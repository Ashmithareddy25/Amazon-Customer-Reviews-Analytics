B002ZG993Q|1.0|About the only way you'll get your money's worth out of this movie is if you watch it for free. Even then you'll likely feel cheated out of 2 hours of your life.  The movie starts out with George Clooney happly walking around with a girlfriend(?)  He gets into a firefight, then promptly shoots his girlfriend dead before fleeing the scene.  Who she is and why he kills her?  Even by the end of the movie neither me nor the 2 buddies I went and saw this movie with had ANY clue.  That pretty much sets the stage for the whole thing.  He has a tattoo of a BUTTERFLY between his shoulderblades.  It seems to have some significance... again, never explained.  Me and my buddies DID however all come to the conclusion that the film's numerous sex scenes with Mr. Clooney were inserted into it to assure the audience that despite this butterfly tattoo, he is NOT supposed to be gay.  As for the plot... I won't spoil it for you, if you seriously still intend to watch this movie, but I will say this. I've seen better plots in adult films.  No joke.
B0033TJATW|5.0|My sister recorded this. I remember when I were young, I used to play this in my former VCR, watch the amazing stage performance of \\"Man in the Mirror,\\" get brief clips of his former singles like \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\\" \\"Ben,\\" and the poignant \\"Music & Me;\\" I saw the amount of acclaim he got for his awards; then I saw a bit of the great \\"We Are The World\\" that had raindrops coming down on the screen; then it got into \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" starting, \\"You knock me offa my feet now baby, whoooooo...;\\" then the movie. I liked the lead up to \\"Speed Demon.\\" I got my younger sister into the movie too. Michael tries to battle this demon who bothers the children he tries to protect and wins the battle eventually, turning into a big silver robot and shooting the enemy's flying object. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" had spectacular dancing. This was the movie that encouraged my brother to get \\"HIStory: Past, Present and Future\\" for me. This legend was my icon. Too bad he left the world so soon.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|If you are in your sixties and are a Cliff and the Shads fan you have to have it. I am the same age as Bruce and I wish I was half as fit. Hair is the same colour but the voice has gone unlike these guys who seem ageless. A good 2 hours worth of reminiscing. Well worth the money.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Another reviewer mentioned that the quality of this writing was up there with any 19th Century Gothic writer, and I completely agree.  This was completely readable without one line that made you read it again and ask yourself \\"What?! How did that get through editing?\\" Immediately after finishing this novel I checked for anything else by the author and was quite disappointed there wasn't anything.  I completely recommend this!
B00005JPO1|4.0|Harrison Ford and more star in Steven Spielberg's 2008 adventure sequel.<br />In 1957, Indiana Jones locates an ancient artifact that Russians want<br />to use as a weapon. This is a good, but long waited sequel. It's great<br />to see Harrison back as Indy and this dvd set has nice picture and<br />sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.
B00447G29S|5.0|This movie was superb in many ways. The story is excellent and the movies great for children and adults of all ages to remember the innocence of youth and recognize the milestones we have all passed growing up. But now on to the real essence of this review: the 3D quality.    The 3D is VERY GOOD...in fact it's great on so many levels. The colors are vibrant and vivid and not washed out like many have complained happens when watching movies in 3D from dark glasses. Also, the picture quality was top notch in HD even while wearing glasses. The surround sound effects and audio couldn't be any more realistic and complementative of the video. The 3D was spectacular guys. Many scenes had things popping right out at you (which i love) and the depth was deep and realistic. I actually felt like I was in the movie. I have an 82 inch 3DTV so that helps but a crappy 3D movie is a crappy 3D movie no matter what screen you watch it on and crappy this was not. The 3D on this film will make any television pop and sizzle and truly brings out the power of your new 3DTV to your family and friends.    Overall watch The Polar Express is a wonderful holiday experience anyone should have the opportunity to enjoy and if you're looking for a good 3D movie then this is a must buy as you will not be dissapointed. Furthermore I experienced no ghosting at all while watching but that could be due to my televisions technology compared to plasma, LED, and LCD. Pick up a copy for yourself. You won't regret it.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|Why is Sherlock Holmes an action hero? Isn't he supposed to be a detective?!    I simply couldn't grasp the plethora of action scenes in what is supposed to be a detective film. I'm not saying it should be boring, but turning Sherlock Holmes into Rambo is just ridiculous. The entire first 40 minutes are composed of actions scenes. This is typical Guy Ritchie nonsense.    I expected an intricate, tense and mysterious detective film with plot changes that would make your head spin - after all that is what Sherlock Holmes is all about - but all I got was Rambo with a bit of detective skills. I would definitely not recommend this. Rent it once and forget about it - shouldn't be too difficult!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|First, thank you so much Amazon for exposing me to such a brilliant show. I was perusing Amazon's VOD \\"Free\\" section and stumbled upon it. Breaking Bad is as addictive as the drugs manufactured in the show. The characters are rich and dynamic, not to mention superbly acted. The dialogue is perfection and the cinematography is sleek without being glossy. With a seemingly outlandish plot of a Nobel prize-winning chemist turned lowly-high-school-chem-teacher turned meth-cook, watching it the story feels suprisingly grounded. Another bonus is that this serious drama is filled with great humor, making the immoral and rather morose material palatable, and actually kind of delicious. Breaking Bad is an entirely different caliber of show compared to anything else on TV. It feels more like film than television. Now I know why it has all those emmys. After finishing the free Pilot episode I purchased the rest of the season. I never pay for anything if I can help it, I am the biggest cheapskate out there. That's how good it was! After 3 weeks I've purchased and viewed all 3 seasons. I've also gotten the rest of my family and most of my friends addicted! And we have very VERY different tastes, ranging from sci-fi guys to 1950's italian film experts to gore connoisseurs to action buffs and art house coming-of-age lovers-- WE ALL LOVE Breaking Bad! If you like watching quality you will enjoy this show I'm 100% sure of it. The only problem is Season 4 doesn't start until June 2011 and I'm jonesing for more!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been excited about any new music. I am pretty picky about music and was so happy to find something I finally like! I think the last new band I was excited about was the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or White Stripes, and if this band continues in the same vein in which they have started, I've put my money on a winning horse! Give it a shot, it's worth the 5 bucks and then some! The band looks like Sam Cook meets Prince with a little Terence Trent D'arby thrown in.  It's very hard to classify, which makes it even more wonderful! I love music that can't be labeled.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I can only give this item 1 star.  If the cost in the theaters wasn't prohibitive enough.  How many versions of the same DVD can you release trying to milk as much money out of unwary consumers as you can.    This release does not have any 3d content.  I'm sure next spring their will be a grand Re-Release with all new features \\"Never Seen Before\\" in 3d.    Be like me and send a notice to the film companies.  (Not interested)  I'll wait until a full version comes out with all I want.  Until then Nada.    As to the movie itself.  The special effects were FANTASTIC in full 3-d in the theater.  It truly looked like a completely different world.  It was the only selling point to this movie.  I had one friend who saw it several times because it \\"looked so pretty\\".  The story line was pretty basic and had no new ideas. It only repeated what we've seen in our own history.  There were no plot twists and the film was very predictable throughout.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|When watching Lost, start from the beginning and try not to spoil anything for yourself, it is an amazing ride...however..what was the greatest show in TV history (I know its debatable, but few show's have the writing, acting, directing, and MUSIC that this did, and when you take time to appreciate all and the talent behind them its amazing)ended up becoming the greatest tragedy in TV history (not debatable!)  I'll keep it short, the sixth season is ridiculous, the ending makes the entire show pointless and will really bum out anyone who actually gets this show or might ever want to rewatch it 1 or 5 times. Just accept that most of your questions will never be anwesered and don't let it get you down, stop watching after the fifth season, act like the sixth didn't exist and enjoy pondering for evermore, don't let darlton spoil what was a great show.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|Leafing through the reproduction of The Boss's notebook used in creating Darkness is a profound experience.  How an artist can create a work that just speaks directly to your soul and show you how he did it is incredible.    The Boss has made many great records, but I don't think any resonate quite like Darkness On The Edge Of Town.  This is an emotional journey into the darkness of life and the fight to truly live.      This collection has instantly become the greatest thing in my music collection.  Remastered Darkness (it sounds better than ever), the tracks on The Promise, and the Blu-Rays offer so much surrounding this record.  The live performance from 2009 is fantastic, offering the perspective of time.  The documentary gives you an even deeper look into everything surrounding the album.  And in the end it makes Darkness hit even harder as an album.    Born To Run is an album full of hope that really does take you somewhere, but what happens when your dreams fall apart and you have a decision to make?  Do you keep fighting or do you just give up?  Darkness is made better by Born To Run and both records play off each other, but the grittiness of Darkness has never fully left Bruce's later work.  Many of the same themes permeate The River, The Boss's next album.  And that one most desperately needs a remastered version (the CD version is of TERRIBLE quality!).  So bring on The River, Bruce!  But thank you for giving us so much insight into Darkness On The Edge Of Town, my favorite record in all of rock history.  Over a decade after first hearing it, it still tears at me and shakes me to my foundations when I hear it.  There's a great power here and hearing a 60 year old Boss sing these songs at The Paradise in Asbury Park just increases that power.      There are great records and then there's Darkness On The Edge Of Town.  Open up your heart when you listen to this and you will be deeply moved.

0525951652|1.0|I really admire Ken Follets ability to write a good long multi family saga however this book was terrible.  The character development in the first 100 pages started out really well then the book went downhill from there.  Ken Follett spent too much time on the war stories and the politics of the era.  He completely lost site of the characters and they became flat and boring.  He spent the last 100 pages trying to wrap up the stories and failed miserable.  I had force myself to finish this book and I won't be wasting my time with the second or third books.  If you like a book of endless war stories and politics then enjoy.
0786955570|5.0|Once a long time ago a young dungeon master with entirely to much fondness for vampires picked up a 2nd edition adventure called House of Strahd.  More then 15 years later an older (hopefully) wiser DM picked up this board game because he's still fond of vampires and of D&D.  I have to say its a fun game.  Is it the best boardgame ever?  I wouldn't go that far but its an honestly fun game and a BEATABLE game.  People talk a lot about how hard they think it is but honestly I've played it a 3 times so far (once solo the other two with a group) and won every single time although I'll say it wasn't an easy win (and since when is that a bad thing?).  The secret to beating the game (and since unlike a traditional game its the players versus the board game not versus each other it is beating the game) COOPERATION.  This isn't like Betrayal at House on the Hill or a lot of other board games its an entirely cooperative effort.  If you use your powers properly and work as a team you can beat it if you run off in your own directions without a strategy your going to lose.
0316098337|1.0|I never made it to the end of the 1st chapter.  This is one of the worst books I have tried to read.  I tried to get through chapter 1 to see if it would get better, but had to give it up.  Crazy is the word I have to use for this writing.

B004BC7MRM|4.0|I'm not really familiar with Kid Rock (I'm more of an opera and disco guy) but my 82 year old Mom loves him. So I downloaded it for her. But after listening to it a few times, I have to say it's a pretty decent album. Good songs and fun to listen to!

B0042JTDXK|2.0|i've been a fan for 10 years, traveled far and wide to attend many concerts and shared his music with everyone i know. but this is not the josh i fell in love with. he seems to have evolved somewhere over my head and i just can't grasp what he's trying to share. his voice is angelic still, and the music is beautiful but the two just don't jive. it's just not a good marriage. my favorite is the instrumental \\"wandering kind\\" and after that i would say \\"higher window\\". yes i'm disappointed...
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|I am a huge Kid Rock fan and I must say that a feeling of sadness came over me listening to this realizing that this was the follow up to the masterpiece \\"Rock-n-Roll Jesus\\".  Very slow, kind of mundane, found myself hitting the next song button half way through each track waiting for a good song to come along.    My advice - if you are a KID ROCK fan of albums past (the excellent \\"Devil Without a Cause\\",the very good self titled \\"Kid Rock\\", the masterpiece \\"Rock-n-Roll Jesus\\") you will more than likely be dissapointed with this.    I really hope that this album will be the exception and not the new norm for Kid.  Hopefully this is Kid Rock's \\"I am just taking a little break from the rock\\" album and returns to his bad a** status on the next one.  I totally understand that we all need a break from the \\"same-ole-same-ole\\" so I will let this one slide.      Best Song: Purple Sky, title track Born Free is decent all though the \\"do-do-do's\\" at the end of the track get old fast.    All right, time to move on.....NEXT!!!
B003SNJYSK|2.0|This book was generally very well written and interesting, but the author has two of his characters do amazingly stupid things. Ellen finds out that Waaler is a Neo-Nazi, knows she is in danger from him, leaves a message for Harry, but doesn't include Waller's name in the message?! Waaler's supposed to be a smart guy, but doesn't wonder why his cell phone is turned off and doesn't look at his incoming call log!? Waaler kills the Neo-Nazi guy, but doesn't care that he couldn't have gunshot residue on his hands because he didn't fire the throwdown gun? These things just ruined the book for me. It was as if Nesbo was too lazy to come up with a credible plot line.
0525951652|4.0|Its a shame the review of this excellent book has been distorted due to people complaining about the price.  The majority of the people rating it a one is due to pricing and many have not even red the book.
0451169514|3.0|As the years pass, the mark that King has left on the narrative structure of genre fiction becomes more and more apparent. In a way, you could say that King (if he didn't invent it), took the suspense genre and made it what it is today. I say this because King is a suspense writer more than a horror novelist. What is horror but suspense. He is the writer that first combined an urgency in every sentence with short chapters that ended with cliff-hangers. All you have to do is compare Ian Flemming, the writer everyone read in the 1960's to King's first works in the 1970's and you see a titanic shift in writing style. Today you can look at just about every mystery/thriller writer and find some aspect of King in their style.<br /><br />By the time King got to \\"It\\", he was at the top of his narrative game. Over the previous 10 years his work had gotten increasingly more complex. Telling stories within stories. Following several character lines at once. And shifting focus as an author. \\"It\\" is probably THE most complex King work of fiction. If you take a work like \\"The Stand\\" (probably his most loved novel), you have this story arc that is elegant and simply laid out. \\"The Stand\\" follows many characters, has a plot that is complex, but its easy to digest. \\"It\\" is a maze of characters, timelines, stories/backstories, and narratives. \\"It\\" is a difficult work to get into. King starts the story in the middle and backfills events. At the same time he works in what is happening at the present moment. It takes 100's and 100's of pages to get to the point where all cylinders are firing as one. I can see how a lot of people would stop reading this early on, and I don't blame them. Its frustrating for the reader to get attached to a character and then not see them again for 100 pages because the author is busy telling the next segment of half a dozen other characters.<br /><br />Also, I'm not a clown guy. 'It' is a clown. You learn this in the first chapter so I'm not giving anything away. I just wanted to say that imagining a clown as the force of evil here was not an enjoyable exercise. King delves into being gay and HIV/AIDS here. When this book was written, AIDS was turning into a scourge of the nation. If you weren't around for it, its hard to imagine how much it altered the country from a free love society in the 1970's to the tight lipped \\"Just say no\\" 80's.<br /><br />The novel itself focuses around a group of kids who have become adults. They have all forgotten about the summer of 1958 when they first fought the \\"It\\". They all went their separate ways and lived lives of their own for 27 years. Now the \\"It\\" is back and they remember what they forgot so long ago. They promised each other in a sort of magical way that they would band together again if \\"It\\" came back. And a large part of the story revolves around this group remembering the promise and gathering together again to fight whatever this evil is.<br /><br />After \\"It\\", I feel that King no longer tried to top himself anymore. This was the high water mark of his creative efforts. In a way he tried too hard and lost something after he veered away from his simpler early works post 'Cujo'. And when he quit the drugs his writing in my opinion became vapid. While \\"It\\" is not a masterpiece, there is a lot to like here. King is at his best when he is telling a short story. And here he tells 100 small vignettes that are tied together by this narrative. I enjoyed every single one of them.<br /><br />What I think partly sinks this story is Kings desire to fit in with what was happening in the nation at the time. You can feel the author getting preachy at times and becoming overly PC. Early on King tells a story about a writing student who gets frustrated with his fellow classmates and asks them something like \\"Why does a novel have to mean something? Why cant a story just be a story?\\" I think King lost sight of this or was at the time questioning his own motives for including this sentiment<br /><br />By the time the story hits the half way point, when it shifts focus from the childhood part to the adult, it's basically become so overblown that its hard to enjoy. Take the \\"Stand\\" again. The story ratchets itself up. There is a direction and mostly a single focus as it drives itself towards a showdown. With \\"It\\", at the half way point, after 15 or so hours of reading, its easy to feel that your just now at a starting point. That what you had read was background filler. All the jumping around on the timeline chops the story into a disjointed mess.<br /><br />Also, because King tells so many small stories in a dis-jointed time line, he gets to the point where he constantly has to refresh the readers memory as to where they are in time and what previous stories have relevance to the situation the characters are now in.<br /><br />Hmmm... in many ways this is Kings finest effort. But I had to struggle to calmly turn the pages without skipping forward quickly. Reading this was like treading water. You stay in one place, your getting nowhere, your exactly where you started, and then at the end you get out of the pool & you realize you've gotten one good workout. I'd give this one 3.5 stars.half way point, when it shifts focus from the childhood part to the adult, it's basically become so overblown that its hard to enjoy. Take the \\"Stand\\" again.

142311339X|5.0|An outstanding sequel to the Percy Jackson series, introduces an entirely new cast of great characters plus re-acquaints us with some of those we liked from the original Percy Jackson series.  Good \\"cliff-hanger\\" writing as to the missing Percy Jackson, leaves the reader wondering till the end what became of him.  A very enjoyable and quick read.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I throughly enjoyed Starz production of Spartacus. I believe that Andy Whitfield did a fantastic job protraying the gladiator as did the other guys. Was glad to see Lucy Lawless back and John Hannah portraying a quasi-evil person. Am looking forward to the Prequel and hope that Andy gets through his therapy in record time and can come back and do another stint as Spartacus.

0131480057|5.0|I thought at first that it would be just another 'book' about Linux system administration but when I started reading I was surprised with the way it is written. Very easy to read, complete and up to date! Congratulations to the authors for a great job well done. At my workplace I coach several junior sysadmins and they also are putting the book to good use. Being a Linux system administrator for several years now I also enjoy this expert manual and use it whenever in doubt of something.    Thanks again guys.    Eric
B0007ZIYM4|4.0|Be warned: I'm no musicologist or semi-pro violinist or even classical-music junkie who can compare this CD to two dozen other \\"Four Seasons\\" recordings.  But as a regular music lover with a regular stereo -- more like the average Amazon customer -- I thought I should let people know why I responded warmly to this recording.    Having a small ensemble tackle the piece turned it into a wholly different experience from the few orchestral versions I already owned, making the slower and softer portions more intimate, yet (and here was the big surprise) sacrificing little of the power needed to express the violence of nature in the more aggressive portions.  I do think there are a few spots where spare instrumentation left the aural landscape a bit thin, but those instances were relatively uncommon, and more than compensated (especially to someone without an audiophile system) by the crispness and closeness of the recording elsewhere.  I'm delighted to have found this CD.    As for critics who carp about the packaging: There's no doubt the marketers were trying to take advantage of Jansen's beauty, and add an element of fantasy to the music, by filling the booklet with gorgeous photos of the violinist wearing a flattering dress in an elegant setting.  But if you're worried that she scored a recording contract based primarily on her appearance, please let me reassure you: Whatever faults experts might detect in Jansen's playing, it's not the kind of thing that should cause a regular listener to doubt whether she was up to the task.  To these untutored ears, the beauty of the performance more than measured up to the beauty of the performer.
0765326353|5.0|Finished this hefty book about a week ago. Sanderson's language is beautiful, his characters are interesting and varied, and the world he's created is truly unique. The only caution I have is that this book feels tailored for very experienced readers of fantasy, and although the world he hints at is wondrous, he reveals very little about the actual nature of the environment his characters inhabit. The illustrations, while rare (I believe five pages of illustration for a 1000+ page book) add to the feel of the book greatly.     Pick this book up. As long as it's not your first foray into fantasy, it won't disappoint.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.<br /><br />Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.<br /><br />Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.<br /><br />A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.<br />His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholson<br /><br />P.S.<br />The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When I saw the previews for this new show on Showtime Jan '10, I knew that we were going to order the channel just for, \\"Spartacus\\"!  What can I tell you about the show that everyone before me hasn't said repeatedly; or the media hasn't said before us?  I can't tell you anything new, just that I love this series and found it to be one the most provocative, sexy and action-filled series that has come along in a long while.  This is a show that men will watch on their own and women will snuggle up because the story speaks to us as well.  I find that if you love gladiators, action, violence, war, mythology, Greek/Roman history, heterosexual/homosexual characters (this alone reaches out to so many because there is something for everyone), betrayal, loyalty & a love story then this is the series for you.<br /><br />The good:  Andy Whitfield (Spartacus)... the man is beautiful & his acting is superb.  Lucy Lawless (Xena- need I say more) and finally beautiful women & men.  The series is shot in the beautiful New Zealand and every cast member is so wonderfully suited to their roles.  For those with prudish tendencies, this may not be for you.  The sex scenes are raw and they would make any normal person blush.<br /><br />The bad:  Andy Whitfield had battled Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma after the first season was released which delayed taping for the second season.  Luckily they came up with the pre-quel idea that will be airing Jan '11, while they waited for Andy to recover.  He did recover and was set to begin shooting the second season when he was found to no longer be in remission, causing him to pull out of the series.  This has saddened so many Spartacus fans but all you can do is pray for the wonderful actor that we have come to love & know as \\"Spartacus\\" and his eventual remission.  The chatter is that they will be re-casting.  As blasphemous as it sounds, I think that this is the only thing to do if we want to continue to watch this great series live on and further employ so many in New Zealand.<br /><br />Highly recommend... great series that will not disappoint!Zealand.    Highly recommend... great series that will not disappoint!

0446560065|5.0|Like many of my fellow feline enthusiasts, I have followed Simon's Cat on the internet for some time.  When I found out that there was a book prepared in his honour, I was more than a little interested.  After reviewing several pages, I was hooked.  You may think that something is lost in translation ~~ a video clip type of approach to a stop action book approach, but Simon's Cat is just as wonderful in print as he is on internet.  One of the best books I have purchased in quite some time.
B001GWK2MC|4.0|I have owned several of these bouncers in the past few years.  I actually owned two of the bouncers from one-step ahead prior to buying this one.  My kids love this thing and the previous ones we've had.  They both bounce in it for hours and I can be assured that they won't hurt themselves.  It's like a short-term babysitter!  The fact that they have so much fun is why I keep buying them (when I can't repair them anymore).       Because I've owned a few of these, I've realized that they aren't kid proof.  They will tear.  You should expect it when you buy one.  This one doesn't seem like it's as high-quality as the bouncer from one-step, but even that one had tears. That's why when I purchased this one, I didn't expect it to be any better.  I was right.  Within a few weeks the bouncer had two small holes causing it to deflate everytime I inflated it.  But, that isn't a problem in this house!  I've learned with the other ones that if you keep a little vinyl repair in the house and it's as good as new in no-time.  You need to inflate the chamber that you suspect has a hole.  Press all over to find the hole.  Once you find the hole, you may need to deflate the chamber.  Get your vinyl repair goo out and put a large amount on the hole.  Let it dry overnight and voila!  Good as new for awhile longer.       I recommend using something like Aquaseal or Seamgrip.  There's also a cheaper vinyl repair that I got from an Ace Hardware that seems to work as well.
1934356557|5.0|The title only gives a partial idea about the content of the book. It is not only about SQL but also about data modeling. After all, even the best SQL expert cannot do much if the datamodel is a catastrophe.<br />Most of the ideas are illustrated with a relatively simple but complete example of a bug tracking application. The fact that the same sample application is used throughout makes it very easy to understand and to follow the presented concepts.<br /><br />About the book organisation, there is an antipattern per chapter and each chapter follows the same structure:<br />- Objective (problem to solve)<br />- Antipattern description<br />- How to recognize the Antipattern  (e.g. from questions raised by developers)<br />- Legitimate uses of the Antipattern<br />- Solution (a proposed better approach to solve the problem)<br /><br />Every antipattern is explained in detail (there is almost nothing left to the imagination) and anyone involved in database programming or in data modeling (from novice to experienced) would easily learn how to recognize, and hopefully avoid, suboptimal 'solutions' that could create problems in the future.
B004132HZS|5.0|I really enjoyed this adaptation, especially considering I'm a bit of a Jeremy Brett fanatic.  I'm also a former English teacher, so I like to see literary adaptations done well.  This, indeed, was one of those well-done adaptations.  The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman was great.  And Holmes and Watson were definitely still alive in these two actors.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  I will definitely purchase this DVD.
B000001ELP|4.0|This ain't your traditional Kiss album by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not the worthless stinker that its reputation would lead you to believe it is.  Kiss decided to indulge in experimentation by making a prog-rockish concept album, complete with a fantasy-type storyline and orchestral accompaniment.  Even though I wouldn't rank it up there with King Crimson or ELP albums, I appreciate Kiss's effort to provide us with a bit of variety.  And some of the songs genuinely rock, which doesn't hurt at all.  I've always loved \\"The Oath\\" and \\"I\\" (although I'm not a fan of the last track's closing coda), and most of the other tunes are worth at least a listen or two.  Although I wouldn't rank it up there with \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" I wouldn't dump \\"Music From the Elder\\" in the same garbage heap as \\"Kilroy Was Here.\\"  It probably belongs in the same category as the Alan Parsons Project's \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" or Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime.\\"

0345495004|4.0|Maymah was a woman ahead of her time. We believe today's term for her would be \\"milf\\", in Frank's eyes. Had Catherine divorced Frank and they had been able to marry she would have become a \\"smilf' and later in life she would be a \\"gmilf\\".  Chop chop    The story of Maymah Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright gave us many topics of conversation including....how could a mother leave her children to stroke her.....\\"ego\\".  At times we all would love to leave the doldrums of runny noses and diaper doo-doos - but wait, most of us don't have a live-in nanny AND a live-in auntie to share in the duties.  We feel that Mamah did not live in the doldrums of motherhood but instead lived in a constant state of discontent and was just trying to find the next fix.    Evidentally, Frank's fix was fulfilling in many ways and inevitably was her final fix.  Chop Chop    Another question that perplexed our group was how Mamah put up with Franks short falls for so long.  His constant mismanagement of funds and inability to live in reality would have found him without these MILFS, SMILFS, or GMILFS for sure.  Despite Franks obvious emotional controls over Mamah, there were hints toward her control over him.   Afterall, he did come back home to her after his trysts with the Geishas and society ladies living near the jobsite at Midway Gardens.  And he did only keep one of the Baby Grands, afterall.  Chop Chop    And how could Mattie - her old college buddy - live with the guilt of not having stopped Mamah from her rampant discard of responsibility.  Oh wait, she didn't.  Chop Chop    We felt the ending snuck up on us far too quickly.  We were truly shocked to find out that apple pie bakin', pullman porter, dapper Julius Carlton was capable of such a feat.  Although we felt he didn't work alone.  We suspect Anna Wright was in on the massacre helping in an inconspicuous way such as securing all windows and doors.  Chop chop    We suggest a table decorated with an old rusty axe, matches, and replicasof the last supper ~ cans of beef stew and of course wine  Marie Callender's apple pie for dessert.  chop chop    Signing off . . . .

B0044XV3QY|4.0|I purchased the original Blu-Ray of Pandora and had no problems at all watching it on both my computer's Blu-Ray Samsung SH-B083L drive and on my Samsung BD-C6500 player but this latest version simply will not play at all on my PC. On my Blu-Ray player for my TV it played part way through and then stopped and refused to play again! I have no idea if it is a disk issue or a Samsung issue but it did play at least some of the disk! What gives? What I saw was wonderful. I love the new beginning and having read the script that was put out there back in January I have no idea why this original beginning was changed for the movie to the rather dull fly over stuff. The beginning on the longest version is true to the script. I saw a few scenes that were not in the original version which I liked but I didn't get to watch the entire movie! I ensured that both my PC Blu-Ray drive and my Blue Ray player have the most up to date updates out there so I'm very disappointed that I can't watch this flick! Perhaps in time I will be able to but if is a disk defect how on earth am I supposed to tell that in time to exchange it at the store? GRRRRRR!
B00418NXBK|5.0|The pressure is on the Kings Of Leon to follow up Only By The Night,their breakout album. I, like many others had giant expectations.It's really hard for a band to match the hype and come up with something different, when everyone expects another Sex On Fire and Somebody. I was disappointed when I first heard it.I felt there were too many slow songs and not enough rockers.After a few listens I came to really like several songs and am happy I have it.If you're a true KOL fan,you have to have it .I still expect great things from this band. These guys have a unique sound.Caleb's voice is so different.So  \\"home grown, back to the rythm and back to the beat of the radio\\"- Fans

0375703861|5.0|I was first introduced to this book in my 20th-Century British Fiction class and it was the final book of the semester because it tied together many of the themes of changing post-colonial and racial identity of British culture. That's the \\"important\\" reason for its inclusion in the syllabus. Truth be told, it's just a fascinatingly well-written story. Zadie's prose style has a street-smart bounce to it and she seems to understand the male mind better than most men I know, including myself. It's a very clever and fun read, although it is punctuated with some very touching moments. I highly recommend this book.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Best Josh Groban album to date. I absolutely love it and can't stop listening to it over and over again!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|THIS IS THE JOURNEY THAT KID ROCK WAS ON TO GET TO THE MUSIC HE WAS MENT TO DO  EVER CD HE HAS DONE WAS GREAT BUT I THINK HE IS ON THE MONEY WITH THIS CD  ITS SHOWS HOW MUCH HE GREW AND THE GREAT SINGER AND MAN HE BECAME  KEEP ROCKING FOR US YOU ARE THE FUTURE FOR MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I thought Josh's last album was a step down from his tremendous debut and Closer albums which had the perfect songs and styles for an operatic voice like Groban.  But Awake still had quite a few great songs on it!  The new CD I do like Bells Of New York, well written and I like the background music and instrumentation.  Galileo is also a pretty classical sounding tune which also makes great use of the voice.  But Lora Delladdio is pretty typical mundane sounding.  The single Hidden Away now I'm sorry but this sounds formula all the way, like a pop song and nothing at all special for Groban.  The parts are repeated over and over and other than his voice changing in a higher tune, the song just isnt anything special!  Higher Window is even more formula sounding than Hidden Away, SAME TYPE OF SONG!  NOTHING like When You say You Love Me, You Raise Me Up, To Where You Are, Let Me fall, or even from the last CD So She Dances!  If I Walk Away is better Josh's voice, a banjo, more stripped down than usual but still a nice song!  Love Only Knows is a boring English song, not a song worthy of his voice AT ALL!  The rest of the CD after that sounds like filler to me, cuts that shouldnt have even made the CD except for the last song Illuminations Straight To You which is alright, a nice production on that song but still doesn't live up to those beautiful masterpieces and soaring vocals on the great classic songs I mentioned.  Josh Groban has an incredible voice  he just isnt writing or choosing the material that is worthy of it.  he should sing other writers songs, classics, or like he did in his early career singing songs that other people wrote or have even sung before.  I would be really surprised if Illuminations went double platinum like Awake did.  I think he would have done better with a 2nd Christmas album than this!
B003WTE886|5.0|Ok so I begin by saying that I have loved every album this lovely young lady has put out so far. For this reason I bought Speak Now the Deluxe Addition only knowing one song and I bought it confidently. However Taylor surprised me. This album is not quite as poppy and young as her previous albums and some of the songs are irresistably heartbreaking. The vocals as well as the lyrics of Haunted, Dear John, Never grow up, and Innocent show that Taylor is undeniably maturing while she keeps it light and fun with tracks such as speak now, mean, and sparks fly. I am so impressed with her latest album that I have found it impossible to take out of my cd player and I have not skipped through a track yet. Good job Swifty!
B0038QMREA|5.0|When I heard one of his songs on the HBO show \\"Hung\\" I knew I had to find out more about this artist and hear more of his work. I wasn't able to discover much, but the album holds up really well. Not to be missed!

B000JJSJYQ|5.0|This release includes the Album Amarantine and a bonus disk with four Christmas songs on it, including We Wish You A Merry Christmas, Christmas Secrets, Adeste Fideles and The Magic of The Night. Amarantine is a powerful album that showcases Enya's voice like never before. The beginning track, Less Than A Pearl is a wonderful moving piece that has a great flow of Enya's traditional multi-vocal layering sound, the song is a masterpiece. From there you are taken on a journey about Love (Amarantine) to listening to the rain in It's in The Rain (Another masterpiece) to the thunderous Loxian (Gaelic feeling) wanting to make you dance song (The River Sings), the journey continues with Long, Long, Journey and into a final, beautiful and captivating song \\"Water Shows The Hidden Heart\\" which is by far one of Enya's best slow songs. This album is reminiscent of Shepherd Moons especially in the use of instrumentation, as well as A Day Without Rain with the use of Pizzicato in the song Amarantine. Yet it combines some new sounds, some rolling drums in Less Than A Pearl, wonder piano arpeggios in It's in The Rain, and subtle, beautiful and light Shepherd Moon's sounding instrumentation in Water Show The Hidden Heart. There is a place only Enya can take you. The Enya \\"sound\\" is unique, there will never be another enya. A must have for any fan and makes a great Christmas present for ages 5 -100.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is the best set for any Avatar fan!  Not only does it have all three versions of the movie, but it also has a lot of special features.  As for the extended cut, it is incredible!  The added footage adds so much detail and background that was missing from the original version.  I could not wait to purchase it when it first came out, so I bought the bare bone version.  Then i sold it when I saw this was coming out. So glad I did because this is the version to have.  Whether you are a die hard Avatar fan or just a casual fan, this is the set to buy!
031603438X|5.0|An absolutely stunning book that is a must-read for lovers of the Rolling Stones and Rock `n' Roll in general. A biased, cynical and vengeful appraisal of his life delivering by a raconteur in a style that proves beyond a doubt that Keef related most all of it to his co-author.  One-liners and snide comments abound.<br /><br />Keith Richards - member how early LPs said Richard? - uses his skill as a raconteur to lead us through his view of his life.  After an introductory chapter dealing with archetypical experiences on the road with drugs, booze, weapons and the southern United States police and judicial system; Keef proceeds to explain exactly how it all happened. We are introduced to his family and follow his - in all certainty, inevitable - development into a rebel. And this rebel soon finds that embracing the blues - the music of the poor and disenfranchised in America - is a solace to him. As we all know, he meets some like-minded individuals and - via an intense and cathartic process - transform themselves into The Rolling Stones. With the band in place, we are guided through the next forty odd years in chapters that are loosely chronological but are directed more at depicting how and why Keith Richards is who he is.<br /><br />It is important to remember that this is an autobiography and, as such, does not necessarily have to be the pure and simple truth. It is, by definition, the subject's view of himself and of the world. And, make no mistake; Keith Richards is opinionated, perhaps even arrogant, about himself and those with whom he has interacted. In light of that, some of the descriptions and recollections expressed may or may not be factual. What is true is that Richards and co-author James Fox have created a narrative that- at least in my view - is the voice of its subject. Read the book, then listen to interviews with him and it's wholly apparent that Fox managed the production most of the memories are Keith's.<br /><br />The sections on his creative processes and the mechanics of playing - especially the details on opening tuning - were sublime. Richards believe music should be/must be all about expressing an individual feeling, regardless of whether or not what is being done is tecnically correct. It is such a liberating view that I wanted to run to the storage room, pull out my guitar and just strum.<br /><br />Yes, there's a lot about drugs. But, he used a lot of drugs didn't he? And his discussions of use by himself - and others such as John Lennon, Brian Jones, Bobby Keys, various and sundry Rastafarians - are delivered in such a matter of fact style that I found myself alternately amused and appalled. Even his description of Anita Pallenberg's use - something he decsribes as being out of control, compared to his usage - and his view of the impact on his children seems to delivered without rancor.<br /><br />A similar tone and attitude is exhibited in views of those with whom he has come in contact. He's very laissez faire about people until they let him down or act in an insincere manner. Thus, you will read of his very low opinion of Brian Jones, someone he seems to feel let everybody (maybe ieven inc,uding himself) down through narcicism. Bill Wyman receives less coverage than Mick Taylor and is damned with no praise whatsoever. Apparently his key contribution - and perhaps raison d'être for getting into the band - was ownership of a Vox amp.In fact, late in the narrative, Richards expresses surprise Wyman helped him get a heroin fix becasue in his view the bassist was self-centered in the extreme. Billy Preston receives a beating also. Here Richards castigates the keyboardist for, in no particluar order, wearing an afro wig; beating up one of his boyfriends and playing too loudly. This final transgessions resulted in Richards taking Preston aside and threatening to knife him.<br /><br />Finally, there is Mick. While Richards and Jagger are not true brothers, the stories and comments at time evoked theborhers Davies to me. His comments seem like they're base don the sort of love/hate relationship - born of envy - with which the two Kinks - maybe really Raymond - dealt.<br /><br />I found I read the book in great 50 to 100 page chucks, and then had to put it down to rest. There was so much going on and so much being said that I became overwhelmed trying to process it all. That's not a negative, mind you. One of the most attractive aspects of this book is that it is entertaining, something that some other autobiographies are not.they're base don the sort of love/hate relationship - born of envy - with which the two Kinks - maybe really Raymond - dealt.

B002VWNIDG|5.0|First of all 'The Shining' is one of the best horror movies of all time. Terrifying and chilling. What makes this DVD even better is the extras. seeing the original advertisements and trailors brings back memories. The documentary of behind the scenes by Kubrick's daughter who features Shelly Duval, Scatman Crothers, Danny Lloyd, and Jack Nicholson on the set in between scenes and during rehearsals is very rare and very good.

0380973650|5.0|This book is based on an interesting premise. What if a culture's belief in a god actually causes that god to spring into existence? What if when believers in different gods migrate to a new place (such as America), they literally bring their gods with them? Neil Gaiman creates a world, and an America, where these things are true.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the gods, America is not a welcoming place for them. People bring copies of their gods with them, but the gods are forgotten as the descendants of the original settlers assimilate into American culture and turn their interests toward more worldly things.<br /><br />This story follows Shadow, the main character, as he is thrust into the world of the gods. He interacts with gods from different pantheons in his job assisting Wednesday (aka Odin). He crisscrosses the US trying to round up all the traditional gods in preparation for an epic battle against the new gods (representing media, technology, cars, etc.) that Americans have cooked up in recent times.<br /><br />The story has a number of interesting plot twists that really kept me hooked from beginning to end. People aren't always who they seem to be.<br /><br />Be aware that this book does contain scenes involving sex, violence, and other things you may not want to discuss with a small child. If this type of content will detract from your enjoyment of a book, this one is probably not for you. I personally thought it was mostly done in a way that enhanced the experience and understanding of the story, and will gladly give it the full five stars.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|I love this whole cd with the exception of one song, For the first time.  My favorites by far are Born Free and Care.

0307454541|5.0|This is a truely awsome book that has all the ingredients for a fast paced read, but also provides enough depth for it not to be \\"just a best seller\\".  When reading it you never get the impression that the author wrote it just to become a best seller, but rather that he wrote a masterpiece for the masterpiece itself.  It is definetly a fast read, a capturing story that you want to finish reading to know the end, but you don't want to finish reading because it is such an great ride.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone that loves travelling through the pages of trully great book.
0060936223|5.0|The bulk of \\"Just Kids\\" is Smith's recollection of Smith's early years in New York with Mapplethorpe and how they came to create their own image as artists and autuers and to craft their image and art. Again, it seems weird to think of either of them as being anything other than fully formed individuals, and that, in and of itself, seems supremely bizarre. We seldom think of the intervening events that came to create them as artists, yet here is Patti Smith lying bare exactly how she came to be what she became.    A good book overall!
B005OHSD3A|1.0|Although the new Atkins diet is very flexible and allows you to even be a complete vegetarian if you like, the core belief that saturated fat is heart healthy has not changed. Of all the low carb diets out there, this one is the least like what modern hunter gatherers actually eat and the most likely to raise your LDL (South Beach and Paleo are much better). You would think that after 40 years of the Atkins diet, if it was good for heart disease, there would be at least one long term study showing it actually reduces heart attacks, but there aren't any.<br /><br />SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE ATKINS DIET DURING WEIGHT LOSS THAT THE BOOK WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT<br /><br />1)  It raises LDL in 30% of patients and causes many unpleasant side effects in most patients.<br /><br />A May 2004 study, financed by Atkins and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, described two participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group (Atkins) who dropped out of the study because of concerns about elevated serum lipid levels. In one participant, the LDL-cholesterol level increased from 184 mg/dl (4.75 mmol/l) to 283 mg/dl (7.31 mmol/l) in 3 months. Another participant's LDL-cholesterol level went from 182 mg/dl (4.70 mmol/l ) to 219 mg/dl (5.66 mmol/l) in 4 weeks. Overall, LDL-cholesterol increased by more than 10% in 30% of the people on the low-carbohydrate diet.<br /><br />Several symptomatic adverse effects occurred more frequently in the low-carbohydrate diet group than in the low-fat diet group, including constipation (68% vs. 35%; P &lt; 0.001), headache (60% vs. 40%; P = 0.03), halitosis (38% vs. 8%; P &lt; 0.001), muscle cramps (35% vs. 7%; P &lt; 0.001), diarrhea (23% vs. 7%; P = 0.02), general weakness (25% vs. 8%; P = 0.01), and rash (13% vs. 0%; P = 0.006). One participant sought medical attention for constipation but had no complications. One 53-year-old man in the low-carbohydrate diet group who had a family history of early heart disease developed chest pain near the end of the study, and coronary heart disease was subsequently diagnosed.<br /><br />While most patients did not seem to worsen their health during this short term weight loss study, it clearly worsened the blood lipids of 30% of patients and as well as caused unpleasant side effects in an even larger percentage of patients. Clearly the Atkins diet is not healthy for everyone. Even during the weight loss phase, this diet would be extremely unlikely to prevent or reverse heart disease in anyone.<br /><br />Yancy WS Jr, Olsen MK, Guyton JR, Bakst RP, Westman EC.

The Atkins also produced less favorable results for flow-mediated vasodilation than the other two.<br /><br />4) During weight maintenance a high saturated fat, high beef diet increases the number of small dense LDL particles.<br /><br />In a study co-authored by Ronald Krauss, during weight maintenance two low-carb diets (one high and one low in saturated fat) were compared to a high carbohydrate diet that was also high in saturated fat. The values for small dense LDL were 222 nmol/l in the low-carb, high saturated fat diet ; 207 nmol/l in the high-carb diet, high saturated fat diet; and 187 nmol/l in the low-carb, low saturated fat diet.<br /><br />Mangravite LM, Chiu S, Wojnoonski K, Rawlings RS, Bergeron N, Krauss RM.

From homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at the high extreme (over 600 mg/dL LDL cholesterol) to hypobeta-lipoproteinemia at the low extreme (less than 15mg/dL LDL cholesterol). Since these SNP's are present from birth, this allowed them to see the effect of low LDL levels maintained over a lifetime. The results show a three times greater benefit for these life long low LDL levels compared taking statins later in life. Ference stated, \\"the effect of each of the included SNPs on risk of CHD is mediated largely or entirely through effect on circulating levels of LDL, rather than through some other pleiotropic effect.\\"<br /><br />\\"The researchers also conducted a meta-analysis of the \\"natural\\" randomized trials by combining non-overlapping data from multiple SNPs involving 326,443 participants. Results of this study indicated that lifetime exposure to lower LDL was associated with a 54% (95% CI, 48-59) relative reduction of CVD for each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) lower LDL.\\" There is a clear dose response relationship. And no one is suggesting that people that statins all their life, but low animal fat diets can do a lot to improve LDL.<br /><br />Ference BA. Late-breaking clinical trials IV.

While South Beach gives much better cardiovascular biomarker's than Atkins, it still wasn't good enough to prevent his heart condition from getting worse.<br /><br />There are some people on Dr. Davis track your plaque website who claim to have reversed heart disease on a low carb diet, but they also achieved extremely low LDL levels. \\"LindyBill\\" says he reduced his plaque by over 30% but he also reduced his LDL from 119 to 52 mg/dL. (Dr. Davis recommends grass-fed meat [which happens to be low in saturated fat] as well as supplements that improve lipids.)<br /><br />The Atkins type diet is often characterized as being the diet of our ancestors. But hunter gatherers didn't eat dairy or factory-farmed meat which this diet permits. The online USDA National Nutrient Database shows that factory-farmed meat contains about five times as much saturated fat as grass-fed meat (ground meat doesn't count because the same amount of fat is added to both making comparisons meaningless.) And wild game eaten by HGs contains even less saturated fat than grass-fed domestic meat. And LDL in modern HGs who eat wild game averages 50 to 70 mg/dL (far below average American levels), while the average person on an Atkins diet during weight maintenance eating factory-farmed meat and dairy sees their LDL go up to above average levels.<br /><br />The book tells us not to worry about saturated fat because the more saturated fat we eat the less saturated fat there is in the blood as if this had any relevance to heart disease. What matters is that saturated fat in the diet increases LDL in the blood. This is what matters.<br /><br />In every long range study that I've seen increasing animal fat and reducing sugar either fails to reduce heart attacks or actually increases them. This doesn't mean that everyone has elevated LDL or an increased risk of heart disease during weight maintenance. Studies just report averages.<br /><br />THE TRUTH ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOW FAT DIETS<br /><br />Not only does the book make false promises about the benefits of high animal fat diets for heart disease but it misleads us about the evidence that low animal fat diets can prevent or reverse heart disease. The book uses the Women's Health Initiative to claim that low fat diets are ineffective for weight loss or the prevention of heart disease and cancer. But in that study people were free to replace fat with anything they chose and in this country that's usually sugar, white flour and fried potatoes swimming in trans fat. And there was no significant lowering of LDL. However there are other kinds of low fat diets that are very effective at lowering LDL and reducing heart attacks.<br /><br />In the 1950s, Dr. Morrison put 50 heart attack survivors on a 15% fat, high protein diet and another 50 survivors were told to eat as usual. Total cholesterol fell from 312 mg/dl to 220 mg/dl in the experimental group. That's a reduction of 29%. And over a period of 8 years, 38 patients eating as usual died while only 22 in the experimental group died. See [[ASIN:B00129IJJ2 The Low-Fat Way to Health and Longer Life]].<br /><br />In the 80's Dr. Esselstyn used a 10% fat, high fiber diet plus low dose statins to arrest or reverse heart disease in 18 severely ill heart patients. We know it worked because of before and after coronary angiograms and cardiac PET scans. Some had been given less than a year to live by their referring cardiologist. After 12 years, \\"Adherent patients have experienced no extension of clinical disease, no coronary events, and no interventions. This finding is all the more compelling when we consider that the original compliant 18 participants experienced 49 coronary events in the 8 years before the study.\\" There was no requirement to count calories or exercise to get these results. Although the sample was small, the results were statistically significant. The percent of reduction in mortality and cardiac events by far outperforms any other study that has ever been done on coronary artery disease patients. See [[ASIN:1583333002 Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure]].<br /><br />Dr. Ornish also reversed heart disease using a similar diet plus exercise and meditation but no statins. Since then Dr. Ornish has enrolled at least 3800 patients in demonstration projects (to demonstrate savings on surgery) which resulted in over 40 insurance companies including Medicare covering a program in diet and lifestyle for heart disease patients. According to Dr. Ornish, \\"In brief, we found that almost 80 percent of patients who were eligible for bypass surgery or angioplasty were able to safely avoid it for at least three years.\\" Insurance companies wouldn't pay for something that made a lot of people worse. If any one got worse it had to be a small minority of patients. See [[ASIN:0345496310 The Spectrum: A Scientifically Proven Program to Feel Better, Live Longer, Lose Weight, and Gain Health]].<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />According to an objective evaluation of all the evidence by Harvard School of Public Health, \\"The answer to the question What should I eat? is actually pretty simple. But you wouldn't know that from news reports on diet and nutrition studies, whose sole purpose seems to be to confuse people on a daily basis. When it comes down to it, though-WHEN ALL THE EVIDENCE IS LOOKED TOGETHER-THE BEST NUTRITION ADVISE ON WHAT TO EAT IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD: Eat a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; choose healthy fats, like olive and canola oil; and eat red meat and unhealthy fats, like saturated and trans fats, sparingly. Drink water and other healthy beverages, and limit sugary drinks and salt. Most important of all is keeping calories in check, so you can avoid weight gain, which makes exercise a key partner to a healthy diet.\\" This is basically a Mediterranean diet.<br /><br />Dr. Atkins advice has always been on the fringe and still is. Studies show that during weight maintenance high animal fat diets increase total LDL, small dense LDL and IGF-1. They also increase the risk of heart disease, cancer and all-cause-mortality in the average person. But if you feel you absolutely must eat low carb, then the evidence says that however good your health is on a low-carb, high animal fat diet, it'll be better on a low-carb diet that is low in animal fat and animal protein.<br /><br />BTW, someone said I was a vegan who was against animal food on principle, regardless of the health consequences. They're wrong. I'm not a vegan. This is only about health. And Aktins versus vegan is a false dilemma. There are many ways to eat low-carb, some of them much better than others. The original Atkins (low in vegetables and high in animal fat) is probably the worst of them all. And there are many ways to eat vegetarian. And some of them include a lot of sugar and junk food and aren't healthy for anyone. But the vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists live longer than any group that has ever been studied. So it's possible to to be a healthy vegetarian. Actually there are more studies supporting the Mediterranean diet than for any other eating style. Ancel Keys (who has been libeled by Uffe Ravnskov and others especially since his death) promoted a Mediterranean diet(which is a near vegetarian diet).

B002QEXN2K|1.0|I am a huge John Mayer fan!  HUGE!  I was so excited when he mentioned he had a new CD coming out during one of his concerts.  Sadly, this was a major let-down.  Normally I open the wrapper of one of his CDs and play it until the darn thing is nearly warped.  I listened to this one ONCE and haven't touched it since.  What happened John?  You use to write songs that sang straight to my heart...
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock is a new and updated version of the timeless classic. The plot lines are intriguing and the characters engaging. Sherlock has a borderline social disorder, having no friends except for Watson, a war veteran. Sherlock uses modern technology including: cell phones and laptops to solve crimes quicker than ever. Cinematography is done quite well, with fast pace shots and transitions. With the aid of text layers on the scene, you can see exactly what Sherlock is observing. Overall the series is intelligent, suspenseful, and thrilling. What could you expect from the writers of Dr. Who (the current series)? You really have to pay attention to dialogue or you'll miss out. There are only three episodes, but they are well written. I can't wait until for season 2.     Long live Sherlock!
B003UYUP58|5.0|The author tells a pretty compelling story of mankind's encounter with cancer throughout history. It really does feel like a gradual awakening to the presence of a monster lurking in the shadow, slowly being brought into the light. Along the way, there are discoveries, battles, casualties and heroes. While no fault of the book, the story told is incomplete. There is still no definitive cure, which reminds one of the haunting passage quoted early in the book. Imhotep, something of an Egyptian renaissance man, who lived thousands of years ago chronicled many maladies and offered various therapies for each. For one in particular, \\"a bulging mass in the breast\\", he offered a chilling conclusion under therapy: \\"there is none\\".

B003XRZZFM|4.0|Dimmu fans will like this, but black metal purists will shake their heads at this stuff. It's much more dark than their last few records, but the sound isn't as good. The thick guitar sound is gone, as are the loud drums, but composition wise this is a very interesting album. Don't download it either, I've heard the MP3 version and it blows...the original is much better. The only thing I didn't like is the way it folds out, way too much cardboard...takes up too much space on the cd tower, and I don't even have the collector's version. Good music though, but if you are more of a purist then I recommend the new Melechesh, or Watain album. If you simply like the stuff than sounds like it was recorded up satan's butthole on a tape recorder from the 80's, then go for the new Black Funeral, or Enoid.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I saw Josh in New Haven at the Shubert last week. This small stage venue and then listening to his new album twice since then has me more enamored of his unique and stunning voice than ever.  I agree with the reviewers this is a stripped down Josh and what he intended to do when deciding to work with Rick Rubin. The soul and sincerity of his songs are touching and almost mournful;right from his heart.  He took a risk with this and for that I applaud him. Going out of his comfort zone.  I am a long time fan of that glorious rich voice and never tire of listening to him. Who sings like that???  I agree I wasn't so thrilled with Galileo either, but all the others are perfect in every way and I too will continue to listen over and over until I have heard every lyric and nuance and note of this piece of art. I look forward to his tour and seeing how it all works out on the big stage. He is a professional in every sense of the word.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Back in 2004, I saw a commercial for an upcoming show called \\"Lost\\" and I thought that there wasn't any way that a show that was just about survivors of a plane crash on an island with a monster would last. Admittedly, I expected a poorly executed piece of television.<br /><br />But after watching five seasons of the show, I was hooked. And then the final season aired and I was angry. I honestly felt like the show had focused more on character resolution and had barely addressed how its complex mythology fit together.<br /><br />So I bought this collection and I watched the entire series again, just to see the show in its entirety to see if I could make sense of what the show was intended to be. And after watching 6 seasons all over again, I changed my mind.<br /><br />I'm not going to say patronizing things about how Lost is so much better than any show and that it's only for intelligent-minded people or that it's only for open-minded people. What I'll say is this:<br /><br />Lost is a truly unique television show to watch. It's imaginative, surprising, affecting, emotionally-touching, audacious,and it has some of the best characters you'll find. And, yes, it has plenty of mysteries (and also plenty of answers along the way), but in the end, Lost stays true to itself: great characters, compelling stories, but just enough mystery to keep you watching.<br /><br />I've watched the series a lot since it ended, and every time I watch it, it still has the same sense of surprise and mystery and emotion as it did when I saw it the first time around. And though that might be frustrating to some (and if you feel that way, you're certainly entitled to), I'm glad that Lost never had that part of itself taken away and that it will always retain the characteristics that made me enjoy it.<br /><br />As for the packaging, it's great! Includes some surprises, some cool collector's items (read the Black Rock diary--you may find a long-awaited answer), and it looks well put together with lots of details that hearken back to moments in the series. The DVD case is a little flimsy and a couple of the episodes in Season 6 have very minor frame jumps (only like in 1 or 2 spots in the whole series), but if you enjoyed Lost the first time around, it's worth buying in my opinion.<br /><br />Bottom line: Lost is a truly unique experience, one that I'd recommend without hesitation.ts in the series.

Just picture it's 1988-89 and just after master they release Garage days , then Justice comes out BUT before the black album they go back to lars Garage and spend three weeks recording death Garage or Magnetic days , except it's not covers this time.     Death Magnetic is really good, it's Metallica again and now they're older two years recording fly's by for them feeling like two weeks ..ha ha, that's why it sounds like it was made in the garage ..:)    If you want a really good sound from a full album from them they'll need say six or seven years recording ..jokes.     Still if you can picture it as a release between Justice and the black album and they were in the garage again , it's perfect , infact it's Metallica having fun ...plus remember they were never huge rock stars they were and are US hardcore loving kids who just loved metal but wanted it fast like the Hardcord 80's bands they were into at that time ... hence the speed metal label at the time , so just cause now they're huge.! does not mean they had the willingness or hope to be some larger than life ROCK band..Cause that's not them, and this album proves it , if they get that sound sorted there is a new album waiting in them to be as good as Master 2011.   art work is cool, the back cover back to they're old school look..nice .  This is a METAL album ....! Great Thrash (speed metal) from the masters of this type of music.  Can't wait for the New album , I had not brought any Metallica since The black album and had been into them since 1985.    DEATH MAGNETIC is worthy . roll on Metallica. woohoo.    Tracks for me are , all nightmare long, broken,beat & scarred , the Judas kiss,my apocalypse.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|It's the greatest heavy metal album ever recorded. This belongs side-by-side with Pink Floyd's THE WALL.    I wrote Rob Halford a number of years ago, after he returned to Priest, suggesting that they do a concept thematic  album similar to Iron Maiden's SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON, but focus on Nostradamus. Apparently, it was the  right time for them, or coincidence that they were thinking along similar lines. This is the album that followed.    They took an extra long time to write and record this album. The release date kept being put off, as it grew into  a double-length outing.    The songs are exquisite. Laden with arpeggios (title track and the song \\"Revelations\\" alone will blow away most  guitarists). The musical craftsmanship is excellent. It's a roller-coaster ride through the LIFE of the famous  seer, Nostradamus, and a glimpse behind the visions, putting no small detail on the emotional impact of losing  his first wife, his life during the time of the inquisition, and his experiences with seeing visions of the future.  The music is eerie, majestic, sweet, hard-rocking and hard-hitting, and delicate, soft, and of every definition  and attitude associated with heavy metal--and yet, transcendent. This album allows Priest to break out of the box.  (I mention Pink Floyd up above because Pink Floyd is often considered 'heavy metal', despite many of their songs  being very soft or even pop-rock. It's an attitude and an intellectual *style*--a certain orientation. And, here,  Priest is no different with this album--it covers the extremes and includes, like others have stated, their   notable 70's flavor, just updated. It runs the gamut from the soft to what borders on thrash, and without losing  the intricacy).    Judas Priest at the band's finest! The perfect complement to this would be \\"NOSTRADAMUS: LIVE\\" (same songs, same  order, only live). The album should have garnered a Grammy.

Also, being chased by Olga Kurylenko may not necessarily be a bad thing, although her preference of long and sharp stabbing objects makes her slightly less attractive (slightly...). But the movie turned out to be very entertaining. The storyline feels authentic, there are colorful characters, amazing scenery and awsome cinematography. The ambush scene feels as real as it could have been for those unfortunate other legions in Germany. There are bloody, violent and scary scenes, but they do not appear self-serving. The chase makes you feel like you are running for your own life, but little Olga has a little more unnatural help than the logic of Quintus would allow it. The end is satisfying and makes real sense, leaving the remote possibility of a sequel open.
B002ZG974M|1.0|I was so excited for this movie to come out when I first heard about it. I thought it would give more facts about the different countries the babbies lived in and their customs for the children as they went threw the first year. But it is just a movie where you get a look at how other homes are else where.

B00428ZRFY|5.0|Rihanna and her songwriters and producers are at the top of their game with 'Loud', my favorite pop CD released this year. After emerging from the dark urban goth of 'Rated R' she is definitely in a different space now.<br /><br />*Sing These Songs With a Bunch of Drunken Friends: \\"Cheers\\" and \\"Raining Men\\"<br />*Dance Like You've Lost Your Mind To These Songs: \\"S&M\\", \\"What's My Name\\", & \\"Only Girl\\"<br />*Try To Get Through To Him/Her: \\"California King Bed\\" & \\"Complicated\\"<br />*Dump Him/Her With These Songs: \\"Fading\\" & \\"Man Down\\"<br />*Body Him/Her With This Song: \\"Skin\\"<br />*Seek Professional Help If These Are Your Words: \\"Love The Way You Lie\\"<br /><br />My Favorites: \\"Raining Men\\" is what I consider an upgraded version of Beyonce's \\"Diva\\". I lose my mind as soon as it starts along with \\"What's My Name\\"! Through \\"California King Bed\\" and \\"Complicated\\", Rihanna projects a longing that's refreshingly palpaple (and relatable, on a personal note). 'Loud' is Rihana at her best.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|I'm not reviewing the Rocky Horror Picture Show itself, as that's been done many times. I'd like to review what makes the 35th anniversary blu-ray edition of RHPS so great, and that is all the extras. Especially great are the options for:<br />1. Trivia pop-up<br />2. The words to scream back at the screen - very useful for virgins who haven't attended a showing yet, and nostalgic for the old-timers, even if the words might not match what you know. They are an amalgamation of the most common phrases, so for example, while we used to say \\"What do you do with Smurfs?\\" apparently the common phrase was \\"How do you kill cockroaches?\\" Also, they never use the phrase \\"Castles don't have phones!\\" which was surprising to me. Be warned that the language is the same as used in the theatres, which means rated R+ :)<br />3. The shadow cast actors are very good! Especially the girl who plays Janet, she was amazing. Brad and Magenta were the next best to Janet. The guy who plays Riff Raff has more \\"freedom of expression\\" than I'm used to, though.<br />4. The option to \\"throw\\" stuff at the screen is kind of funny, at least for one time through the show.<br /><br />There is a two-hour featurette (in two one-hour parts) that shows the Making and Casting of the Shadow Cast. I really enjoyed that also.<br /><br />You won't be sorry to get this edition even if you have prior editions. I've got the 15th anniversary Laserdisc edition, the 25th anniversary DVD edition, and now the 35th anniversary blu-ray edition, and the new one is the best yet :)

B000002KGT|5.0|This album made me a fan of Fleetwood Mac and ultimately of Stevie Nicks. When I threw the vinyl on my old record player, the house was shaking, and my dad (God bless his sou) knew all the songs on this album in and out, even though he was not a Fleetwood Mac Fan. But I played it so loudly that there was no escaping, not even for him, who was into operas.<br /><br />Needless to say that the vinyl was totally scratched and dented from all the use and misuse over the years. The only other album that saw more use and abuse in my collection was Mother's Finest Live, which, to this day, is my absolute favorite album, followed by Rumours.<br />This album has to be part of every music collection. Of course I replaced the vinyl version with the CD version, and still enjoy the songs as much as I did the very first day.<br /><br />Sonja Paris<br />[[ASIN:B0047T7N6O MAKE THE COUGAR PURR]]<br />[[ASIN:1452824541 Make The Cougar Purr]]

The \\"Promise\\" album is outstanding and one wonders how much more stuff like this is \\"in the vault\\".

B0000019PA|5.0|The first time I listened to a few songs off this album I knew it was different. Different in a good way. But I was distracted at the time and didn't actually have the album and didn't listen to the whole thing. Then I heard the song Aeroplane Over the Sea on the radio and was reminded of the album my friend called \\"maybe one of the best ever.\\" I admit being a bit suspicious of that type of praise for a record. But after returning to it and listening to the whole thing(repeatedly), I cannot really argue with him. It has infected me and I feel drawn to it in a way that is puzzling to me. I have listened to it over and over again and have picked out something different to like about it every time. And when it's done I feel like I have satisfied the urge and can go back to listening to everyday kinds of music. But sure enough, a phrase gets stuck in my head and I have to go back and listen again. It is raw and mystical and you just have to wonder what he was tapped into when he made this music; like he was a conduit that something passed through.

0316069485|1.0|I am a retired clinical and forensic psychologist who worked with convicted criminals for 29 years. I have been an avid fan of Connelly's Harry Bosch until recently. I was very disappointed with 9 Dragons, and now, unfortuately, The Reversal is also even more disappointing. Harry's IQ appears to be getting lower while he lets his ego-centric younger half-brother treat him none of the respect he deserves (from his earlier books).<br />I think Connelly must be running out of ideas. I cannot recommend this book, even though I have recommended earler (pre 9 Dragons) Harry Bosch books to many friends.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Although Rupert Penry-Jones is quite handsome - more attractive than Ciaran Hines - I found Sally Hawkins poorly cast in this version. Amanda Root is a much better Anne. In this version Sally's 'acting' was basically sighing her way through the story. The film went quickly without jeopardizing Jane Austen's storyline. But Sally Hawkins ruined it for me - especially the longed awaited kiss that focused on her mucus laden teeth.  Yuck!

B003EYVXSW|4.0|Splice is for the most part a fresh and original story idea for a horror film that sets itself apart from the many sequels and remakes to have come out in recent years. The film's premise and themes deal with tampering with nature and the fears and controversies behind biogenetic engineering. Similar themes to classic stories such as Frankenstein only with more recent technology and sciences. The film's premise is about two genetic engineers Clive(Adrien Brody) and Elsa(Sarah polley)combining the genes of many different animal species with a human to make a new type of hybrid species. The couple raise their creation named Dren as if were their own child. Dren grows at a rate much faster than normal species and first seems human in nature. However as she grows her animalistic traits start to kick in and she slowly turns on the couple.<br />This film starts out somewhat slow but picks up pace and moves along faster as it progresses. Splice also offers some shocking and controversial sequences that might be disturbing to some. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley give decent performances and are convincing enough in their roles. Actress Delphine Chaneac probably gives the best performance of the film. Being commited enough with the production to shave her hair off(similar to Natalie Portman in V For Vendetta) and convincingly uses non-verbal acting as her character Dren doesn't speak in any point of the movie. The special effects and makeup used in the movie are sufficient enough and the cgi baby dren or her added on limbs don't come across as fake as many films with cgi effects do. Overall this is a creative and original above average Science Fiction Horror film. One of the better theatrical horror films to come out this year.
0345505387|5.0|Amazon had this book to me for less, including postage, than I would have paid in Australia! It was certainly worth the wait (way less than Amazon predicted, thankyou very much *G*). Richly coloured, beautifully presented graphic novel that tells the Outlander tale, albeit briefly, from a different point of view. Mind you, we get to see some gorgeous illustrations from the collaboration of minds between Diana and the illustrator, which include one Jamie Fraser in some enthralling poses. Not exactly my mind's eye vision of all the characters, but then I'm not the illustrator. A very worthwhile addition to the bookshelf-bulging collection of Diana Gabaldon...and a great option for when your eyes canna focus on the print any more and need some pretty pictures. ENJOY!!!
B002K4MAA2|5.0|Very happy that,I,purchased an all region DVD player so i could get films and this British Tele-miniseries that is ONE of the BEST Zombie shows yet! The best way to describe DEAD-SET is,Night Of The Living Dead Meets Shaun Of The Dead.While their is an underlying sense of satire/comedy mixed with an reality show background,the makers of this horror epic never forget to go deeper into the realm of horror/thriller to provide what essentially becomes like a roller coaster ride experience for the fans in whom no doubt that the director intended this show for.There are only a few movies that have been made featuring Fast-Running ZOMBIES,Nightmare CityA.K.A.City of the Walking Dead1980,28 days later,28 weeks later,the remake of Romeros ,Day of the Dead,the remake of Dawn of the Dead and also most recent,Devils Playground,that is another exellent U.K.film.Don't forget about Rec or Rec 2 or the upcoming prequel and third sequel to those thrillers that are on the drawing boards or The Greek film Evil:to kako and its sequel featuring Billy Zane that should soon be available!Dead-set is an example of how much ALIVE! the ZOMBIE genre has become.And oh yeah,the ending of this one reminds me of the ironic ending of Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The ending of Dead-Set brought tears to my eyes and that is the first time Any Zombie flick has ever moved me emotionally. A must-see for Zombie fans and the DVD Dead-Set is full of many deleted scenes and special features as well as being as pristine a visual copy as i have seen yet.As an American,I,must say,the UNITED KINGDOM and The British are giving Hollywood ,a BLOODY run for their money in terms of Film-making!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I see some one star reviews which I do not think are deserving.  Just as when Metallica went in a different direction, everyone bashed.  Bottom line, this is STILL Kid Rock.  However, this is not American Badass.    This album in its own right is excellent.  If you are hoping for Bawitdaba, your not going to find it here.  If you enjoyed 'Picture', like Zac Brown, enjoy country-rock, you are most likely going to enjoy this album.    Rate it for what it is, not for its (un)likeness to previous works.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Charles Ferguson's \\"Inside Job\\" is a brilliant and totally persusaive documentary about the economic meltdown of 2008. Relying strictly on recorded fact and expert testimony, the film is an efficient as the slitting of a throat, and leaves us in no doubt as to whose throats are being slit.<br /><br />Narrated by Matt Damon, \\"Inside Job\\" shows us step by step how financial deregulation, reckless lending and an insane reliance on the derivatives market led this country and the world to the brink of financial ruin. It is painful to watch Frederic Mishkin, a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, sputter like a schoolboy when asked to explain why he wrote a report praising Iceland's financial system when in fact the entire country was circling the bowl. It is infuriating to see the bristling indignation of Glenn Hubbard, George W. Bush's chief economic advisor, when asked why he advocated financial deregulation that ended up costing U.S. taxpayers trillions of dollars. What is even more painful and infuriating, however, is to see mortgage foreclosures continue at a record pace while the so-called recovery is too weak to support job creation on any meaningful level.<br /><br />The only place \\"Inside Job\\" falls down is at its end, when it issues a half-hearted call to arms. Ferguson has already made the point that Barack Obama has offered only token opposition to Wall Street kleptomania and continues to reward the same people and activities that Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush rewarded in succession. What conceivable presidential candidate in 2012--one, that is, with a prayer of getting elected--would do differently? No question about it--U.S. taxpayers are stuck paying through the nose to make sure Wall Street executives continue to receive their hundred-million-dollar bonuses.

B000PDYVVG|2.0|I mean, really? I was almost speechless halfway through the book, and would have thrown it away at the end if it wasn't on my Kindle. I've never hit \\"delete\\" with such vigor. I love the reviewer who called it a \\"ME-moir\\", how true.<br /><br />Incredibly self-indulgent, petty, childish, whiny and trite. Reading this book is like watching one of those vapid Real Housewife shows, except you've actually paid for the pleasure (?) of being simultaneously disgusted by - and humiliated for - another human being if you were fool enough to buy the book. I KNEW I should have gotten this from the library. Argh. I found the author's personality so horribly distasteful I'm truly annoyed I've made her any more money, especially out of my own pocket.<br /><br />What a selfish, self-important, shallow twit she is, My two stars are mainly for the fact that she doesn't seem to care who knows she's a shallow twit, and that she can string an interesting sentence together if you overlook the cringe-worthy content. It's a shameful commentary on the state of American literature that this has sold as many copies as it has.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|What a lovely boxset. I remember watching Dr Quinn as a little girl, but never managed to see all the seasons and episodes. It is absolutely wonderful to be able to watch the series again from the start. It is turning out to be even better than I remembered it. The audio and visuals are as to be expected from an old tv series and I have not had any problems yet. The set does include the two movies and is well packaged with each season in a separate plastic case. One disk down, another forty something to go . . . many hours of happy viewing! If you enjoyed this tv series, get this set, you won't be sorry!
0240816250|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most complete and interesting book about Photography technique now in the wide marked and scenario of Photography books. It is full of very useful and great tips and suggestions that could fit perfectly to professional and advanced amateur photographers. It covers both traditional (negatives) and digital photography and this is good because now we can see how traditional photography is living a new life and it has a great appeal on young photographers as well as ''aged'' ones. Also for this reason I do believe this is a great book, also very elegant and extremely well done from the layout point of view.  I am an amateur photographer, planning a couple of exhibitions next year and this book is helping me a lot in the not easy process of exhibition setting up etc. So, in a few words and hope this review will help other readers in their decisions, a very very good book that I strontly recommend.
0470876417|2.0|I think this is an interesting book. But the designers made a colossal error in design. The text fonts are very, very small. I have older eyes and use reading glasses, and with them I can read almost anything. But this book is really painful.    The book should come with a magnifying glass.
B004222UC8|4.0|The new 2-disc Special Edition of the \\"The Eternal Idol\\" is a fascinating listening experience for anyone who is otherwise a fan of this album. First, the remastered CD of the original LP with Tony Martin on vocals has never sounded better. While not the best produced album, the remastering brings a richer and more musical sound than my original CD, that I purchased back in 1987. But the big revelation is the second disc, which includes demo verions of the originally conceived LP with Ray Gillen on vocals. Be warned that these are demos, and the mix is not polished. Nonetheless, the sound is more than adequate, and for the first time we can hear what \\"might have been\\" had Gillen not quit the band before the LP was complete, and before Tony Iommi decided to have the vocals redone by Martin.<br /><br />So who is the better singer? I would say they are both very good, and about equal. But that is not the main issue in the comparison.<br /><br />What's most intrigued to me is that Ray Gillen sounds less like the late, great Ronnie James Dio than did Tony Martin. Martin's voice has a slightly husky sound like Dio's, and Martin's phrasing is more Dio-like than Gillen's. Ray Gillen brought a somewhat more unique sound to his version of Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Given that this album was a major commercial flop, as were all the Tony Martin Sabbath albums, it is interested to wonder if the more original vocal sound Gillen brought may have better connected with Sabbath fans that abandoned the band with this release. Personally I remember upon first listen thinking that Tony Martin sounded like a low rent version of Ronnie James Dio. I doubt I would have thought that if Gillen was singing, and I may have reacted to the LP a bit better back in 1987. It really wasn't until the past five years that I came to appreciate how good Tony Martin is, and that his 5 Sabbath LPs, while by no means great, are all very solid efforts, and very enjoyable.<br /><br />This special edition is highly recommended for fans of the LP and worth the upgrade from your 1987 CD. For those unsure of Sabbath-the Tony Martin years, probably still worth a try if the steep price doesn't scare you off. That said, \\"Cross Purposes\\" is probably the best Martin-era Sabbath, and may be a better starting point for the uninitiated.
B004BC7MRM|3.0|I consider myself the biggest Kid fan out there.  I love his good ole rock and roll songs, his hard core rock/rap, and his country songs. One of the greatest things about Kid Rock is that he has a unique ability to write many different types of music.  Usually on every album he will add one or two songs that are raw and edgy....umm not this one.  its \\"ok\\" but, Kid is not a just \\"okay\\" artist.  He's a whole lot better than this and this album does not do his talent any justice.     At least we get a tour and seeing him live is like nothing you'll ever see again!
B00136JU7Y|1.0|This DL sucks. It's broken and glitchy. I would have done better recording the drunks at a karaoke bar. NO STARS FOR YOU!:P
1416594884|3.0|I always like books that have some sort of intrigue to it. Books that have plenty of action and non stop thrills. And while there are many books on that topic, it always works if the execution is done right which is done here but not necessarily %100. Not to say that this isn't a great book, it is but there a re a few places where a bit of a polish could have been done.<br /><br />  The characters are developed to the point where you can \\"feel\\" them and sympathize with them but some of the plot is very familiar because it's going on today in the real world as we speak.<br /><br />  I will say Kudos to Mr. Le Carre for writing a pulse pounding story which almost left me wanting more. Almost but not quite.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This album is easily her best work since Mask & Mirror. I've enjoyed all of her albums, but only a few have a spark that really moves me. This is the first album to make my heart skip since Mask & Mirror. I've listened to her other albums, but this one will get loads of listening time. Totally worth it!
B003EV6DBW|3.0|I was looking forward to series 5 since hearing that David Tennant would be leaving the show.    Matt Smith as the Doctor was good, and I enjoyed his portrayal of the the 11th incarnation of the Time Lord. Likewise I thought Karen Gillan's Amy Pond was a fun companion that had the resourcefulness and courage of Donna Noble, but without all the whining and yelling.    Unfortunately the writing for this series ranged from moderately good to absolutely dreadful. This was the biggest disappointment of the season because Steven Moffat penned my favorite episodes for the previous four seasons, and as the new lead writer and executive producer I was expecting similar quality from the scripts for season 5 (at least for some of them). But there were no stand outs like \\"The Empty Child\\", \\"Blink\\", or \\"The Girl in the Fireplace.\\"    The new Tardis interior exemplifies the old saying that bigger is not always better. I like the concept of allowing the Tardis to rebuild itself after its near destruction during the regeneration from the 10th to 11th Doctor, but why so 80s and why so orange?    And then there is the format of the disks themselves. The menus are poorly designed with no episode sub-menus (or selection) and only scene selections (yes, you can watch an episode by selecting its first scene). It comes across as having been thrown together in a hurry. The sound also appears to have been mixed poorly with the dialogue constantly overwhelmed by the music and sound effects.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|One of the most impressively effective and beautiful 3D movies ever rendered for the new 3D generation.    I have to say that I saw this movie in 3D at theaters.. and it was ok. I say that because I thoroughly enjoyed it, but didn't think the 3D was as phenomenal as other films. I was hesitant to purchase it again on Bluray-3D simply for this fact, but got it through Amazon's Disney discount offer, which made the purchase at a value. Wow, was I wrong with the 3D effects.    The movie looks GORGEOUS on my 3D television. The story is amazingly well done, if not a bit creepy in some parts. It does push the boundaries of a PG film. Some parts, especially the Jacob Marley and third ghost of Christmas Future, are almost too frightening for small children, especially in 3D. But older kids (~8-10 yrs old) would probably love it, even if they do not understand what is being said. The movie uses almost exact prose from the Dickens masterpiece, therefore adults would understand the speech more than their children- after all, the original story by Mr. Charles was written as a ghost story intended for adults rather than for children. The underlying themes and ideas are great for all ages, but better understood and directed towards the lives of adults in this corruptive world that we live in.    Pay no mind to the harsh reviews of others here on Amazon, the movie is excellent. A classic! Jim Carrey truly delivers his best performance, something that my father will watch and be impressed to know that it is actually the goofy, suggestive man that he once despised as Ace Ventura. A redeeming performance on his behalf for a movie of redemption during the holiday season. Zemeckis adds his eye-candy flavor to an already well-established tale to make this a fun and rewarding experience that rivals other holiday films for the best movie to enjoy next to a crackling fire on Christmas Eve. Oscar-worthy performances by all, especially Carrey. Rewarding 3D effects that truly immerse you intothe adventure. Well worth its place in everyone's holiday collection. Easily five stars.
0395389496|3.0|First, my disclosure: I didn't read this book for the first time as a child.<br /><br />The story is a straightforward tale about a boy who is right at that age between believing in Santa Claus and not believing. On Christmas Eve he is whisked away to the North Pole on the Polar Express and meets Santa who gives him a gift. The gift is a reminder about the joy of Christmas for all those who truly believe.<br /><br />The artwork is exceptional for the tone of the story, which is to say it evokes a Norman Rockwell feeling of longing for the classic childhood. The gift of the bell seems to represent the boy's faltering belief in Santa Clause. Sometimes it's strong; sometimes it's weak. By the end, only those who truly believe in the spirit of Christmas can hear the bell.<br /><br />I appreciate the childlike atmosphere of Christmas and how simple and good the world feels every December. I don't agree with the book's notion of aging being some sort of an automatic loss of the Christmas spirit. An experienced understanding of Christmas can be the truest of all. If anything, the bell should ring louder for the adults.<br /><br />The Polar Express will no doubt endure as one of the best stories to read to your child each Christmas even though its message seems outdated.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is my all time favorite story.  I have seen every version ever made including most plays.  This is an over the top Jim Carey movie.  I watched it with my 7yr old grandson and he was so scared he couldn't sleep. All the horror took away from the moral of the story. It makes me very angry that Disney was a part of this. THIS IS A CHRISTMAS HORROR MOVIE not for children. So many good versions out there, get one of them and let Disney know this is UNEXCEPTABLE!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Those expecting Eurythmics' \\"Winter Wonderland\\" will be surprised, perhaps, as this is a very traditional -- with some modern adaptations -- album. There's not a second that hasn't been thought through on this wonderful album. I've loved Annie Lennox for 25 years, but I will say that I was even surprised just how truly wonderful this album is. It's a classic.
0525951652|4.0|`The Fall of Giants' is the first volume in the `Century Trilogy'.  It reminds me of one of those  epic novels from the 1970's like Herman Wouk's  `The Winds of War' that were turned into mini series on TV back then.  It's scope is epic and encompasses the time 100 years ago just before and right after World War I and its impact on the lives of five families whose lives intertwine.    There are two Welsh families, the working class Williams who are coal miners and Socialists, and the Upper Class Fitzherberts who own both the mine and most of the town.  The families are brought together as Ethel Williams works as a housekeeper in the mansion and is befriended by Lady Maud who is a fellow suffragette.     In Czarist St. Petersburg the Peskov brothers live a hard life in a factory that is owned by Lord Fitzherbert's Russian wife's family.  Both dream of saving money and moving someday to America.    In London, German Walter von Ulrich serves a Spy in his father's diplomatic office.  Walter is in love with Lady Maud  and sees the growing war clouds as a harbinger of doom on the order of Europe.  He does what he can to make the Germans see reality.    In America, young Gus DeWars is the son of wealthy New York socialites.  He has caught the attention of Woodrow Wilson's state department and his travels to Europe in their service causes him to befriend Lord Fitzhubert and von Ulrich.    The clouds of war begin to develop and the lives of all five families intertwine as they are caught up in history.  As with the rest of Follett's works we get a history lesson and a grand Melodrama.  The book would be perfect as a miniseries on one of the cable channels.   I enjoyed it very much.
B004132HZS|5.0|I can only second all reviews present here; this is a stunning series.  Like others who are loyal to Jeremy Brett, I was hesitant to watch the new Sherlock but found Cumberbatch completely irresistable.  Cumberbatch excels in all parts he portrays but yes, I agree that this is the actor's finest work to date.  Martin Freeman and Rupert Graves also excel.  Bring on the new series!  This is a  masterpiece and it will please even the most critical viewers.  An absolute must for the home collection.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Being a big fan of the original NCIS, and having watched all seasons to date, was interested to see how the spin off NCIS would be. Great news - totally loved it!  Appreciated the fact that is is very different from NCIS - much more 'reaching for my gun' type action. We haven't been given a poor cousin or another extension, we've been given a completely different show, from how the crew are managed, to James Bond type accessories that don't appear in the original NCIS, plus the undercover work that features in most episodes. I like how there is some element of linkages with Washington - with Director Vance and Abi - adds to the realism of the program. Great show! But for those people into the forensics side of Abi and NCIS, this is not the show for you - there is no forensic team member, and we only hear forensics mentioned for toxicology.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I have been waiting for this version for a LONG time. I am a huge Avatar fan and didn't get a chance to see the extended cut in the theaters. Now I can see it PLUS more with the new alternate opening...which is AMAZING! Really adds to the storyline. The only downfall is that with all those versions of the film on 1 disc...it wasn't enough...so half way through the movie you have to change the disc to continue the movie. I don't really have a problem with it...just kinda gets annoying. However, the Blu-ray version has all 3 versions of the film on one blu-ray disc...considering of course that they hold ALOT more data than regular DVDs. This is for sure a must buy for any Avatar fan...the documentary \\"Capturing Avatar\\" will absolutly blow your mind and amaze you with wonder about the world known as Pandora...and the film known round the world as AVATAR!
6305736650|3.0|Love this film.  Seller was in Quebec. They sent movie to me through USPS.  The movie was broken.  Contacted seller and they have no more available.  They promised refund.  I know this is not the seller's fault but I was looking forward to watching this movie.    Would recommend this seller to anyone 100%.  Things like this do happen from time to time.    Movie is one of the best classics of all time.    Looking forward to my refund.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Scott Pilgrim VS The World highly relates to the successful cartoon show... FAMILY GUY!  The entire movie is random, stupid and makes zero sense!

B001U2FASE|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  Had trouble with the subtitles on Blu-Ray and seller promptly sent out another movie.  Can't get better than that for service!  Thank you so much.  I love dealing with you.  You stay on top of things and make the customer happy.    This movie is a must see by everyone.  It's not your typical war film.  It's a nice story.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|Great movie with a great message. For those who say that M Night Shyamalan's movies have gone down hill this one will change their minds. Very similar to the set up and presentation of a Rod Serling written episode of the Twilight Zone, but edgier. Shyamalan has out done himself with this one. Best movie he has written since Signs!
1577314808|4.0|This is a spititual book and it is so practical at the same time. Tolle gives us one of the most valuable techniques for practicing the power of now. If you follow Tolle and his mind journey I promise you a great joy in discovering your own true self. What is missing from this book is mind programming techniques like hypnosis. My point here is to write the main exercises and program your mind with these suggestions. So if you want to find what a real inner joy is , buy the book.

B003ZHQVJO|4.0|This isn't the Kid Rock you've always known. Missing is the angst of his past albums. No rap, hip-hop. Nothing even remotely resembling the devil without a cause that we've all come to know. Instead, grab any old Bob Segar album off the shelf, and guess what? You have somehow managed to pick up \\"Born Free\\" every time.<br /><br />Nothing against Bob Segar. I love his/their old albums. This is just not what I expect from Kid Rock. I could see it coming from his last album, but, when you boil it all down, this is really just mushy rock. Good for the road and I suppose and few listens, but, to me, nothing really memorable.<br /><br />Kid Rock: locate your lost attitude and use it to make your next album. Please? That was some really good stuff you used to make.
0525951652|3.0|I approached Ken Follett's Century Trilogy with a decision to make: the first novel, Fall of Giants, came in at almost a thousand pages, and I knew that if I became hooked, this would be many hours of reading, not just for this novel but expecting that I would read the next two as well. I've read a lot of Follett's work, and feel that his compact Eye of the Needle is the best of all, although the historical novels Pillars of the Earth and World Without End were entertaining and engaging. I took the plunge. Set in the 20th century, the new novel uses the characters in five families to present the historical events, including the Russian Revolution, World War I, prohibition, and the fight for women's rights. Follett's history seems accurate, and the vivid characters he presents draw readers into their personal stories. A minor annoyance I experienced was from plot: the improbable circumstances that brought characters together. I was reminded of the John Jakes historical novels where at every turn a character bumped into a historical figure or another main character. Readers who enjoy historical fiction will find many enjoyable pages to read in this first installment, and may look forward to learning what happens next to these characters.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B002VECLVO|3.0|A Single Man is a good film but it didn't blow me away. I have always thought of Colin Firth as a boring, uninteresting actor but he turns in an amazing performance here - really shows his surprising range. Julianne Moore and Matthew Goode deliver stellar performances as well. A Single Man is a very slow film, nothing special but not a total disappointment either. A mixed bag for me.
B003YOZNBK|3.0|I will probably draw heat for this review, as I have for some of my other comic book cum movie reviews, but so be it. I have not read the comic book so this review is strictly based on the movie, JONAH HEX.<br /><br />Set in the recently-post Civil War America, JONAH HEX is the story of a man driven by vengeance. During the closing days of the Confederacy, Jonah was ordered to destroy a hospital. When he refused, his commanding officer burned Jonah's family alive, forcing Jonah to watch. The commander then brands Jonah's face and leaves him to die, although he says the brand is so Jonah always remembers who did this to him. The Crow Indians rescue Jonah from the brink of death, leaving him with the ability to talk to, and torture, the dead. So Jonah sets out to kill his old CO who is now planning to destroy Washington DC with a super weapon.<br /><br />That is the basic story line of JONAH HEX, and you get most of it in the first few minutes of the movie. But what struck me was the similarity to the old Wild Wild West television series. In every blessed episode, we saw James West, the Secret Service agent, thwarting an evil genius who was trying destroy something. Jonah isn't as pretty as Jim West, but his role is the same. In the series, we had Artemis Gordon acting as a sort of M from James Bond. In JONAH HEX, we had Agent Broils from the Fringe series supplying horse-mounted Gatling guns and incendiary crossbows. In Wild Wild West, Jim's boss was President Grant. In JONAH HEX, he was working for President Grant. And of course, there are the pretty girls present in both.<br /><br />As I sat watching JONAH HEX, thinking about The Wild Wild West series, I realized how flat the movie is. The characters are cardboard, the plot is pointless, and even the visuals are ordinary. The acting was passable but not remarkable. The actors read their lines but they didn't own their characters. I started imaging other actors in those roles and found that it was a very easy exercise. In fact, it might have been a better movie if they had gotten unknowns to play the main roles.<br /><br />I'm giving JONAH HEX 3 stars because it didn't offend me and because no one used the word, \\"Friend-O.\\" It just wasn't an exciting or even interesting movie, but if you have some ironing to do, this might fill the bill for something to have on in the background.have been a better movie if they had gotten unknowns to play the main roles.

B003V5PPZG|2.0|I was hoping for a change in Linkin Park since all of their constant remixes...then they came out with this...not tasteful from their awesome original old school music.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|This is one of the best albums available this year and as such scores a 5 out of 5.  There is a definite 80s musical influence but not so much that the music is dated. The vocals in the track Silver Lining also remind me of VAST's Winter in My Heart  while very much retaining its own unique style.    Still. I am very tempted to score this album much, much lower due to Sony's poor marketing.  The only reason I won't is because the band doesn't deserve to suffer for Sony's poor marketing decisions.... That being said... rant ahead regarding Sony...    There is no option for a digital download purchase. There is no way to preview the tracks prior to purchase. In fact, had I not heard \\"Silver Lining\\" on a fanvid for Ashes to Ashes of all places, I would never have even considered buying this CD/album in the first place.  Which means, I would have completely missed out on this amazing group and their music. Also, I hate buying CDs. It's a waste of materials. A waste of space. A waste of time. I prefer digital purchases. There is simply no reason for CDs any more. Forcing customers into an outdated business model, if anything else, only encourages piracy. Please, stop this nonsense.  Make it easier for me to spend my money on great music like this. Not harder.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This is the cheapest that you will be able to find this movie new on Blu-Ray. That's a Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital copy for $10 less than WalMart.<br /><br />This is a good movie for our times. Both serious and comical. No pun intended. The acting is good with a mixture of new and old faces. The story isn't 100% original, but adds a nice spin to the traditional superhero story - again with serious moral themes and jokes. It's not age appropriate for everyone, so send the little ones to bed before watching.
B001KVZ6G6|3.0|First of all I'll like to apologize for my English since it's not my native language.    The movie is great, I love it, I think Pixar is great in making heart-touching movies with good family values, but this review isn't about the movie, is about the DVD disc. I'm from Guatemala (Central America) my native language is Spanish, when you see the product's description it says, and I quote:     Language: English (DTS 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)  Subtitles: French, Spanish    So I was expecting that the DVD will have Spanish subtitles as well, but it doesn't, it only has English for the hearing impaired, my blu-ray player doesn't work and I planned to watch the DVD movie while I fix it but now I can't. Today as I was writting this review I saw a review that said there was no Spanish subtitles in the DVD, I didn't saw it earlier but still Amazon should have a separated product description for every disc, after all who has the time to look for a detailed comment to see exactly how the product is? Wouldn't it be better to look for such detailed product description at the product description section? I think it would.

6304698623|2.0|\\"A Little Princess\\" is a second-rate melodrama for children.  It gives us a glimpse of trench warfare in World War I, complete with poison gas.  A small but important part of the action takes place in images from East Indian imagination.    The movie apparently teaches that make-believe can transform your world and make it wonderful, though the teaching is undercut by the slapstick ending of a comic romance and elopement.      Fantasy stories can help us see clearly and prepare us for real life, but I don't think this one does so.  After one viewing, the effect was not unlike a large helping of strawberry ice cream in a bowl of beef stew.  \\"Princess\\" has its good points, so let's give it 3/10 (vs. 6 or 7/10 for \\"The Secret Garden\\", which has a better story and fine photography).  If you buy \\"Princess,\\" consider getting the dvd with \\"The Secret Garden\\" on the other side.

B004259BMM|5.0|This is classic Keith, but you can hear an easy confidence in the songs that may have been lacking in the last couple albums. I love all of his past work, and this ranks near the top! As far as the low number of tracks, you can't fault him ... some folks are on a budget, and artists are feeling the pressure to produce new music more often these days. But, the true fans headed to Target ... and most likely have completed the album on iTunes as well. Can you blame us?? ;)

B0000BWTK3|3.0|I've owned the Kovacevich (BBC SO/Davis) version of the Schumann and Grieg piano concertos for some years and been somewhat disappointed at the less-than-sparkling audio of these 1971 Philips recordings. [[ASIN:B000007OTJ Favourite Piano Concertos, Vol.2]]    Decided to buy the Andsnes version after reading several reviews. Not a disaster, but a wake-up to how truly excellent the Kovacevich version is. The Schumann concerto is my favorite and Kovacevich's phrasing and momentum envelop you and sweep you along in a way that - at least for me - Andsnes does not.    So I'll be sticking with the Philips discs for a while. The trade-off between audio quality and performance is no contest - and if you don't already own it the \\"Favourite Piano Concertos, Vol 2\\" set it certainly is terrific value. Just wish Philips could get some Decca engineers to come over and remaster them ...

B003VIW8DU|4.0|Having been a Roxy Music/Bryan Ferry fan in the US since the early 90s, every new Ferry solo album release was an anticipated event for me.  In my 20s, Ferry conveyed the wandering romantic with a suave style.  Now I'm in my late 30s, having found my one true love, Ferry's impact on me as a lyricist has waned, but he still can put out a nice musician's album.  While I wasn't as excited about \\"Olympia\\" coming out as I was when \\"Mamouna\\" came out 13 years ago, I was ready to buy this (CD+DVD) package, especially since it had a DVD, and press reviews were good.    Package:  While an odd way to start the review, I think there were a few things that struck me about the packaging.  First, instead of the standard plastic case, we are entreated to a glossy mini-book, with some beautiful shots of Kate Moss (who I never found attractive, but was gorgeous in the shoots).  Also a nice addition was the introduction by Richard Williams, with eloquent descriptions of the tracks.  The last time I read liner notes was either a) the first Roxy Music album (with Pete Sinfeld not making any sense) or b) Shades of Deep Purple.  Definitely worth the money.    Music:  After about 5 listens, the title of my review says it all.  I found some stuff rehashed from old albums, some numbers recycled, and some remodeling of the standard Ferry sound.  Briefly hitting each track; \\"You Can Dance\\" starts with the intro of \\"True to Life\\" off \\"Avalon\\" and then goes into a beaty mambo-like beat.  \\"Alphaville\\" is essentially \\"NYC\\" from \\"Mamouna\\" with different lyrics.  \\"Heartache by Numbers\\" is when we see some of the Ferry creativity come out, with the beautiful harmonies of the chorus, aided by the Scissor Sisters' production.  \\"Me Oh My\\" is one of the softer melodies with some of the Ferry pathos that has been missing from the last couple of albums, and quickly becoming one of my favorites.  \\"Shameless\\" with collaboration with Groove Armada, is more a techodisco beat with some nice lyrics.  Then comesthe climax of the album, \\"Song to the Siren\\", which will polarize those who may prefer the original Tim Buckley version or the Mortal Coil version; I personally loved it, as Ferry decides to use a more musical interpretation of the song rather than a vocal one.  Very reminiscent of \\"Is your love strong enough\\", but softer.  \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" starts the decline, and while not horrible, was not that special.  \\"BF Bass\\" was a funk melody, but a throwaway for me, while \\"Reason or Rhyme\\" was going back to the deadpan of \\"Dylanesque\\" (which all sounded the same).  Finally, for the end of the album proper, \\"Tender is the night\\" is a relatively quiet number, which is nice note to end on.  The two bonus tracks, \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" and \\"One Night\\" were OK, but did not add to the overall experience.    DVD:  Nice \\"Making of\\" DVD, which is more interesting to see how hard Ferry worked on the album, and what was involved in making the album.  The video of \\"You Can Dance\\" was dull, and almost destroyed the song for me.    Overall, \\"Olympia\\" recycles a lot of Ferry's previous work, but when the creativity came out, the album starts to shine.  Would recommend to the Ferry fan for the highlighted songs above.  Those who have not heard Ferry may welcome this album, especially with the lack of proper music out there.  But a good comparison is Sade; though most of the albums sound relatively the same, there are shades that you were not aware of, and an essence of style and glamor always seeps from the album.  3.5 stars.

B00003CX8U|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CX8U All That Jazz]]  Many critics have likened &#34;All That Jazz&#34; to cinimatic self-indulgence...and believe that no one who had those personality charactistics would want to make a filmed auto-biography of himself (&#34;womanizer, cheat, liar...&#34; - as he describes himself...)(as the previous reviewer, &#34;A Customer&#34;, says, you should read the 2 literary biographies of Fosse - if you want to see how accurate a portrayal Fosse gives of himself in the film).   I believe Fosse was a great dancer, choreographer, and film-maker - and at the same time a person whose moral & humane values I would wish on no one...   As a student of ballet, modern, & jazz, I inculcated my daughter, when she was a young ballet student, on various selections from Bob's repetiore - his signature number, &#34;Steam Heat&#34;, from &#34;The Pajama Game&#34;, &#34;Hey, Big Spender&#34; & &#34;Rich Man's Frug&#34; (Pompeii Club scene) from &#34;Sweet Charity&#34;...etc., etc...

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I'm not the biggest Kid Rock fan, love his voice, but can't stand numerous 'F' bombs and lyrics to his songs. I was told from a friend this cd was excellent and I have to agree. Many of these songs take me back to the days of summer, growing up and enjoying a life free of any responsibilities.     For me, this cd is a change from the past and a good change. I agree there is a comparison to Bob Seger. Many of the songs sound like something Seger would have sung during the late 70's. I might be one of the few, but I think Rick Rubin was a big plus for Kid Rock. Very enjoyable cd. Thinking many new fans will be had with this cd.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I love Josh Groban's music and this is definitely different, but I find I still like it quite a bit.  I love Você Existe Em Mim, it is my favorite.  That said, I do like his earlier work better, especially his very first, the one simply titled Josh Groban.  In my opinion that one was the best.  I remember my roommate in college playing it over and over again and I've been in love ever since.  His voice is absolutely beautiful and I love to listen no matter what he is singing!

B0029LHX1W|4.0|I picked up Child 44 on the bargain book rack and it subsequently sat for a while in a pile of unread books at home.  I finally decided to give it a try and was glad that I did.  Smith presents a compelling story set in the time of Stalinist Russia in which a disgraced former WWII hero begins to track a serial killer, who by definition cannot exist in the Soviet State.  On the one level, this book stands well on its own as a murder mystery.  The added complexity and contradictions inherent to the oppressive environment in Stalinist Russia add another dimension and take the story to a higher level.  Although the pace varies throughout the book, the story is engaging from start to finish.  Smith hooked me at the beginning and definitely kept me turning the pages.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|Sure, the stats are there.  Barry Gibb has written (16) number one hits.  The Bee Gees have the rare claim of occupying the #1 and #2 positions on Billboards Music Charts (behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley).  The Bee Gees have had (9) number one hits; six of them in a row (tying with the Beatles and one behind Mariah Carey).  And now it's their 50th anniversary.  But this box set represents more than just that.<br /><br />Twenty years ago, the Bee Gees released [[ASIN:B000001FWW Tales From Bros Gibb]], comprising all their singles and B-Sides on four discs (up to 1990).  Now twenty years on, they focus on the songs they take the most pride in.  This time, they include brother Andy Gibb, who was heavily rumored to become the fourth Bee Gee in the late 1980's, before his tragic death.  This is a musical collection of the most popular family pop/rock group in history.<br /><br />Each disc is focused on one brother.  Barry's disc (like the others) relies strongly on his lead vocals and comprises mostly hits.  \\"Spirits (Having Flown)\\" begins the set, being one of the arguably best compositions the group has produced and ends with their first notable single, \\"Spick And Specks\\" from Australia in 1966.  Each song is carefully remastered, a few in mono and the remainder improved in clarity and state of the art stereo.  Barry, noted for his strong vocals including falsetto includes a few album cuts and previously unreleased cuts that are a marvel.  \\"Barker Of The UFO\\" is a bewildering cut, but perhaps reflects the sixties atmosphere of random fun.  Mostly, this disc shows Barry`s choices as being some of his finest in composition and production.<br /><br />Robin's disc also carries several hits, but contains some album cuts and B-Sides that could have been singles, or were for other artists.  \\"Love Me\\" and his solo's \\"Juliet\\" and \\"Saved by The Bell\\" are historic masterpieces.  The exquisite, \\"The Longest Night\\", almost a single and one of his most romantic is haunting.  Pull in the ethereal, \\"Rings Around The Moon\\" and his version of \\"Islands In The Stream\\" and you get a clear idea of what Robin's voice can wield. For a true crowd pleaser, Robin includes the anthemic song, \\"Odessa\\" from 1969.  A song that has received extensive critical acclaim as a masterpiece of songwriting and singing.<br /><br />Maurice Gibb never had a lead vocal single, as his expertises were in arrangement instrumentals and harmonizing, the latter being the magical glue that held the brothers harmonies together.  From the sixties simple, yet satisfying, \\"Suddenly\\" to his post-mortem tribute song, \\"Man In The Middle\\", Maurice proves his talents.  To emphasize his own style and talent, this collection contains two remarkable previously unreleased songs, \\"Angel Of Mercy\\" and \\"The Bridge\\" with shared vocals with his daughter Samantha of `Samantha Gibb and the Cartels'.  Maurice's solo singles, \\"Railroad' and \\"Hold Her In Your Hand\\" are here in digital delight.  It s a shame that the B-Side of \\"Railroad\\", the song \\"I've Come Back\\" is not here.  His songs were lovingly chosen by his wife Yvonne and children Samantha and Adam Gibb.<br /><br />Although Andy Gibb unfortunately never became the fourth Bee Gee, his songs were chosen by his daughter Peta, who shows a talent for what her father's best songs truly were.  All of Andy's singles are here (other than the notorious novelty song, \\"All I Have To Do Is Dream\\" with a C-list actress).  But Peta cleverly mostly picks out the songs that Andy wrote himself.  Most of his first album cuts are included here, pure in their style and innocence.  Olivia Newton-John is included as well (a long time family friend) in a duet along with a heart-breaking unreleased song, \\"Arrow Through The Heart\\".<br /><br />On this box set, it truly is a family affair.  The accolades are included with the music (which is enough already!), along with a 60-page booklet with rare family photographs from the early sixties to the recent.  The Bee Geeshistory is carefully chronicled with excerpts from many artists.  It starts with Barry Gibb under the title \\"From Our Family\\" and continues with his heartfelt reminiscing, particularly about Andy.  Many many quotations are here, from Robin Gibb to Yvonne, Samantha and Adam Gibb. Peta Gibb also describes in loving terms her feelings about her father's legacy.  The accolades don't stop there.  Included in this tribute are extensive comments from extraordinary people like David English, Robert Stigwood, George Martin, Cliff Richard, Graham Nash, Elton John, David Foster, Olivia Newton-John, Franki Valli, Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, Glen Campbell, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick, Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake and many many others.  There is so much more in this extraordinary box set that begs a look and a listen.  Not many artists have achieved so much.  Only one family has reached this height.  The Bee Gees are forever.<br /><br />An Afterthought:  Big hit songs like, \\"Lonely Days\\" and \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?\\" are omitted, as it was the harmony of the brothers and no one person took the lead of the song.  That is bittersweet.history is carefully chronicled with excerpts from many artists.

B004CD7OCI|5.0|A well-written, well-told story with good acting all-around.  Production quality rivals motion pictures.  Make-up and effects on zombies are outstanding.
143915726X|4.0|Just finished reading this book and it was good. I didn't read it right away because I thought it would be sad. And it was a little but it was also very engrossing. Not at all girly so maybe I'll make my husband read it eventually.
0920668372|5.0|I purchase this book anytime anyone I know is has a new baby boy. It will bring tears to your eyes everytime you read it (in a good way)! This was always one of my son and my favorites. I had to read it to him every night before he went to bed.  When he moved out of the home he was welcome to take anything from his old bedroom, he decided not to take much but he took this book.  We will write the saying, \\"Love you forever, Like you for always, As long as I'm living my baby/Mother you'll be\\"  in cards to each other. It will have special meaning for anyone but even more so to any Mother/Son relationship.      I can't recommend this book enough.
B0046JZ2CW|5.0|For the final season of this show, its an amazing way to end it. Awesome songs with an awesome singer.
B002FGU4D0|4.0|My husband loved these sandals ~ great fit, easy on & off, sturdy.  However, the stitching came undone after only 2 months.  Granted he wears them a lot, working in the yard, but still (I think) they're too expensive for that to happen.
0786955716|3.0|Having bought the other dungeon tile set and enjoyed it a lot, I decided to pre-order the city set without looking into it much.  My copy arrived today, and I was excited to go through it.  Well as I did, and began punching out the different tiles.. I gradually became more and more disappointed with what actually came with it.  The title of it made it seem like it would be ideal for creating a town environment.. like the picture on the box also implies.  And maybe you can build... a.. town.  However most of the tiles you get are NOT like you see on the cover.  I was expecting roof tops, and big tiles to use as stand alone buildings.. and maybe like a town square or something. I was severely disappointed.    What you do get is seemingly random pieces of walls.. most of which seem to be great if you want to build a sort of 'cabin by the lake' as most of then are on water. You get ZERO rooftops like there are on the cover. On the flip side of them is a sewer setting, which I guess could be interesting.. but EVERY tile has sewer sludge going through it.  The big 8x8 one has like a cross of sewer sludge.. almost entirely defeating the purpose of the huge tile.. unless you like to have your PC's jumping over sludge all the time.      The buildings I will probably use somewhat to build random houses.. but I certainly will not be making any sort of town atmosphere out of it.  I may run a sewer type adventure eventually .. just to use the sewer side of them.. but creating a realistic dungeon out of it.. will almost certainly require more than is provided .. as I don't need sludge filling 80% of all my tiles.. thank you.  Other than that though.. there is some neat bridge tiles.. and a couple small market stalls which I am pleased with.. but these were just kind of like slapping a little bit of icing on a cake that already tastes bad.     If this set interests you.. and you feel like you can make what I've described work, then I would suggest it.. but I would strongly suggestto EVERYONE.. that you check this out thoroughly before picking this up. Maybe convince your friend to get it.. and see it before yourself first.. or go to a game store and see if you can convince them to open one up to see it. Anyway, I really don't think this is a 'must have' set.. or even that it creates the city feeling as it implies, so.. buyer beware.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It goes without saying, by now, that this series is excellent.  Well worth owning.<br /><br />That's the content, let's get to the Blu-ray quality!<br /><br />The quality of the Blu-ray playback is very good, but not always perfect.  At least on my player, which is a Sony Blu-ray player known for good quality playback, I can see some strange artifacts - but there are not that many of them.  In one of the episodes, there are eagles and other birds flying, and you can see flashes of their wings drawn at the wrong place and time.<br /><br />But those problems are few and far between.  This series looks amazing on blu-ray!!!  I love watching the massive waterfall scenes - definitely like being in a theatre when you're watching it on a 55\\" screen!<br /><br />I found that setting my TV to the clearest (Samsung calls it \\"smooth\\") setting, Planet Earth looks great.  This means that scenes with motion are as clear as they can be.<br /><br />Enjoy... this is a great work done in amazing HD quality.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I was initally drawn to Frozen because I am a fan of Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore, two fellow Canadians. The movie is low on action, but the suspense is what keeps the movie going.     Frozen is low budget and it's obvious from the start. The writing is mediocre at best, fortunately the acting makes up for it a little. Ashmore, Zegers, and Emma Bell have a lot of chemistry and their dialogue kept the movie going through the not so interesting parts.     You might be wondering how I could possibly give a good review to a movie where I have criticized several key aspects. The answer lies in the suspense. This movie, while unrealistic is not impossible. This adds an element of suspense that you might not find in a cheap slasher movie.     Is Frozen worthy of a purchase? Not really but if you're looking for a hour and a half of thrills, Frozen might be a good fit for you. I definitely enjoyed it.
0307277453|5.0|This is the book to give to educated friends who are starting to believe the creationist propaganda that evolution has been discredited by new findings since they got out of school. In fact, the last ten years have produced a tidal wave of evidence in support of evolution: geological, anatomical, developmental, and genetic. This book ties all those various threads of evidence together in a researcher's entertaining true-life account of his work. The only thing missing would be a chapter on the wonderful experiments of the last decade documenting evolution in the field and lab. What's best about this book is he doesn't have an axe to grind: he talks about his work and lets the evidence speak for itself. He shows how you can take what science has learned, apply it, and it really works. (IE, in how he picks his field work sites.) Highly recommended. Give it to your friends before they are too far gone to be saved.    Although I do feel a bit bad for the poor messed-up baby skates.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I watched Cloverfield on ppv a few weeks ago and enjoyed the movie. So then I decided to purchase it and I couldn't think of any other source than Amazon.com to make my purchase. Good suspenseful movie that was fond to watch with my son(18 yrs. old).
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I have all of Kid Rock's albums and Born Free is by far the best.  I've always thought that if he ever made a country/rock album it'd be great because those always seem to be popular songs on his albums.  Well he did it an i love this album.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|Well I almost bought every single one of Mariah's albums for over 15 years ever since I was at high school. I love her voice, the way she sings, everything. She's just the all time diva to me that no one can compare. With this said, you can imagine how excited I am to see her coming out with a second X'mas album after 10 years! I've been playing it in my car for a few days and I have to say she's lost it. Her voice is getting worse and worse for the past few albums and this one cannot even compare with her first X'mas album. A lot of times she's just stretching her voice too far to the point that it becomes too much for me. Don't get me wrong she's still Mariah Carey and her voice is still amazing. But if you compare this one with the first you know what I'm talking about. The voice is just not there and I feel she can't touch a lot of the high notes so she just chimes in with lots of background vocals to cover her weak voice. I really miss her old voice but I guess people's voice does go down hill as they age. But hey the song selection is pretty good and like I said she's Mariah! I still love her and will always be a supportive fan!
0316098337|1.0|The book is a very easy read however, is riddled with contradictions.  Jack's character is not consistent.  One minute talking in complete babble, the next making extremely intelligent observations well beyond a 5 year old's regular I.Q capacity. Given that the kid watched t.v for hours and hours and his mother seemed to be somewhat intelligent, the kid comes off at times to be almost mentally challenged with his confusing lingo comparable to an alien infant.  Doesn't make sense!  Over all, I found his character tedious to identify with.  The relentless breast feeding comments (over load of gimme biddy), rather detailed, was unnecessary and kinda creepy. Story line goes downhill fast for second half of the book. What's up with that tooth?  Ick!  Although very easy too read, found it rather painful to finish.  Seemed very unrealistic of how things would go down.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Unstoppable\\" is basically a story of a unmanned train out of control and the race to stop it by a young conductor (Chris Pine) and a engineer (Denzel Washington) that is about to retire.  The movie is a 90 minute thrill ride as we watch police, helicopters, news stations and all the Pennsylvania Railroad personnel try to stop it.<br /><br />The race against the clock train chase is a great thrill ride if you are in the mood for this type of movie.  It kept the audience spellbound. (Actually, all they had to do was disconnect one of the air hoses between the cars - I did this during an inspired moment while standing between two trailers connected to an unmanned truck that started rolling downhill.)
B002E9HACG|5.0|I was very critical of the \\"new\\" european sound when I listened to Start from the Dark. It got better with time, but now I don't listen to it very much with the exception of two or three tracks. I didn't like Secret Society, it's got some good tunes, but the title track produced some bad impression over me and I could never get over it.    But this album is different, it's got a lot of power! I was very surprised to hear what I thought was a \\"symphonic\\" Europe, but then I learned it was just keyboards. It's alright. But anyway, I have been listening to tracks 1-6 everyday for the last three months!! And Joey's lyrics kick some major ass! \\"Now catch that plane and get your ass... your pretty ass... over here!\\" Hahahahaha that is so cool!    This album fills me up of energy in the mornings when I go to work. Totally recommended for fans and not fans.
B0040Y7EU6|5.0|The performance is really charged, and the soloists are brilliant. When the children are ushered in to partake in the singing, it elicits are really cool vibe. To see their facial expressions, as they realize what they're participating in lends an amusing emotional charge to the performance. The comments pertaining to audio compression are pertinent, but when you get caught up in the energy and interaction of the musicians, and Rattle's communication with them, the audio issue takes a back seat. Lots of uplifting attributes are conveyed, and the performance shines. It's quite brilliant, and quite honestly, the audio is completely tolerable. Just kick back and ENJOY the show.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I'm excited to see Josh Groban coming out a new album, but after a couple days of playing it in my car, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. This is simply not his best album! His voice is still amazing but the song selection is just bad, not a lot of variety there. A few songs I even feel he shouldn't have done them at all, as they did not go well with his voice. It doesn't touch me this time and I have to blame his producer on the bad song selection. He could've done a lot better than this. The whole album is just boring and does not chime with me. I hope Josh will do better next time as I really love him and been an faithful fan for years!
B00475BUVM|1.0|My score is based on the 3D only.The 3D is next to non-existent. This was converted to 3D in post and it is the worst viewing experience I've had in 3D so far. Save your money if you are looking for new 3D content.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|For better or worse, the Dark Knight has forever changed how people look at \\"comic book\\" movies. In that vein, I liked the Losers, but wanted more realism and 3 dimensional characters. The movie is entertaining if a bit formulaic, but good for a Saturday night.
193413712X|1.0|This is the first book I have ever given a 1 star rating. I cannot believe this won the Pulitzer. About 10% of Tinkers has interesting, almost brilliant, prose. The other 90% is so overwritten and full of run-on sentences that it becomes unreadable. The book has no meaningful ending. I was actually annoyed upon finishing it.
0553805371|1.0|This was a disappointing book. I am sorry that I spent the money to get it and spent the time reading it. A clue was on the first page or two where we were told that philosophy was dead and only physicists could could now answer the hard questions. If so, Hawkings is not among those who can. The banal attempts at humor could be forgiven if the contents otherwise justified reading the book. There is no comparison in content or quality to (such as) the many books by John Gribbin, Paul Davies, or David Lindley, which basically cover the same material, plus much more. Hawkings does coin the phrase, \\"model dependent reality,\\" and then forgets it entirely in advocating particular solutions to basically unsolved problems...in-so-far as meaningful material was covered. Do not buy this book. Instead, try Russell Stannard's \\"The End of Discovery.\\"
0865479186|5.0|This was a great book that can be applied to nearly everything in life, not just medicine and alternative medicine.  Too much of what  we hear is nonsense and it is especially irritating because reality is more interesting.  I think people who like this book will also like [[ASIN:0807061425 White Coat, Black Hat: Adventures on the Dark Side of Medicine]]
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific kept me hooked all the way through.  It is very well done with superb acting!  I can't wait to see it again!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|My mom just gave me the vinyl LP of the album. Strangely, only the vinyl edition has arrived to my city in Spain, and couldn't find the standard CD or the digipak (anyway I wanted the LP edition too). I just finished listening it.<br /><br />Is it possible to hold so much happiness in a compact disc or vinyl record??. I was totally in heaven while listening to it. Annie made it again. Her personal touch to these carols isn't just amazing, but she also seems to have a magic wand to give each new song she does her special touch of quality, taste and \\"savoir faire\\".<br /><br />Did I say heaven? If not heaven, the sound experience of all the glorious vocals and CHOIRS included in almost every song makes it close to it. The end of As Joseph Was A Walking gives me chills. What choirs!! :o<br /><br />Definetly, a must-have for this Christmas season. Thank you Annie for making these upcoming days a little more warm and happy :)<br /><br />Ps: the packaging of the vinyl edition is just gorgeous. It portrays the mood of the music perfectly. This music deserves to be listened while you read the lyrics and admire the beautiful pictures in the booklet. I thank God for they still release music in physical format today, and particularly this vinyl edition, despite the dramatic situation of piracy in the music industry around the world. Thank God that they realise how much Annie's music deserves these different editions for the joy of those who love quality music-like us! :)
B001AQR39O|5.0|Package was delivered on time and as advertised. The picture on the DVD isn't really sharp. I have noticed this with other Showtime DVD's. If you have the option, go for the Blu-Ray. Still gets 5 Stars because the show is awesome.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I wasn't sure that this would be better than the regular DVD I have, but everyone is right, it is the standard by which all Blu-Rays should aspire to. Not only is the video and audio superb, it did feel like a new movie, I swear they added some scenes in, because I don't remember certain scenes, they just seemed different and I've seen it alot recently. Also to finally have all the extras from the two previous 35th and 40th versions on here, plus new stuff. I haven't even seen it all yet. This is what all movie makers should look to when they want to understand what people want. The best picture and sound and awesome extras. There is nothing else to say but buy it!
1400049628|2.0|Of course it is a useless book but i was hoping that it would be more entertaining! Book is full of repetitions. I didn't even want to finish the book.   Overall waist of money!
0316098337|5.0|A friend suggested this book to me and told me it was \\"pretty good.\\"  Understatement of the year. This book from the start grabbed my attention and continued to hold it through to the last page. The way the author writes the story through the perspective of five year old Jack forces the reader to pay close attention to the details, of which there are many and all are fabulously described. The suspense of not knowing how the characters came to be in Room propelled me forward through the first two sections where the details of Ma's abduction and captivity were pieced together.     I was completely moved by the end of this book, and felt sorry that it was over and I had to move on. I've yet to find another book that was as engrossing and enjoyable as this one, and I hope that Ms. Donoghue continues to write fantastic fiction.
1423113497|5.0|My eight year old son says this is the best book series ever.  He really enjoys it and I am actually learning more than I knew about Greek mythology.  Highly recommended.  My son's other favorite author is Bruce Coville, but we have now read all his books and was happy to find this series to continue our nightly reading.
B004BRP7R4|5.0|I will not lie: I am a Josh Groban fan.  I own Awake, Closer, Josh Groban and the \\"best\\" songs from Noel, and Josh's live album.  As soon as I discovered a new album in the works early in 2010, I found myself constantly checking Josh's website for details.  Illuminations was released without much to-do on November 15, 2010.  So, naturally, I bought it...November 15. And it has already been well listened to.  Obviously, I'm pleased with the new album.  But, lyrically and musically, how does it stand up to Josh's earlier releases?  Does this album stand alone?  Or am I being seduced by Josh's rich, lyrical voice?    Illuminations will be enjoyed by long time fans of classical/pop crossover, and will hopefully attract some new listeners as well.  Those who complained that Josh only produces \\"sweet and corny love songs\\" will find Illuminations a bit more down to earth.  Long time fans will be pleased that Josh's voice still shines in four different languages, and the thirteen songs will leave listeners satisfied but not overwhelmed.  The instrumentation seems simultaneously grander and more raw.  Do I like it?  Yes, I do.  Will you?  I don't know, but this might help:  Song Break Down:  1) The Wandering Kind (Prelude)  An instrumental piece is an interesting way for a vocal artist to start an album.  Even so, it's one of my favorite tracks.  Piano driven in the beginning, it dissolves into a pretty little piece that reeks of romantic melancholy.  Good noveling music.    2) The Bells of New York City  Pretty, romantic, sad...hey, sounds like The Wandering Kind!  Not much to it lyrically, but the music is beautiful.  Every time this song starts, I think it's something by Phillip Glass.  According to my mother (who is also a Groban fan), it's a disguised Christmas song.    3) Galileo (Someone Like You)  Unfortunately, I don't like this song at all.  The lyrics aren't really there and don't seem to match the music.  Sorry, Josh, but this one's a dud.    4) L'Ora Dell'AddioSlow and a little sad, this song show's Groban's voice nicely.  Some parts feel like lyrically cramming.      5) Hidden Away  Please don't keep your love hidden away.  A sweet song requesting a girl to show her love, instead of hiding it.  This song reminds me of You Are Loved    6) Au Jardin Des Sans-Puorquoi  It's French.  Nothing else, good or bad, sticks out about this song.    7) Higher Window  One Amazon.com reviewer complained that this song \\"sounded religious\\".  It does, but it's subtle and I can't decide what religion it's referring to.    8) If I Walk Away A \\"poppier\\" tune than some on this album.    9) Love Only Knows  Another pop influenced song.    10) Voce Existe Em Mim  Possibly the coolest non-English song I've ever heard (it's in Portuguese, if you were curious).  I love it.  Go listen to it.    11) War At Home  Sad but encouraging without sappiness.  This is one of my favorites.  Two ambiguous uses of the word \\"hell\\".    12) London Hymn  Composed of a creepy choir.  Moody and pretty, but lacks depth because, well, it lacks lyrics.    13) Straight to You Other than some lyrics-not-matching-the-music problems, this is a wonderful song.  It also has a few phrases that might make Christians uncomfortable (Heaven has denied us it's kingdom/  The saints are drunk and howling at the moon/ And the chariots of angels are colliding).    THIS REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED ON [...]
B002UXRGM0|5.0|If this series doesn't produce in you an absolute sense of wonder at the magnificence and diversity of life on our little planet, then probably nothing will. The cinematography is beautiful, the images rich and lush, the content educational and awe-inspiring, and the commentary? Well, David Attenborough is all i have to say about the commentary. To have someone who's life has been dedicated to this subject narrate such a beautifully put together series can be described as nothing short of a match made in heaven.    The BBC has once again done a magnificent job with Life. I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in nature or to people that wish to become interested in it.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|Like the description say, it get useful when you play shooting games, even when you play sports and adventure game, it gives you a better grip of the buttons
B003VIW8DK|1.0|A very good effort.... if you like Avalon, Boys and Girls, Bete Noire, Mamouna (my personal favorites) you will like this record, 4 stars for music.  Recording is TOTALLY over blown over compressed 1 star.  When will these sound engineers responsible for these HOT digital recordings all be forced to do something else for a living.  How can they not notice this style of recording RUINS dynamic range of our beloved music. Very upset we had to wait all these years for new original Ferry only to get stuck with this CRAP still happening with recordings.<br /><br />Update:  I have gotten some enjoyment listening to the CD on my Itouch, It actually sounds much better and dynamic. However, I shouldn't have to go to my Ipod to listen to a record. Still, I would really like to listen to this CD through my home system (Bryston/Magnapans) where his other records are so dynamic and transparent.
0312600844|5.0|Some very good books aren't great reads, this one is, it's like reading someone else's mail. It's funny, the plot is so similar to Lorrie Moore's \\"A Gate At The Stairs\\", chock-full of the aches and pains of being a parent, of marriage, of everyday modern life, but \\"Freedom\\" is a thousand times better.   It would be fun to have someone teach both books. Both books are full of depressing, believable, shockable events that are guaranteed to make educated white boomers squirm. It's a good example of what a difference the writing makes. It's as if Moore and Franzen attended the same Iowa Workshop, were handed the same assignment, and went at it.  Franzen's dialog is stronger, the plotting smarter, the insights more surprising and powerful. Moore's nature writing is stronger, much stronger.   Both authors write about birds. It's probably a draw when it comes to writing about birds.
0316098337|1.0|I really wanted to read this book because it sounded like an interesting topic. However upon reading the bad reviews I had to change my mind.  A child talking unrealisticly and sounds like it gets annoying fairly soon in the book.  Therefore, I have decided not to purchase it.
1572816112|4.0|Great set, great artwork. The only problems are that half the deck has \\"nameless\\" cards, very beautiful in design but confusing to the purpose of them other than to look pretty. That solved by simply separating the named cards from the nameless. The other problem is the box isn't exactly durable for travel and slowly falls apart. But the buy is worth it since you can get this same exact deck at Barnes and Nobles for $22+tax.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is based on a comic book series. Even if you have never read then you should see it. If you have read them, know that like most movie adaptations, things change and parts are left out, don't worry it is still awesome. This movie really is just a bunch of video game references, made only better by the Blu-ray video and sound quality. This being said I warn you if you have not seen this movie rent it before you buy it, you may or may not enjoy it as much as I do. Also I don't know how long it lasts but I bought this for only $25 and it comes with the Blu-ray, a DVD, and the promo code for a digital download. Great value. I do not know about the special features, I have yet to watch them.
031603438X|4.0|I still have the 45 I bought of \\"Satisfaction\\" back in the day, so this book resonated with me because as the Stones were coming of age, so I was. Informative and engrossing - this book takes you from birth and childhood to present day - and most importantly for me, as a picky reader this book doesn't DRAG. Want to know what Keith thought of Brian Jones? In here. Charlie Watts? Ditto? Want to know why you could never get \\"Gimme Shelter\\" to work on your six string guitar? Keith used open tunings then and was perfecting his use of a five string (I had no clue about that). Keith's tangles with the law? In here. Mick Taylor? get it here. Mick Jagger? Fun parts to read! Like brothers, not best friends.    I was surprised at the directness of his account, the substance abuse, the band relationships, the women in his life and his seeming \\"down to earthness\\". Very enjoyable book.    It would have gotten five stars from me, but his accounts from 1981 to present day weren't as in depth as I would have liked. While he did touch upon his music more than any Stone's work I've read - I would have enjoyed an even deeper view into that process. It in fascinating to listen to something like \\"Undercover\\" and \\"Dirty Work\\" and then compare it to \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and understand why the mix is so different and who influenced what.     Recommend this. Good holiday present for the music lover in your life!
B002VECM6S|5.0|A real family movie that isn't sappy. I'm a BIG Sandra Bullock fan and she really shines in this flick!
B00402FGE4|4.0|First off, kudos to whomever made the decision to release the first season as 1 box set and not leave it as the two half-season sets that were previously released. With that out of the way, this show has a lot of potential with some great actors, some great talent involved and a lot controversy that's hurt it ratings, I'm sure.<br /><br />I loved SG1 and Atlantis. I liked that they didn't take themselves too seriously, they were light-hearted - for the most part - sci-fi action oriented shows that had some nice humor thrown in from time to time. This show, after the success and brilliance of at least the first Season or 2 of the new BattleStar Galactica decided to tweak the SG formula and attempt to find a balance between the dark, dramatic story-telling of BSG and the action/humor elements in previous Stargate incarnations.<br /><br />Frankly, it was hit and miss for me. I liked some of the choices they made which created conflict between the different facets of the crew and some of the dark, edgier moods that were set. I liked Greer and his \\"on the edge character\\" and Young and his take on things. In fact, I liked most of the characters, the situation and setup fairly well. Much like Voyager, there's a lot of story-telling potential here to be had.<br /><br />On the other hand, the show can also devolve into too much conflict, darkness, romantic triangles/drama and just drag the show down after a while as well. Sometimes the show spends so much time trying to be edgy that is loses the determined hope and courage that balanced out the new BattleStar Galatica formula.<br /><br />I'd say that if you like Sci-Fi in general, watch the show with an open mind and don't go in thinking you'll be watching the next Stargate series or the newest BSG clone, but view this as it's own show and realize that it's still the first season and a most first seasons are for new series, it's rough in places and they're still finding their way. Whether they evolve into something good like a Nu-BSG or Farscape or Deep Space 9 or whether they devolve into something like Voyager has yet to be seen.p Space 9 or whether they devolve into something like Voyager has yet to be seen.
B003WTE886|3.0|Let me first start off by saying that I am a Taylor Swift fan.  Been a fan from the start.  I was highly anticipating this album; I thought her first two were fantastic.  I read a Rolling Stone review saying this was her best album yet and that she's only getting better; that made me even more excited to get this album.  But I'm going to disagree with Rolling Stone and say that this is actually her poorest album of the three she has released so far.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Tay's, you are familiar with her style by now.  She likes to start things off light and loose, then hit those power choruses.  Problem is, this gets a bit old.  Her songs all sound the same.  They are catchy yes...but I don't know, I guess I want a bit of variety.<br /><br />Compared to her first album, this is really different.  I think it's safe to say that Taylor Swift isn't really \\"country\\" anymore; she is more pop/pop rock.  Which I think is fine; musicians grow and change.  But...is Taylor Swift really growing as a musician?  Her live performances seem to be getting better, but lyrically, I feel like she is actually regressing.  Some of these songs sound like they were written by someone in middle school.  Listen to the song \\"Better Than Revenge.\\"  While I love the song for its catchiness...I also dislike it for its catiness.  Same goes for \\"Speak Now.\\"  Not exactly very deep lyrics.  I know that Swift likes her songs epic; she loves fairy tale references, and this continues in this album.  I think maybe her being a very open person about her personal life is affecting my review a bit.  While I love \\"Long Live\\" and some of the songs on this album, knowing what inspired them kind of...makes me not like them as much.  Once you know the inspirations for her songs...you feel like she is being a bit overdramatic; I don't know.<br /><br />All in all, this was a pleasant album, but I was hoping for something a little different and more variety.  My favorites are \\"Mine,\\" \\"Back to December\\" (acertifiably good song), and \\"Long Live.\\"  I will still continue to follow her, and hope she grows musically, and I'll still be excited to buy her next album.
0879309210|5.0|I had been researching on the net about how to install a floyd rose on a strat. I had just gotten so frustrated with trying to adjust my MiM strat's tremelo system and had tried almost every trick out there when I came across this book. All I can say is great job Dan!!!! Not only did I find detailed instruction on how to install a floyd but by following a few of Dan's few simple setup rules I now have my strat's tremelo stable enough to actually use!!  I have always done my own work on guitars and amps and effects but there is some great information here!! And I was just browsing! I do not know what the earlier versions were like but this is great! Well worth the price!!
0061997811|5.0|I am thrilled with this book. It has so many wonderful pictures of everything Potter. From the cast, crew, sets it just takes my breath away. The additional treasures are marvelous. It brings the world of Harry Potter to life as you turn each page. The artwork, footnotes, call sheets, snapshots, memories of the cast, crew and production teams all come together in a way that takes the reader into how the movies were made and feel a part of what must have been a truly remarkable experience for all involved. The forewards and paragraphs written by Daniel, Emma and Rupert are so special. It really makes me, a fan, feel a part of the world Ms. Rowling has created. Anyone who is a fan of Harry Potter would enjoy receiving this book, I'm sure. The sneak peeks it gives at the Deathly Hallows movies are tantalizing. Thank you Mr. Sibley, for pulling together a really special book. In this day and age, it reminds me of why I love paper and binding books so much. I will treasure it always.
B001S86J5S|5.0|Like some other reviewers here, this is one of those few movies that makes it's way into my DVD player just about every year. It's got just that perfect balance of comedy, drama, action and even a bit of romance that makes a movie great. The actors are all very good in their respective roles, including some great performances by Sheen, Berenger and a young Snipes. Special mention for Bob Ucker as well for his hilarious take on being the Indians announcer.<br /><br />This Blu-ray edition is a good transfer as well. The picture is crisp and shows no visual artifacts or defects at 1080p viewing. One thing that I really enjoyed on this disc was the alt. ending scenes and what the original storyline was for the owner of the Indians and how they envisioned her arc in to end up completely differently. For those who haven't seen it, the movie would have been the same up almost till the end where they revealed that she really did love the Indians, there in Cleveland and it was her plan all along to get those personal (whom she could afford) and that manager and get them to pull it together for a playoff run.<br /><br />While I don't necessarily think they should have gone with the alt. ending, I think that could have been equally as satisfying as what we got. In any case, it's a classic I'd recommend it highly.
B004CD7OCI|5.0|I'm a zombie fanatic and this new series doesn't fall short of any of my expectations. I'm sad only for the fact that there's a mere 3, or 4 at best, episodes standing between us and the season's end. I hope we don't have to wait a year at least!! The Walking Dead is well written and thought out and incorporate's just as much character building as it does moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. I visibly tense through a big portion of the episode. It's the perfect balance and I love it! Can't wait till Sunday on AMC.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|At the end of the year, we'll usually see Christmas CDs out in the market. Most of them are cliché and sounded just about the same of those we purchased several years ago.    But not this one!    Sure, only 1 out of 14 tracks is Pink Martini original, but Pink Martini's interpretation of the other 13 are unique & beautifully arranged. In addition to the \\"white Christmas\\" feeling kind of songs, I was surprised to hear \\"Congratulations - A Happy New Year Song\\", a Chinese New Year tunes from 1946, sung beautifully by China and Timothy. Another one is \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" sung in 3 languages with carnival theme & cavaquinho/ukelele in the background. The most \\"fun\\" Auld Lang Syne I've ever listened to.    This is not a typical cliché Christmas CD, but a collection of unique & beautifully arranged new year songs. If this is what you have been looking for, your search is over.     For those considering MP3/digital purchase, don't do it. Like other Pink Martini albums, many songs are sung in foreign languages. Those who don't speak French, Hebrew, Chinese, Italian, Arabic, Japanese, German, Ladino(Ocho kandelikas) and Ukranian (yes, those languages are in this CD), might not be able to fully appreciate the music with out a booklet with all original lyrics & translations that comes with the CD.     Get one for yourself, get several more for your friends & family. Spread the joy.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Just finished and I am amazed because I could not finger the bad guy until the end.  David has written another great Camel Club mystery.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I have all of Josh Grobin's albums and I never grow tired of them. I was so looking forward to this new one but it has left me with no wow factor. I have listened to it all the way through 2 times but it just is not up to speed with all his other album. I believe he made a wrong choice going with a new producer, bring back David Foster. If I could return it I would.    Glad it is time to crank up NOEL, because this new one left me feeling a bit disappointed.
B002JIEYL2|5.0|In 1973 in the UK and 1974 in America Black Sabbath released \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" an experimental album going further than the original Sabbath sound of earlier albums. The change is not unappealing but fans will know by certain songs that it is an experimental album. And I'll say right know this experiment was well worth it. It gave us some amazing songs, except the title track and \\"Sabra Cadabra\\" (which Metallica covered on their Garage, Inc.album) most won't be the usual Sabbath you would hear on classic rock stations.<br /><br />The band experimented with synthesizers on \\"Who Are You?\\" they used an orchestra on \\"Spiral Architect\\" but it doesn't mean that there isn't any heavy Sabbath on it. In fact the album has one of their heaviest and best known songs with the title-track. Because a band experiments it doesn't mean they're selling-out or they suck, it certainly isn't the case with Black Sabbath, this album is one of their best. While some may say that this album isn't good or is a sell-out I disagree, I think it's a very strong album with some really great songs that every fan should like. I understand the band is known for the doom sound and all, after all I own and love those albums but I think at that point they needed something new. They did, and that's great the orchestra parts sound really good and create an ambiance without being overused and at times sounds brilliant and adds to the music.<br /><br />And now for the songs. The title track is a monster, by far one of their heaviest songs and I can't imagine something this heavy for 1973! An absolute favorite and when Ozzy could do it, the end of the song was something epic. It's quite an album opener. Follows \\"A National Acrobat \\"is in the vein of classic sound and is a really great song, nothing much to say about this one. Then follows \\"Fluff\\" an acoustic instrumental song, kind of like \\"Orchid\\" was on Master of Reality but only longer and far better. \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" is another great song, the breakdown section sounds really good, I think most fans of Sabbath have at least heard of this song or perhaps heard Metallica's version which was also pretty good. \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" is one of the bests songs here in my opinion, everything is great, has some clever lyrics and the middle song of the part is amazing. Has to be one of Sabbath's most underrated songs. \\"Who Are You?\\" sounded futuristic back then and still does so now. It's really bizarre and reflective I don't know what to think of it, I'm not such a big fan of that one. \\"Looking For Today\\" is another superb song, overlooked but really good, it sounds like really old classic rock n' roll, because it is. \\"Spiral Architect\\" has the full orchestra fro really great results, ends the album in great way, great song.<br /><br />Those who like \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" like it A LOT. The album is grandiose, a masterwork and really is Sabbath's \\"Chef d'oeuvre\\". It doesn't have a classic doom Sabbath sound all the time, it's different and in some ways perhaps better. It remains one of my favorites in the Sabbath catalog and is one of their most ambitious releases.sounds really good, I think most fans of Sabbath have at least heard of this song or perhaps heard Metallica's version which was also pretty good. \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" is one of the bests songs here in my opinion, everything is great, has some clever lyrics and the middle song of the part is amazing.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|As a member of the One2One Network, I received a copy of the cd Featuring Norah Jones.  I have never really listened to Norah Jones' music before but after listening to this CD, I am now a fan.  This CD provides some soulful and heartfelt music.  After a long day at work, I put this CD on and quickly found myself in a relaxed and mellow state.  It was great to hear other artist like Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and the Foo Fighters with Norah Jones.
0316789720|5.0|I bought this for my son (6 1/2) who saw it first in his Montessori classroom. He became obsessed with the book. He can follow the simple step by step instructions, and the results please him very much. Even for me who never really learned how to draw this book is great. I didn't know it was so easy to draw a frog, a car, you name it.. the steps focus on the main characterics of each object and the outcome is a simple but very realistic drawing. Love it and recommend it highly!

B0023P1D8S|5.0|With two albums under their belts, Black Sabbath evolved from a good local act to stunning band and was staring to get some recognition after Paranoid. Their third album Master of Reality was to be released in 1971, and to this day it's still one of my favorite albums of all time and one of Sabbath's greatest. The first self-titled album was a strong bluesy, really dark and heavier than anything else out there, then they got known with Paranoid which is considered one of the best and most influential album of all-time. But in my opinion if there's one album that you can get tired of hearing of all that Sabbath has done, it has to be Paranoid. I like Master of Reality better, the songs are just better to me and it's something you don't always hear on classic rock radio like Paranoid or Iron Man. Besides I think the album represents the band at best, as lords of doom. In 2009 Master of Reality was remastered and now has a better sound along with a second disc of extra tracks which should be enough to make any Black Sabbath fan happy.<br /><br />Master starts out with the epic opening of Sweet Leaf, with Tony Iommi choking on a joint(it's truly how it begins) and the songs just kicks in with the nice slow riff, it truly is one of Sabbath's best songs. I will also mention it was written about Ozzy's leaf of choice(I guess you know which one). After Forever is one of the best things the band did, if you read the lyrics more closely you'll see that its Sabbath saying they believe in god! It might sound weird with Sabbath's reputation at the time, but they wanted to get the satanic thing behind them at the time. \\"Would you like to see the pope on the end of the rope? Do you think he's a fool? Well I've seen the truth and I've changed my ways\\" just great lyrical stuff. Then Embryo follows which is a nice and different, 28 seconds acoustic song, it's a great introduction to another classic, Children of the Grave. Another personal fav, Tony's chug-a-chug riff, Ozzy's vocals, Geezer's bass playing and Bill's drumming altogether make this song [pretty fast considering the time and make the song special.<br /><br />Orchid is a more complete instrumental; it lasts longer than Embryo and sounds better with gentle acoustic guitar. Lord of this World is a slow rocker like Sweet Leaf, just another great song, and much like the rest of the album really dark. The ending is fantastic with the song getting faster with a great drum beat and another amazing solo. Solitude follows; it's a slower more emotional song. I feel the song is beautiful, it seems weird but I think it's truly a unique song and something very different and well done for Black Sabbath, plus the guitar work is amazing, not much of a riff, just melody. It's not a song they played live often (if they ever did), but I appreciate it and like to hear this from one of my favorite band. The name fits the song really well as it pretty much describes the whole song in one word. Into The Void is the epic here, at 6:11 it's the longest song on the album.Another excellent song not much to say except it's highpoint.<br /><br />The second disc is like a holy grail of unreleased and alternate versions.I mean, Lord Of This World with Piano, slide guitar and double voice tracked? Sounds terrific let me tell you! Weevil Woman '71 is best described as a reworking of the original Evil Woman track found on Sabbath's debut, it's different and it's quite simply a shame they couldn't make more out of it for the song to be included on Master of Reality.For any hardcore Sabbath fans this second disc justifies the purchase of this remaster, and rightfully so! Plus this remaster's sound sounds very close to vinyl therefore making it the best version of the album available on CD.<br /><br />Master is definitely one of my favorite Sabbath albums simply because it's just everything the band is; it's dark, heavy, and it's edgy. It's really a masterpiece and a classic album. The fact that it's got so many classicand that all the songs are great and unique combined with the musical abilities of the individuals who perform it just make that good, that timeless. Black Sabbath left their mark in music and this is one of their best albums, a must have for any rock n'roll(heavy metal or whatever you call it) fan or Sabbath fan.This remaster with improved sound and a fantastic second disc makes this 5 stars all the way.t and unique combined with the musical abilities of the individuals who perform it just make that good, that timeless.

B000CPH9I4|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It's what I've always been looking to listen to.  Love these Irish folk songs.  Wife reckons I was Irish in my previous life and I'm Chinese!  Hope they'll make some of more of these type of music rather than the poppy stuff.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|Compared to her last, this is a pretty disappointing album. A few good songs, but too many of those slow \\"emotional\\" songs that have been trendy in R&B for a while now. I was pretty excited when I got this, but after listening through I definitely prefer her previous.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I watched the Extended Collector's Edition last night on Blu-Ray and in about 4 scenes, right around when the chapter switches, the chronological process bar randomly popped up on the screen for a few moments.

B0041CGP02|4.0|Bon Jovi has been around for over 25 years now and their music has changed with them, this compilation is a statement of that. It's hard to please everyone and evolve in the music industry because there will always be fans who will say \\"your old stuff was better\\", to a certain degree I feel that way but I enjoyed just about each album the band has released and think the \\"new\\" sound isn't bad at all. It's great to see Bon Jovi still performing and releasing new music after more than 25 years in the music business, that's something alright. A 1 star review that claims Bon Jovi sucks or that they are the worst band ever doesn't explain much and isn't helpful to those figuring out whether or not to buy this new greatest hits album, I'd look for a more objective review if you're visiting this page. Someone who hates the band will not make a helpful recommendation, if you hate the band go on a forum and complain about it. Me? I'd rather let the music do the talking...<br /><br />The single disc edition of Greatest Hits has 17 songs, including two new ones, while the double disc edition has 28 songs, including four new tracks. The first disc (which is the single edition of Greatest Hits) is the better one as it features classic. That doesn't mean disc two is bad, not at all, there are 12 songs on this disc and some good ones as well. I was surprised to see that Jon Bon Jovi's Blaze of Glory was included; however there is no other solo material on this collection. It's unfortunate that Greatest Hits ignores two albums completely, 1985's 7800 Degrees Fahrenheit (\\"In and out of love\\" would've been the obvious choice) and 2002's Bounce (\\"Misunderstood\\" would have been a great selection), at least one song of each of those albums should have been included in order for it to be more complete. It's not that big of a deal but to a huge fan of the band it might be. New Jersey is the album with the most songs represented here with a total of 5 (which is a little too much if you ask me).<br /><br />The 4 new songs are a nice touch it gives something for the longtime fans who collect everything (even if I wish they would just release the new songs individually). The single \\"What Do You Got?\\" features a modern Bon Jovi with interesting lyrics and a different sound from their trademark 1980's sound, but I think \\"This Is Love This Is Life\\" is the strongest out of the new songs; it has vintage Bon Jovi qualities to it, nice sound and lyrics plus an undeniably catchy chorus to it.  \\"The More Things Change\\" sounds like something that would be on The Circle or a recent Bon Jovi album, definitely not a bad song, pretty good actually. The same could be said of \\"No Apologies\\", it's not all that different from the material found on The Circle but it's a good song.<br /><br />Otherwise there isn't much to complain about. No, not everyone's favorite songs are on Greatest Hits but it was to be expected with this collection. They included the obvious choices (Runaway, You Give Love A Bad Name, Wanted Dead Or Alive, Bad Medicine and so on, along with more recent songs like It's My Life, (You Want To) Make A Memory and We Weren't Born To Follow) and the hits and singles and it gives a pretty fair overview of Bon Jovi's career which is what buyers should be looking for. In terms of content most of this compilation is fine in my opinion. They even included two songs from last year's The Circle, I was not that big a fan of the album but I liked it for what it was and it's nice to see that it is also represented on Greatest Hits. The 1994 compilation Crossroads is an alternative but I still think this new greatest hits is better (the single disc edition is cheaper and has most of the songs on Crossroads). Good choice of songs, 4 new songs and two discs; not perfect but very good greatest hits album sure to please new fans or those who own no Bon Jovi.4/5The 4 new songs are a nice touch it gives something for the longtime fans who collect everything (even if I wish they would just release the new songs individually).

B002JVWQSW|5.0|I hadn't seen a single episode when I took a chance and purchased season 1 of Modern Family on DVD, based on the large number of favorable reviews.  I already had quite a few favorites on DVD like Dexter, Desperate Housewives, Glee, Numb3rs and many others.  Modern Family goes to the front of the line!  I'm not complaining, I only wish the episodes were even longer and there were more seasons already out on DVD to watch!  I'm loving this show and I'm expecting it to keep coming back, season after season! :)
0471267554|1.0|I too was excited about reading a book that would make a good argument for a higher fat/lower carb diet -- like the way I eat now.  Instead, like other reviewers have said, the book makes huge leaps and conjectures from very little prehistoric evidence.  His recommendations are too specific with too many promises to cure every ill known to man.  To link our every illness on eating sandwiches is to blame the victim once again.  If only we ate this way, or hadn't eaten that we wouldn't have gotten cancer/arthritis/colitis, etc.<br /><br />His book is no different than the racist Macrobiotics Diet book by Michio Kushi.  Beans are the Third World protein...Hmmm.  Only certain groups of people in the world could afford to eat the Paleo diet -- free-range, grass-fed, wild-harvested -- all code for EXPENSIVE and exclusive. Anytime an author sets out exact amounts and types of food and claims one can avoid cancer or Alzheimer's through his diet, he has given himself away as a charlatan.
B002JIEYLC|5.0|After Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Black Sabbath returned with 1975's Sabotage with less of the orchestral arrangements from the previous album and returning to more straightforward rock. After the experiments from the last album they returned to more straightforward rock. Sabotage is known to be brilliant and to most fans it's the last of the great classic Sabbath with Ozzy albums. To me it's a classic and one of the best albums by Black Sabbath. But there's also a common judgment that Sabotage is one of Sabbath's worst efforts (with Ozzy) and that after SBS the band lost it for the 70s. Well, as you might have guessed I do not agree with this statement and believe that Sabotage is one of the band's strongest albums and holds up pretty well to the other ones. I like it a lot because it's not an overheard one like say Paranoid, it's different but still very good and brings something different and heavier.<br /><br />The album opens with Hole In The Sky, a bombastic shocker of an opener, a seemingly philosophical song and one of my favorite songs on the album and I feel it's one the best things the band ever did. It's also a song that Ozzy wouldn't sing often after the album's tour as its too high for him. Then Don't Start (Too Late) follows, an acoustic instrumental that we are used to get from the band by this point in their history. It's not bad but I think that the other instrumental song, Supertzar is so epic here that it makes this one forgettable. Symptom Of The Universe is next, highly memorable for being one of the first true heavy metal riff, the song is just amazing as it gets to an acoustic part and then gets back to the heavy riff topped with Ozzy's screaming vocals. Megalomania is not cited often when Sabbath is talked about, it's the band's shorter songs that take the credit, but this is something else. It's a masterpiece that is hard to describe, it's great and then it gets even better as it switches to another tempo and an evil voice sings with Ozzy, then there's the solo and then it gets even faster until the conclusion, you're just left sitting there realizing you've heard something amazing.<br /><br />Thrill Of It All is a slow rocker, it's not one the high points of the album but it's still pretty good. Supertzar is an epic instrumental talked about earlier, it's just so mysterious with the choir at the beginning and you just have the riff and some percussion at some places and that's it. You just have this intriguing title and that's it. Am I Going Insane (Radio) is Ozzy's showcase, it's him alright as he sings \\"tell me people, am I going Insane?\\" it's a great song you get a feeling here of what he would be doing in his solo career. Some may be intrigued by the (Radio) mention, it's actually British slang.<br /><br />Sabotage is one of my favorite Sabbath albums for many reasons; it's heavier in some ways, epic, it's got some much underrated songs and just some the best stuff they've ever done. It's just underrated, one may think that. Let it be known, I think the band hit their creative peak with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (maybe before) but Sabotage is in no way boring, underachieving or a repeat of past work: it stands strong on its own. As someone already said, it might be the most consistent album Sabbath has done (at least during the Ozzy era), every song has something good to offer. So if you thought the band was over at this point I suggest you give it a listen and we'll see.the solo and then it gets even faster until the conclusion, you're just left sitting there realizing you've heard something amazing.    Thrill Of It All is a slow rocker, it's not one the high points of the album but it's still pretty good. Supertzar is an epic instrumental talked about earlier, it's just so mysterious with the choir at the beginning and you just have the riff and some percussion at some places and that's it. You just have this intriguing title and that's it. Am I Going Insane (Radio) is Ozzy's showcase, it's him alright as he sings \\"tell me people, am I going Insane?\\" it's a great song you get a feeling here of what he would be doing in his solo career.

0765326353|4.0|Magnificent and magnormous! I know, that word isn't real, but then neither is this book. It is full of make believe. Crammed to the hilt, really. That is both good and bad.<br /><br />I love epic fantasy. I truly do. The Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire are fantastic pieces. In my youth: the Belgariad, Mallorean, Riftwar Saga, The Foundation series and more were massive staples of literary enjoyment. The larger the series (and of course the books) the better. Brandon Sanderson's new series: The Stormlight Archive promises to be HUGE. I've seen Sanderson grow in his writing and it certainly shows in this new piece of work. It does have its share of problems though.<br /><br />First off, it's 1008 pages long! That's a lot to bite off in a first book, and worrisome for how long it may take to get through, but it read quickly (relative to its size) and I enjoyed almost all of it (except for the resulting neck pain from lugging it around each and every workday).<br /><br />It starts with a view of the far past, where some truly epic foundation stones are set for a fascinating story in this alternate universe. Then you are pulled along on a grand journey that delivers.<br /><br />Humanity lives in the strange world of Roshar where highstorms literally scour the landscape on a frequent basis, creating plant and animal life that is almost too hard to believe. Much of mankind is also strange: a myriad of races with a rainbow of skin, eye and hair colors. The distinct races and their different kingdoms are in fact too much. There is so much variety and such a large swathe of detail that the things that are most important occasionally get lost.<br /><br />In this world, Stormlight is both an energy source for magically powered machines and a source of magic to be drawn upon. One of its most compelling uses is to power the Plate of powerful knights capable of astounding feats of strength and destruction. Despite the varied uses it is clear that few survive in this era that are true masters of the energies of Stormlight and there is more to come as Sanderson doles out the details of his magical creation.<br /><br />Character is a strong point in this book, with some truly strong scenes of emotion and incredible trials. Like most epic fantasy, there's a lot of them and three in particular: the thief, the lord and the surgeon-turned-soldier. Their conflicts are real, and they are complicated. Rarely do they make a decision that doesn't have some sort of ramification. This gives great depth to the story and life. The world of Roshar has its problems and each of these characters are doing their part to try and make it a better place, each in their own ways. Each of them succeed as they fail, pushing themselves to their limit, ready to quit but persevering anyway.<br /><br />One complaint, is an important reveal towards the end of the book. It is neither well set up or convincing in its reveal. I won't say what it was only that it was irritating reading it. It is just one of those things that the writer forces upon the reader without ample reason and has the feel of a \\"darling\\" that needed to die (Writing Excuses reference). The perpetrator of this fallacy is both far too learned, and wise to make such a callous assumption. I can only hope there is a better reason in the next installment. But this is just one moment of annoyance amongst many of enjoyment. Many reveals in the book will have you reading with a jaw dropped halfway to the floor.<br /><br />All in all, a worthy read for epic fantasy lovers that love expansive stories and huge books. There are moments of heart-wrenching emotion and edge-of-your-seat thrills. 4 stars!<br /><br />I might, however, advise petitioning Tor for a wheeled version to make toting it around easier, or you can always get the e-book version, I suppose...<br /><br />Check out my blog for more reviews, fantasy and sci-fi goodness and my own journey to fantasy publishing.

B00382X4XC|5.0|In 1979,After Ozzy left Black Sabbath,Dio became the new singer of the band giving the band a new life and new energy.You can feel right from the opening song \\"Neon Knights\\",that something about them has changed.Some though,are quick to criticize Dio and of course those people just want Ozzy and nothing else,if you have an open mind then you will probably like Sabbath-Dio,if not then just don't like it that's all.Ronnie James Dio,has an amazing voice and in my opinion,he's a way better singer than Ozzy and can really bring a song to life.I can understand those people because I was once like them,believing that Ozzy was the only true singer of the band but once I heard them with Dio it all changed.I think that Sabbath was great with Dio,maybe not as much as they were with Ozzy,but Dio certainly had his place in Sabbath and the albums he did with the band are memorable and classics ones with some great songs. This 2010 remaster of H & H is a nice upgrade for the fans who already owned the album because the sound on this re-release is the closest to vinyl as has been said before AND the extra disc of 7 live songs from Hartford is a nice touch. Both are good enough reasons to re-purchase this fantastic album.<br /><br />One big change on the album is of course the fact that lineup is now consisting of Toni Iommi,Geezer Butler,Bill Ward and Ronnie James Dio,but another change is that Iommi's guitar playing has changed in the transition of Ozzy to Dio.He plays awesomely in my opinion and comes out with some rocking riffs that really stick to your head.In a way Dio is much more of a musician while Ozzy is a singer.This album has much more melody than previous albums and its a masterpiece that can sometimes be overlooked.The lyrics can also be more profound and real,they are different than in their previous album,you'll notice.Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio is still Black Sabbath to me, lets make this clear.<br /><br />The albums starts out with one of the best metal songs ever in my opinion,\\"Neon Knights\\" which has a great riff by Iommi and at this point already you know you're in for something special.\\"Children Of The Sea\\" is considerably slower and more of a rocker.Dio sounds amazing on this one and its really an emotional song about courage,one of the best songs on the album.\\"Lady Evil\\" is another great song with a good chorus and there is really nothing to complain about.I often have some of the lyrics in my head,\\"Lady evil,evil,she's a magical,mystical woman...\\" its got a good groove what can I say?\\"Heaven And Hell\\",the title track is amazing starting out slow and gradually becoming more intense.The solo in this song is amazing!A highlight of the album.\\"Wishing Well\\" is pretty good,there's nothing really special,the song is just great.\\"Die Young\\" is excellent no less.\\"Walk Away\\"'s the song I don't really like,it's good at what it is,no more.\\"Lonely Is The World\\" is a good bluesy closer but nothing exceptional here.<br /><br />Dio was the best choice for a replacement singer,some bands after loosing such important members as Ozzy was decide to quit but sometimes continue and in some case do very well and Sabbath was one of those bands.Everything is top notch,the songs,the playing,everything is there and the result of \\"Heaven And Hell\\" is a masterpiece and one of the best Sabbath has ever done.I can't say it enough,this album is a must-have and it should be in any serious rocker's collection. This is one of the highlights of Dio's career (and Sabbath's!), RIP metal fans will never forget you.

0316069485|4.0|The characters of Mickey Haller (criminal defence attorney) and Harry Bosch (Detective) are both well known to readers of Michael Connelly's other books.<br /><br />But I was a little worried as I hadn't ready any of his books before and wondered if I wouldn't really know the characters by not reading them before. But I needn't have been concerned as Connelly managed to give just the right amount of back story for each so that, by the end of the book, I felt I knew them both pretty well.<br /><br />The first part of the novel deals with the build up to the trial, the story of Jessup's conviction and the reasons for the re-trial, the talking to the witnesses, choosing the jurors, all of which made an interesting and steady build up to the trial.<br /><br />The last part then deals with the trial itself which I thought was the most compelling and fascinating, I love court room dramas and this did not disappoint.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the way the story alternated chapters between the lst person of Mickey Haller and the 3rd person of Harry Bosch. I really got a feel of how each character was thinking and of how the characters thought of each other. It really brought a new dimension to the story.<br /><br />This was a storyline that kept me intrigued throughout with intelligent characterisations, simply told explanations of the justice system, a couple of twists and turns scattered about, and is one of the best court room dramas I have read for a long time. Thoroughly enjoyable!

B0040JHWKS|5.0|Bruce delivers big time! Imagine... The Beatles found extra tracks for Revolver; another side of the moon was discovered by Pink Floyd; U2 planted another Joshua Tree. Sounds impossible, doesn't it? Well, the Boss had arguably the best three album run of the seventies (The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town) and now he's just dropped a fourth masterpiece from that peak period thirty-something years later. These twenty one tracks are not b-sides,Darkness cast-offs or novelties. They are the most thrilling and  eclectic bunch of songs you'll hear in 2010. It sounds like Bruce's London Calling.<br /><br />Disc one begins with Racing in the Streets ('78). I'm getting chicken skin just thinking about this track. Bittan's piano marches us into an electric track that sounds as if it could have been recorded for Born to Run. The songs are so strong on this disc that the one track I was really excited about hearing, Because the Night, is not one of the better songs (and it's great!) Candy's Boy brings out a sensitive side to that wild girl that we could have never imagined on Darkness.<br /><br />Now I was fully prepared to be let down by the second disc. I thought Bruce had obviously front loaded this package. Was I wrong. If anything the second disc is more upbeat and melodic,revealing Springsteen's fifties and sixties influences. By the time the refrain on the second track, Ain't Enough for You kicked in, I felt like clapping right along. Also, the second disc contains the best track on the album, The Promise. It's as good as anything Springsteen has recorded (man, is that saying something!)<br /><br />Okay, I'll take a breath and let the hurricane of hyperbole die down to a steady rain. Here's the facts: An iconic artist has released twenty two (surprise, there's a hidden track!) songs from his peak period. If you've ever turned up Born to Run when it comes on the radio or witnessed the live miracle of the Boss in concert, you owe it to yourself to buy this gift of an album. Merry (early) Christmas!rself to buy this gift of an album. Merry (early) Christmas!
0061714372|4.0|I would say this book is pretty good. It's a mixed bag. If you want to know about Dave's life story i'd still pick it up. It tells about his early/family life, has pics of his early years, his family, Metallica and himself, his drug addiction, etc...<br /><br />I knew a lot of this stuff but there was some in here that I didn't. Lots of stuff about his drug addictions... Not enough about the music, in my opinion. If he didn't have the drug addiction to talk about I kind of wondered how long the book would actually be.<br /><br />He did have a hard life but he was very successful, despite his problems, and that's to be admired, but all the things he did kinda surprised me, also his indecisiveness about his religion, god and political leanings.<br /><br />The impression I got at times was that he was basically saying \\" I wish I was still in Metallica\\" and I wish I was still in the band and never kicked out. Tells about the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame ordeal and how he was kicked out of the band unjustly and IF ONLY... I was under the impression he wanted to go back to Metallica and would if he could. I was also under the impression that when he formed Megadeth he put all that behind him and was now confident he was the best and what he did was good enough cause it sure was for his fans.. But Dave, he still harbors resentments about the whole thing. He can't rewrite history yet I sensed that he wish he could've.<br /><br />All these issues with Metallica.. Yet Dave is not blameless. When alls said and done, no one was blameless. They all did things that may have contributed to this whole break up. I say it was just meant to be, accept it.<br /><br />Besides that, I really think you'll enjoy the chapters containing one song similarity between Metallica and Megadeth.<br /><br />Overall...It was enjoyable to read about his life- it was a candid look at the life of a talented musician with drug problems.
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|I'm not a big fan of films the Disney studios make for direct-to-TV or DVD and truly feel they've slipped on their major releases in the past decade or so.  This one was truly a suprise!  I got it for the kids, a 7 year old boy and his 4 year old sister.  They really enjoyed the film and I, too, enjoyed it.  While the CG work is a bit \\"iffy\\" or \\"off\\" at times it's never bad enough to pull you out of the story, which is one of the better ones I've seen lately from Disney.  Of course they have the obligatory songs, but they're not too distracting.  I don't recall *any* pop references which is a delight as it will help keep the film from feeling dated in a few years.<br /><br />The quality of the image and sound is very good.  Of course being all digital you don't have the anomolies of film: grain, specks, streaks, etc.<br /><br />Overall a good release from Disney in a nice package at a reasonable price.  I'm sure I'll be seeing this one more than a few times over the next few months. I'm happy to say that's not a bad thing for this release.

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Born free is a catchy album. This album will be disapointing only for those that likes only the Rap-Rock side of Kid Rock but those with an open mind and those who likes classick rock,southern rock and country will love this album! From the already classic anthem \\"Born Free\\" to the bluesy \\"Rock on\\", the catchy \\"Purple sky\\" or the future radio friendly and next single \\"Care\\" this album will blown you away! This is an album that has to be listened from start to finish!

There were hundreds of stickers of all sorts and more importantly, for my nephew, it had a lot of Star Wars related character stickers as well as from other movies he has enjoyed watching such as the Harry Potter movies, the Indiana Jones movies and others.  He enjoyed getting this along with the Big Nate books I got him.

B003YWUTJI|3.0|Norah Jones - ...Featuring Norah Jones    I really enjoy Norah Jones voice, and her new release, \\"...featuring Norah Jones\\" does not disappoint.  She has some very interesting collaborations, everyone from country music's Dolly Parton to rapper Q-Tip.  Her diversity is apparent, as she flows from one genre of music to another seamlessly.  It starts off a little slow, but it picks up a little about halfway through.  My personal favorites are:  \\"Ruler of My Heart\\" with Robert Rundolph; The Dirty Dozen Brass Band,   with the type of vocals you would expect, and Soon the New Day with Talib Kweli.  I would recommend this CD as a nice low-key alternative to holiday music this Christmas.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this cooler for a Core i3 540 in an HTPC/gaming PC. Because the PC is in my living room, it needs to be very quiet, but I wanted to be able to overclock the CPU. With the stock cooler, even a mild overclock caused the fan to become audible. Because of limited airflow, I knew I'd need a beefy cooler even for a modest overclock.     The CM Hyper 212 has totally delivered. I'm currently running at 3990 MHz, and the fan is completely inaudible. Temperatures are lower now than with the stock cooler at stock clocks. As I find time, I'll see where the upper limit is with this setup, but I'm completely satisfied with the performance of this cooler. It's unbeatable at the price.    As for installation, I thought it was very straightforward. I referenced the illustrations to make sure I was aligning things correctly, but really there are only so many ways it could go. The key points are:  1. alignment of the cooler relative to RAM slots  2. alignment of screws/bolts to backplate and locking plate. There are three positions available for each, and you need to reference your chipset type to know which positions to use  3. alignment of locking plate relative to alignment pin. It can only go one way. Well, two ways, given that you could turn it 180 degrees.    Once installed, it's very firmly seated, which is much better than the stock Intel push pins.
B0035G9ABG|2.0|Compare this album to the other two and you'll see that the songs in Plastic Beach sound like they came from another band and it might as well have been.<br /><br />Ever since I saw the video Clint Eastwood one night I fell in love with the band and unlike most people, I didn't jump on the Demon Days bandwagon. Know why? BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SOUND ANYTHING LIKE HOW THEY WERE! Luckily Demon Days for its total turn around was actually a decent album but their first album still remains their greatest. BTW, when is Del tha Funkee Homosapien coming back Albarn?!<br /><br />And with that said, I encourage anyone to listen to their first album and then this one and see how they have nothing in common, thus alienating a huge fanbase. I was utterly dissapointed and will not be spending any money on this album. The hip-hop element was great in the first album, diminished but still notable in Demon Days, and now seems non-existent in Plastic Beach. I'm listening to their album and it really has no catchy tune and in all honesty most of the time Albarn sounds like he was forced to sing and has no emotion in his work.<br /><br />A real shame and I can't understand how people are giving this such a high rating when all the songs sound so dull. I've read a number of reviews saying that you need to let the album wear on you. Just sounds like forcing yourself into a lie really.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I usually never write reviews but am making an exception for this one. Because I have to ask the other reviewers. Seriously guys what really is all the fuss about.     Let me put the record straight here. Life narrated by David Attenborough is retailing for 42 dollars at amazon.com whereas this version narrated by Oprah is retailing for 17 dollars. The box set contains 4 discs and about 11 hours of high definition stuff making it the cheapest blu-ray at amazon.com. Also for the 25 dollars you save by ordering this version; you can buy 2001 space odyssey, master and commander and Dark Knight. So I ask again, Guys what is the fuss all about???    The narration of Oprah Winfrey is just different to David. In my opinion, David while being a terrific narrator puts my children to sleep whereas Oprah has a more of a story telling aura to her. I could never make my child watch Planet Earth (narrated by David) however he gladly watches Life with Oprah narrating. Plus, Oprah is not quarter as bad for adults as people have penned down here.     To sum it up David's voice might be better for adults but Life at 17 dollar a pop with oprah's voice is just a steel. So go ahead order this version and with the money you save order some other terrific blu-rays out there. My recommendations for cheap blu-rays for terrific audio and video quality include:    1. Master and Commander  2. The Dark Knight  3. 2001 a space odyssey  4. Day after tomorrow  5. Bolt  6. Casino Royale  7. Live Free or Die Hard  8. Spider Man 3  9. Black Hawk Down  10. Iron Man.
B002VPE1OS|4.0|Pros - easy to apply and remove, fits the screen nicely, no glare whatsoever, touch features on the phone are not inhibited  Cons - very grainy view of the screen, and the feel of film is rather like touching the non-sticky side of tape
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the first season of True Blood. There was only a couple of scenes that I had some difficulty watching. The beginning romance between Sookie and Bill is just wonderful to watch. The actors all play their charactors so well, and I felt surprised so often while watching season one. Just when you think you know and understand a charactor you get surprised, and I love that when I watch a series or a movie. I truly recommend True Blood the first season!
B003L77G06|5.0|If you watch this show and can't manage to laugh or even crack a smile, then I recommend a sense of humor transplant.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Every positive review you've read so far is on the money. I can't remember having more fun watching a movie than I did watching Kick-Ass! It is in turns serious, thoughtful, ridiculous, disturbing, hilarious, and awesome. The overall package is a film that makes you laugh, cheer, marvel at an unexpected turn, and laugh some more. The premise is easy enough; just read the movie blurb and you get it. But the film is so much more, and goes way beyond expectations.  If you aren't grinning ear to ear by the time the credits role, you need to see a doctor. Kick-Ass is one of the most outrageously enjoyable movies I've ever seen. One caveat- if the idea of a young girl killing a whole lot of people in gruesome ways (albeit with a tongue planted firmly in cheek) is off-putting, then don't watch this movie. Otherwise, if you get that the whole movie is a juxtaposition of super-hero cliches onto a real life stage, you relish every minute of Kick-Ass. This is a Must-See.
1401227821|5.0|amazing book, and the most interesting part; adam hughes, because he shares words and jokes about the process, the work, and the joy of his illustrations; a most have!
B00005JLR8|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  So moving.  So glad I found it on the Amazon site as could not find it elsewhere.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|This was about some woman with a personality disorder who has a hard time holding onto her job because of it. She makes a sexual arrangement with a co-worker per doctors orders. The couple flies to Alaska together. This is where the story goes off-track. There is a lot of confusion and misunderstandings between the gentlemen's family over this woman. They're on and off boats and planes many times. It is hard to make heads or tails out of much of this film. I think it would be best suited as an art house feature.
B004132I20|5.0|Better than Jeremy Brett's Sherlock? Benedict Cumberbatch certainly is as good, he has the character of Sherlock down. He's good. Really good.     Sherlock Holmes in the 21st Century - using cellphones and Googlemaps and GPS - the show is witty and clever, and exciting, and funny.... I hope they make lots more in this series, I'll watch them all.

My fav is last kiss but I can actually listen to the entire cd over and over again without it getting annoying. If you don't have any of her cd's make this the first one you get.

B003E6K1VK|4.0|I've recently been using my iPad to make music, and figured my in-ear headphones weren't cutting it anymore.  I felt I was missing a lot of the nuances that I knew I was producing in the music.  BTW, my in ear are Etymotic 6i Isolator Earphones, so I'm not coming from horrible sound by any stretch of the means. So I did a lot of research(thank you amazon) and I ended up purchasing a pair of  new Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Studio Pro Headphones.  Amazon linked the Fiio E7's as what others were purchasing and I had no clue what they did so I checked them out.  Ended up watching a video review By David \\"Deckhand Davy\\" Zamora (by the way I highly recommend you watch it also) and I was sold.  I never knew what a different a little amp could do so I was willing to give it a try.    Essentially this is a little amp for your headphones.  Plain and simple, the electronic devices of today (ipads, mp3 players, phones, etc.) can power smaller earphones just fine, but struggle to output the power needed to drives a quality set of headphones.  the E7 essentially converts a straight digital signal from these devices and 'amplifies' that signal so that the nicer headphones sing like and angel.    The set-up is rather easy and you can fine tune the signal a bit with the built in equalization that it provides.  Although I do find the menu set-up not too user friendly and a tad confusing.  The Screen on the E7 is bright and very easy to see (omled it think). Onto the sound...    I wanted a base to compare to so upon setup I plugged in my ATH-M50 headphones directly into the iPad and started to play some tracks that were musical, but bassy at times.  Great test tracks.  I have to say I was a little underwhelmed by the stock setup, but also in all fairness, had not let the headphones break in for 24 hours, which is highly recommended.  So I plugged in the headphones to the E7, and then the E7 into the ipad.  Immediately I noticed a difference in the depth of the test track and how the nuances of the track were more predominant.  Better, but again I was a bit underwhelmed.  So wanting to break in the E7 and the Headphones at the same time, I put together a loop playlist and let them stroll for 24hr.  Man what a difference a day makes :)    Simply put, a night and day difference in the sound.  I'm sure there are better combinations out there, meaning nicer headphones and DAC's, but for the money, the E7 is hard to beat!
B001HC8516|3.0|I've been ruminating on whether to write a review for this book since I read it last month. This book drives its point home, and years of episodes from my love life and friends' love lifes come into focus with clarity and a raw, naked exposure. However, the truth did not set me free. In particular, the section discussing the fact that there are not enough good men out there for all women hurt deeply. The authors then argue that although there are not enough good men out there, it is better to be alone than in a bad relationship. However, I did not come to the same conclusion. The authors also have made it clear to me when a man is \\"not that into me.\\" Before, I would not have made this assumption. In the past, I probably wasted a lot of time on relationships with guys who really weren't that \\"into me\\" thinking that the relationships were emotionally deeper than they actually were.<br /><br />I read \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" immediately after ending an abusive relationship. Since then, I have started trying to date again and meet new guys. The difference is that now I can see that they are just not that into me. I'm in my 30s, which is the age in which I am competing for the attention of guys my age against girls in their 20s. My ex was gorgeous, intelligent, and attentive, and despite being absolutely horrible some of the time, he WAS into me. Too much, in fact.<br /><br />Combined with reading the book and the realization of just how many guys are not into me, I regret the breakup. It is a hard thing to swallow, and I think I would rather settle than be alone. So much for healthy attitudes. I think it would have been better if I had still been under the delusion that guys are into me.<br /><br />It's kind of like when you're a kid and find out that Santa Claus and unicorns aren't real. It's part of growing up to know it was all a fantasy, but in the end it also makes you more jaded, doesn't it?
B00006RAKP|4.0|The concert is a very recommended one. It has the most of Elton's hits. The sound is great, especially in the DTS format.  The stereo is also not bad, but not like the DTS.  However, the video is not that good, when the DVD video can have much better quality.  Overally it is a great release. Also available on Blu-ray.
1401323952|5.0|I have been a fan of Nigella's for many years and collect all her cookbooks. This one is great.  What I love about it is that so many of her recipes are great for an everyday family meal, but also great for entertaing as well. Another plus for me is that as a mother of 6 children, its nice to see recipes that includes large enough portions for a larger family or can be easily adapted to feed more than two. Definatley a great buy!
1439107955|5.0|There seems little left to say so I'll take a different tack, look to another facet of this book and its author.     Today I heard Dr. Mukherjee interviewed on the Terry Gross show (Fresh Air - NPR), where the topic, the book, was biased in favor of the author ... and a wonderful treat it was. While I am interested in cancer and progress toward cure, the fascinating aspect of today's experience was the man himself. In all the interviews of all the interviewers I've listened in on - mostly literary in nature - I've never heard a more articulate responder than Mukherjee. He's a poet. His choice of words slice in toward meaning like the scalpel itself. He avoids vagueness and ambiguity, courts acuracy and precsion like no one I've heard. He is a treat just to listen to, never mind his insights into the disease, it's history and possible future.    I ordered this book today in order to get more of his artistry but I wouldn't discourage those seeking the phycician's prowess - that is there too. If I should be in that 25% that ends up with cancer, I would hope Dr. Mukherjee would be there to consult with me and console.

My glutes have slimmed down, my arms are looking and feeling stronger, and my legs are sculpted. Oh, and let's not forget, my abs may not be rock hard (yet), but the sides have definitely slimmed down. After my 30 days with Jillian, I fell in love with her. Her attitude is great, very encouraging.

IT IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDIENCE TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF THE MOVIE.<br /><br />I could do a point-by-point deconstruction, but what would that accomplish? It's like discussing the Middle East Peace Process with the self-same ten year old, whose glassy eyed stare of boredom would be your only reward.<br /><br />Additionally, it's usually a bad sign for any film if the best elements anyone can talk about are the special effects - which by the way are decent-to-pretty good.<br /><br />If you have young children - this is a 'must see'.

1427210497|3.0|Freedom is ultimately about the freedom that we all have to destroy our own lives.   Introspective soliloquies are lurking behind every corner here.  They are the heart and soul of the book, often compelling and beautiful, but wasted here as Franzen rips the souls out of every character, one small piece at a time.  That would be acceptable if there were redemption in the desolation.  But time and again, Franzen telegraphs the fact that there will be no redemption for these poor characters.  Desolation seems to be the whole point, and Franzen heaps it on, as if the purpose of the project were to keep the reader turning page after page, hoping that things will get better, knowing that they will not.    There is plenty of dialog here, but it is the weak connective tissue between the hard nuggets of introspective insight.    The best thing about this book is the feeling you get when you realize that you can walk away from it, and that your life, though difficult, messy, and troubled, still has a touch of the divine.
0803732287|5.0|Cute story with a great rhythmic flow. My son absolutely loves this one right now and it is great to read to him. Of the ~100 books we have for him, I'd say this is in the top 5.
006145205X|4.0|Worth reading if only to get a temporary reprieve from the doom and gloom that seems to have been pervading Western society for the last few years, if not the entire last decade. You may have your political points of disagreement with Ridley, but if so, shouldn't you get to know your enemy? If you're on his side already, it's good to have points with which to back up your beliefs. And if you're open-minded, no matter what your stripe, it's a good alternative perspective.
B000007U6V|5.0|I never would have believed the many people who refer to Autobahn as a highly original piece of art had I not listened to the album myself.  I mean come on- electronic music original?  As ignorant as it sounds, I just didn't think electronic music COULD be original.  What was I thinking?    First of all, I'll be the first to admit I'm normally not particularly fond of electronic music.  This is because most of it repeats extremely simplistic beats for what seems like an endless amount of time over and over again, never really altering a whole lot as far as arrangements are concerned.      As a result... more often than not, I'm left totally bored and confused what the appeal of the entire genre even is.    However, that point of view has now officially been changed thanks to this highly influential piece of electronic music known as Autobahn.      To say Autobahn is years ahead of its time would be a major understatement.  It's at *least* six years ahead of its time.  Listen to this album and try telling me it wouldn't fit in *perfectly* with the new wave scene of the early 80's.  It most certainly would!   Artists like the Cars, Kim Wilde, Men Without Hats, etc. all resemble elements of this band.     I'm completely blown away by Kraftwerk's sudden change in style too- the first couple Kraftwerk albums don't resemble Autobahn in the least.  Those early albums are more like a collection of oddly put together sounds and barely noticeable musical ideas all crammed together to try and create something meaningful (the results arguably not nearly as enjoyable as done here, of course).    Anyway, let's mention the vocal melody in the title song.  Even the *vocal melody* sounds way ahead of its time.  It resembles what the punk rock bands were doing in the early 80's, such as the lead singer of the Clash for example (but obviously without the same kind of aggression as the Clash since, of course, punk and electronic are two completely different styles of rock, but that should go without saying).    It's quite catchy, too.    Then the rest of this 22-minute monster goes through a ton of eerie and haunting (and melodic) electronic sounds.  If Kraftwerk intended to experiment with a style of music not yet heard at the time, then I can't explain where the talented songwriting came from.  The band just had that special mysterious ability I guess.    \\"Kometenmelodie 1\\" is even *creepier* with the electronic sounds which are now slowed down considerably.  Now we're entering haunted house territory, haha.  It's really good, and the melodic aspects floor me quite a bit.  Actually that's not really true- the *originality* of Kraftwerk floors me the most.  You have to respect the originators because not just anybody has the talent to come up with THIS kind of stuff.  \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\" takes the electronic synths and makes them anthemic and even approaches sadness near the end.    Kraftwerk finally settled into a comfortable groove with this one.  No more lengthy flute passages or airplane sounds indicating a war scene- Autobahn is where we have to tip our hats to a band that was just radically different from everyone else back in the mid 70's.
1439133948|5.0|We've owned multiple copies of most of the books in the Vorkosigan saga in our family. My husband and I had copies when we married of many of the books, and my parents owned copies.... I bought this for my mother's birthday and was THRILLED to find the e-book versions of all but one of the prior books in the series included on a CD in the first printing. A delightful lagniappe that almost outshines the book itself, and makes this the single best book purchase I've made in recent memory.<br /><br />The story itself is a great read, a fascinating story. Bujold's storytelling is really exquisite in every work I've ever read of hers, and this is no exception. Great story, great characters, great writing, fascinating worlds. And now I have the full set on my computer, so I don't always have to track down which family member has what book, where.<br /><br />Now if only I could get the same for my Pern books...
0307454541|3.0|This is a strange book, in the sense that you'd expect the title character, Lisbeth Salander, to be the central figure, but she isn't. Instead, it's an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist who has bitten off more than he can chew. She is peripheral to the plot, and remains an enigmatic figure throughout, albeit with exceptional skills and unexplained contacts in the world of computer hacking.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, Blomkvist becomes embroiled in the Vanger family tragedy (the Vangers are an extended clan which should have been culled to keep things manageable). The mystery is made unduly complicated for the purposes of the story, despite which Blomkvist manages to unravel it. Having done so, he then places himself in jeopardy unnecessarily (the temptation to shout \\"He's behind you!\\" is hard to resist.<br /><br />At over 500 pages, the book does bang on a bit (but don't they all nowadays?). Having read it, I feel that I need a period to recuperate before trying to tackle the second in the series.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Every one has so eloquently reviewed this wonderful movie that I can add nothing but my personal little story of the way I felt when I first saw the movie.    I went with my mother and her friend and we sat in the balcony of an old movie theater down town. I was 9.   The theater is kind of spooky and I remember being a little unnerved by it.  The movie started and I was absolutely and utterly in love with Julie Andrews from the moment she appeared on the screen.  I remember even attemptling to speak with a british accent after I saw the film.  My mother said at the time how wonderful Dick Van Dyke was and I remember being so mad at  her for saying that--how dare she say anything against \\"my\\" Julie. But seeing it again as an adult I have to say she was absolutely right. (dont you hate it when you have to admit your mother was right? ) I have heard people vilify Dick Van Dyke for his accent but we have to remember that everyone else was british.  He is so wonderful in this film that it takes my breath away and at the end when he is chastising Mr. Banks and telling him in a nice way that he hasnt made enough time for his children, it always makes me cry.  He was wonderful, SHE was wonderful.  Wonderful movie.
0307346617|5.0|Well, now I know what we should do to prevent a zombie war from happening.<br /><br />This was an.. unexpected type of story.  I'd heard from a friend that this book was fun to read, but I think I was thinking of it more along the  lines of a Pride and Prejudice and Zombies type of book, a kind of tongue-in-cheek war novel.  What I got was along the lines of.. a documentary, with fake interviews that felt real, a scenario that was both fascinating and filled with horror, and a story that just kept gaining momentum.<br /><br />Max Brooks writes World War Z without it seeming full of gimmicks and, while reading through some of the reviews on the book, I noticed that there were a few comments about how all of the interviews sounded the same.  In a way, they were - at the beginning of the book the narrator speaks to how he's writing the book with the emotions that his employer won't allow in their report.  He's documenting, editing and compiling on his own and the end result is a product that, ultimately, is written by one man and influenced by those he interviewed.  Was this meant to be a serious piece of news? Not at all.  But it was close enough to give the illusion of that, and that's what I really enjoyed about the book.<br /><br />Fantastic read - highly recommended for those who enjoy war stories and are looking for something just a bit different.
0307474712|4.0|David Nicholls, who has become a new addition to the Nick Hornby-esque writing style of \\"movie in a novel's form,\\" comes with 'One Day.'  It tells the tale of two lovers, with one chapter devoted to only one day per year for a couple of decades.      For a summer beach read or to curl up with under a blanket this winter, 'One Day' is definitely a winner.  It is not a complicated read with any unique or creative storytelling, but it is more than entertaining and is a very sweet story.  As the story progresses, it throws in plenty of heartbreak and bittersweet story elements.      If you're looking for an easy romantic read, definitely check this out.    -AP3-
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I don't know where to begin and I'd be the first to admit I'm not an objective Bruce reviewer, but... This is a must-have for the die-hard Bruce fan. The live DVD of the band playing DOT straight through is so refreshing. As a fan who always enjoyed Bruce's guitar playing and wished he'd taken up those duties more in later releases, he's back in top form showing he still owns all those chops from the late 70s with every bit of urgency and commitment as ever. It's obvious the band took this performance as a serious, landmark task, they're sharp and tight as a group. The sound quality is impeccable, the playing masterful. Surprisingly, to me, this was as much of a treat as any other of the components of this coveted box set. The 'bootleg' DVD from '78, especially the first half is high-quality, including simply the best version of \\"Independence Day\\" that I've ever witnessed. To me, the show loses a bit of focus toward the end, and I'm rather tired of the \\"Detroit Medley\\" (a requisite of the period} but that's partly due to the fact the bar is set so high at the beginning of the show. Great performance nonetheless. And a re-mastered Darkness on the Edge of Town, which has always been 1-2 with Born to Run in my book as favorite Bruce album. Simply a no-hesitation purchase for one who is into Bruce.
B001QOGYBI|1.0|Based on other reviews, I guess I missed something. I'll keep it short: my kids (7, 9, 12) were literally yawning and asking how long this movie was after 1/2 an hour.  As for myself, I was expecting a lot based on the movie pictures I had seen. But the style gets old really quick, something is definitely missing as far as graphics go, although I couldn't say what precisely.  Clooney's voice is, simply put, boring as can be. Most characters are creepy, but not in a fun way, they just make you wish you were somewhere else. The story doesn't go anywhere, and doesn't want to end. I usually like offbeat creations, but this one simply leaves a bad taste, if you remember anything after seeing it.

B0044XV3QY|4.0|People, ignore 99% of the one-star reviews. Many of them were posted weeks before this package was even released! A bunch of people who trashed the movie on the other Avatar movie product pages, plus many complaining about no 3-D or double dipping, as if no other movie has ever been released as a barebones then an extended release later. Plus, it has been extensively written all over the internet that the 3-D version would not be released until next year. Amazon IMO should not allow reviews of products until after they are released. Avatar sure isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it fully deserves intelligent commentary, whether one gives it one star or five. I have never seen so many uninformed haters cluster around a movie before. People are even giving the movie one star because their BD players aren't updated with current firmware. All I can say about these people is what Neytiri said to Jake upon their first encounter... \\"You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do\\".<br /><br />I loved the extras - this is one of those rare movies where the extras are as much fun as the movie itself - and wish a lot of the deleted scenes (many with unfinished CGI and some at the motion-capture level) had made it into the movie. It would have made the movie even longer, but almost 4 hours is not too long for this type of sci-fi epic, at least to me. However, the additional scenes that made it into the extended cut really added to the movie and helped clarify the plot. The Sturmbeest hunt scene was great, and lent a bit more legitimacy to the montage of Jake's improbably quick training. Another additional extended scene involving Grace and Jake really helped flesh out the backstory and also added an important element of bonding between the two characters.<br /><br />Seeing the feature-length \\"making of\\" documentary was wonderful - it really went in-depth on just how incredibly complicated the making of this movie was. Some of the deleted scenes with unfinished CGI are a bit tough to watch - very rough and cartoonish, and it can be difficult making out which character is which sometimes - and you kind of have to fill in with your imagination the missing CGI to get a sense of how the scenes fit into the movie. For those who aren't that familiar with the movie, it helps to get quite familiar with the storyline and scene-to-scene progression before delving into the deleted scenes.<br /><br />Two negatives:<br /><br />1) Amazon shipped me the DVD version, not the Blu-Ray version that I ordered! There's a lot of extras on the Blu-Ray set that are not on the DVD set so I was not a happy camper when I opened the package. Plus, I've already seen the original theatrical release on Blu-Ray and the video and audio quality of the DVD version is very noticeably downgraded. I already had removed the shrink wrap from the box before I noticed it was the incorrect format so I watched it all anyway. Amazon's problem, not mine. (Edit 11/19/10: Amazon got the correct (Blu-Ray) version to me in less than a day and a half after I filed a return ticket. Good job guys.)<br /><br />2) The case the set comes in, while beautiful, is not kind to the discs. In my opinion, having the discs lie against cardboard sliders is a great way to have the discs end up scuffed or scratched. As I said above, Amazon accidentally shipped me the DVD version when I had in fact ordered the Blu-Ray version, and since I didn't notice it was the DVD version until I had taken off the shrink wrap, I watched the DVD version anyway. As soon as I pulled out the discs I noticed seriously nasty scuff marks on the playing surfaces of two of the three discs (and yes, I WAS very careful). That is NOT acceptable for a freshly-manufactured product, and I had never encountered that problem before. When I received the Blu-Ray version, very luckily, there were no blemishes on any of the discs. So, I transferred them to standard Blu-Ray plastic cases for better safekeeping and now just keepthe original case in a drawer. I have seen many other complaints from people here about how the cases marred their discs, so I know I'm not the only one. This is why I gave this set 4 stars, and not 5. My attitude is that when you're buying a product like a DVD/Blu Ray box set, it's not just about the movie itself, it's an overall PRODUCT review. When the package that the product is supposed to be permanently stored in causes damage to the product, then the packaging is fair game for being included in a review. You're not just buying the movie, you're also buying the case that is supposed to safeguard the disc(s). Almost everything is fair game in a review of a movie - audio, video, cinematography, editing, music, story line, continuity, acting - plus things like the extra bonus material and the case. ALL this is part of the overall product that people shell out their money for. So, I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 4. Movie 5 stars, packaging 3 stars.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of the movie, don't hesitate to get this extended collector's edition.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|Often I  see a comprehensive box set released and it looks so good but I wish I was just a little more interested in the subject album or artist. I didn't have that problem with this one. At 16 years old back in 1978 Darkness On The Edge Of Town was the first serious album I ever bought. Up to then I was buying Aerosmith, Kansas, Rush and the like, didn't own a thing (yet) by Bob, Bruce, Van, Neil etc. Back in those days we all listened to the radio because it was fresh and exciting. WPLJ in New York City was my station. They started playing 4 songs from Darkness constantly (as well as broadcasting the Cleveland '78 show which I taped on my radio shack 8-track stereo - still have the tapes). Carol Miller, an amazing DJ at WPLJ, seemed to have a major crush on Bruce. Soon I was hooked on an artist that would remain in my top 3 to this day.<br /><br />Darkness is a landmark Bruce album, certainly worthy of the box set treatment. But who would have thought we would get anything like this? Let's break things down:<br /><br />1. THE PACKAGING<br />Very different than anything you have seen before. It comes in a large slipcase that is made to look like a worn copy of the album. Inside the slipcase is an actual spiral notebook that is very thick, a reproduction of one of the worn notebooks that Bruce used when creating the album. The 6 discs are spread out inside the contents of the notebook in little envelopes built into the extra thick pages. The notebook will be fascinating to the Bruce fanatic. It has tracklists for different darkness running orders, handwritten lyrics often different than the released songs, pictures and other ephemera. An unusual item that will take a couple enjoyable hours to go through.<br /><br />2. THE REMASTER<br />I'm not an audiophile so others can explain this better, but Darkness on cd has always sounded a little dull and lifeless. This release remedies that. Everything sounds fuller and richer, jumps out of the speakers in a way it never did before - without sounding shrill and brittle like some remasters can sound. The actual album was to me one of the lesser reasons for buying this set, but I am very pleased to have this.<br /><br />3. THE PROMISE - 2 CD'S OF OUTTAKES FROM THE DARKNESS SESSIONS<br />The Bruce camp has been touting this as sort of the lost album between Born To Run and Darkness. That is marketing and nothing more. This is not in any way a cohesive album of songs anywhere close to those 2 masterpieces. These are outtakes, similar to the Tracks collection and even the many bootleg cd's released over the years. Many of the songs are derivative of other Bruce songs with snippets of melodies and lyrics you will immediately recognize. In my opinion there are only a few that could have been in serious consideration for the album, and almost none that would not have marred the feel and continuity of the finished work. Also the hard truth about this collection is that some of these songs are not that good. Don't get me wrong - they are not bad. But SOME of these songs are merely generic mid tempo rockers and ballads, pretty bland compared to Bruce's best work in this era. It's always exciting to get new Bruce and mediocre Bruce is better than most of what's out there. That being said I can't see myself being drawn to listen to about half the songs on this collection much as the years go by. Of course your mileage may vary. On the flip side there are a good amount of songs that any other artist would have as the centerpiece of their album and never consider holding back. Because The Night, Fire, The Promise and a few others are genuine Springsteen classics and are long overdue for legitimate release. Despite that this set is a bit overhyped it is a welcome addition to Bruce's released work.<br /><br />On a side note a couple people have commented on these songs being doctored recently with overdubs, etc. I will say that these songs do seem pretty polished and I am curious exactly what was doneto them and when. Maybe someone will do an analysis and post it online. I don't think the average fan cares much about this issue but it does seem a little like cheating to me. :-)<br /><br />4. THE MAKING OF DARKNESS DOCUMENTARY DVD<br />This is a fascinating documentary, over an hour and a half long, that really gives us a feel of what Bruce and the band went through to create this great work. There is lots of great footage of Bruce and the boys in the studio as well as current commentary. Watching this I begin to understand the commitment that Bruce had to making the finished album conform to his vision. To wade through the 50+ songs (many of them great in their own right but not adhering to the overall theme of Darkness) is an amazing achievement.<br /><br />5. HOUSTON '78 CONCERT DVD<br />They call this a Bootleg House Cut. You will enjoy it more if you think of it that way. It was filmed in 1978 for in-house broadcast (probably a little bit down from TV broadcast quality, but really not bad at all). It is not crystal clear, the sound is not pristine but it is nevertheless fantastic and the average Bruce fan will get lost in this. A full 3 hour show of Bruce and The E Street Band at the top of their game. Some of these songs are spine-tingling. I will tell you one thing that I personally like about old footage. It is a pet peeve of mine that modern concerts (Bruce included) are usually filmed with the quick style editing that sees a camera shot change every one and a half seconds. I much prefer the way they used to film things back in 1978. Also, with quite a few bootleg videos from this tour already circulating it is an accomplishment to find something that no one has seen before.<br /><br />6. THRILL HILL VAULT VIDEO<br />A few simply filmed in-the-studio songs. Goes well with the documentary. Also 5 live tracks from Phoenix 1978. Like Houston the quality is not perfect, but the performances are stunning.<br /><br />7. DARKNESS PERFORMED BY CURRENT BAND<br />Bruce and the band perform the album in the original running order without an audience. I was surprised at how great this is, that this is a vital document and not just a bonus. Of course, after watching the archival footage, the video and audio quality is impressive. This is a focused, passionate, serious performance. No smiles, no distractions. These are 60 year old men whose youth is gone but are still at the top of their game musically. These performances are amazing. I get the sense from Bruce and the band that they know how blessed they are to still play these songs so well with so much weight and so many years behind them, that they know that everything comes to an end eventually. That these days are precious. This set is a perfect bookend in this collection.<br /><br />I can't think of a more comprehensive, exhaustive look at a single album. And every element works. One can tell that in putting together something of this magnitude that Bruce was very much committed to making this special. Obviously if you are only a marginal Bruce fan this will be overkill. But if you are a longtime fan with affection for this album you will enjoy this for a long time.<br /><br />Added 7/3/11: As tonight I again watched the 12/13/09 performance of Darkness in its entirety I am reminded what an important document this set is. There is a gravity and mortality that hangs over this incredible performance. Danny is already gone and this is the 2nd to last time Clarence will perform with Bruce and the E Street Band. Every song here is just about perfect, but they played a 10 minute Racing In The Streets that is one for the ages. When Bruce's vocals are done these men - Bruce and Clarence and Roy and Stevie and Max and Garry - continue playing for another 5 minutes. It is as beautiful a piece of music as I will ever hear - men in their twilight mourning and celebrating the passage of all those lost summers.alysis and post it online.

B0034JKZ86|1.0|What on earth was Disney thinking? Why the heck would they put voodoo in a children's movie, specially an animated one. I couldn't believe it, I was very disappointed. I was very excited to see the movie b/c of the previews, which showed no voodoo. It seems like Dreamworks is started to be a better animation for kids and families. Lately some Disney movies have been going downhill. It's just not what it used to be.
0525951652|5.0|This was a very compelling story and a great history lesson.  It really put things into perspective for me.  A hundred years ago, people were no different from today - perhaps even more petty.  The characters were real and you cared for them.  I'm surprised by some of the less than stellar reviews.  Follett knows how to tell a good story.  I liked Fall of Giants even better than The Pillars of the Earth!  Can't wait for the next one...
B000TEUSJK|1.0|I saw the great actors in this movie.  I am interested in ancient history and ordered it.  I saw \\"unrated\\" and thought it was the directors cut or something. I have bought hundreds of DVDs and I am happy with all of them. I received great service from Amazon.      Howver this movie is terrible. It is not history, acting or anything.  It is just a waste of talent. Do not buy it.  I binned it.
6305428522|1.0|Looks like it's straight from a used VHS tape. You need to zoom in 2x to get it to fill the screen. Too bad, I was really looking forward to seeing this again. Not worth the $9. price tag. Wait for a better DVD.
B000V5TV22|5.0|I purhased this gps unit to hook up to a netbook which i use for navigation on my boat.  I downloaded free software form the internet and rastor maps from NOAA and the plugged in the gps unit.  It works fantastic and it even pick up a signal inside the cabin of my boat.  I've used it for 6 months now and I am extremely happy with this purchase.  I have anice marine GPS for very little money. I would highly recommend this unit.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I expected it to be a plastic toy, so I wasn't surprised by the screwdriver's physical condition. The product description needs to be changed to reflect that it doesn't come with the psychic paper. The one I got must have been a dud, because it doesn't work. No lights, no sounds, just a neat-looking toy. It's cool to have it just to have it but I'm sooooo bummed that the bells & whistles don't work. :(
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I'll be honest: the first time I heard the entire length of Josh Groban's new album \\"Illuminations\\", I was disappointed. I kept waiting for the big orchestral entrance, the explosion of percussion, the big sound I was used to - and the big sound never came. This album is quite a departure from what Groban did on his first three albums, but the change isn't all bad. It's one of those records that grows on you with time. After listening to it straight for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that this may, in fact, be Josh's best work.     \\"Illuminations\\" is about subtlety. If you enjoyed the soaring chorus and thunderous explosion of his past hits 'You Raise Me Up' or 'You are Loved (Don't Give Up)', you may want to listen to this one first. It begins with a piano prelude that reminds me of 'Life in Technicolour' from Coldplay's \\"Viva la Vida\\". Immediately after is 'Bells of New York City', a dark tune that wouldn't be out of place in a Dickensian Christmas film. Also dark is 'Au Jardin des Sans-Pourquoi', though if you look at the lyrics (either read French or translate them), it's obvious why. At the same time, despite its weight, it does have somewhat of a soaring chorus.     The best songs on the album are the ones Josh leaked onto YouTube early: the first single, 'Hidden Away', is about coming out of your shell, and has a soaring high point toward the end, despite the lack of percussion. 'Higher Window' is about lost love, while 'L'Ora Dell'Addio' is about the pain of leaving someone behind. My favorite track is the romantic 'Você Existe Em Mim', which is the only track with strong percussion. Also incredible is 'War at Home' which in many ways is the sequel to Groban's rendition of 'I'll Be Home for Christmas'.     The only track I'm not a huge fan of is cover song 'Galileo (Someone Like You)', which would have sounded more at home on Josh's debut album. Compared to the rest, it's a little bland. That being said, it's still a good tune.    \\"Illuminations\\" is quite a departure from Josh Groban's usual fare, but it's by no means a bad change. The album is subtle, but moving. Lyrically, Groban is far and above any previous work, and the melodies are mesmerizing as well. It's truly the best from Josh so far.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|I don't understand all these 1-star reviews from people saying \\"it's not the old Kid Rock\\", or where's the rock and where's the rap? Hello... anyone that has followed him through the years and listened to his albums old to new can easily see he was headed in this direction, and has been for some time now. He even publicly announced that he wants to be more rock and country oriented. What do you think All Summer Long was? Exactly that.     If you follow Kid at all, you know he was on CMT Awards (Country Music Television), he did a show with Hank Jr. on CMT Crossroads, the guest stars here are all country or classic Rock... so what makes you think it's going to be his old Rock/Rap style of music on this disc? I have only heard portions of the disc and it does sound pretty mediocre, but it's easy to see from a mile away that this is where he has been heading, and I think it's not such a bad direction. Definitely better than going back to nineties style Rock-Rap. Time to move on !!!
B0017ANAZO|4.0|If you're craving more Sex & The City / Waiting To Exhale type movies, with a 4 star-female ensemble cast, this film is for you! Annette Bening is her usual amazing self. Candice Bergen is always phenomenal to watch (and someone we can't seem to get enough of, these days). Eva Mendes' performance is the best I've seen of her & my favorite of her roles played, to date! And the actress who plays Meg Ryan's teenage daughter gives a precious performance, as well. This film is a remake of the 1939 version of The Women, which I'd love to see. Interesting note: There is not ONE male actor anywhere in this film, which was a goal of the project--to make a film exclusively about women. This is definitely a wonderful curl-up-alone-with-a-girl-movie film, when you are needing one!
B0019EXZY4|4.0|I like bank job(BJ's)films! Especially when they're done right. 'The Bank Job' offers us something a little different than the over blown versions in cinema these days. The film is set in the 70' which helps to make this less complicated than newer films with the same premise. No high tech devices, just guys with shovels etc. There were a few problems with this film, which did border on ridiculous(taking a nap in the middle of a BJ!??), but overall this was a really entertaining ride and reminded me of a film made in the 70's because it wasn't so outrageous to spoil the fun.
B003INBNXO|4.0|whats great about this film is that it wasn't the typical martial arts films with fighters ridiculously flying through the air with cgi effects spraying blood all over the place. this is a film a martial artist can appreaciate with a accurate and skilled display of this particular form of kung fu \\"Wing Chun\\". the cinematography was beautifuly shot and action scenes were rich with good fighting displays  the story revolve's around the history of bruce lee's teacher known as IP Man, what i also liked about the plot is that it touched on the decadence of pre war china, and the degrading humiliation many of these great martial arts teachers had to endure after the japanese invasion.very enlightening film it made me want to do more research on the subject after viewing.  if you appreciate films like hero, curse of the golden flower, martial arts films with a complex plot then you'll appreciate this. definatly one that stands out in the genre
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I hate comparing to X-Files, the mother of all government coverup/alien invasion/crazy phenomenon/wacky conspiracy scifi tv shows.  I wasn't interested until I caught 10-15 minutes of the pilot.  I'll admit I was totally burned out on the whole there's-a-big-secret-but-we-won't-tell-you-until-after-six-seasons tactics that the lame-ass show Lost pulled (way to go JJ Abrams!).  This show gave me a reason to tune in each episode without getting angry that they were holding out on me.  The format/story/characters were all so interesting that at some points I didn't care about the fact they wouldn't paint the whole picture.  I was for once satisfied that they would only feed tiny nuggets of info each episode so you never knew the whole picture, only small portions of it.  Alot of the junk that gets put out now tries to bank off of the notion that viewers are willing to put up with 20 some episodes of crap until finally they know the big secret that was hinted at in the beginning.  Fringe does it without losing my interest.  Between the damn fine actress Anna Torv and the hilariously insane character Walter Bishop (Josh Jackson is okay, someone else could've played it better), I have developed a loyalty to this show and hope it doesn't run out of material before it comes to a close (hint:don't do what the X-files did).  Check this show out, for sure.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I got the opportunity to check out this CD before it hit the stores through One2One Network. This is my first experience with Norah JOnes and I must say, I was pleased with what I heard. I liked the variety of music on this album. She pairs up with several other artists from a variety of musical genres. I really like the duet with Dolly Parton, \\"Creepin' In.\\" Although the two rap songs were really not my favorite, they were interesting paired with her voice. The CD could be enjoyed by all types of people. I will say, that after listening to it over and over, the songs do start sounding the same.
0525951652|3.0|I have read every one of Ken Follett's books, and, like others who have reviewed this book, I expected to thoroughly enjoy it.  That was true for approximately the first half.  I shan't waste anyone's time repeating the other criticisms vis-a-vis poor characterization and way too many coincidental meetings.<br /><br />What truly BORED me were the overly detailed, unnecessary descriptions of every trench on both sides!  I felt that I was sinking into the mud and began skipping whole pages.  Enough is enough!!  After the Battle of the Somme, Follett did not need to describe every single battle in agonizingly prolonged,and, did I mention, BORING, BORING, BORING detail.<br /><br />I concur with others in the hopes that the next two books of the trilogy will improve.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This is just amazing.  It's a gift. The sound quality is great, and there is so much material here that you will be entertained for hours.  The packaging is really interesting.  I have had it for 2 days and have barely scratched the surface. If you are a Bruce fan, you will not be disappointed.  I think it's the single best release in the entire Springsteen catalog.
1585673927|5.0|My wife is a huge fan of the Jeeves and Wooster books. She said this one has been her favorite so far. Please understand my wife is not the type to laugh out-loud very often, being more of the serious type. However she laughs hysterically when she reads the Jeeves books, especially this one. I have not read the books but will one day. She tells me so much about them that I'll need to forget it before I can enjoy it. So, if you're looking for an entertaining novel that'll keep you laughing, them I highly recommend getting this book.
B000W04S6U|3.0|If you enjoy movie sound tracks, this is similar quality. It captures the drama and excitement of the game sound track. My only disappointment with the music is that in a few spots some instrument voices sound like they're produced by a lower quality synthesizer.    My CDs arrived in the standard plastic fold out double CD case. The first CD played without issue. The second CD was warped like an upside down saucer. (Possibly from heat exposure?) It was deformed badly enough that it got stuck inside the player. From the sound made by the CD read head banging I wonder if any damage was done.    I love the music (as least the first CD), but be prepared to return this if you receive damaged disks.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|In every fantasy super band or group scenario I can think of, Freddie Mercury is the lead singer. The picture quality is amazing, sound is great and the set list is perfect. Freddie absolutely kills it.

B0043RT8JU|5.0|I cursed myself for waiting so long to read it and to discover John Green. I can safely say it's one of the best YA novels I have read. I don't know what I was expecting but I wasn't expecting this. This book really make me laugh out loud many times, it made me fall in love with the characters.<br /><br />Quintin (Q), Ben and Radar are friends who are in their final senior year. Q and his friends are not the popular kids , but they do have fun and are almost comfortable in their own skins which makes it a refreshing approach on unpopular kids in YA novels. Q is in love with this firecracker of a girl called Margo. She is everything Q is not. Although they were good friends when they were kids as they lived next to each other, they kind of drifted apart as they grew up. Margo became the popular girl. On the outside she seems perfect, but beneath that perfect exterior is a girl who is very different from what Q knows and loves. When she disappears leaving clues for Q to find her, he starts realizing that there is a lot more to her than what appears on the surface.<br /><br />Q becomes obsessed with finding Margo and as the book progresses we get to know more about Q's relationships with his friends and his parents. Paper Towns is the kind of book that makes you want to love the author for creating characters like these. The humor is delicious and as I said before I was laughing throughout. Even my husband was intrigued and asked me to keep my copy for him instead of taking it back home. What is the best part of Paper Towns is that even underneath all this humor is a sensitivity and warmth which very few authors can achieve.<br /><br />If you haven't read John Green, do so now. Even if you don't read YA, you simply cannot go wrong with John Green. Cannot wait to read his other books.
0790742780|5.0|great movie
B00428ZRFY|5.0|I liked the Umbrella album somewhat but some of the songs I could not listen to because they sucked, on Rated R was a horrid cd except for one or two of the songs but when LOUD came out I feel that this is her best CD. It has all the hits plus a few inbetween that you can listen to. Great work!
B004BC7MRM|3.0|I like it...but it is definately not his best work.  I have been listening to it over & over since the 16th and I can't find a song that I just love, love, love.
B0044XV3QY|2.0|I was absolutely blown away by this movie in the theater. I love it for all it's Eye Candy. So this is commentary on this release of the Blu-Ray bot the movie itself.      But this Blu-ray release STILL reeks of the studio milking every fan for everything.  In an interview James Cameron stated he wanted this release to contain everything, thus the 3 versions of the movie and all the extra's..but it doesn't include the one thing that made the movie as big as it was..the 3D? You gotta be KIDDING me.      That means there's at LEAST 2 more releases in the future...the release that is finally the movie in 3D, and then the release that is the movie, but just the movie with no bells and whistles. And then the final 3D Avatar with all the features this release has..probably right in time for release before Avatar 2 hits theaters and then they can release a bare a bone 2 movies bundle after that.....      The writing on the wall is so obvious.   No thanks, I think I'll pass on this guy.     I was so looking forward to exercising my 3D Sony with this movie too. So disappointing.

B003ITZBW2|3.0|I could tell by the trailers and teasers this was going to be much darker than past \\"Batman\\" animated endeavors. Sure enough, the opening cribs from the \\"Death In The Family\\" comic story, with Joker bashing the Jason Todd Robin up with a crowbar. I won't go into further detail, as comic diehards already know what happens next, but there are plenty of twists and turns in this story I don't want to spoil for the uninitiated.     The good: the animation is fluid and extremely well story-boarded. The action doesn't seem to let up for a second, and the voice work overall is really good. Nightwing appears, and they don't bother to bog the story down with explaining who he is. It's good to see Black Mask for once, though he doesn't do much here but chew scenery and punch out his guards.    The not so good: this is the same team that brought us the 90's Batman Animated series, but Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammill, the respective voices of Batman and Joker from that series, aren't back here. I can only assume they want to mark this release as a departure for the world of animated Batman (and since they grafted Jason Todd's origin onto Tim Drake aka Robin III in the latter seasons of B:TAS, what happens here already doesn't jive). It's also brutally violent: shootings, beatings, killings, and that's just the Joker. I guess this darker mood was telegraphed back in the \\"Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker\\" film, but even I wasn't expecting something this out and out violent. I'd never read the Judd Winnick comic arc this is based on, but there's a real dark undercurrent to this story. In short, it probably ain't for the youngin's.     I'm not sure why the developers settled on adapting this story over something like \\"Hush\\", but this film delivers well overall.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Matrix Reloaded was awesome. This was just a horrible let down. Normally its the #2 in the trilogy that is the dog. Wasn't the case here.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|excellent series, very informative  with spectacular photography, the additional  diaries of how the films were obtained were as interesting as the actual film itself.  highly recommend for anyone  with an interest in the world around us.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|A friend turned me on to this group recently and I was lucky enough to see them last night at the Bowery Ballroom. They were all in fine form and put on an excellent performance, despite the absence of Daryl Johnson. I'm saving up for the CD.
B003XIO7ZK|4.0|I've long been a fan of Grave Digger, albeit to a lesser extent than most.  I thought Excalibur was really the only album they ever made that I thought was good from start to finish, and when Rheingold came out, I was one of only a few people who thought that it wasn't exactly great.  But no matter what, Grave Digger always had a few good songs on every album, and this one is no different.  There are a lot more good songs on this one than on your average GD release, though.      How good is an album when even the intro gets you going?  So many bands use this as a throwaway track, but here, it's actually important, and it leads in beautifully to \\"Paid in Blood\\" which is one of the best songs on here.  The title track has one of the most unique Digger solos I've heard yet, and \\"Hammer of the Scots\\" has your typical chant along chorus that will make it a fan favorite. I think \\"Rebels\\" is my favorite so far, but there are a lot of good tracks on this one to consider with it.      My biggest complaint about Digger has always been that so many songs they write are just too repetitive.  Remember \\"Giants\\" from Rheingold, where the singer has about 2 verses and then just yells \\"Giiiiiiiiiiiiiaants!\\" for like 7 minutes?  I hated that song, and thankfully, few songs here border or too repetitive, though the aforementioned \\"Hammer of the Scots\\" comes darn close.  Each song has it's own personality as well, and the instrumentation and rhythm guitar is done with impeccable talent.      Overall, a solid release, and I'm glad I gave this one a chance.  It's probably my second favorite GD album, and that's a pretty good comeback for a band that I had basically written off a few years ago.  Get it, especially if you're a fan of this band.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Movie Review:    Schlinder's List is one of those movies that forever change the way a movie about a sensitive topic is made. Very few issues in our world's history move people like the Holocaust. This movie tackles the issue with a humanity and humility we hadn't seen before. The life of Oscar Schindler was beautifully told in this movie and it was good to know that despite the times, there were good and courageous people to stand for good.    Schindler's List is a story about Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis. He starts a company to make crockware and uses bribes to win a military contract. He also hires an accountant, Stern to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into the ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a very dependable labor force. For Stern, who is also a Jew,  this job could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. In 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Cmdt. Goet, a cruel man who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony for fun. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but as he observes what is happening to his employees, he begins feel bad about what is happening. He realizes that his factory is the only thing preventing his staff from being killed in the death camps. He begins to demand more workers in effort to keep more Jews alive and bribes Nazi leaders to keep Jews in his employ and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune, but saved over a thousand people from death at a concentration camp.    There is no doubt that the Holocaust forever changed Jews forever. Although since the days of Abraham Jews have been persecuted, never the scope of the Holocaust. The Holocaust isn't some ancient event. People are still healing from this atrocity and the survivors and their children have torecord this story for the ages. I think Schindler's list makes the record.  Over and over the Jewish people have been discriminated on simply because of their faith. And yet, through all of these horrors, so many have the strength to retain the religion for which they were prosecuted. What a story of courage, faith, and conviction!
B002U33GUQ|3.0|I had not enjoyed a solo jazz pianist as much as Mehldau since Keith Jarrett appeared thirty-five years ago. Actually Mehldau's \\"Some One to Watch Over Me\\" far surpasses Jarrett's version. Mehldau's technique remains formidable on this recording. His solo work is brilliant as is that of Joshua Redman. But there are several disappointments here which don't seem to have been mentioned much by others and I present these as just one person's ears.<br />1. The string writing is amateurish and the ensemble playing is very weak (it sounds like a pickup orchestra with little interest in what they are playing).<br />2. The recording quality of the piano is terribly uneven. On some tracks it sounds like Mehldau is playing in a closet.<br />Nevertheless, I admire any composer/performer who enters new territory (e.g. Ornette Coleman, Don Cherry). These days Mehldau fans will cheer anything he does but I hope the sensation that attends him does not prevent him from more thoughtful musical experiments.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Some of the best books about children, some that qualify as \\"juvenile literature,\\" are the ones that aren't just for children. With Suzanne Collins' dark, delicious book THE HUNGER GAMES, I found another great read, one that reminded me of Orson Scott Card's ENDER'S GAME or Robert Cormier's AFTER THE FIRST DEATH.
B001FES0IE|4.0|I've always been a fan of vinyl records and the newer weight vinyl is even better. This has always been a great album and it sounds as warm as i expected it to.
B004CD7OCI|4.0|(Note: This is a review of episodes 1-3 of the first season of THE WALKING DEAD.)    Well, I just finished watching the first 3 episodes of THE WALKING DEAD and must say I am impressed if not overwhelmed. I think it's a real measure of how much series television has improved over the last 15 years or so that a show like this, which probably would have blown me away had it come out in 1995 or so, now merely strikes me as significantly above average. On the whole it's a solid show, although I find there is an overreliance on foreshadowing that is counterproductive to the effects one should be trying to achieve in the horror/thriller genre. Having said that, I must commend the creators on putting together a great-looking series with credible performances and artful dialogue. The most intriguing to me, I think, is the reiterated theme of the inability of people to get along at the precise time when they most need to; if you don't think that's a relevant topic for a contemporary show, you need to turn off the entertainment and turn on the news.
B0028DRGDQ|2.0|I bought this movie because other reviewers said it was so much better than the remake (Quarantine). I don't agree. The story is exactly the same but Rec is foreign and starts very slowly. If you have Quarantine you don't need this one.
B003UYV08E|1.0|I really enjoyed the 1st Iron Man but this sequel was a complete waste of an hour and half of my life! I could go into excruciating detail why I hated this pitiful, pitiful sequel but I just take my word for it, don't waste your time.
B0000039QA|5.0|I personally think some of Biggie's ILLEST stories were told on this record. 'What's Beef?' 'Kick In The Door' 'Story To Tell' etc etc etc Big was just one of the best who ever did it.
B00445JSX2|3.0|If you are expecting the darkness of Devotional, pass on this. If you expect the strong and vital band of Paris, pass on this. I dont know what happen here. Russell Thomas is a top class director, with several concerts in his resume. But this is not one of the best he has done. The camera work seems to match a TV concert. Too many crowd images, too many cameras approaching from the far side of the arena. Picture quality, also not state of art.  As regard to the sound, I dont know if it is my home theather, but I sense a poor mix. No trebles, sounds very \\"boom\\", the guitar is difficult to hear, the voice is low.   Well, I hope that maybe I had a first bad watch, and with a second it gets better.  German
B000KFTWIG|5.0|I miss Big everyday but I feel blessed that I was a teenager in the 90's when hip hop was at its greatest. This is a hip hop classic, if you don't know now you know.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I have always thought that \\"Darkness\\" was Bruce's best record. It is filled with passionate performances, some of his greatest guitar licks (he has always been supremely underrated as a guitarist), the E Street Band just smokes from beginning to end, and he was as tuned in to what he wanted to say at a deeper level than probably any of his other records.  The packaging is spectacular in its scope and in how it is creatively delivered in notebook form, as has already been mentioned in several reviews.  The added bonus material from the Darkness Sessions, as well as the \\"Making of Darkness\\" DVD and a legendary 1978 Houston gig in its entirety makes for an experience that any fan will be able to return to repeatedly, never tiring of what is contained within. The superb remastering job from the best in the business, Bob Ludwig of Gateway Mastering in Portland, ME, presents the listener with the aural experience that this recording was always capable of delivering. There are some surprising revelations in this set as well, such as in the \\"Making of Darkness\\" DVD where we see the difficulties that the band had in recording certain sections of the record and taking weeks to get the appropriate drum sounds down. The fact that they were, literally, unable to mix the record properly after it had been tracked until Chuck P. was brought in to save the day was astonishing to me. I wasn't expecting that from a group that was so experienced by this time in their career, both in the studio and live. These are in no way complaints, they are just unexpected bits and pieces that inform an audience of the process in creating a piece of work of this magnitude. It's a detail, but it's a revelation as well. This set is well worth twice the price and every Springsteen fan, as well as every fan of rock and roll, should do themselves a favor and add this to their collection.
B000002B1M|5.0|I think this is Nas' best album. Lyrically he is just off the hook on this album and the whole vibe of this record is just perfect. I do not know why this album is, was and always will be slept on? Is it because the hit single was 'If I Ruled The World' which was cross overesque? If you do not own this record you are missing a big part of hip hip history.
030726999X|5.0|Enjoyed this as much as the first two books.  I would love to read more in the series, but alas, that's not to be.  I have recommended them to all of my reader friends.  Great read!!!
B000002ITW|5.0|I received this CD with no issues.  It was in great shape and I am so glad to have it.  Saved a bunch.  I have been looking at this for years but couldn't justify the $30 for new. I would recomend this purchase method.
0446195529|5.0|See book summaries above.<br /> My two cents. I was completely satisfied and enthralled by this newest in the Camel Club series. It was definitely filled with plenty of surprises. More than I'm used to from this author. That's a plus. The suspense, the twists, the characters, plus all the escapes, made this one of the most exciting in the series. Keep up the good work Mr. Baldacci.
038533348X|5.0|The book \\"Cat's Cradle\\" by Kurt Vonnegut is a story of tragedy, deceit, and confusion.  You follow a character named Jonah.  He follows a scientist, Dr. Hoenikker, who creates the atomic bomb and Ice 9.    You move to multiple locations following multiple story lines.  You move to an island called San Lorenzo.  In San Lorenzo there is not much money and everyone is starving.  The only people that are not starving are the people that are not locals.  The profiteers that come from America are the people that are not starving.  One example of one of these people is H. Lowe Crosby, a bicycle maker.  This book is a story of many things, it has many lessons to learn from it.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|Great music, but this CD itself though is not good. It freezes in many places. Must be defective. But like I said, the songs are great. lots of high energy dance songs.
B0045LSIRM|5.0|I remember seeing Bryan on the Tonight Show when he was touring his \\"unplugged\\" album and even Jay Leno mentioned to him he felt that was his best record of all.  Well...when you have a terrific tunesmith, and Bryan is a very very good songwriter, and you have a very identifiable voice ,and Bryan certainly has that, well ...the more \\"production\\" you add to the mix while it can be fun often just creates a distance between the artist and the listener.      Bryans new album \\"Bare Bones\\" which is really the stripped down show ...something like James Taylors tour with just guitar and the odd keyboard..offers the best opportunity to  connect with Bryan the songwriter, singer and artist to date in my opinion.    Sure, I might have wanted this song or that song, but its a very generous 20 songs and I paid $10 at the local fye store today and can't stop playing this one!    My general rule on any live CD or DVD is ...does it make me wish I had done everything I should have to have tried to see that artist if they were in my neck of the woods on that tour and would I see them if I had the chance on this sort of tour and the answer is a resounding YES!! I am hoping that Bryan will release a DVD from this bare  bones tour in the future..    I can't see any reason this isn't a full 5 star value...this is what I love the most about REAL Music...no hiding behind beats, production, back up singers, this is where the rubber meets the road and the fakes fade out....and the real deals step up...
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|I know it's become uncool to like Kid Rock, but I'm approaching 30.  At this point, I don't really care.  This is an excellent album.  The production was amazing, and the instruments compliment what I've always thought Kid Rock did best...have his little scratchy voice singing along instead of spitting his version of rap.      On \\"Born Free\\", the song is decent.  It gets a little old though after a while. I was looking at the time when I thought the song should be over- 3:00 or so.  Unfortunately the song goes on to 5:13.  I should have skipped ahead after four minutes, when they start singing together.  Listening to that part knocked it down to a two star song.      \\"Slow My Roll\\" is another average song, nothing really special about it.  Not bad, and maybe it would be relaxing when you're working too hard or something.  When I'm already sitting in bed at noon, I can't really slow my roll much more, so nothing.      Here is where the CD really starts to improve.  \\"Care\\" is really smooth, and the guests are really good.  TI's verse was good, and I really like where he adds the \\"wish I could though\\" after Rock's \\"I can't change the world and make things fair\\" and have little doubt that I'll be shrugging my shoulders and singing along to that.  Martina McBride adds a nice backup voice to the song.  Smooth, kind of the Kid Rock that's gotten a little older and isn't scared to slow it down a bit.  I'll go ahead and give it five stars.      \\"Purple Sky\\" has a really solid refrain.  \\"want to drink till I'm not thirsty. Sleep till I'm not tired\\"  What more could ya ask for.  Really great road trip song.  Probably four star song.  Five if you ARE on a road trip.  Especially with a girl you love.     At this point, I'm starting to see all of his tracks are just a little longer than they should be.  Sometimes it's two minutes, sometimes it's 20 seconds.  But I did want to push the next button a few times.      \\"When it Rains\\" is another average song.  Maybe only two stars, really.  Went ahead and pushed next.  I'm glad I did.  I really liked \\"God Bless Saturday\\" and found myself nodding my head to most of the song.  I gave it four stars, but easily could have made it five.  On \\"Collide\\", it's pretty cool that Bob Seger's on the piano and not singing.  Wish he would have done some singing too, but it's his Sheryl Crow duet, like his \\"Picture\\" fans surely were looking forward to.  It's good, but it's not \\"Picture\\", which I did really like.  Four Stars is fair for this song.  You can see yourself having a good moment holding your girl while this song plays, and it would really be good for a movie soundtrack to play during the \\"tender moment\\" in a romantic comedy or something.  Good song.     \\"Flying High\\" definitely earned five stars.  Great song.  It's a country song, but Zac Brown style country.  I do really like his and Kid Rock's repartee throughout the song.  If you like Zac Brown music, you'll love this song.  If you want a nice relaxing summer song, you'll love this song.  \\"The grass don't much greener and life can't get no sweeter.  I got a funny cigarette and two dollar bottle of wine.\\"  I immediately made this line my ringtone.      \\"Times Like These\\" is kind of his \\"I love you\\" to his home town of Detroit.  It is a little bit of a downer especially after we were \\"Flying High\\", but a good song, and you can tell he really seems to care.  Four stars.  But maybe the order of these two songs should have been switched.  I'm considering changing the track number on my Media Player.  I liked it but wasn't in the mood for it.  I skipped to the next one about halfway through.      \\"Rock On\\" is a slow one, and probably a good song to listen to when you're breaking up with someone, which I kind of am.  This one caught me at the right time, and gets four stars from me.  But it IS way too long and repetitive.  Yeah.  Even in the right mood, the length makes it only three stars.  This is a good CD if you can skip when it starts getting old, but not as great if you're listening to it impassively.      I actually didn't like \\"Rock Bottom Blues\\".  Maybe I just haven't been to enough places with \\"good foot stompin music and wine\\".  Give it two stars, but I think a song with one star is AWFUL. I also didn't really understand \\"For the First Time\\".  I don't know what's up with his voice, but he shouldn't do that.  Sounds like it has good lyrics, but you can hardly stand to listen to his voice in this pitch that's a good two octaves too high or something.  It's one step below sucking helium before he sings.  That's not his sound.  Gets two stars because of the lyrics, but I hope someone covers this song or something.      The CD wasn't as good as I initially thought, when I first bought it was skipping around.  If you listen to CDs in your car or on road trips (Kid Rock's always good road trip music) and it's not a hassle to push the next button, it will be a good CD.  Four stars for sure (though still not five).  As it is with me, I listen to music in my home primarily and am not close enough to push next.  It was a good CD, and I'm kind of surprised that Rick Rubin didn't say something about it.  Three stars though.  It's an ok CD, with a few standouts.
B003TML0VO|3.0|I'm a huge Santana fan.  I have all his albums and CD's.  But I have to say that his style of guitar playing does not link all genres.  He can't introduce cumbia style guitar licks and guitar voice overs into established rock  themes that are inbedded in your brain in a rock type genre!  Not to mention feel good songs.(what were your doing when this song came on the radio? Dance the night away)?  Sorry Carlos try again, but this time with Mana and or Peggaso,..You know hispanic/cumbia style! Yeah!!!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|The Camel Club returns! They're my kind of guys: Old geezers who still have the knack to handle tough assignments. In spite of the not-so-great review from some brain trust reviewing agency, Baldacci didn't disappoint with this book. Oliver Stone is, as always, a friend, a patriot (in spite of the fact the government screws him)and someone I've grown to respect and trust. He ranks up there with Daniel Silva's character Gabriel Allon. It's refreshing to read a book that offers an adult hero instead of the usual pap of tough guy, lady killer, dumb as rocks and generally obnoxious. Oliver doesn't have to show off...he uses intellect and years of experience to get the job done. The one thing that always bothers me about the Camel Club series is how much of the governmental intrique is fiction and how much is real. I lean toward the latter. If you like thoughtful action by a mature lead character and skilfully woven plotting, don't miss this one. I'm anxious for the next one! If you're too cheap to buy the book, quit carping about it and don't offer a pseudo review blathering on about it's cost.
B003OT4LZY|4.0|I heard the song \\"She Brings Me the Music\\" on an episode of Chuck.  I liked it, so I looked for the album.  Wasn't easy to find (can't download it on Amazon or iTunes) but I finally got the CD (an actual CD - it's been ages since I had one of those).<br /><br />I don't have any history of being a fan of Richard Ashcroft, but this album is one of the best I've bought in a long time.  I'm going to have to start going through his past work to see if it's as good as this.
B003YWUTJI|2.0|I was very excited to listen to Nora Jones' new album \\"Featuring\\" when I got it. Although I think she is VERY talented, I had a little trouble getting through the album. I didn't really connect with any of the songs & I had trouble finding one I could sing along with. Sadly...This album is not for me.
0316069485|2.0|Connelly is capable of spinning a good yarn (if you can get past his corny writing style), but there's not much suspense here unfortunately. This book reads like a bad Dragnet screenplay from the 60's. Some of the dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny, but that's probably not the intention. Amazing that anyone could compare Connelly's writing to Raymond Chandler, or compare Bosch to Marlowe. The L.A. setting is the only thing they have in common.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I am ashamed to say that although I have seen the entire Jeremy Brett BBC series, I had never read the original stories before. I think these stories would be a smash hit even if they were published for the first time today. True classics that stand the test of time.
0321687299|3.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that I am a rich web application developer, not a web page developer, so my interest may be different than some.    I found this book to be oriented toward getting things done in HTML5, in fact, maybe a little too much so.  In general I felt too much time was spent in examples that may or may not be widely applicable.  For example in Chapter 4 there were several pages on how to write a custom video player by overriding the defaults...sure its cool but will a lot of people want to do it or does it help us to learn HTML5?  I could say the same about some of the other examples.  I also thought there was too much time spent on ARIA and fallbacks for non-HTML5 browsers.  Those are certainly very, very useful topics but could be covered by other books...I was hoping for more of a focus on HTML5 exclusively.  I was a little disappointed on some of the editorial decisions on which of the new elements to cover and which to deem \\"out of scope\\" although I do understand the justifications.    On the plus side I loved the pointers on what is supported by which browser.  This information was sprinkled throughout the book.  Although this information will get out of date rapidly I still really felt like it helped me get an idea of what parts of the spec are widely adopted and which ones are years away.  The chapters on the new semantic elements and forms were very helpful and helped me feel comfortable in the new world.  I still feel like I need to learn more about the JavaScript enhancements and CSS3 even after reading this book.
014241543X|5.0|LOVED, LOVED, LOVED best book ever i wish there was another one like it, i already read 13 Reason why!
0380715430|5.0|Mother Tongue was an absolute pleasure to read.  It is well written and enjoyable to read!  I will most certainly purchase more books by this author! This book is a keeper!  I appreciate the many dynamics of the English language that I was made aware of while reading this book.  I enjoyed discussing different aspects of this book with friends!  There is nothing like a book that awakens curiosity and encourages the reader to pursue more knowledge!  I loved it!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I thought it was a fantastic inner look at the Pacific side of WWII. I had a problem forming a bond with the characters as I felt the story bounced around just a bit too much. It was definately worth buying. I enjoyed it more the 2nd time I watched as I felt I knew the characters better then,
0446581348|5.0|I've been looking for a make up book and now I've found Boobi Brown Makeup Manual. This manual tells you everything from how to take care your skin, how to find the right color and type of foundation for any skin tone, how to find the right color and type of foundation for any skin tone to how to apply every detail of eye makeup (Brows, Eye Liner, Eye Shadow, and Eye Lashes).This book such a bible for me and you must have this in your life. Bobbi Brown is my favorite make up artist.
B0004Z33F0|5.0|This 1988 excellent action film has just the opposite view of fighting in Afghanistan than the US has today, 22 years later. These were the days when the Russians were fighting in Afghanistan. John Rambo, retired Army Special Forces expert, with long curly hair and many body scars, is in Thailand fighting in a sports ring. He is hit more than a dozen times without being able to land a hit of his own. We see that he is able to stand strong body blows that would have felled a lesser man, a foreshadowing of what is to come. Then, he beats his opponent with several well placed blows.<br /><br /> His former colonel and a State Department official come to Thailand to ask him to join the colonel in a mission in Afghanistan to support the Mujahidin, later called Taliban, against the Russians. Rambo refuses. However, when the colonel goes alone and is captured, Rambo rushes to save him. The State Department tells him that if he goes and something goes wrong, the Department will deny that it sent him, because they do not want to fight in Afghanistan.<br /><br /> When he comes to Afghanistan, everyone tells him that the Afghans will ultimately win against the Russians, just as they beat the English, because no foreign nation can beat them. He and one Afghan go to the Russian fortress to save the colonel. An Afghan boy follows Rambo to help him. A lot of violence follows.<br /><br /> Will Rambo be able to save the colonel? How many times will he be wounded? Will the colonel survive his mistreatments and his wounds? Will the Afghan man and the boy survive? Will the Afghans come to Rambo's rescue? Will they care about him? Will the US learn from the Russian experience?
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|I was SO looking forward to this new CD BORN FREE. After listening to the 1st song, I was thinking he was starting off slow and that the CD would pick up.   I WAS WRONG.   I am up to song 11 now and I couldn't tell you one single thing that stands out in ANY of the songs. Kid Rock used to run rifs like nobody's business - up, down, in your face - but now listening to these new songs makes me visualize 2 women walking on a beach talking about their female problems. I am SO disappointed.    ** Note: He dropped his Brown Trucker Band, and in it's place is a high pitched female's voice and some guy's twangy country voice that sing along side Kid's. There is no individual Rock anymore, I feel like he sold out to country.  Thumbs down, sorry. I REALLY, REALLY, wanted big things for this album. Any why not, I have all of his others!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I am and have been a fan of Christopher Nolan from his directorial beginnings.  I've read all the reviews here for \\"Inception\\", and I can't add anything more to describe the incredible  sense of anticipation I had waiting for the films release, watching it on the big screen and the emotions that remained with me for days after having experienced this film.  Few films have affected me like this one did.  I do want to add, that I think it was another act of brilliance on Nolan's part, to cast Tom Berringer in the film.  He is an extremely under-rated actor.  And my hope is that we will be seeing more of him soon.  (I can't wait to see this movie on Blu-Ray on my 120 hertz TV)!!!!
0767817664|5.0|Funny, charming, sexy overtones; scary?? Only \\"horror\\" film I have ever liked.  Quite a cast of characters both old and new.
1441408266|5.0|I have a mantra that I repeat in my mind on retiring and on awakening.  I follow this listing in order of importance problems facing me that need solutions.  My belief is that we are all a part of a Universal Mind as a given.  Spiritual connection to Universal Mind is not and requires effort to benefit form solutions that exist for every problem.  This was not a sudden theological concept but developed from my Episcopal upbringing over 70 years.  Wow what a surprise when I stumbled onto Master Key!  It is as if I read this book that was written before I was born.  The author presents his theories which support myown personal theology exactly in a way I would be hard pressed to do.  You don't have to be religious and you won't be offended if you are when you read and practice the things you read in Master Key.  I absolutely reccommend this book!
B000001EL3|4.0|This album is generally acknowledged by most Kiss fans as their best and most consistent effort containing new tunes and I'll agree with them. Kiss albums in the main are usually infused with a couple of good rocking tunes but also contain a lot of filler,cheesiness and cringe inducing moments. The songs you need to avoid on this album unless you like overblown 70's rock opera orchestration are \\"Great Expectations\\" and \\"Sweet Pain\\" but we will allow them the obligatory power ballad and top 10 hit \\"Beth\\".I personally have always hated \\"God of Thunder\\" but a lot of people believe this is one of their signature tunes and Gene Simmons using it in the past for his bass solo and blood spitting at live gigs may be part of the reason - listen to this track and make up your own mind.On the other songs the band stick to their own brand of 70's glam metal party tunes and the best of these I believe are \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" but the others have their moments too.<br />In my opinion if you want a Kiss \\"Best Of\\" or an introduction to the band take it from someone who religiously bought every Kiss album as it came out up until the disaster of \\"The Elder\\" I would purchase Kiss Alive 1 and download your favourite tracks from this album and \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" and you should be rewarded. Avoid anything after 1980(some of \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" and \\"Unplugged\\" may be an exception) at all costs unless you are a fan of 80's type excessive hair metal,turgid love ballads and laughable lyrics.They have done themselves a bit of a disservice by continuing on so long past their use by date although the Reunion and Farewell Tour were great from a purely nostalgic point of view but it should have ended there and only have themselves to blame about being viewed as a novelty act by some but don't let this dissuade you from this very good album when they were at their peak.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Very easy to use! I enjoy it very much, although it is not anatomic - kind of uncomfortable to use on my tiny wrist.
0756405890|5.0|When I picked up this book I was bored and had nothing to read which I can't stand. I thought well maybe this will be interesting... I must say that that was an understatement. I have read this book several times now and it never seems to get old. The writing style is great and the way its told is refreshing. I truly recommend this book to any one that wants to immerse yourself in a new land with a main character that has more style and flair than alot of the characters you read about in todays books. Its also nice to read about someone that is just so over the top that its funny how stupid he can be. The only downside is the wait time on the next book. The waiting is worse than what we had for Robert Jordans \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series before he sadly passed away.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Let me put it to you straight. 8 minutes or 16 minutes extra of garbage is still garbage! This movie had OK special effects, NOT amazing ones. I'm sure it looked cool in 3-D. But boil right down to it, it was the most simplistic piece of garbage of all-time! I can't believe how many people think it is one of the greatest movies of all-time! Has anyone seen anything by Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick, Clint Eastwood, Christopher Nolan or dozens of better film makers than James Cameron? Any one of their film is miles away better in quality and watchability. Frankly the only way I could watch this film was with RiffTrax, from the MST3K guys.    Cameron spend 15 years working on this? A first grader asked to write a screenplay could come up with a better story in 5 minutes, let alone a decade and a half. How stupid do you think the movie going public is? Well, pretty dumb considering how much money it made and how many good reviews it gets. Unattainium? That's pretty simple symbolism. I get it. The metal is UNATTAINABLE! We shouldn't be materialistic. I get it! We get it also, white man always violent and destroying nature, while natives always peaceful and live in harmony with nature. Goes against all history and logic, but ok. And to boot Marines are EVIL! Again not true, but whatever. Cameron is entitled to his opinion, but he could have wrapped it into a story that was a little bit harder to decode.

B004BC7MRM|5.0|I have read through all the reviews from other folks on this album. This is their perspective & it is very obvious that some wanted the same old stuff.  I think this is a very refreshing new sound for the Bad Boy of rock & roll. I did read an interview in entertainment magazine about this album & have been chomping at the bit for its release. I am pleased to say I am not disappointed at all. I still love the old stuff & now the new. It is great to see the talent that Kid Rock possesses.   For those of you who have slammed it well that's your opinion. I say let the music speak for itself!   I am sure we have just witnessed a crossroad that will bring bigger & better things for Music in general.  I say to Kid Rock \\"Bob keep it up brother you are turning the sheets inside out & it a good thing\\"!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I already purchased my item because I forgot to preorder on here, but I wish I had considering prices everywhere else. I highly recommend this special bluray pack especially, my 3 yr old loves the dvd but we can watch blu ray as family too!!! Really ties up all three films very well, should be nominated for Best Picture, will definitely win Best Animated Feature unless How To Train Dragon takes it, which would honestly be alright with me as well.

0399536108|3.0|Pretty sure the five star reviews of this book are planted by those that might directly benefit. Let's get real here people this isn't Walden. Still the message of living your life on your own terms and how to do it is a powerful one which is why I give it three stars. The self help book formula goes something like this. First suspend your disbelief or this book won't help you. Now you have permission to dream big and take the plunge. Finally here is a smattering of a few examples of people/situations along with some filler, now buy the next book. In my experience things rarely work out so well no matter how well planned envisioned or enlightened. A person needs something to fall back on besides competence talent or vision. Might I suggest being born into a wealthy and well connected family? The book Life is a Bi_ch And Then You Die didn't sell many copies but that message is just as relevant.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|There are many opinions about the extended release of Avatar. Good and bad. The bottom line, is what are you considering buying for? Is it just curiosity? Or are you looking for more of an already favorite movie? If your reason is the latter, then you will not be dissappointed.<br /><br />I, for one, was excited to get the new release. I have watched the theatrical version over and over. (Yes, I am a freak that way). I wanted more Pandora. With this extended version, that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />There are not JUST clips of minutes shoved in, it is more Pandora in snipits. More of planet, more of the feelings, and some background left out of the theatrical version that I think must have been really hard to cut for reasons of time. At least if I had to edit this movie, it would have been really difficult. But who am I? A fan, that's what I am.<br /><br />I was concerned about it being split into 3 discs that it would feel choppy. Actually it is only split between 2 discs and it was done at an excellent point in the movie. It was a perfect bathroom break....although I know that the pause key can be used at any time, this switching of discs was okay with me.<br /><br />I am not going to give you any spoilers....but....the new extended scenes give insight into some of the dialogue. Jake says he is a deadly ariel hunter...yes there is a scene for that. It is wonderful! Grace refers to the breakdown of peace between the humans and the indiginous as being about using machine guns on them. Well, that is vsually answered. There is a tidbit added to the \\"bonding\\" of Jake and Natiri that I wondered about and got the answer. And there is so much more.<br /><br />So, for my money, this was worth the purchase. I wanted MORE Avatar. That's exactly what I was given. Oh, and it was done so very well, besides.

Back in 1965,66, My Friends and I were all dropping Government Manufactured Pharmaceutical Quality LSD. ( Sandoz LSD ) We were well on the way towards higher Consciousness and there really wasn't anything that the government could do about it.With the advent of LSD, there came Psychedelic Music, Psychedelic Rock Poster Art and Psychedelic Dungeon's were popping up everywhere.It was LSD that started the whole Counter Culture Movement back in the Sixties. Woodstock was the tail end of it, But it all started in California.Woodstock the Movie captured some very important things that people need to realize,One,The scene where Artie What-his-name says...Hey if you have to be afraid to walk down the street and smile at someone or say hi to them,then what kind of a way is that to have to go through life, it was so important that the great writer Richard Matheson puts it in his film \\"The Omega Man\\" Charlton Heston saying in the film...Yeah they don't make movies like that anymore.Lets all remember those were not Extra's working for SAG (The Screen Actors Guild) getting paid to make the Movie Woodstock.I remember seeing an interview with Crosby,Stills and Nash back in the Seventies or Eighties and David Crosby was saying of Woodstock...There was an amazing Spirit going on there man,There really was something going on in the back ground of this whole scene.Now in August of 1969 Just south of Woodstock,You had the People who helped to end the Counter Culture generation,I'm talking about American Gangster The DVD,Right when Woodstock was happening,South of Woodstock down in New York City Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) rules Harlem's Chaotic Heroin drug world of Junkies,He was bringing in Heroin right from Vietnam.Was this based on a true story?

0312600844|1.0|Oh, Oprah. There once was a time when I loved your book club selections. I loved ICY SPARKS. Then you chose THE STORY OF EDGAR SAWTELLE. That was the beginning of the end.     I had heard all the hype of THE CORRECTIONS, and though I had never read it, I had to get the follow up to the novel. I had to know what was going on.    To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what happened in this novel. I made it through roughly 400 pages of this sloppily written, god-awful, horrible dreck before I gave up. I realized that I didn't honestly care for the characters, and I could care less what happened to them by the end of the book. I recommend skipping the book. It's a waste of time, and a waste of nearly 600 pages.
0312600844|5.0|Some of the reviewers giving negative reviews are a bit shocking. Why all the anger? I can only assume the book affected you enough to draw such a strong emotion. But maybe that's something those who are so adversly emotionally affected should take some time to reflect why.     Anyway, I gave the novel 5 stars because it was thoughoughly entertaining. I was so pleased to have been given the book by a neighbor and find myself soaked up into the story of each and every character. The story was balanced perfectly to be complicated but real, which I really appreciated. I enjoyed reading a book that tackeled internal human conflict with depth and honesty. After reading it, I have found myself still thinking of all the implications of the title and the author's full intent...which I'd say makes the book even more interesting...that it continues to interest me and give me food for thought even after it's read.    I titled my reviewed based on the fact that I was intensly relating to these characters and this family dynamic because of their depth and the excellent story telling, so much so that it was mind bending...meaning the story had the ability to expand my knowledge of human nature.     Unfortunately, when you write as Mr. Franzen has, with such honesty, it does make some people angry and focus of the parts of the novel that offend them. I kind of have the feeling that although I thought the author offered a balance and honest view of each character's political and religious beliefs, some readers in today's climate may become immediatly offended that this is a mostly liberal, non reglious family, even though, that is not the point of their story. I don't understand that mind set because my own beliefs are actually opposite of the main characters but I was able to fully embrace them, love them and understand them.

0684833395|4.0|Catch-22  proceeds as a novel that increaces surrealism and transforms nightmares into actual tradgey moments  develop coming in the story.  I believe Catch-22 is a well written war novel that blends different moods,which express each characters point of view on life as troops.This Novel discusse the ups and downfalls of World War II.<br /><br /> One character who I found most intersting in the book was: Yossarian. Yossarian is character who captures personal fears and opinions of  his troubles in life. He reminds me of high school and all the pressure you go through,inorder to get your goal done. However in high shool, you have to deal with passing examens,inorder to get a good grade. Instead of passing examens, Yossarian has to passed missions, inorder to become a well trained war flier. Yossarian is trying to indenify his way through life, under pressure and  protecting himself and troops,who Yossarian is in charge of.<br /><br />Catch-22 is novel that can truly show you how most military families are and the obstacles we go through,inorder to have a love one safer from any type of war that's over seas. Most people don't understand what it takes for a person to fight for a country that may not be right all the time. It takes encouragement and self-control to fight in a war that may  never end for both real troops and the  troops express in thew novel.<br /><br />Overall this novel is truly an amazing story that could teach you lessons upon lfe and what not to do that may leave you scar for life.  This novel express every aspect on each character's view on life,whether they found tradgey upon thier battle buddies or closure from their distance families.
1433523930|5.0|I have not read this bible from cover to cover and I'm not going to go into detail about every single thing, KJV versus ESV that sort of thing.  I believe you read what ever it will take to help understand and receive the Word of God.      The bible is big and substantial, the cover is soft and rustic looking, the pages are beautiful with easy to read print. It is packed with information that will bring God and the life of Christ alive. I have the KJV study bible, the NKJV study bible, the Open Bible, and I have to say that this bible takes all that is good about each and everyone of the them and wraps it in a truly quality study bible.    I would definately suggest this bible for the seasoned who wants to go deeper into the Word, the student who wants to learn more, or the beginner that needs comprehension and readability.

0307266303|5.0|Born to Run is a true story that centers around the Tarahumara Indians who live in western Mexico. This tribe is known for unbelievable feats of running endurance. Wearing home made sandals as foot protection and fueled on lots of corn, they can run for distances of 100 or more miles without much difficulty.<br /><br />Christopher McDougal traveled to Mexico to see what they're all about and to pick up tips that could help in his own running. During his travels, he encounters numerous \\"characters\\" including a man who calls himself Caballo Blanco. Caballo Blanco is an American who has lived among the Tarahumara for more than a decade and has incorporated endurance running into everything that he does.<br /><br />After returning to America, McDougal stays in touch with Caballo Blanco who sets up an ultra race in the beautiful but desolate Mexican Copper Canyons where the Tarahumara live. His dream is to bring together American ultra marathoning great Scott Jurek, a number of other top ultra runners, and the Tarahumara who are regarded as some of the most incredible endurance athletes ever.  McDougal helps organize the American side of the race and brings about 10 other runners with him.<br /><br />One of the runners is called Barefoot Ted who virtually always runs barefoot or with minimal foot covering. He provides an interesting foil to Caballo Blanco, both being unique characters in their own right.<br /><br />The book makes a strong case for the benefits of barefoot running and the possibility that running shoes may actually cause more injuries than they prevent. They also discuss something called the Running Man theory that postulates all humans were created to be runners and discusses group endurance hunts. These endurance hunts involved running after prey and keeping at it until the animal died of exhaustion. While humans are not nearly the fastest animal on the planet, we have greater endurance than a vast majority of all others. For example, given enough time and distance, a man can outrun a horse.<br /><br />McDougal's journalism background shows throughout the book as we see vignettes telling individual character stories that feed into the overall narrative of the Tarahumara and culminating in the race. He delves into the science behind running as well as telling interesting background stories for each of the people represented in the book. He clearly performed a great deal of research when writing the book.<br /><br />His writing style is funny, engaging, and off the cuff. There are a few spots where the language is a little off color and a few scenes are described in a bit more detail than is needed. He discusses macro-evolution theory as fact but if taken with a grain of salt, the perspective is still interesting as it relates to running. These elements do not overly denigrate an otherwise fascinating and fun story. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone interested in running, geography, or just a plain good story. Incidentally, if any movie producers are looking for a good potential movie, this would make a great story with a full cast of characters.horse.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|Josh Groban is my absolute favorite singer. I have flown across the country...driven many miles just to hear that beautiful voice live. When I met him, I told him how his music gave my dying grandfather so much comfort - he hugged me and I was so grateful. I love Josh Groban as a musician...and as a very kind person.  I am a long-time Grobanite and I support his humanitarian efforts whenever I can. I am going to be honest here, as others are not, in the hopes that Josh will grow from this experience.    \\"Illuminations\\" is a life lesson for Josh. He wanted to spread his wings - as most performers eventually do when they feel misunderstood or held back.  Change your management...change your producer...change the formula...write your own music...depart from the norm...move to a new city...finally get that Grammy!  If it works, great...    The problem is, it doesn't usually work and you lose dedicated fans, the label loses money, the tour under-performs...and the artist learns that you will never be loved by everyone - best to please those who already do love you and find another way to grow....like say, acting on TV or hey - Broadway!    What does Josh really want to be when he grows up? Once the dye is cast, you can change pieces, but not the entire dye. Josh's voice is gorgeous - he needs to grow that big voice.  Bocelli...Buble...Dion - all huge voices that are not trying to be what they're not...all of which have Grammys...all of which have David Foster.    This CD is a case of artistic defiance - it is an artist's attempt to grow.  I find it to be awkward and dark - not at all what I want in my IPOD from Josh.  I am disappointed as I have waited so long for new music...but if this gets Josh back on track, it will be worth it.

That's what they were called, as there heads seemed too large for their stick-thin bodies.<br /><br />I bought the book after reading a sample from Amazon and am thakful I did. It has forever changed my opinion of Portia. My heart breaks for the 12 year old child who was encouraged to start model dieting by her mother. I'm sure her mother didn't realize that she and the modeling had just set her daughter on a dangerous path of anorexia and bulimia.<br /><br />Most if all, my heart breaks aches for Portia as she felt she had to hide who she truly was.  I think that Portia and Ellen are a beautiful and positive example of what finding true love really is about.  In light of all of the recent LGBT suicides in our young people, I hope they will look to Portia and to Ellen and know that it does get better and that there are people who will love them for who they are.  So brava, Ms Portia Degeneres! Job well done!

031603438X|4.0|The single greatest testament to the resiliency of the human body no matter what you put in it or do to it is Keith Richards. This guitarist and riff master for the Rolling Stones for the past near 50 years spent more than 10 years as a heroin junkie, snorted more cocaine than Charlie Sheen in a decade of `bad nights,' rolled over more expensive cars than James Bond, smoked more cigarettes than Humphrey Bogart on a film loop, and been exposed to more potential STDs then, well Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />But to read it from Keith himself in his new autography, \\"Life,\\" his saving grace was that he `always had the pure stuff.' His cocaine and heroin was always pharmaceutical grade; he kept track of his tolerance levels, and the jet set groupies he rolled with and often supplied him were protective angels along the road. He boasts of being Number One for more than a decade on the list of celebrity rockers `most likely to die.' And yet, here he is in 2010 somehow remembering more than 550 pages of growing up a single sensitive kid in Dartford, England, rattling off early blues record influences, forming a band with his mate Mick, starving for gigs, sharing a flat and some birds, striking it big, becoming a jet-setting millionaire bohemian, escaping Britain's taxes, and somehow avoiding getting arrested or permanently imprisoned for drugs, contraband, speeding, tripping or any other number of civil violations more numerous than a file cabinet in a New York City police precinct headquarters. The man lived, for sure, and here's his Life as he remembers it, and as we vicariously get the pleasure (or not) of experiencing.<br /><br />How do you sum it all up? His philosophy, I mean; not the copious amounts of smack or speedball ingested, or five-string guitars open tuned. Well, perhaps the incident of Keith's reaction to hearing about the death of one of his best `mates' Gram Parsons in the U.S. while he was in Europe explains best. Was his first instinct to be sad, or to mope, write a song, mourn, or possibly hop on a plane to join Gram's other mates smuggling his body out into the Joshua Tree desert to give it a proper Viking funeral? Nope. Keith is a firm believer in the saving power of distraction. Heroin is a great distraction from actually living your life or dealing with the bumps because there is a constant parallax between what is actually happening to you and where you are experiencing it from (somewhere a bit removed), except of course when you have to go cold turkey. If you tend to be an oversensitive artist type, it's perhaps understandable to anesthetize yourself from the nonstop barrage of a life you never expected or anticipated - especially when you can afford the `pharmaceutical grade' stuff (or the birds are just giving it to you).<br /><br />So what does Keith do when he hears one of his best friends has suddenly died from an overdose (he didn't monitor his own tolerances correctly, Keith explains)? He jumps on a plane to Germany with another mate and spends the next few days trying to track down the `most beautiful model in Europe.' Not to shag her, mind you, though he accomplishes that later. No, he does it just to have a mission that will sufficiently distract him from the loss he was probably never emotionally prepared to feel. And I get that.<br /><br />Reading these live action adventures of the Pirate of the Parrot Cay (and every other exotic locale you or I can mostly just read about), you just might get it, too. Scoring dope can get pretty boring and repetitive, especially when that seemed to be the main goal of his life for so many years, but in between, there's some `pure' good stuff.ourn, or possibly hop on a plane to join Gram's other mates smuggling his body out into the Joshua Tree desert to give it a proper Viking funeral?

Probably should have read the other two first but I did find the final book very readable and within the first 100 pages Larsson catches the reader up well enough for the reader to enjoy the 600 page conclusion as a stand alone book.  Loved the book and how Larsson tied all the loose ends together perfecly.  I mean perfectly.  There are many popular authors who should read this book and learn about it.  In many books the loose ends become a tangle and are a poorly tied rush job, but Larsson's conclusion was paced perfectly...masterfully.  The theme is classic: good vs evil.<br /><br />In time I'll read the other 2 books in order. Right now I'm just glad my curiosity got the best of me and I finally read this story of adversity and triumph and good and evil.  Sadly though, it was his last work.  Although I only read this, the 3rd book --I'm sure it would be better to read them in order.  What did I know,  I thought the books were just hype.  Shame on me.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|well Vb, i concur with the first two comments, and one of them asks a very simple question of you  '' why give it 5 stars ?'' , a very pertinent and valid question surely. Yo submitted this review ...back it up. It seems all concerned agree that 'The Promise' is pretty good, but nowhere nearly good enough to have diluted the wonder of Darkness.<br />So , its nothing personal, the question goes out to all those people who give an album '5 stars'... even though they then go on to list a number of percived 'faults' ,complaints,disappointments,etc.<br />5 out of 5 , is numerically , at least equal to 100%, ie: perfection !. so ????.<br />ok.im being pedantic , i admit it.<br />...but if Darkness is a far superior album, (and Born To Run), surely this release should be deducted ! star, at least , to denote the difference. This idea of '5 stars ', across the board ,for ones fave artists ,helpls no one.<br /> ie: someone ,a lot younger than i ,ha, is curios about which Springsteen album he should buy ,as an introduction,  ... what does he find, Darkness and The Promise , and everything else are equal ???.<br />I love all the mans albums, ...but the sure all hell are not all 5 stars,or equal.<br />For now i rate this cd 3 stars, it might grow to 4 in time....but it will never be anywhere close to 5.<br />Oh, and give me the 'raw' sometimes even vicious production of 1978, over this sterile ,smoothed over, radio friendly release every day of the week. Its a 'nice' album.  Darkness Wasnt a 'nice' album...indeed rock n ' roll...should never be nice in this way !.<br />All that said, it's Bruce,  he does'nt do bad,or even average...it's pretty damn good.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|Before I begin I want to get one thing out of the way: I am absolutely in love with Matt Smith as the Doctor AND I am completely blown away by the visual quality of Doctor Who on Blu-ray!  More please!    BUT - I have to agree with Amy below that the packaging of the Fifth Series is unforgiveably cheap and shoddy.  I have had my set of the Fifth Series less than one week and the packaging is already starting to fall apart.  This is especially disappointing when compared to the previous four Series boxes which set a very high standard for DVD packaging.  The way those sets fold out to reveal a fantastically rich and panoramic image makes them something I will always treasure, and the way the First Series disks form a puzzle with the fold-out image is an incredible treat!  In terms of both content and quality, the packaging for the Fifth Series simply doesn't measure up.    Shame on BBC & 2-entertainment!  Doctor Who is an incredible product that deserves the very best treatment - and so do Doctor Who fans!
B000NY17J6|5.0|As noted, this is the original Volume 1 and Volume 2 released together on 1 CD.  Together, this combined Greatest Hits collection spans Linda Ronstadt's best work from the 1970s (everything has a 1970s copyright date).    I don't know what happened to the other person who gave this only 3 stars, but my copy played loud and clear on my equipment, and I don't buy junk, and my ear can pick up flaws quite well.    If you've been looking for Linda's 1970s work, this is the best place to start.

1933492953|5.0|\\"It's easy enough to learn how to draw. It's very difficult to learn how to think.\\" Howard Pyle    There are multitudes of \\"how to\\" art books available, all with wonderful explanations of different  techniques for improving are work on the surface. But the ones that try and effectively explain the thinking  process of making pictures are few and far between. \\"Framed Ink\\" is one of those. I recommend it highly  for any artist who is seriously interested in telling stories with his pictures. While Marcos's artwork is  fully of visual bravado, each drawing never loses its focus on the essential: the story. The book examines  not just how to make your drawings pretty, but to give them depth, character and meaning.    A must for the graphic storyteller's library. It might be the best examination of the storytelling process  I've seen since the Famous Artist Course.    Mike Vosburg
0312356854|5.0|July 1942 marked a dark period in the history of France where thousands of Jewish families were rounded up and forcibly kept in the Velodrome d'Hiver. They were then sent off to transit camps in France such as Drancy, before being packed off to Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp. What is disturbing about this whole incident is that the rounding up and mobilization of Jews for deportation was done by the French authorities.<br /><br />Based upon this seldom mentioned, little known piece of French history, author Tatiana de Rosnay has crafted a well-written novel that alternates between the past in 1942, and the present. The past centers around a 10 year old Jewish girl Sarah Strazynski who is forced to go to the Velodrome d'Hiver with her mother and father, innocently leaving behind a 4 year old brother Michel locked in a secret cupboard with the assurance that she would return to let him out when it was safe.<br /><br />The present revolves around writer Julia Jarmond, a transplanted American who is married to a frenchman and finds herself being consumed by the story of the Vel d'Hiv incident. As she digs deeper, she uncovers dark secrets surrounding her husband's family which are connected to the deportations of Jews from France. As the truth emerges, the author deftly handles the question of guilt caused by supressed secrets and how the truth can sometimes not only bring about pain and disrupt the regularity of life, yet also have the ability to heal and move forwards into the future.<br /><br />The method employed by the author, which alternates between the past [1942] and the present is an effective tool for it ties both periods together and brings the story to a satisfying conclusion. I do confess though that I found the story of the past much more dramatic and interesting than the one which deals with Julia in the present. On the whole though, it was an engrossing read and I would recommend it, especially to those interested in the genre. I'd also recommend the following books which deal with the Holocaust and France: \\"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews\\" by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction), \\"One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France\\" by Fred Gross (memoir), and \\"France:The Dark Years, 1940-1944\\" by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period).with the Holocaust and France: \\"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews\\" by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction), \\"One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France\\" by Fred Gross (memoir), and \\"France:The Dark Years, 1940-1944\\" by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period).
B0040BF4L0|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One is a charming series that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and uptight Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.<br /><br />By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.<br /><br />There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more.<br /><br />This is a wonderful British period drama that makes you feel all warm and wonderful!clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms.

B004132I4S|4.0|[[ASIN:B004132I4S The Age of Adz]] is an album that is almost designed to be under-appreciated, and that's a shame.  This is one of the more enjoyable and thought-provoking albums I have bought this year.  There are albums to compare it to, but this is not the sort of music one would call \\"accessible.\\"  In many ways, those who will have the hardest time appreciating this music are the more ardent fans of Sufjan Steven's previous albums.<br /><br />I shudder to classify this as experimental music in the indie rock vein, because here you have a clear concept where many experimental albums are searching for one.  This is an album that requires patient listening and multiple plays, yet that alone won't be enough for people stuck on the more accessible prior Sufjan Stevens albums.  This album is neither better nor is it worse than those albums.  It is simply different, and it stands on its own very well.<br /><br />IMPOSSIBLE SOUL AND OUT OF PLACE TRACKS<br /><br />It is tempting to critically dissect these tracks.  Some tracks, like \\"I Want To Be Well,\\" seem better designed to be played live.  Others are just so unconventional that they seem out of place here.  But all of them are good in their own way.<br /><br />\\"Impossible Soul\\" provides a perfect example.  It's really an EP on its own.  It brings to mind groups like Phoenix, MGMT, and Passion Pit.  This track is less of a song and more like a mash-up of 7 or 8 diverse songs.  There's even an auto-tuned section around the 11 minute mark that is indicative of its range.  It would be normal to think these various elements to be scattered, but careful repeated listens reveal its satirical beauty.<br /><br />There are more *pop* elements buried within this track than on the rest of the album.  But because they are not accompanied by much lyrically, they take some work to fully appreciate.  I don't mind getting two albums for the price of one.  Unfortunately, the lyrical repetition and track length may be off-putting to some.<br /><br />START HERE<br /><br />Those on the fence should explore the following tracks first.  They may be more accessible, with vocals that are more forward versus the instrumentation that takes a front seat on so many other tracks.<br /><br />The first track, \\"Futile Devices,\\" is reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkul's [[ASIN:B00005NKKZ Bridge Over Troubled Water]].  Sparse piano and guitar accompaniment give the harmonized vocals a dream-like quality. \\"Now That I'm Older\\" is a track that evokes the mood of songs like Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"  The beginning brings to mind angelic choral chamber music, but the instrumentation comes in waves over the early and middle portions before giving way to the vocals again.  This pulsating instrumentation is used in other songs too, like \\"All For Myself.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Walked\\" is perhaps my favorite track.  The moderate vocal reverb and familiar theme of romantic longing makes it easy to relate to.  The instrumentation alternates between mid-tempo rock and keyboard infused chamber music.<br /><br />\\"Vesuvius\\" is just a beautiful song.  I am reminded of the most recent album from Imogen Heap, [[ASIN:B0028Y5MY0 Ellipse]].  \\"Too Much\\" also brings that album to mind both in the vocals and the instrumentation.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is an album that may grow on you if you are patient.  It will be most readily appreciated by fans of the experimental and layered instrumentation.  It fits in nicely in the alternative and indie categories.  While it may have an uphill battle on the independent radio circuit, most music nerds and seekers of new music should find something of interest here.<br /><br />Enjoy.fence should explore the following tracks first.

B000FC1GJW|1.0|I enjoyed The Golden Compass greatly. However, at the Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass go far beyond books appropriate for the target audience. The story is less a fantasy, and much more an indoctrination into atheism. Obviously the author is free to write as he chooses. However, I certainly would not recommend this for young readers or for most anyone, for that matter.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific, quite simply, is powerful, compelling, horrific, tragic, human, inhuman, and an accurate represenation of what it meant to be a US Marine dropped into the fiery hell of combat with the fanatical Japanese across seemingly meaningless atolls strewn across the South Pacific.<br /><br />The production values of this DVD set are incredibly high and realistic throughout. You will feel every emotion when you watch it. There is no holding back here. This is the brutality of war like has rarely been seen. It will bring you to tears and you will wonder how on Earth any of these men could have survived much less retained their sanity.<br /><br />The 3 main characters whose eyes the story is told through are all unique in their own way and give the viewer the ability to view the horror of war as if they were one of their buddies right along side. Robert Leckie is the brash young newspaper writer who shows us that the will to survive in the face of total insanity is indeed doable. John Basilone is the reluctant hero of Guadalcanal. He is a man's man, a marine through and through who shows us all what a true leader should be. And then there is the shy country boy, Eugene Sledge, who along with his comrades experienced more than anyone could take but found a way to cope and enjoy a very successful life after the war.<br /><br />All of these stories needed to be told. And I feel humbled and richer for finally seeing how it actually was for these men.<br /><br />The only reasons I gave it 4 stars were because I felt, especially with the first few episodes, that they were a bit too short. I would have liked to have had better introductions to the characters. But by the time I had finished watching all 10 episodes and viewing all the bonus features this was not as big a problem as I felt initially. I also was not particularly happy with the number of sexually oriented scenes because I felt they were thrown in merely to titilate and did not really help the story at all. We all know these men met women while on liberty. No need to exploit this to the degree as was shown. After seeing Bob Leckie's widow in the Special Features I actually felt sorry that she would have to view her husband making love to another woman and having it so graphically depicted.<br /><br />But those are just small quibbles. This is a great mini-series and anyone who loved Band of Brothers (My all time favorite!) should really enjoy this. I also believe that watching it multiple times will increase your appreciation for what they have done here. And the musical score is fantastic as well. I just love that opening theme! So soaring and majestic!<br /><br />Semper Fi Marines!ile on liberty. No need to exploit this to the degree as was shown.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire / 978-0-545-22724-7<br /><br />In my review of \\"The Hunger Games\\", I noted that I thought this excellent series to be the best books I have ever read, and I enjoyed them so much that I rushed out and bought the audio books immediately after I finished reading the series.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" continues very shortly after \\"The Hunger Games\\" ends, with Katniss settling uncomfortably into the life of a celebrity after returning home victorious from the hunger games. Although she is understandably pleased that her mother and sister are set for life (or, rather, set for HER life, as the victor's spoils run out after a victor's death), and she is happy to share her riches with the other serfs of her district, she also grapples understandably with ennui (now that she has no more school and no daily `job') and realistically with post traumatic stress disorder - Katniss is plagued with nightmares and survivor's guilt.<br /><br />The love triangle that has developed between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale has now deepened into something dark and painful; the capitol leaders are intent on making it clear to Katniss that the part she played in the games, she will have to play for life, and it's fascinating how much Collins is able to convey that the victors are still, ultimately, slaves to the capitol - in some ways, it's hard to escape the feeling, as a reader, that the children who die in the arena are the \\"lucky\\" ones. The district serfs are serfs for life; they can be made at any time to fight to the death for the amusement of the capitol, and not even victory can save them from being nothing more than slaves.<br /><br />Although it is true that \\"middle books\\" in series are often the most dark (think \\"Empire Strikes Back\\"), \\"Catching Fire\\" is, in some ways, a bright light in this series. Katniss and Peeta form a much stronger team this time around, as close friends instead of forced collaborators, and both are now put into a position where their strengths are allowed to really shine - Katniss blossoms as a truly efficient huntress; Peeta shines as a superb negotiator. Any lack of character interaction from the first book is strongly averted in \\"Catching Fire\\" - as readers, we are allowed to see the other victors from previous years, and to laugh at their gallows humor and cry as the scars of their souls are exposed.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is one of those rare sequels that - I think - will please both fans AND non-fans of the first book alike; everything that was beautiful and stunning about \\"The Hunger Games\\" is here again in full force, and anything that might have been lacking (from certain points of view) from the first book are deepened and fleshed out here.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolllowed to really shine - Katniss blossoms as a truly efficient huntress; Peeta shines as a superb negotiator.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay / 978-0-545-31780-1<br /><br />It's my opinion that \\"The Hunger Games\\" series is the best novel series I have ever read - I enjoyed them so much that I rushed out and bought the audio books immediately after I finished reading the series - and \\"Mockingjay\\" wraps up the series superbly.<br /><br />In some ways, \\"Mockingjay\\" is the darkest novel of the series - Katniss continues to grapple realistically with survivor guilt, post traumatic stress disorder, and the physical scaring and internal damage that has been inflicted on her in her relatively short life thus far. Whereas most protagonists seem to embody the \\"whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger\\" concept, \\"Mockingjay\\" provides us with a realistic portrayal of the scars and wounds of war as Katniss starts to doubt her motives more and more.<br /><br />Throughout the series, Collins has really shown her skill at character development, but \\"Mockingjay\\" stands out beautifully as an rare example of showing how wars and conflict can so thoroughly change people. As Katniss and Peeta struggle with understanding their own identities and separating reality from their war-induced hallucinations, Prim starts to develop from a victim in need of saving to a strong young woman supporting her older sister, and Gale starts to really explore the depths and bounds of his anger and warlike nature. It's amazing to watch the characters grow through the war that threatens to consume them.<br /><br />More than the previous two books, \\"Mockingjay\\" contains some seriously painful and scary material, not the least of which because the two main characters who have been such bright lights in the darkness thus far are seriously straining at the edges of sanity at this point. And yet I hesitate before saying that this novel \\"isn't for children\\" - underneath everything there's still so much hope for the future, and trust in the triumph of the human spirit. If you haven't read the first two books in the series, go back and read them first, and then pick up \\"Mockingjay\\" and - like me - you may sob your way to the satisfying conclusion of this excellent series.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollthem first, and then pick up \\"Mockingjay\\" and - like me - you may sob your way to the satisfying conclusion of this excellent series.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
0756405890|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, and I was starting to wonder if it was just a recycling of old ideas, but it had some good elements that kept me going, and I was completely behind it for the second half. For one thing the writing style is good... I am so sick of awkward fantasy writing with adverbs out the wazoo and over-explanatory dialogue. There were a few places where Rothfuss repeated things one too many times, but there were also a number of subtle points that were nice.    I do not think Kvothe is a mary-sue. I think it must have been a conscious choice to make the main character so clever, because he needed to be believable as someone who could become a hero. Anyway, his cleverness is countered by the fact that Rothfuss gives him terrible luck. (Very fun to read.) He is practical and he is not emo even though his life sort of sucks. I found him an enjoyable character.    The other characters were all good too. So many of the girls were \\"beautiful with dark hair\\", (starting with Kvothe's gypsy mom) that I found it hard not to picture all of them as that gypsy chick from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. But they are good characters.    Anyway, like I said, I think it's worth mentioning that this book made me miss my bus stop, and it's a big stop so it's hard to miss. And now that I'm done with it, I'm wishing I weren't, even though it didn't make me cry or anything. (And it's not hard to make me cry.)    My friend gave me \\"Mistborn\\" and I tried it but couldn't get very far. I miss Name of the Wind. :( I'm glad the second one comes out so soon.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games / 978-0-545-22993-7<br /><br />I read this series under recommendation of not one, but two friends, and now at the end of it, I can honestly say that I think this trilogy is the best series of novels I've ever read. It's sometimes difficult for me to write 5-star reviews, when I know that nothing I can say will convey the elegance and beauty of the novel nearly as well as just picking it up and reading it!<br /><br />It's difficult to know how to categorize \\"The Hunger Games\\". I suppose they're science fiction, of a sort - after a nuclear war apocalypse, the borders of the maps have been redrawn, much like the classic \\"[[ASIN:0373811977 Deathlands]]\\" series. The world as our main characters know it now consists of a single, decadent capitol, and the slum districts that surround it, where the serf-like inhabitants toil in destitution in order to support the lavish lifestyles of their rulers. Each year is a build-up towards a single event - the Hunger Games - where \\"tribute\\" children from the districts are placed in a single arena and forced to fight one another to the death.<br /><br />It's not pretty stuff, but Suzanne Collins manages always to show the highs of human spirit in her narrative as well as the lows. Amidst decadent corruption and destitute desperation, her characters exhibit incredible strength of will, determination of love, and an overarching need to protect the young and vulnerable. Fascinatingly, Collins manages to provide us with a heroine - Katniss - who is both an incredibly strong, determined survivor, and yet also an unreliable narrator - succumbing on more than one occasion to survivor's guilt, and doubting her own judgment and motives even as she struggles to save the people she holds most dear.<br /><br />Even if you don't care about character depth and development, it's hard to not appreciate the active pace of \\"The Hunger Games\\". Whether Katniss is fighting with her opponents, scavenging for food, or running for her life, the narrative is always fast-paced and hair-raising. Collins has a great sense of pacing, and understands when Katniss (and the reader) requires a moment of rest and recuperation; these moments are careful interspersed to provide much needed breaks between the horror and shock that is the experience of these brutal games.<br /><br />I personally found these books to be compellingly written and wonderfully entertaining (both as single novels and as a series as a whole); so much so that I purchased the audio book as well, narrated by the smooth tones of \\"[[ASIN:B002BWQ4C8 Law & Order]]\\"'s Carolyn McCormick. I should add, in the interest of fairness, that although 9 of 10 people I recommended this book to loved it (and couldn't wait to finish the series), my own husband didn't find the novel compelling enough to continue, citing his frustration that much of the meat of the novel features Katniss alone, with minimal interaction with other characters. For me, this was not a problem (and, as an issue, it is all but removed from the next novels), but I mention it here for fairness and as a reminder that no one book is perfect for everyone.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollthe narrative is always fast-paced and hair-raising.

I should add, in the interest of fairness, that although 9 of 10 people I recommended this book to loved it (and couldn't wait to finish the series), my own husband didn't find the novel compelling enough to continue, citing his frustration that much of the meat of the novel features Katniss alone, with minimal interaction with other characters.

B00009NQQO|4.0|My nearly two year old son loves this in the tub. He's actually pretty hilarious, the balls end up everywhere and hoop sometimes makes a splash. Entertaining way to coax him into the tub on the days he refuses. The only thing I didnt really care for was that the hoop \\"catches\\" the balls instead of releasing them, so for the few times he actually uses it correctly, he gets frustrated to try and retrieve the ball(s).
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It offers a vivid picture of how the world has changed in the last 50 to 60 years. Julia is a young, mature, woman searching for herself, and finding it in the thing she loves most. During her search, she is supported by her wonderful husband, whom she never forgets to appreciate. Their love story is so beautiful and heart warming. They were truly an amazing couple. And she is truly the Mentor of all time for those who love to cook.    Julie, on the other hand, is a young, immature, self absorbed nit-wit, who goes looking for herself in Julia's shadow and convinces herself she is a great person by the end of the movie. There is absolutely no comparison between the two, except in Julie's demented mind. She makes you nervous, irritated, and wishing you could spank her and put her in a corner. Her husband is long suffering, and decent, and you wonder why he was ever attracted to her in the first place.    If you can suffer through the \\"generation of today\\" parts of the movie, it is worth watching over and over again, just for the Julia and Paul half of it. It makes you long for the days of intelligence, virtue, and a world where you could safely go searching for yourself, and truly succeed in your dreams.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is the entire family's favorite show.  We all look forward to Wednesday night to see episodes from Season 2.  Season 1 was spectacular.  You get introduced to all the family members and see the characters develop more fully overtime.<br /><br />There are additional scenes and \\"family interviews\\" that are included as \\"special features\\" which for us was a real treat.  If you missed Season 1, it is worth the investment to buy this product.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|This movie is different from any vampire movie I have seen. The friendship between the the young girl and boy is very movingly portrayed. The supporting roles are fleshed out to give the setting a community feel. You can see some of the reluctance in joining in the bullying of the boys tormenting the young boy Oska. The movie is beautifully shot using the snowy landscape to good effect. A terrific movie that will appeal to viewers outside of the horror genre. Be sure to set the viewing options to Theatrical subtitles as the default setting subtitles destroy the translation.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I am not one to follow any series, but I saw the 1st couple episodes of the 1st season and was instantly hooked. The 2nd season is just as incredible. Frothing at the bit to see the 3rd season and more. The writing and the acting are the best. This series is addicting to both the 20' crowd and the 50's age group, as well. The storyline is full of twists and turns you can't predict.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|mines a little shorter than most; this is visually perfect! it is a true dark account of the meaning Dickens wanted to tell. misery on several levels, nobody was happy; even scrooge's nephew had his own worries, even if putting on a good face. true, not for kids; marley? kids don't need that! very darkly filmed; should give way to how the story unfolds. this is the ADULT film version, give children something of a lighter version. we thoroughly enjoyed this; yet not something to view over and over....to us, anyway.  FIVE STARS!  charlie
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This comes as a buyer beware note.  I ordered and then sent back the first release of the Avatar, because there was nothing new to be seen.  No special features, nothing...    This box is fully packed; disk 1 comes with 3 versions of the film. (the extra scenes add little but time, but are nice).   The second disk is full of deleted scenes, virtually an entire movie's worth.  I think over a hour of them.  Worth watching to see the editing decisions made to trim the movie.  The second and third disks also contain a lot of making of stuff.  Fun to watch if your into that stuff like I am.    Package is good too. Sort of a book format, with sleeves the hold the disks.  Weirdly the index is not on a page, but on a insert. So you have to keep the loose sheet to know whats on the disks.      A good buy, but now I have to look carefully at what I order and wait till a copy of the film I actually want comes out and not get suckered again.  If they want to sell lower cost, lite versions of the disks, fine, but don't milk the public by holding out a little bit more each time.

B000002NIW|5.0|NOTHING ELSE!  This album is just `perfect'!<br /><br />Breathe.<br /><br />I'm done.<br /><br />Seriously though, there are few albums within this genre that tap into the consistency that Deftones manage to layer from track to track on `Around the Fur', their sophomore album.  I'll see if I can reign in my excitement long enough to put my thoughts on paper.<br /><br />I'm not really this `OMG' about everything, I'm just really bored right now and when I get bored I tend to get overtly theatrical about everything.<br /><br />That said, `Around the Fur' really is one of the better `metal' albums of the past, well, twenty years or so, and may possibly be the best collective offering from Deftones.  They polished up their sound from their debt `Adrenaline' and balanced out beautifully their new directions.  The brutality they enlist on certain tracks is unmatched by many, and the way they can melodically intertwine their efforts is stunning.  I mean, listen to `Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)' and try to tell me it resembles `My Own Summer'.<br /><br />You can't.<br /><br />The album's opener, `My Own Summer', grabs the bull by the horns and gets the album off to a great start.  The closing track `MX' is vastly different yet equally stunning in the way they weaved texture in uniqueness throughout the track.  The garbles and backing vocals are interesting and memorable.  `Mascara' is disturbing in its ambiguity, although the idea that this is about abuse is not unwarranted.  `Around the Fur' is, musically, one of the catchiest tracks here.  That opening drum kick beat is insanely great.  `Rickets' is brutal in a controlled chaotic kind of way, while `Be Quite and Drive (Far Away)' is drastically different; very mellow in tone.<br /><br />`Dai the Flu' is genius; pure genius.  I love the way that the song is comfortable in its soft presentation.  Chino's vocals are sincere and delicate, yet riveting enough to carry the crunch of the chorus lines.<br /><br />`Lhabia', `Lotion' and `Headup' remind me a lot of `Adrenaline'.  They lack the forward moving progression of the balance of the album.  They aren't bad tracks at all (I love `Adrenaline') but they feel slightly misplaced with the overall feel of the sophomore album.<br /><br />Maybe I'm bias, since this album brings such nostalgic memories of chilling with my friends in the Florida sun, but I don't think many will argue with me that this album is certainly top (very top) notch!forward moving progression of the balance of the album.

B003KT3NRA|4.0|I saw this cd at walmart one day.  I had no idea that Vince Neil was releasing a solo project.  I heard somewhere that Motley Crue were in talks about releasing a new record (probably just a rumor at this point).  I picked up the cd thinking \\"cool...Vince Neil\\".  I didn't even look at the back of the case to see what it was.  I popped it in the cd player in the car and by the third track I picked up the case and really looked at the back.  I was immediately disappointed.  Crap....a covers record.  I shelved and didn't listen to again for quite awhile.  Pulling it out today, I decided to give another listen.  It's actually pretty good.  Not gonna say its great or that its the best thing he's ever done.  Dr. Feelgood or New Tattoo.....really any Motley record blows this out of the water.  But that's not saying that this is bad...its not.  Its just different.  If you like classic over rocks with a twist.  And rock it does.  Well worth the price of admission.    Now he needs to do another Motley record.
B00004Z400|5.0|It's not uncommon for a band with a nice following of devoted fans to come out with an album years into their success that finally gets them commercial success, propelling them into constant radio play, possibly even getting their music used for film trailers and attaining them frequent spots on MTV.  It is also not uncommon for that said band to `allegedly' sell out in the process and thus lose the respect of those fans who followed them from birth so-to-speak.<br /><br />`White Pony' was the album that made Deftones a household name.  The catch is, this album is 100% Deftones, and will not lose them any fans (but it surely gained them quite a few).<br /><br />I don't know how they did it, but they did.<br /><br />The album has a few low points, most notably the atrociously brutal `Elite', which doesn't capitalize on what Deftones can do.  The chaotic nature of the track is a turn off (which is a surprise to me) and it kind of takes me out of the more natural and progressive textures of the album.<br /><br />`RX Queen' and `Street Carp' are predictable and formulaic, but fun, and `Teenager' has a subtle bite, but it pales when placed up against some of their other `mellow' tracks.<br /><br />The rest of the album is simply divine.<br /><br />Most everybody has heard `Change (In the House of Flies)'.  It is one of the more commercial offerings from Deftones, but it never once feels like a detour from their established formula.  It has a haunting edge to it that sinks into each glistening moment, and that chorus line is catchy to the superlative.  `Knife Party' was my ex-girlfriends FAVORITE song for a long time, and so I listened to it a lot and it certainly grew on me.  I don't hate her so the song hasn't lost any of its spark.  I love the fact that the lyrical ambiguity wraps itself beautifully around the playful texture of the musicality, even if there is an obvious air of brutality at play.  The opening track, `Feiteceira', is a classic example of what makes Deftones so great.  It recalls the beauty of their first two albums with an ease and excitement only they can elicit.  `Korea' puts `Elite' in its place by completely obliterating it with a more polished and focused approach to chaos.<br /><br />And then there are the softer tracks.<br /><br />`Digital Bath' is kind of genius.  The song is so beautiful.  I mean, it just doesn't get any more fluid or calming on a Deftones album, and it's so intoxicating.  You just drift into the place it creates and dwell there for four minutes.  `Pink Maggot' is an interesting and expectedly disturbing way to close the album.  Sure, it's a repressed version of `Mini Maggot', but it contains far more passion.<br /><br />But there can only be one song that reigns supreme as the `best on the album' and that track is EASILY `Passenger'.  This song is one of the best ever recorded, by anyone.  The haunting quality is entrancing from start to finish.  It actually brought me to tears on more than one occasion.  There is a fragile beauty about it, something so off that it begs for an understanding ear.  You can hear pain and defeat with a passionate portrayal.<br /><br />Possibly the best song they've ever recorded.<br /><br />So, when all is said and done, Deftones continue their streak, expanding their fan base without compromising their vision.r first two albums with an ease and excitement only they can elicit.  `Korea' puts `Elite' in its place by completely obliterating it with a more polished and focused approach to chaos.

0385486804|4.0|I don't know that \\"Into the Wild\\" caused me to have strong feelings for Chris McCandless one way or the other.  I tend to believe most of us feel the urge at some point in our youth to get away from the world and learn about ourselves.  Few of us die as a result of these experiences, which makes McCandless' story novel.  They way he died is even more novel.    Though Krakauer digresses into stories of living in the wilderness of Alaska similar to Chris McCandless for a significant portion of the 200 page book, the story will hold the interest of readers.  As the author pieces together the delayed teenage angst of this college graduate, one must embrace the thoroughness of his research.  Krakauer must have spent significant time piecing togther the McCandless puzzle.  In what amounts to several journeys, McCandless met many people.  Tracking these people shows a dedication to research as well as the evolution of Chris McCandless as a person.  The apparent downward spiral of the traveler may be disturbing to some.    In the end McCandless chose not to embrace the life of this world which directly or indirectly resulted in him no longer being a part of it.  Whether he died of poisoning or starvation, better preparation or not chosing to go to Alaska at all would have saved his life.  In the despiration to find something to cling to in this world as our own, not every person is able to grasp what they want.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought this set after my Razer carcharias were stolen.     I do not miss the razer set i had one bit! after getting these.  the sound is way better, and they are more comfortable, and only half the price. they do a decent job at blocking out outside noise and fit comfortably over your ears. the hide away mic is neat feature for portability.    the only downside, i would not take these to a quiet place like the library because if you have them turned way up, the sound does bleed through the headset and others will be listening too. they could have a little more BASS too. but i liked them for gaming.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|I knew this was a 'spread your wings' type album for Josh, so I was keeping an open mind.  There are many great things about where Josh is as a musician, but as for the CD, I must say I'm disappointed.      One thing I love about the album is the \\"organic\\" or \\"stripped down\\" production style, which I favor in general and I love for Josh's voice in particular.  His voice is naturally beautiful, a gift he's been given and that he's kind to share with all of us.  I love the rich baritone and the warm, kind quality that comes through.  It's soothing and let's the message of the song enter your soul with joy and calm.  No one can duplicate what Josh was born with and it's kudos to him for respecting his gift and continuing to treat his voice with TLC. It only seems to get better year after year.  I've always had the feeling that he doesn't hear in his own voice what his listeners hear.  So though he may know he has a high quality voice, he may not fully realize that his voice has a magical quality for many listeners, this one included.    He seems to be in great form.  I'm happy that he took some time between CD's to be a person.  As a fan, he doesn't owe me music produced within a particular time frame.  An artist must be a person first, or else they'll have nothing to give.  I saw him in one of the \\"before we begin\\" concerts last month and his voice is better than ever.      I'm happy that Rick Rubin pushed him to write and that it caused personal growth for him.  At the same time, I think Josh and Rick should have recorded Josh's best writing and procured some other pieces that fit his voice better for the remainder of the songs.  Higher Window in particular is a favorite of mine, but others on the CD are just OK.  So despite the great voice and favorable stripped down production, song selection is just so so and unfortunately that LARGELY affects the CD's quality, unfortunately.
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you like the Beatles, or are too young to have been through Beatlemania and wonder what the fuss was all about, this is for you. A fabulous collection of film, some from the personal archives of the Beatles, that is just a fun thing to watch. Even for those of us who thought we had seen it all on the Fab Four, this adds a lot of interesting info. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|first off, i will admit this is a really good record. Most of the times when songs are left off records it is for good reason. Many of these songs did see the light of day but most of these recordings sound like modern/new recordings to me. Production sounds alot like \\"Magic\\" and \\"Working on a Dream\\" just not as loud. 4 stars because I question how old alot these recordings really are. Would love to be proven wrong.

B004132HZS|5.0|For anyone familiar with the 19th century Doyle stories, the re-telling of the original Sherlock/Watson initial meeting in a 21st century London is remarkably well done. The cell phone as gold watch delighted me, having been mesmerized as a kid by the original scene. The 21st century Holmes and Watson capture the same intensity as did the original- updated with amusing moments like \\"wonder if he is gay\\", from both men and Mrs. Hudson! The CSI-ish overlay \\"sidebars\\" demonstrating Holmes' photographic memory, etc. are slightly annoying, but in total, this IS Sherlock as Doyle would have made him in 2010.  PLEASE keep this series going!
B000056TKD|5.0|Of all the different versions of Holst's classic The Planets I've heard over the decades, Steinberg's simply passed me by for some reason. Having just heard it recently, it has instantly become one of my favorites. Steinberg's interpretation is relatively straight forward but compelling nonetheless. My favorites are those done by Boult in 1945 and Sargent in 1954.    But my main concern here is the overall audio quality. As has already been stated, the sound is basically bright and beautiful with great stereo separation. But the main issue here has been the lack of bass or midrange. So, being the audio perfectionist that I am, I think I solved that problem quite nicely.    What I have done is remastered each of the Planets through my computer using \\"Audacity.\\" I'll get straight to the point. Because of the high volume of each selection, I reduced the volume of each movement by -2.5db. I then added the standard \\"bass boost\\" option (200hz frequency response and \\"bass boost\\" of 12db). It was necessary to reduce volume because adding the bass boost increases the volume and would otherwise result in over amplification. I believe the results are truly remarkable with just enough bass response to enhance each movement without any exaggeration or distortion whatsoever. The results are particularly impressive on the quieter passages of Saturn and Neptune but have given the entire opus the \\"bottom\\" it was missing before. I didn't think anything needed to be done with the Strauss selections. Though totally unrelated to the Planets they are a nice bonus to this package.    Anyone who loves The Planets should definitely check this one out. And I hope my suggestions are helpful!
0525951652|3.0|Thriller writer Ken Follett occasionally rares back and passes a historical novel...and they are all uniformly excellent. Well written, well researched. The Fall of Giants is no exception, and surprisingly, at over 1000 pages, isn't fluffy at all. Many famous authors seem to intimidate their editors, but Follett either writes extremely tightly, self-editing as he goes, or his editor has the ability to rein him in as necessary.    I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in this trilogy. We've made it from 1911 through WWI to 1925...in incredible detail and with terrific description and fascinating characters.    Walt Boyes
0765326353|5.0|This is the book that pretty much every young, aspiring fantasist wishes she/he could write. You have an insanely original world with literally fantastic flora and fauna, brilliant world-centric magic systems, a fully robust mythology, each scene crafted for each character to move toward goals, consistent and excellent dialog, characters with a history that is dribblingly revealed in good doses, tension building, great plot pinches, and a staggeringly vast world.<br /><br />And with all of that, there's a story. A truly intriguing story that rises from the characters and the world that they live in.<br /><br />I can't say it's a perfectly crafted epic novel, but I don't think there is anyone living today that could get it any closer to perfect than Brandon Sanderson has done here. This dude knows his stuff and all of that notoriety he's gaining is well worth it.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to sink your teeth into, something with rich and real characters, something that will engross you and immerse you into a very alien but still somewhat familiar world--this book will get the job done.<br /><br />As I read The Way of Kings, I found myself wanting to know how all the character threads would tie together. At times I felt like the characters and the setting they were in was something of a vacuum, but the pay-off and reveals at the end make that slight issue a non-issue.<br /><br />Here's my cover copy or quotable summary:<br /><br />The Way of Kings is a demonstration of one author's remarkable development of the craft of storytelling. Not overly concerned with providing a roller-coaster of a ride, Sanderson gives his readers a complete world to inhabit, characters to fall in love with, and a story that will stagger the imaginations of readers everywhere. The Way of Kings is not a roller-coaster; it is a world-sized theme park that we could spend our lives in.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Absolutely one of the best films of 2010 and destined to be a cult classic!  It takes great acting skills to make a movie like this work and everyone in this movie was at the top of their game.  What made it so fun for me was that the storyline may not be that far from the truth someday.  It certainly captured the politics around immigration.  The Mexican network is a hoot.  Love Lohan the nun!

B001KVZ6ES|5.0|what people need to realize about this film is that the racism is merely superficial. The barbershop scene, and construction site scene are prime examples. Using epithets, but behaving in a very decent manner, is a hallmark of this movie. I was profoundly moved and impressed how Clint Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski (what a cliched last name however, i.e. Streetcar Named Desire), in effect, becomes a father figure to the two neighbor kids, Thao and Sue, who see through his \\"racist talk\\", and understand the good man he is .... while his own sons do not, are shallow, materialistic and see him as \\"only\\" racist ...    for those who think the ending was a disappointment, let me say this ... what would any loving father do for his children, if he had to sacrifice his life to save theirs? I know if I were in \\"Walt's\\" shoes, I would have done the same. It was a brilliant ending, NOT at all disappointing.     and ... the wrap-up (denouncement, if you will) i.e. funeral and will reading were brilliant, appropriate, and will make you smile ... maybe even shed a tear too ...    during Clint's \\"Dirty Harry\\" days, I was kinda ambivalent ... but as writer, director, actor (with depth) he's hard to beat ... as a professional songwriter, I even like his original music ...    I'd shake your hand anytime Clint ...

What an amazing, exciting and intelligent television series.  The writing and acting is fantastic.    I ended up staying on the couch and watching the entirety of season one in a bleary eyed marathon and then ordered my mother to rush out to score me season two.

B004AP09CU|1.0|No one's going to dispute the greatness of this album.  Here's the thing; Most of the people clicking on the link for these re-mastered versions are like me.  We paid for the album when it came out.  We paid for the CD when it came out.  And now that the record label has re-mastered it, they want to charge $1.29 per track?  It's not a whole new album that they need to recoup their studio costs on, how much could the re-mastering possibly have cost?  I'd like to have the modern re-master that sounds as good as it should on today's audio equipment, but I've paid for this album enough.  They even have the outtakes as a new release, \\"The Promise,\\" and they want a buck twenty-nine for those tracks that have sat around collecting dust for years too.  This is why the music industry has lost so much control in recent years, the greed never stops.  It has been well-documented that Bruce isn't a money-minded artist, but I wish he would've stepped in and insisted that the record label offer a fair price to his long-time fans.  Where's Tom Petty when you need him?  Oh yeah, there he is on Amazon with his recent album Mojo as well as his recent Live Anthology offered up at the standard .99 cent per track price point.  Go buy that and let Columbia continue to shrivel up and die.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Wow--I'll admit, I was quite skeptical, but The Centurion completely surprised me.  In a tired genre, this film managed to put a unique spin on the sword-and-sandal-in-Britain plot, fusing a bit of buddy-film and catch-me-if-you-can charm.  Beautifully shot, with an epic feel, there was a surprising amount of character development in a short amount of time--specifically the early cave scene, where some casual banter deepens the characters and draws in the audience for a rare investment.  The action was brutal yet realistic, the acting was very well done (Fassbender is a rising star indeed), and the film managed to tell a familiar story in a thoroughly enjoyable way.  It's nothing cutting edge, but it's certainly a gem in its genre.  Give it a view!
0143118420|1.0|Eat, Pray, Love is supposed to be Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir of her year-long quest to find herself and restructure her life after ending an unhappy marriage. In reality, Eat, Pray, Love seems to be Elizabeth Gilbert's selfish, egotistical attempt to make money. The story opens with a short description about the events leading up to Gilbert's decision to go on a year-long journey around the world. She uses very vague and ambiguous descriptions to explain the demise of her marriage and the subsequent downward spiral of her happiness in life. From the very beginning, it is difficult to understand the real reasons why she gave up on her marriage so quickly and easily, which makes it extremely hard for the reader to connect with her as a person. While I think she was looking for pity and compassion, the reader's emotions tended to turn towards extreme disconnect, an inability to relate and anger and disgust with her decisions.   Without being able to relate to Gilbert and understand her decisions in the beginning, I should have taken that as a sign to stop wasting my time and find a different book to read. However, my persistence forced me to continue, and to say that I forced myself to read the remainder of the book would be an understatement. The few, albeit far between, bright spots in the book helped me continue. For example, Gilbert is an amazing writer who has a way with words. Her prose was easy to read, and she was able to describe things using vivid words and descriptions that were almost poetic. Also, there were occasional instances of humor that were enjoyable and entertaining. With that being said, the book is overall a narcissistic, self-absorbed memoir of a woman with whom it is impossible to sympathize.    In the end, I felt like Gilbert wanted to go on a trip. So, she convinced a publisher to give her a financial advance on the book that she would write on her travels and filled the pages just to keep in compliance with the contract that gave her the money to go on her voyages. Personally, I hope that her new life and marriage stays strong, just so the world will not have to endure a sequel.
0439023491|4.0|The way the story is going to spin in this book is predictable based on what happened in the first one, and unfortunately until it gets to that point, the story suffers a bit.  The main character for a while looks more helpless and confused than what she showed us before, but that might be attributed to a slightly larger cast of supporting characters.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the story picks up speed halfway through the book and finally delivers the poignant moments of drama, coated in blood and anger, and gets to be more unpredictable too.  The setup for the third book is quite interesting, which leads to the disappointment that there's only one more entry to tie everything up and you know it will not be the same as the previous two books due to the way the story checks out.<br /><br />Not quite as good as the first one, but still very entertaining.  On to the third one, I go!
0316098337|5.0|When you read a lot, you are excited by the prospect of something entirely new.  This is a love story like no other, a thriller like no other.  It is told entirely from the point of view of a 5 year old boy born to a woman while she is being held captive, having spent his entire life with her in the same Room.  What happens to Jack and Ma is revealed through Jack's discoveries and realizations in real time, no small feat for a writer to create a believable voice for such an unusual subject.  Not an easy book, but worth the effort.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I loved the original version of Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. She's gorgeous and the clothes are classic. But this newer version with Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford is one I will watch 100 times. Ormond and Ford are both excellent in their rolls but I am delighted anew every time I see it at the brilliant, funny, memorable one-liners (\\"Your idea of a long term relationship is giving your date a chance to order dessert!) that were written into this script by Barbara Benedek and David Rafiel. My 18 year old granddaughter and I watch Sabrina and repeat out loud all our favorite lines and laugh again and again. I bought another copy of this movie for me because I gave her my original DVD. This movie is just delightful!
B002ZG997M|5.0|I have never been a fan of Denzel as an actor.  I have tried to like him in Training Day, Deja Vu, etc.  Never have been a fan, until this movie.  I absolutely loved his character, the writer(s) did a phenomenal job at the plot.  I wish I could keep watching it, after everything was said and done.  I heard this movie got sub par reviews and I do not understand why.  This movie blew me away.  Bravo!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I just love this movie.  It is so very good and keeps your attention all the way through.  I say buy it you won't regret it.
B0044IJ1S6|3.0|I love love LOVE Depeche Mode and was really looking forward to this concert DVD, but I'm beyond disappointed with it.  I have come to the conclusion that Depeche Mode are not even trying anymore. This concert was a disaster.  Where to begin?  First off, the thing opens with shots of the audience holding up their cameras and mobile phones and taking pictures of the band.  Who wants to see that?  Where's the band?!  Secondly, Dave's voice in the first few songs is just atrocious - couldn't they have filmed this on a day when his voice was in better shape?  He doesn't even sing the full lyrics in several of the songs, preferring instead to let the audience take his place on vocals. Really. Enough, Dave - I bought this to hear YOU sing!  Then there was that one awful song near the end - Martin and Dave messing up the lyrics and giggling incessantly.  It wasn't a total waste, though.  Martin's voice was in tip-top shape, the stage design was pretty interesting.  That video globe thingie was pretty cool.  Other people say that the band is beginning to show their age and whatnot, but I think they've got several good years ahead of them yet and I sincerely hope that they can pull themselves together for at least one more tour - and a much improved concert DVD experience.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|November 18th, 2010<br /><br />1. S&M - upbeat; sexual. but not really my type of song. has a dance-y vibe and that's probably why it's the most downloaded song off the album on iTunes right now. 3/5<br /><br />2. What's My Name (Ft. Drake) - hot song. drake's feature is fine, but riri carries this song on her own. infectious as hell and has an island feel. 4.5/5<br /><br />3. Cheers (Drink To That) - a really chill song about living life to the fullest and not worrying. i like avril and i really like her song \\"i'm with you\\" which is sampled here, but the sample is not necessary at all. 4/5<br /><br />4. Fading - i really don't like the chorus in this song. it's the weakest part of the song because it feels tacked on and like she puts no effort in it. otherwise, it's okay. 3.5/5<br /><br />5. Only Girl (In The World) - this track gets me amped. and it's fun. dance-able. 4/5<br /><br />6. California King Bed - standard ballad. 3/5<br /><br />7. Man Down - a cool song with a reggae affinity. 4/5<br /><br />8. Raining Men (Ft. Nicki Minaj) - alright song. 3.5/5<br /><br />9. Complicated - love this one. pretty good. 4/5<br /><br />10. Skin - sexy mid-tempo. 4/5<br /><br />11. Love The Way You Lie (Pt.2) - part 2 to the original. gives rihanna's side more. 4/5<br /><br />Rihanna returns with her highly anticipated fifth album. It's solid, but a tad uneven in spots. The main disappointment was that she wrote NOTHING on the album yet wrote about half or so of the tracks on her last album [[ASIN:B002UXRH10 Rated R]]. I dunno what was up with that but anyway. Still some good songs here.<br /><br />3.8 stars or a 7.6/10<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"What's My Name\\"<br />\\"Only Girl (In The World)\\" &<br />\\"Man Down\\"
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|It is a thriller with twist I did not expect. A few friends said this movie was rather dull. I on the other hand disagree entirely, I really enjoyed the film.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|It's so eclectic and personal.  Listen to the words carefully (and may I point out here that you can understand ALL the words), and so many of these songs tell a story.  Wonderful!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I have read the sample and it must be a great story. Ken Follett must be a lawyer. He charges by the word. Until we stand up to these outragious prices and refuse to pay them, it will get worse. I am willing to not pay the price.
1416594787|5.0|\\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" blows Dawkins' other works out of the water.  He gracefully, and humorously describes the foundations, and fascinating mechanisms of evolution.  Some historical context is given, but Dawkins spends most of the book actually immersing the reader in the incredible/concrete/observable scientific facts that we are fortunate to have discovered.  Though the topic is solidly scientific/evidence based/scholarly, Dawkins doesn't shy away from his total admiration for Darwin, nor from his witty commentary about \\"deniers\\".  I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like a more solid understanding of the natural world.  One need not be an atheist to like this book, it will appeal to fans of \\"LIFE\\"(Discovery Series), and those who enjoy logical discourse alike.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|So you say you like disaster movies. Well, boy do I have a movie for your that is the mother of all disasters.<br /><br />That's not to say 2012 is a bad movie. It's actually a reasonable entertaining movie. Long on special effects, but unfortunately, long on hokieness too (If that even is a word). And long in time at 2 hours and 38 minutes, which was about one hour too long, give or take a disaster or two. 2012 is just one disaster after another until your left at movie's end gasping for breath and hoping there's actually some air in our world left to breathe.<br /><br />2012, which was directed by Roland Emmerich like he was directing a pinball machine, is corny and contrived. A \\"B\\" movie disguised as an \\"A\\" movie extravaganza. It's melodramatic in a funny sort of way. Predictable, but somewhat enjoyable, if you don't mind the stilted dialogue and less than believable secondary plot lines. If it had been produced as a \\"B\\" movie with less famous actors, this movie might have become somewhat of a bright spot.<br /><br />2012 sadly short on even the slightest bit of suspense as to what will happen next. I actually sat back and said what was going to occur in the next minute of the movie, even to the point where I knew the mistress of the big, bad Russian billionaire would shoot him the middle finger as she sneaked onto the survival ark (yes, there's actually 3 survival arks) while he was stranded outside.<br /><br />The movie starts in 2009, when Scientist Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) travels to India to discover from fellow scientists that the earth's core temperature is increasing rapidly, He rushes back to America, and at a fund raiser, he accosts White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser, played brilliantly by the always reliable Oliver Platt, and hands him papers that basically say the world as we know it is going to end, most likely in 2012, because that's when some ancient Mayan calendar says it is going to end; December 21, 2012, to be precise. Anahauser informs the President of the United States Thomas Wilson (Danny Clover, who plays the entire movie with a look of shock and disbelief on his face. Morgan Freeman was much better) of the dire circumstances. By 2010, The United States and the leaders of 46 countries start a massive, secret project to build several \\"arks\\" to insure the survival of the human race.<br /><br />They decide that only 400,000 people will be able to fit on these arks, that are being built at Cho Ming, Tibet in the Himalayas. In order to fund these arks, without tipping off the normal citizens of the world, they decided to sell these seats for one billion euros per seat. So guess who's going to survive the oncoming catastrophe. Not people like you or me of course, but only the leaders of the world, their staffs, scientists involved in the project, and thousands of billionaire bags-of-wind from dozens of countries.<br /><br />Enter Jackson Curtis (John Cusak) in 2012, a Science Fiction novelist who wrote a book only 500 copies of which were sold, one of whom, amazing to Dr Helmsley, who carries the book around with him like a pet rock.. Talk about non-believability. Curtis is so unsuccessful as a writer, he presently drives a limo for a Russian billionaire Russian (Zlatko Buric), who unbeknownst to Curtis, has bought several seats on the ark, for himself, his annoying two brat sons, his pilot (Johann Urb), and his girlfriend Tamara (Beatrice Rosen), who is secretly banging his pilot. For animal lovers, Tamara is constantly clutching a tiny dog in her arms, which leads to the predictable \\"oh please save the little dog from destruction\\" scene. (Insert cheers here)<br /><br />Curtis is divorced and his ex-wife Kate (Amada Peet) is currently living with her boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), who is a plastic surgeon (amazingly he did Tamara's boob job) and an amateur pilot, which comes in handy real soon. Also Curtis two kids are living with Kate and Gordon, Noah who is somewhat of a brat, and Lily, who still wets her pants at night and has a fixation with wearing hats, any kind of hats.<br /><br />Curtis arrives, hate of course, to take his kids on a camping trip to Yellowstone Park, where they meet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), a freaked out hippie who's doing a daily radio show that predicts the end of the world. He tells Curtis about a Mesoamerican Long Count Calender that says we are all finito on December 21, 2012. At first Curtis thinks Charlie is a little bats in the belfry, but changes his mind after Charlie shows him blueprints for the ark, and pictures of government officials from around the world who were murdered because they found out about the end of the world and the ark, and were about to alert the rest of us peons.<br /><br />Curtis rushes home with the kids and tried to tell Kate and Gordon abut the impending disaster. Before they can tell Curtis how crazy he is, the house begins to crumble and everyone rushed out to Curtis car. Thus begins a crazy car chase, where Curtis' car is being chased by the city of Pasadena crumbling behind them. They rush to a small private plane that Curtis had just rented and Gorden very shakily engineers the takeoff. Then they bob and weave through falling building and bridges to safely. But not for long.<br /><br />This is the start of one disaster after another. Too numerous to innumerate. Cities crumble like dust and tidal waves destroy national landmarks. The coolest one is where a tsunami destroys Washington DC, and the aircraft carrier The John F. Kennedy, carried on the waves, personally takes out the White House. (Too bad it wasn't occupied by today's residents.)<br /><br />Obviously 2012 is not Academy Award material. But it does take you on a wild ride, which is quite enjoyable, if you don't care too much that the plot is full of so many holes, it doesn't hold water as a top flight movie.<br /><br />I'll give 2012 two and a half stars out of a possible five stars. Only because the special effects are a doozy to watch.ation with wearing hats, any kind of hats.

B000001F76|5.0|Nearly 60 years ago (1951) as a little kid in NYC, my sister brought home (2) 78's, one being Hank Williams' I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry backed by My Bucket's Got A Hole In it. The other 78 was a Lefty Frizell. I was mesmorized. I'd never heard that kind of music before living in Manhattan. It was a precursor to Rockabilly and nothing like the Perry Comos and Eddie Fishers that ruled the airwaves in 1951. So it was a joy to finally buy this double set several years ago. It features all the legendary songs and they are too many to pick favorites. Just buy it! Hank Williams is an American icon and changed the course of country and pop music forever. By the way, many of his songs were covered by the likes of Jo Stafford, Joni James,Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney and many others because his style was a bit too raw for mainstream citified American, but the songs were brilliant and have stood the test of time.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Ok looks like I'm the first one to write a review. :D I just saw it in the midnight showing. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it in 3D because some dimwit decided to get the plain imax instead of 3d but whatever. Now to the movie. The part with harry seeing the dursley's off was not in the movie. Amazing, since that's one of the funniest parts of the book. I love seeing harry stand up to the dursleys. :D Um . . . I guess it wasn't too bad. They showed the part with the locket being destroyed and it was done fairly well. I couldn't believe that they got the actual dialogue from the book right because when they are converting it into script they for some reason think it's great to change the dialogue in a part that they show that's actually right. Not only did they get the dialogue right, but they got it in the right order! Amazing. lol.     As for the graphics, they were AMAZING! I loved how they made everything look so real, and made sure that the effects were utilized to their fullest potential. I think my favorite scene with the graphics would have to be the locket, and godricks hollow. Both were amazing.      I really liked that they added hermione's parents to the mix, showing what everyone was doing to prepare to search for horcruxes and such. It put a whole new level of feeling to the whole production. So cutos to those of you who made the movie.      While there are good things to say about the movie, of course there are bad things.      I couldn't believe what I saw at the ministry! I was so mad because when they used the poly juice potion, they became the same people that they plucked hairs from, but they totally screwed it up. Ron goes to derain yaxley's office, that was right, hermione went to the court rooms, and harry went to see umbridges office, but harry didn't take the eye, ron went with him to get hermione, and they all started changing back to themselves right in the middle of the ministry and NO ONE NOTICED! HARRY POTTER IS THE MOST WANTED WIZARD AT THE TIME AND NO ONE NOTICED! IN THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC NO LESS! Can you believe that? I think not.      They never use the invisibility cloak in the movie. Not once. And the only time they show them using the poly juice potion is in the ministery which as all of us potterfans know,  they used in godricks hollow and when they went into gringotts. Oh and we all know that everywhere they went they used the invisibility cloak in case something went wrong.      Oh and instead of disapperating everywhere, they WALKED everywhere! Can you believe that?      Oh and going back to the beginning, you know voldemort's name is taboo, well they didn't even say it and the deatheater's came. They weren't on tottenham court road. They were in some other place apparently. Oh well.      Maybe it's just because I love the harry potter books that I find all these flaws, but I won't spend all night writing them out because there are a lot and you probably don't want to read a review that long with flaws in the movie.      I will say this though . . . if you haven't read the books, it might be a little harder to follow than if you had. I had trouble understanding what the hell I was seeing when I was watching what harry was seeing when he went into voldemort's mind. And they happen so fast . . . you barely have time to register what you're seeing.      I was a little disappointed with this movie, although it is way better than David Yate's tragic failure at producing a good adaption of Harry potter and the order of the pheonix. It was the worst thing they ever could have done to a harry potter book as good as that. Took him three movies to even start getting better at directing them. Shame.      Okay and for all you people who have read this review when I first wrote it, I want to point out that I think this movie was the best adaption by far than the fifth harry potter movie to which I am no fan of. I loved some of the scenes that they had and I loved the fact that they managed not tocut out the most important scenes although I really would have liked to see dedalus diggle and hestia jones. I loved the movie, I am just pointing out things that could cause a problem later. The only real main concern I have is them not using the invisibility cloak because it becomes a big part of the movie later. I mean, it's common sense people, harry potter (the most wanted wizard in the world) is not going to be striding up the street without some sort of concealment where deatheaters are looking for them. Ok? So please, no negative criticizms on the comments? I am merely stating fact. While I give negative feedback, I also give positive, so try to focus on both parts, not just negative. Thank you.

No scratches, no blemishes on the box, and all 3 discs play just fine.  And the price was great!  Thank you.

B003YWUTJI|4.0|This new album featuring Norah Jones & a ton of other artists has something for everyone. There's a great mix of soul, jazz, R&B, hip hop, and much more. This album exposed me to quite a few artists I wasn't familiar with.     This album is not your typical Norah Jones CD, but her voice is unmistakable on every track. You will definitely find something you like!

B003H6KRIE|5.0|This box set is great.  In the title it states that it uses \\"slim packaging\\".  I am not sure what slim packaging is, but it is normal size.  The three disks are each in their own movie case, just like normal.  I thought it would be the three movies in one case or something, but it is normal.  As you would expect with the Bourne Trilogy, the movies are great and the Blu-Ray versions are fantastic.  Even the extras are what you would expect.  They didn't add anything new to the extras (at least not that I could tell) from the DVDs, but there is still plenty there for any Bourne fan.  Video and sound are what you would expect.      I recommend this box set to any Bourne fan.  The price is right and the movies are great!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|After seeing so many 1 star reviews, I just can't help but edit my review here. For anyone who gives this CD a 1 star, please go out and actually FIND and LISTEN to a 1 (or even 2) star album, then ask yourself if this album actually deserves such harsh criticism.<br /><br />I used to be very skeptical about people making a big deal of track ordering, but this album just shows me that track orders do matter. Even though I think \\"If I walk Away\\" and \\"Love Only Knows\\" are the weak tracks in the album, I don't want to skip them when I'm listening - this album just has that nice flow, making me want to listen from the very first minute to the last. When I fit the puzzles of preview songs into the big picture, they sound better than they used to. The album demonstrates how a good album should be - a collection of songs built around one concept, but each has its own flavor.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Bells of New York City\\" - maybe because I have a deep love for that city, too. The piano riff is simple, but perfect for the sound of bells. And Josh's depiction of the city in winter is so lively - I can almost feel the snow falling from the sky, shining in the headlights of those yellow cabs; and the wind bringing the winter chill to my face, yet feeling warm at the same time, just like the city. Rubin said they were trying to do something grand. They made it. The song is personal and intimate, while it's grand at the same time; it makes me feel humbled, in anonymity.<br /><br />The cover of \\"Galileo\\" is another stunning piece. I can't really find words to describe this song. It brings up so many things - those bittersweet memories, the innocent ages, and the pure love long gone.<br /><br />I have a growing love for \\"Higher Window\\". When I first listened to it on my computer, I wasn't so impressed. But after listening to it with my AKG K701, I'm deeply touched by the its subtlety and melancholy.<br /><br />Another great song is \\"War at Home\\". It has the gravity that can be easily related to the earth, to the lost souls in the war. It was not something I would expect from Josh, but I couldn't be more grateful to see him writing a piece like this, heavy but refined.<br /><br />This is one of a handful of albums that I cannot find any song I dislike. Even with my long time favorite \\"Closer\\", I can pick one or two. In this sense, I should probably list \\"Illuminations\\" as my favorite Josh's album so far. True that the songs seem not to have that mind blowing power as some old Josh's songs do - and I think they are not supposed to be. I can see why some people hate it so much; it's not a typical classical pop album, it doesn't have the flair that Josh's albums used to have. \\"Illuminations\\" is more artistic, more thoughtful. It requires a good stereo system (or a good pair of headphones) and a lot of time to listen to. After being fed with so much modified sound, my K701 can finally enjoy a crystal clear album this time. I'm fascinated by how many beautiful details there are in the orchestration and arrangements; these acoustic sounds are so brilliant. What's better is that the simpler arrangement creates a less swelling sound that doesn't distract me from listening to Josh's beautiful voice.<br /><br />Overall, I'm more than content to see that Josh becomes such an outstanding musician. Accomplished as he is, he's still venturing to new territories - in the music world, this is what keeps a musician alive and young. \\"Illumination\\" is a brave and thoughtful move, and deserves to be appreciated and embraced. So, for people who said this album is boring or amateurish, I recommend you sitting down in a very quiet room, playing it again on a real CD player, from the beginning to the end, and listening to it with your heart. Then maybe you can understand it more. Maybe you can understand him more.to the lost souls in the war.

I'm fascinated by how many beautiful details there are in the orchestration and arrangements; these acoustic sounds are so brilliant. What's better is that the simpler arrangement creates a less swelling sound that doesn't distract me from listening to Josh's beautiful voice.     Overall, I'm more than content to see that Josh becomes such an outstanding musician. Accomplished as he is, he's still venturing to new territories - in the music world, this is what keeps a musician alive and young. \\"Illumination\\" is a brave and thoughtful move, and deserves to be appreciated and embraced. So, for people who said this album is boring or amateurish, I recommend you sitting down in a very quiet room, playing it again on a real CD player, from the beginning to the end, and listening to it with your heart. Then maybe you can understand it more. Maybe you can understand him more.
142311339X|5.0|I absolutely loved the Percy jackson series and was sad when it was over. But then, Hark! Rick Riordan comes up with this one! It brings back all of the elements of Percy Jackson (mythology, teen romance, and daddy issues) and builds upon it. Now we have Roman myths, new characters, and the return of some of our favorite characters from the Jackson series.   Yay! hooray for Rick Riordan, teaching kids and young adults about mythology. I'm not exactly either one of these categories and I still love the books.  Now if only there was a pronuciation guide in the back, everything would be perfect...  I hate that i have to wait another year for the next one, though. Write faster Rick!
0446195529|3.0|While I've enjoyed the past Camel Club series, this book seems only to use Stone's friends as props.  The intrigue requires a bit of suspension of belief to seem anywhere near realistic.  And we go back into the old defunct and should be long decayed (I thought it got destoryed last time BTW)secret training center that everyone and their other brother has had time to crawl around an learn the secrets in the dark.  Again, the FBI, Secret Service and CIA are a bunch of nincompoops who can't even tie their shoes.  And the erstwhile care taker of  a cemetery can easily get the best of them.  He hasn't ran the series into the ground yet, but Baldacci should shift away from the rehash of old story lines.
0671449028|5.0|My son's about a year-old now, and I remember reading this book to him for the first time when we was a couple of months. We both got hooked to it pretty much from the first reading, and no book has ever given both of us the kind of pleasure that this one has.    What I particularly like about this book is that it has a small and simple story to tell, unlike most of the other books for infants. And it has great creatures, illustrations, and colours of course. The nicest thing about the book are the simple but catchy rhymes, giving the book a lovely cadence.     As for the sleeping effect, umm, well, it never worked on my son, but instead I landed off going to sleep many times by the last page of the book (honestly)! Oh well, at least it helped one of us.     Strongly, strongly, strongly recommend this book for all infants!
B00447G2MK|3.0|It sucks that A Day To Remember has changed as much as they have. In my opinion, they've become mainstream and have lost their connection to the audience they had. In this album, they cuss a lot more than any other album. Not that Im necessarily against cussing or that Im a saint of some kind, but it feels like they're being trapped under what the media wants, and whats going to get them famous instead of sticking to their roots. ADTR has been my favorite band since the release of their first album, and I've loved every single one following that too, with the except of \\"What Separates Me From You.\\" The one song, I'll say, that feels like the original ADTR is \\"2nd Sucks,\\" but one song out of ten doesnt cut it for me.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|This device worked as expected, there is only one problem. It is extremely slow! Make sure you get \\"Class 4\\" or \\"Class 6\\" microsd cards, anything else will be very slow and cause delay when playing games.    Nothing much else to say, if you need extra space on your PSP this is the way to go. I cannot see this being used in a camcorder due to the very slow speeds.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|We watched Iron Man 2 in the cinema but failed to capture the quality we were looking for so we were very excited to finally be able to see this again in the comfort of our home in high-quality blu-ray format. I think no one else can get away with playing Iron Man except for Robert Downy, Jr. so I hope to see him in the sequels, if any. Anyway, to those who are thinking of getting this, it's worth collecting and watching over and over again. That way, you can be sure to get your money's worth. You may also download your own digital copy onto your PC and take the movie with you when you travel. I'm from Manila, Philippines. The version that they're selling here comes only in 2 discs and is even more expensive. You see, blu-ray still hasn't caught the eye of the typical movie-goer or collector where I'm from, except maybe from those like me who are movie enthusiasts, that's why blu-rays come out to be quite expensive for the regular person. And I'm talking about both the players and discs. But if you're aiming for quality and pure viewing pleasure, then this is worth the purchase.
B00006JIA4|5.0|A fabulous collection representative of one of the great bands in rock history. There is something for everyone. So much can be said of this perhaps greatest of the \\"Greatest Hits\\"; volumes have already been written...I'll merely tell you about one of my favorites that seems to have been largely overlooked:<br />INNUENDO<br />A bittersweet journey on a grand scale of the human condition woven in with the profound musings of Freddie Mercury-a man face to face with his own mortality; ravaged by the loathsome disease AIDS. You can hear it in his voice. The music is emoting and powerful, engaging and beautiful: his masterpiece and swan song.  A gift to us all, really. We'd do well to pause from the whirlwind mundane busyness of our lives and ponder over such matters.
B002ZG999U|4.0|\\"The Expendables\\" is a sort of a throwback to the 80s-style action film making. It is about a good macho guy or guys with guns shooting (lots of) bad guys. The good guy has to complete one mission or more in the most disadvantageous circumstances. Those who have grown up with such films as \\"Commando\\" or \\"Die Hard\\" (the first one) know what I am trying to say.     The difference is, \\"The Expendables\\" directed by Sylvester Stallone has a lot of \\"good\\" guys played by our favorite actors including Jason Statham and Jet Li. A mercenary team led by Barney Ross (Stallone) is hired to assassinate a dictator in a South American country, where a local rebel Sandra (Giselle Itié) assists them. That's it. There are a few twists in the story, but the storyline itself is simple.    The film also features Steve Austin, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Gary Daniels, Dolph Lundgren and Eric Roberts. Each fighter (and ex-fighter) has their own signature arsenal or abilities - knife, martial arts, demolition, and so on - and when action starts, they never fail to use them. Not all guys fight. Mickey Rourke appears as an ex-mercenary and tattoo artist delivering a moving speech. Though brief, two cameos Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis are amusing.     Perhaps \\"The Expendables\\" feature too many stars. Screen time for some actors (Gary Daniels and Jet Li) is too short. Charisma Carpenter appears as Statham's girlfriend, but she is wasted. Still \\"The Expendables\\" certainly delivers what it promises: a pure, old-school action, and it works.
0307592839|4.0|Jennifer Egan probably employs one of the most innovative styles that I have read in a long while. The story is basically about a former punk rocker who later became a record executive by the name of Bennie Salazar, and a kleptomaniac former employee of his by the name of Sasha.  The story weaves, and backtracks, and changes points of view numerous times.  Each chapter might start in a completely different era, and feature a character who only played a minor role in the previous part of the novel. In the end, you get an overview of the time between the birth of American Punk Rock through approximately 2009. Various detailed insights by many different characters are presented, and each character might or might not be aware of the other characters' motivations or activities...kind of like \\"Real Life\\". It is not as confusing as it sounds, but I should have reread the novel, and tried to put the various pieces into a comprehensive Big Picture. But, it really isn't necessary since each chapter can almost be read as a very well written 'stand alone' short story.
B000024D4R|5.0|Ok, I'm not a big Floyd fan.  I really like Dark Side of course - but hated The Wall and the rest were ok.  But don't trash me...hang on...    Animals is brilliant.  It is a bloody masterpiece of fantastic rock, cynical but truthful lyrics that reflects our government, society and \\"unwashed masses\\" of people  (I can now listen to it and picture Barack Obama and the media and of course those followers passing out and crying for him when he walks by sneering at them)...sorry, politics aside, this is an underrated piece of wizardry that did not rely on digital music programming and reprogramming like is needed today, to sound ethereal and still rock.    Loved it when it first came out - I'm an old geezer - and love it now.    Buy it, put on some headphones and experience it.
0684833395|3.0|I was always told that this book was the ultimate in tongue-in-cheek humor. Unfortunately, although I found parts of the book both insightful and funny, it came across as rather dated.  Perhaps with the growth of a more sophisticated and subtle approach to this genre of humor, Catch-22 is showing its age.  Quite frankly, I got more out of watching re-runs of MASH (which probably has some of its roots in this book) then from reading this narrative.  The fact that it doesn't have much of a plot adds to the frustration.  A good read to get the sense of the time in which the book was written but, overall, old hat.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I must say I'm a little surprised by the negative reviews. If anyone knows how Wes Anderson directs, then they know this is just another great W.A. flick. I watched this with my husband who is 45 and my daughter who is 4. We all highly enjoyed this. It DOES have a plot AND it is visually interesting. We watched it four days in a row and found something we missed every time.    And just because it failed at the box off doesn't mean it was an actual failure, either. I rented it because I refuse to pay $10 a ticket for ANY movie. I have told many people about it and they thought it was great as well. It is not your 'run of the mill' crap that's being put out right now. It's a well done movie. Enjoy!
0143039431|5.0|Although I have heard a lot about this book, for some reason, it did not appeal to me as a \\"must\\" read. Truly an historical novel reflecting the misery and hopelessness of the despression but yet demonstrating man's resilence and hope.  The 1930's are almost three generations ago yet the book and it's story is timeless.  My only regret is that I waited so long to finally read this masterpiece.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|Ok, here we go. I couldnt wait to buy this release. I have owned a blu-ray player for about 6 months and only have T2 Skynet Edition. I figured this was the blu-ray release to get. First off, the 1st disc has 3 versions of the movie. The Theator Version, The Special Edition Re-Release and the new Collectors Edition. You can pick which one you want to watch very easily. There is also an option to only watch the scenes that where added. Very Nice! There is also an audio option for a \\"Family Friendly\\" version that cuts out any bad language. Now on to the quality...What can I say, its the best looking blu-ray I have ever seen!! The picture is perfect. No Complaints there. I had no compatibility issues at all. My blu-ray was up-to-date and had no issues.    Now on to Disc 2 and 3.. There first thing you will want to do is to watch the special features. There are fantastic. Alot of these are even better than the footage they added to the collectors edition. There is well over an hour of just deleted scences!! However, they are NOT broadcast in 1:78:1, but in 2:35:1.. that kinda sucked..As to the Documentaries, they are very informative and you get the full details of just about everything.     Now on to my complaints..The time it takes to load the disc and the time it takes to navigate back and forth to the menus is very annoying...Be forwarned if you are use to the speed of DVDs, get over it, blu-rays take longer...If you stop the blu-ray and turn it back on later it takes FOREVER to get back to where you where. Where as DVD is instant...Blu-rays stink in this aspect.this needs to be improved...
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I had the chance to take a listen to this CD before it hit shelves thanks to the One2One Network. I enjoy having music playing in the background as I do the day to day chores around the house.  This CD made for nice background music.  It was something that was relaxing and I could put on and listen to along while tending to my two young children.  One song that I enjoyed was \\"Baby it's Cold Outside\\", an old favorite, but sung beautifully by Willie Nelson and Norah Jones on the CD.  This CD features a handful of well known artists; Foo Fighters, Ray Charles, Dolly Parton, and Willie Nelson.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|The purists say this should not be called \\"Karate\\" Kid because they use Kung Fu, but this does stay close to the original story, so it's ok.  Jaden Smith does a fantastic job, he does not look like a \\"new comer\\". And who knew Jackie Chan could be serious?!  This movie will leave you with a smile on your face, and a smile in your heart.

B004259BMM|4.0|If you are a true Keith Urban fan he will never disappoint.  I have ALL of his albums (in CD form) and they are the best collection of my CD's to date. I think this CD was a tribute and acknowledgement to Nicole because every song sounds like a tribute to her.  I would love to feel and experiene that kind of love.  I'm still not done with the album but I would love and support Keith Urban if he were the only artist left standing.  He is amazing live, and in his life.

B001VNB54A|5.0|This HBO Series makes history personal. It is a very personal history of some of the men who fought in WW II. The story line follows these men through their day-to-day experience of fighting in the Pacific. If you have an aversion to blood, gore, and violence (cold and hot blooded), I wouldn't suggest this series. However, the displays of these things are not gratuitous.     The displays of violence, blood, and gore are displayed matter-of-factly in a very stark and realistic way, just the way that these events happened. This is a very real dipiction of war. There are no excuses made. No quarter is asked and none is given.    This war, like most wars, was fought mostly by ordinary men called on to do extroadinary and heroic things. It did for the Pacific what [[ASIN:B00005NNM5 Band of Brothers]] did for Europe in much the same way, so if you loved Band of Brothers, you'll love this.    While I was watching this show, it was so real that it almost felt like I was there. I believe that this was intentional. Of course, I'm very glad that I wasn't there.     It makes me want to do more in-depth research because these battles were in some really out-of-the-way places, and it makes me wonder why battles were fought in places like Guadalcanal. Of course, this series was not intended to provide a detailed history, but provided only enough detail to let you know where you were.    In my opinion, the places themselves were not the interesting part of the story but the battles themselves and the men who fought them. This, the Series portrays in intimate detail.    This series was based on several books written by (or about) the men portrayed in it. These books are probably described somewhere in the product description. For one, I intend on reading the book by series character Robert Leckie [[ASIN:0553593315 Helmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific]]. I might also be interested in the book about series hero John Basilone [[ASIN:B0030V0PII Hero of the Pacific: The Life of Marine Legend John Basilone]].
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Sweet, funny, breezy stop motion animation flick based on the Roald Dahl novel.  A fox/father decides to settle down,<br />stop stealing chickens and become a newspaper reporter,  But then, hitting a mid life crisis, he plots one last raid...<br /><br />It's always delightful, and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon.<br />Yet, for me, there was a bit of a deeper layer missing, when compared with  the best of Wes Anderson's live action work.<br /><br />This wasn't a film that moved me deeply, or made me think.  Although it did throughly amuse me with an enjoyable<br />tale, which is really more than enough. But somehow, as an Anderson fan. I wanted that last step from very good to great.<br />Still I applaud his bravery in taking this on, and the sly intelligence he brings to it.
B0026WNGBA|3.0|I have suffered from recurrent knee problems for the past several years and had eagerly taken every opportunity to look at new methodology that might alleviate the pain or discomfort associated with training.  I quickly grew tired of the first three chapters telling me what was coming up in chapter four and how exciting that information was going to be.  Get on with it - tell me darn it. Instead,the first three chapters are all about Master X and Master Y and their profound impact on Mr Dreyer.  I respect practioners of the martial arts and the associated philosophies and powers they have developed.  I consider body awareness esential to anyone who hopes to achieve their best, but I was so tired of Tai Chi by the time that I got to the meat of the book that I was beginning to have little faith in Mr Dreyer's coaching ability.  The remainder of the book, past chapter four, is equally slow.  I do appreciate the technique taught by Dreyer and it has, over the past month, lessened the impact and associated pain.  I am glad that I didn't tire and put the book down but feel the information can be more succinctly presented.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|This is a well made cable that rivals others costing up to 10X more than this one.  The shielding and construction are top notch.  The picture and sound quality of the TV is excellent with this cable, and it just shows that you don't need to spend a rediculous amount on certain name brand cables to get an excellent cable. Delivery from Amazon was fast and the cable was well-protected for shipping in a sturdy cardboard box. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase additional Amazon HDMI cables in the future.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|I was afraid that this album wouldn't match up with the previous 'Only by the Night' but I was pleasantly surprised. The songs are original and have a sound that no one out there has, it's been hard to get some of them out of my head like 'Birthday' and 'Going Back Down South' are just great. Way to go KOL.
B003BKF696|5.0|The National only know one way of making music...to be emotionally honest.  The greatest musicians and bands have an amazing ability to write songs of emotion.  This album is very dark and heavy...and incredible!<br /><br />I was a casual fan of theirs, having heard \\"Boxer\\" and slowly realizing the beauty that hid within that album by listening to the songs at night.  I don't why, but The National's music speaks to me more at night time.  Having come around on \\"Boxer\\" I had no choice but to purchase \\"High Violet.\\"  Again, blown away.  Even if you know what you're getting from these guys, they sill don't disappoint.  Each song on this album is a seperate \\"war wound\\" that is reopened and each song brings its own sense of hopelessness vs. hopefulness.<br /><br />As they sing on Afraid of Everyone, \\"I don't have the drugs to sort it out.\\"  Nor should they.  Drugs would only make them numb to the pain they write about and I wouldn't want to listen to somebody sing about a pain that they, themselves, don't have the strength to withstand.<br /><br />Brilliant.  Maybe the best of 2010.<br /><br />KEY TRACS:  Anyone's Ghost and Afraid of Everyone

044654759X|4.0|Not Sparks' best work.  Very slow moving for the first 250 pages.  Only got exciting the last 100 pages.  It took me a while to read this book because it didn't hold my interest until toward the end.  Safe Haven is different from most of Sparks' novels.  Although it's still a love story, it also has an element of mystery, dysfunction and violence.

1593081154|3.0|I'm not going to try and write a review for a classic and notable novel such as this.  Much has already been written by people far more capable of appreciating and responding to the work than I am.  I will simply add my two cents:<br /><br />This book, wonderful and important as it is, can be a taxing read, especially in the world of short-attention spans and \\"show-don't-tell\\" novels that we consume today.  It is largely an exploration of enlightenment ideas, particularly with regard to the changing relationship between man, God, and nature.  For that reason this novel will certainly remain necessary in any humanities study which tries to understand the rise of the modern era.<br /><br />I found this particular version (the Barnes and Noble Classics edition) to be very useful in that it provided introductory material and segments from essays.  As well, it contains some good questions for pondering and a list of other materials for further reading.<br /><br />I'm glad that I worked my way through the book (and I stress that it did require effort), it is one of those works that \\"everybody talks about but nobody reads\\", but I am also glad to be done with it.  I'm sure that the challenges encountered, which are central to the human condition, will come back to mind again and again.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Everyone in America should be interested in the financial stability of the economy. Everyone regardless of political persuasion. This is NOT a political movie. Its' not Michael Moore.<br /><br />There is a principle in the law: \\"qui bono?\\". It means \\"Who benefits?\\".<br /><br />Finance and economics are complex, too complex for many of us to understand. This movie makes the complex understandable. We live in the aftermath of this. The Great Recession. The Republicans blame the Democrats, the Democrats blame the Republicans. The Tea Party blames everyone. All of these are wrong. What this movie shows is a massive conflict of interest of the people who rate the financial health of companies, even countries. What is shown is economists rating these companies for Moody's and Standard & Poors (rating agencies), who are being paid to give favorable ratings by the same companies they rate! Not just faceless nobodies, Glenn Hubbard, now the Dean of the Business School at Columbia, Frederic Mishkin, a governor at the Federal Reserve and also current the president of Harvard, when they were just economists. We see investment houses secretly shorting (betting against) the very poor quality Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) bonds and companies they were recommending as good investments to other clients. We are shown raters who, rather than doing their jobs and warning of financial instability, gave high investment marks to Bear Sterns and Leeman Brothers two days before they went bankrupt. And these people profited.<br /><br />This movie names names and actually interviews many of the people responsible for the American collapse who shamelessly ignore, lie or try to minimize their personal responsibility. Many others responsible refused to be interviewed...<br /><br />The movie traces these problems from the laws set up in the 1930's to prevent such conflicts of interest and start another Depression. The Glass-Steagall Act prevented Wall Street investment houses from owning FDIC insured regular banks with peoples deposits or speculating with their money to bet on the stock market. The movie shows the incestuous moral hazard nature of Wall Street regulation, weakening of financial rules under Democratic and Republican administration: Reagan, Clinton, Bush and how the laws have not been fixed under Obama! See this movie, see what's really wrong with the economy and where the money (and the jobs) went! This movie is like a nonfiction version of Wall Street II.<br /><br />The only possible minor criticism I could make of this movie is there is a lot of short editing of interviewee's statements. A sentence might be out of context. But I think the director probably got the real intent correct.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I put money in the stock market based on a brokers advice, I don't want to broker to go behind my back and secretly short the stock he's telling me to buy!<br /><br />This movie is entertaining, informative and disturbing but of vital importance to understand.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|...with his achingly beautiful voice, it was appropriate to give him a pass.  Besides, there was always a good admixture of solid songs to outbalance the weak ones.  Sadly, with Illuminations, that is not the case.  Josh wrote the majority of the songs this time, and they do not measure up, and there are not sufficient covers to truly remedy the lack. I do like the sound of the arrangements.  I can get some enjoyment from the lone song in French and the lone song in Italian; the instrumental prelude pleases.  But I cannot recommend this album.  I hope Josh will put that glorious voice to better use in the future and reconsider whether songwriting is necessarily where he should focus his efforts as he reaches the big \\"three oh\\".
0156027321|3.0|Martel writes competently--if you like this sort of thing, to which \\"miscellaneous nonsense\\" applies most aptly. First, we're shooting off guns next to sloths (as in unaus and ais) to measure their responsiveness; then we're adopting apparently conflicting twin majors in college; then we're sailing in boats with mixed arks of beasts.

The supporting magazine is the official companion to the album featuring exclusive interviews with the band and charts the history of one of the world's most iconic rock bands whilst also providing the definitive liner notes on the recording of their new masterpiece.<br /><br />Tracks:<br />1.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Here's the deal... Settlers of Catan is probably one of the best board games of all time.  It is always different every time you play it.  There are multiple strategies that can allow you to win.  It encourages interaction between players via trading, the robber  and how you compete against each other for building space.  And I think the most important thing is that it still relies on a little bit of luck... so that even if you play the perfect strategic game you still might not win... just like real life    It has a bit of a learning curve, nothing too steep... but it also opens up a world of European style board games that can be much more complicated but very fun as well    5 stars from me!

B00275EHJG|5.0|Anyone except a flexible rubber, hard plastic or plush toy without a heart should find themselves in tears more than once in this movie about just those kinds of toys who, after being outgrown for years by their owner, now face the prospect of that boy, Andy, going off to college and leaving them behind forever. As usual the Pixar animation is fabulous, the voice talent -- Tom Hanks, Wallace Shawn and others -- capture the, yes, hearts of the toys brilliantly, and there is at least as much fun for adults as for children.  In fact, for kids younger than five or so, some of the scenes will be very, very intense.  There are many wonderful lines, including \\"we do a lot of improv around here,\\" and Ken telling the other toys at the pre-school that \\"I am not a girl's toy.\\"  His fashion show for Barbie is a highlight.  Life for the toys in the Caterpillar Room of the pre-school captures exactly how it is to live with a two year old and the final scene does the same with the bittersweet moments of moving on.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I waited for this cd with anticipation and high hopes and I couldn't be happier with the result. In fact I believe this is a real masterpiece but these songs require to be listened to with good equipment ( and no, I don't consider laptop speakers as good equipment)and also in a quiet setting and probably more than once- and I expect nothing less from a brilliant cd.  It's totally different to what he did before but that doesn't mean this cd is better or worse than his previous cd's - it's DIFFERENT and that's a good thing, otherwise it would be pretty boring. Some previous reviewer complained that there's no \\"You raise me up\\" or \\"You are loved\\" on this cd to which I can only say \\"Thank God\\" because those songs were already on other cd's and I don't want to hear them all over again.   To cut it short: it's a brilliant piece of art- the songs are all high above standard and Josh sings them with so much passion and emotion like never before. The instrumentation is brilliant, too- you'll here something new each time you listen to it.I can't recommend a song because I really like them equally, my only recommendation would be to give it a chance , get some good earphones and take your time to listen.
B003L77GGA|5.0|I've been watching Smallville since it's premier on October 16th 2001. Lets be honest folks, this series started out so strong, it just wasn't really Superman like... in the beginning. That doesn't make it bad tho, it all comes together in due time. Character development on this show has been superior to most other shows. I put the characterization level to Joss Whedon's Buffy: Anya and Cordelia (through Angel) who have been 2 of the most fleshed out characters in my television watching history. Each character on this show has his or her own place, and their development is top notch. The show finally develops into what it will become in season 4 and the introduction of Lois Lane. Smokin hot Erica Durance!!!! Her chemistry with Tom Welling has been undeniable since she first found him in that field. Unfortunately (And fortunately) Season 7 brought about the end of creators Al Gough and Miles Millar's run on the series! This is bad, as they are fantastic with what they do, and how they kept the pace of the show. Also bad because season 8 Smallville is by far the weakest season under the Smallville belt. It felt pushed, the acting was slippery and the plot had more holes than a 5lb chunk of Swiss Cheese... The Doomsday fight alone was cringe-worthy enough to nearly destroy the entire show, that is until season 9 kicks off... Which is when all the GOOD starts happening despite Gough and Millar's exit. Once the new producers (maybe new writers?) found their groove, they grooved all the way to the bank.... Season 9 exploded into my favorite season of the show. With so many guest stars and new characters... Season 9 looked to be the best, and then..... SEASON 10 has been blowing my mind. The progression that we've all been waiting for has finally arrived... The show has hit it's stride, and it's so incredibly unfortunate (not to say I don't understand) that with S10, we will be rid of Smallville, and that my friends is a melancholy moment, but I'm sure glad they are goingout with a bang! If you haven't seen any Season 10 yet... just you wait, it's tops! As a series... it's one of my all time favorites along with Buffy, Angel, Desperate Housewives and Brothers & Sisters. I find it hard to put these 5 shows in any kind of order, they are all fantastic!
0385339100|4.0|This book was everything I expected it to be.  Fast-paced, suspenseful, creative, and esoteric.  A thriller that was tough for me to put down.

B002HFP0R4|5.0|The long-delayed \\"Mythology\\" boxed set by the Brothers Gibb has finally been released.  All big Bee Gees fans will have almost all the material, aside from a few tracks on Maurice's CD and one track on Andy's CD.  On the latter, \\"Arrow Through The Heart\\" is an absolute gem.  It was originally written and recorded by Andy, Barry and Maurice in 1987.  The song has a great melody, thoughtful lyrics and a beautiful chorus.  Andy's vocals are full of power and he exhibits good range as well.  It's a shame he's gone.  Ditto for Maurice.    On Maurice's CD, fans will want to check out two previously unreleased tracks, \\"The Bridge\\" and \\"Angel of Mercy\\".  They were recorded around the same time as the Bee Gees recorded \\"This Is Where I Came In\\".  Both are duets with Maurice's daughter, Samantha.  She has a lovely voice, similar to that of Enya.  The songs aren't classics, but they are memorable and each features lush instrumentation and thoughtful lyrics.  They are certainly worth having.    The Robin and Barry CDs are made up of only previously released material.  There is nothing new here, although the sound quality is improved on some songs.  The same is true for the other two discs.  Some latter day classics like \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" and \\"One\\" are missing.    The packaging is very clever, made to look like a hardcover book.  It has many photographs and essays from Barry, Robin, Maurice's widow and children as well as Andy's daughter.  Their sentiments are heartwarming.  Also included are short essays praising the Brothers Gibb from a plethora of singers and songwriters and others in the industry.    This set is highly recommended for the hardcore Bee Gees fan, but casual fans would be better served with one of the many greatest hits packages available.
B001F3FUK6|1.0|Superman Returns completely betrays the character as he is portrayed in Donner's films.  This was intended as a sequel but fails to capture the spirit of the originals.  Superman the movie was essentially the story of an immigrant coming to a new land and embracing it as his new home.  He falls in love with Lois and spends much of the film swooning over her.  Superman two essentially tells the story of Superman giving up his responsibility as Earth's protector to be with Lois.  He learns that his responsibility supercedes his own personal needs.           So what happens in Superman Returns?  HE LEAVES FOR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT TELLING LOIS!  Apparently he learned nothing in Superman 2.  He abandons the place he swore to protect and the ones he loves to search for remnants of Krypton.  How stupid.  He comes back and wonders why Lois is upset and has moved on without him?  He's left for five years without telling her he was leaving.  Then he spends time stalking her and even attempts to get Lois to cheat on her fiance.  How heroic.  And I suppose he is never going to tell his son who he is either.           And Lex Luthor's plan is nothing more than a retread of the first film.   Destroy land and replace it with rocky landscapes that cockroaches couldn't thrive on.  Brilliant.

0525951652|5.0|This is the third Ken Follett book I've read--the first two were Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  I enjoyed Fall of Giants for the same reason I loved the others--history was brought to life and despite the book's length, I didn't want it to end.  I enjoy history, but I've never been very interested in the World Wars.  I downloaded a sample of this book because I wasn't sure I would really enjoy a book about WWI.  Within minutes I was hooked and purchased the whole thing on my Kindle.    Sure, the characters might be a little cliche', but I found them nevertheless thought-provoking.  Follett continued his study of monarchies from Pillars and World, which I found fascinating and engaging.  The characters may have also been a teensy bit underdeveloped, but not so much that I lost interest in them or that they irritated me.  The point was to demonstrate the effects of the war from several points of view.  One could hardly fully develop the characters without adding another 500 pages.  They got the job done.    This book was so piqued my interest in WWI (something I thought never would happen) that I spent an entire evening on the internet looking at photos and maps.    And as far as incredible coincidences occurring throughout--I have come across many true-life situations that are even stranger.    I found the book to be an extremely enjoyable escape, and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I loved this movie so much! It was touching and also teaches great lessons. Jaden is such an amazing actor at such a young age. He really was believable in this movie and you could see the emotions. Going to buy this today!
B003XMXZCW|5.0|I had a lot of reservations about the transfer of this film. My fears revolved around Francis Ford Coppola and his tendency to try to impose his will on the technology involved in the tranfer. I have seen too many important films ruined by the unnecessary intervention of a director. Much to my delight there was so much micromanagement of this film...it looks great. My other fear was the overabundance of grain...but this wasn't an issue. This 1979 film looks great...and the inclusion of both versions of the film was a nice perk. I wouldn't waste money on the \\"Full Disclosure\\" version...Hearts of Darkness is a waste of time and money..its no more than a glorified extra feature.
031603438X|5.0|I could not put this book down!   Being exactly one month older than Keith and growing up in London I was fascinated at the parallels in our lives; from the frightening reaction to sirens during the war; to the memories of the Red Lion in Sutton, the Station Hotel in Richmond, Acker Bilk and the trad jazz scene, all those wonderful memories of swinging London.  I was very impressed with Keith's recall and recommended this book to a psychiatrist friend who is an addiction specialist.    It should be required reading for anyone who is a heroin addict.  Not only does Keith show some sensibility with addiction but he came out of the darkness and proves that there is life after drugs.  Bravo Keith!!
0307454541|5.0|Reads very, very well and grips your attention. There is enough material in this book to have served for 2 or 3 different novels, really, I think.  The plot continues to twist and turn and lead you to different temporary conclusions.  The descriptions of people and places & events are all very vivid and riveting. The author worked very hard to make all aspects of his story fit in very clearly and logically, even while frequently changing subplots, action locations, and time periods.  It was hard to put this book down!!
B0043URV8M|3.0|Desplat's score does the job it's meant to do (which is, of course, fit the movie). However, the score, to me just does not have the emotional intensity of the last two films. The piano tracks and some odd-sounding, medieval-esque guitar seem strange and out of place in a Potter film, too. There were a few thematic elements I liked, especially those in relation to the Deathly Hallows themselves, and the soundtrack DOES have good music, but just doesn't have...IT. Whatever IT is. Oomph. Or gusto. I didn't feel like the themes he composed really lived up to Hooper's haunting \\"In Noctem\\" theme or William's emotional \\"Window to the Past\\" theme. William's score for Azkaban, and Hooper's score for Half-Blood Prince were much better, in my opinion. Not seeing what everyone is raving about here.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  I think it is something everyone should watch.  It offers you an insight to the true meaning of loyalty.  It is heartbreaking but a movie you will never be able to forget!
0060763280|5.0|I recently revisited this book for my second read.  Approximately five years and perhaps a few dozen other related books (and hearing T. Harv Eker in person) have occurred since my first read (as well as writing my own book \\"The Millionaire Lifeguard\\") .  So what are my thoughts on my second reading?<br />  Well first of all, get beyond the hype in the book to attend a T. Harv Eker workshop (as some reviewers seem to be stuck on) and get beyond the fact that this author didn't invent much of the content of the book (as some other reviewers seem to think discredits what he says).  Who really created many of the concepts in this book?  Well, does it really matter?  If the principles in this book can help you become financially secure, then does it really matter where they first originated?<br />  First of all, having heard T. Harv Eker in person (on a slate of eight other motivational/financial related speakers), I have to admit the Eker was the ONLY speaker who mentioned anything about hard work.  At a time when there are many other authors who would have you believe that all you have to do is visualize wealth and it will drop in your lap, cheers for Eker for letting us know that the reality of creating wealth depends on more than just believing it is going to happen (although believing is still important, especially if it motivates action).<br />  A few key point from his book that I didn't highlight the first time I read the book:<br />- you have to be the right person in the right place at the right time<br />- if your motivation is to prove yourself, money will never bring you happiness<br />- the only way to change these not-doing habits into doing habits is to do them<br />- when you are complaining you become a living, breathing \\"crap magnet\\"<br />- the number one reason most people don't get what they want is that they<br />  don't know what they want<br />  On this last point, if this book can help you better understand what you want (or help you to identify your passions) and you can translate this into your career or lifestyle choices, then the book is worth far more than its price even if you never become a millionaire.<br />  As I said earlier, look beyond the \\"free\\" bonuses offered throughout the book and focus on the content and you will find some thoughts that can really make a difference in your life (providing you translate the inspiration into action)  This was an excellent first read for me five years ago, and today the principles that are presented are just as relevant.late this into your career or lifestyle choices, then the book is worth far more than its price even if you never become a millionaire.

0061906220|5.0|My son and I read/sing this book every night. My son just turned 5 and was able to read it within a few days. We quote it all of the time and it even has a great message. When my son gets upset if something isn't going his way, I say \\"What would Pete the Cat say?\\" and he sings a funny little song about what is happening and we move on. I even find myself doing the same thing. It's such a simple concept of adapting to changing situations. I recommend the book to any parent. Love it.
B003TVMIDO|4.0|Very well crafted Box, Cds ok, Regarding songs, in some cases I would like more some previos cd version, like in \\"Instant Karma\\".
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|This CD is jammed packed with some of John Mayer's best music; however, I've yet to come across any of his CD's that aren't great.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I've enjoyed all of the movies better than the books. Given the material, the production value was quite good. I can't fault the director or actors: they were spot on in their interpretation of the book -- highlighting key plot points, etc in the adaptation and whatnot.<br /><br />The scene in the tent was laughable. Not because of the actors--they did stellar jobs trying to make the moment work.<br /><br />I don't know two guys alive who would sit in a tent and \\"chat\\" about the girl they both adore. Guys \\"take it outside\\" and do the guy thing-- whatever that may be. But it's not \\"chatting\\" about it.<br /><br />Even with the tent scene I enjoyed in the film overall and will buy it on DVD. KUDOS to Taylor Lautner who SHINED big time in this film. That guy has talent.

B0040JHNZ2|5.0|Ken Follet is a great writer, and when he is writing a historical novel we are sure to get not only a great story but also a very good understanding of the period where he sets his plot, since his historical research is superb. I loved this book not so much because of the individual stories of the characters, but rather because I found it a very creative and entertaining way to understand WWI from the perpective of different countries. I have studied this period in school, and to me it was just a jumble of facts and dates, barely connected and often presented from a biased perspective. This is not to say that the characters in the novel are not interesting or compelling, but at times the fact that Mr. Follet sets the same characters in all major events surrounding WWI makes them a little less beliavable then he could have made them. Still, I enjoyed the book very much and, altough I would not rate it as one of the best novels I have ever read, it is certainly the best history lesson on WWI I have ever attended.
B004498KPU|5.0|GREAT!! Nice to have all his short films in one place to watch over and over again.  This is a great gift or for those of us who feel we lost The Best Iconic Entertainer we'll ever see in our lives.  Fabulous!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|As my title has stated, I'm a fanatic of the Matrix Trilogy.  Sure The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions did not blow the audience or myself away, but you cannot deny the first one did.  With that said, I would put Equilibrium up there on the list along with the Matrix.  Sure we hear the ol' comparison to The Matrix and that it is/not a ripoff.  It's very subjective.  Yes, it is very similar to each other in terms of plot, but the choreography and makeup of the movie is entirely different.      Equilibrium is based more on a reality based level than the Matrix.  Opposed to the Matrix, Equilibrium does not bend the laws of physics as much and brings the fight sequences more down to earth and realism.  The shooting scenes or terrific.  The swift choreography of the gun fight sequences were totally amazing, I was actually quite amazed given that I was such a biased Matrix fanatic.    The one negative thing I did not like about this movie is the ending.  Because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched it, I just end this review by saying that the movie was great, but the conclusion left me wanting for more in terms of a \\"Ending off with a BANG.\\"  If you're a SCI-FI fan like myself, this is definitely a must see!
B0018RBN8C|5.0|This album is so good from beginning to end. I initially was attracted to the song \\"Mercy\\" but have to say that I really like every track. At the office, all of us stressed-out girls listened to the CD over and over...it made us feel good.  If you want something that cheers you up or you just want to sing-along with, this album is it.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Let's not get too excited, this is no gladiator, however it is a fun and new take on the robin hood tale.  The action is very good, the cinematography is excellent, the acting is superb, and the characters are likable if not quite realistic in some cases.  A few minor plot choices mar what is otherwise a solid film.  The departure from the plot of other Robin Hood movies is fresh and an interesting take on his origins.  Overall, four stars.
B00428ZRFE|2.0|Okay, so coming up off of the amazing \\"Rated R\\" this album completely disappointed me. This album is boring, slow, has a generic pop-sound, and is really passable. The only highlight is the single already released, \\"Only Girl\\" and everything on this is borderline un-danceable. I absolutely LOVED \\"Rated R\\"; it was so edgy, so diverse, had great dance beats, and was really innovative and fresh. I really don't know what the producers of \\"Loud\\" were thinking, honestly. Not worth your money.

B004BRP7R4|5.0|For me at least, Josh has done a wonderful job with this latest album. The quality of his singing has improved even more--if that's possible. Some the high notes he hits just puts goosebumps on me and some of the songs really makes me just sit back, listen and relax of his pure and rich voice. You will not be disappointed in Illuminations and I marked it with five stars simply b/c there are no more than five stars available. Listen to the samples Amazon provides and you will see why you must have this album in your Groban collection. Happy Holidays!
0439023521|5.0|Dystopia, Big Brother and post-apocalypse are themes that have been included in novels so often that it could well  be a life's work for a librarian to prepare an exhaustive catalogue of titles. But, in terms of quality, the devil is in the details and Suzanne Collins has justifiably taken the world by storm. Her novel, THE HUNGER GAMES, inspired by the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, is an innovative, dare I say unique, young adult twist on the recurring themes of violence, cruely, despair, privation and revolution that are the mainstays of these types of novels.<br /><br />A distant future North America, now called Panem, is divided into 12 distinct economic districts ruled with an iron fist from the Capitol located in the northwest Rocky Mountain region of the former USA. Every year, in a bizarre celebration called \\"The Reaping\\", the Capital \\"honours\\" each district by selecting two children that will be called \\"tributes\\", one boy and one girl, to participate in THE HUNGER GAMES. The 24 children are released into a wilderness arena and are expected not only to survive but to battle one another to the death. The last remaining child is returned to his or her district as a conquering hero.<br /><br />The games, reminiscent of Rome's bloodthirsty gladiatoral combats,  are televised as an extravaganza throughout Panem on a minute by minute basis. Carefully engineered from start to finish, the sculpted terrain of the \\"arena\\" might be anything from arctic or forest to desert or rugged mountains; an unknown supply of weapons and supplies are provided but will have to be fought for and \\"won\\" as part of the entertainment; the games are replete with intermittent technologically engineered disasters such as fires, teeming rainstorms or earthquakes; genetically engineered humans or animals called \\"muttations\\" are periodically released to provide extra challenge for the tributes or extra entertainment for the viewing audience.<br /><br />Of course, the entire affair is intended to serve notice to Panem of the continuing absolute authority of the Capitol over the Districts. But somehow, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes from District 12 and the perennial underdogs of the Games, unwittingly create an untenable political embarrassment for the Capitol and the engineers running the Games by doing nothing more than remaining true to themselves, their friends and family, to each other and to their values. By thinking and reacting in an unprecedented and entirely unpredictable way, Katniss and Peeta create the first small kernels and the obvious foreshadowing of a rebellion to come.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are truly intelligent, well-crafted, complex, memorable characters displaying the love, friendship, loyalty, courage, innovation and independence that contrast obviously with the much darker themes so typical of other dystopian novels that we're more familiar with. Suzanne Collins has crafted a winning page-turner that will pull you in, quickly and deeply. Like everyone in Panem, you'll find yourself riveted to the pages rooting for Katniss' and Peeta's survival and biting your fingernails with worry over every obstacle they encounter. Then even if they both survive the predations of the other 22 competitors, how will they deal with the requirement to ultimately battle one another to the death to provide the Games with a single surviving winner?<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES was focused on world-building and action. But my expectation is that the subsequent instalments in the trilogy, CATCHING FIRE and THE MOCKINGJAY, will focus more on the cerebral themes of politics and revolution. And, frankly, I can't wait to get to them! Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul WeissPanem of the continuing absolute authority of the Capitol over the Districts.

B001AQT0UY|5.0|I'm not sure why the quality of this Blu-ray disc didn't impress me as it was a bit grainy.  I thought that if I were going to own it, then why not on Blue-ray since it was about the same price as the DVD.<br /><br />The story is a classic, and kind of silly.  But it brings back fond memories of one of my late cats who, as an abandoned kitten, reminded me of Gizmo when I rescued him 25 years ago.  It's also a disturbing and tragic illustration as to the pandora's box of trouble humans can and have opened for themselves.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|DVD in perfect condition and arrived very quickly after order was placed. I love this classic movie; it keeps me cheerful while I am up with my newborn at all hours:)
0525423842|4.0|I love to read a Grisham novel, and I was pleased when my twelve-year-old grandson loaned me his copy of this legal thriller, written for the younger crowd. Grisham's characters are fleshed out so well I feel as if I know them. His plots moves along at just the right pace, and the endings settle the murder mystery. However, this ending had me wanting even more; I wanted the author to tie up the loose end of Omar Cheepe. Perhaps we'll meet him again in a future Theo novel.    I recommend this novel to young and old. There's much to be learned about the law within these pages. The writing is well done, without any profanity or inappropriate scenes. I sure enjoyed it!

0143035711|4.0|A book doesn't have to be perfect to be a classic.  James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales are a good example.  But for its time, this book hit the mark and remains today as an example of what young men go through in the course of exercising their countries political agenda, expecially young men in what was emerging technology in its day--the Huey helicopter.  I can still see the scene where they landed in the river to wash the blood and vomit from the deck of their Huey, and I don't think I'll ever forget it.  But I too, having been there, was disappointed in the ending.  I wish Mason could had done better, but I didn't walk in his moccasins.

1439156816|5.0|I purchased On Writing on a whim. I had no idea I would enjoy it so much. I felt like I had spent a day sitting with King, listening to him talk about his life and career. This book is so much better than any 'learn to write' book out there. He doesn't teach you how to write, he simply shows you the world from one writer's perspective. He is blunt and honest, he isn't uptight or pretentious in any way. He's just a man that loves his work and his family. Without ever saying it, you can see that his life and Tabitha's are one long love letter to each other. Don't take me wrong, there is no mushy bits in this book, you can just feel it in the way he speaks. I believe they make each other better people and are successful because they found their other half that I didn't believe existed before I read this book.<br /><br />King reveals his life and his thought process with an openness that astounds me. I learned so much from something that it pained him to write. I can't thank him enough. I take this book everywhere I go.

B00005LOLD|5.0|this is a wonderful love story.  Marlon Brandon is great.  He is so sexy in this movie.  The Main Star is a beautiful woman that he falls in love with.  You will cry in come parts but the ending in so great.  this is a must see movie.  I caught it one Sunday on cable years ago and fell in love with it so I had to buy it.  I have told anyone who loves old movies that they need to see this one.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|Groban has a fine, well trained voice.  But this album is overwrought, melodramatic, and just plain corny.  Some people exude these aforementioned qualities in a good way (think Meat Loaf, Marc Bolan, and others) but this album is just plain overdone.  Even the lyrics are overdone.  I listened to 'Higher Window' this morning and its hard sit through without wincing and/or laughing.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|So all yall want the same old kid rock? Same lyrics? Same persona? If you were true fans,you would know that he has been kind of promoting country lately. The CMA'S? The show on CMT? You guys are  quick to judge because he got rid of the cockiness and swearing (Oh my god...he's..he's MATURING! Oh no!) Real fans stick with and stay true to the artist through changes. I personally love this album and R&RJ, but the fake fans dropped him the second he had a hint of change. Go  Rock!
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Although previous Springsteen \\"out takes\\" collections, such as [[ASIN:B00000DHTF Tracks (4CD)]], and the overlapping--but slightly different--[[ASIN:B00000IIXH 18 Tracks]], have been interesting artifacts that have proved useful in tracing Springsteen's development as a songwriter and recording artist, only rarely have they offered up fully-realized gems that one feels should have been included on his classic early albums when they were first released. \\"The Promise\\" is another thing entirely. It functions effectively as an album in its own right, and is a cohesive whole that amounts to much more than simply early sketches for what would become the then-unfinished \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town.\\" Several of these songs contain fragments of lyrics or melodies that were recycled when the final version of \\"Darkness\\" eventually appeared, but they are in no sense rough or tentative. Every track here--every one--stands as a fine piece of work in its own right, making this, in a very real way, the great lost Springsteen album that ought to have been. This set is revelatory, yes. But it is also raw and powerful, and just plain wonderful from start to finish.  It is no exaggeration to proclaim it a masterpiece; this is true genius, pure and simple.

B003NFM3JU|4.0|For the past 40-odd years, my standard in filmed versions of Charles Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol\\" has been the Alastair Sim version from 1951. That remains my standard to this day.<br /><br />Based on 1983's unsuccessful \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol,\\" I was prepared for Disney to once again screw up this classic tale with \\"Disney's A Christmas Carol.\\" Jim Carrey's name emblazoned across the 3-sheets added to the sense of trepidation.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong. Quite wrong, to be honest about it. This is an excellent version of Dickens' classic tale, a version that hews much closer to the book than most other versions out there, including my beloved Sim version. The fantasy elements are here given the room to be fantastic, which really works if one believes that Scrooge's journey to redemption may well have happened in his dreams, rather than in the here and now (pace Mr Dickens' admonition to his readers concerning the veracity of his tale).<br /><br />Jim Carrey voices and acts most of the main characters in this version, and he's very good at creating unique characterizations that really delineate the players from each other. He is masterful in his portrayal of the Ghost of Christmas Past, somehow speaking in a way that one would imagine a flame would speak had it voice to do so. His Ghost of Christmas Present is also good, a larger-than-life figure who stands in stark contrast to Scrooge's disconnected-from-humanity self. Carrey's Scrooge is - dare I say it - loaded with subtleties that I really didn't expect from him. His voice characterization is spot on, and SO much closer to what one would expect from a faithful rendition of what Dickens penned than say, the disastrous performance of George C. Scott in his 1980's TV version of the tale.<br /><br />Credit is also due to Gary Oldman's portrayal of Bob Cratchit and - even more so - his Ghost of Jacob Marley, which has to be seen to be believed. One cannot imagine a truer version of Dickens' vision than that achieved in this film's combination of acting, motion capture and animation. Spooky and VERY convincing.<br /><br />The only caveat I'll voice about the movie concerns a couple of extended \\"action sequences\\" that were included to no doubt keep the teens and tweens engrossed in the film. Most egregious among these is the scene where Scrooge is chased through the streets of London by a hellish C&oacute;iste Bodhar. It really adds nothing to the story, even if the animation is particularly good.<br /><br />Not everyone is a fan of motion-capture technology, but I feel it serves this film well, bridging the gap between live-action and animation versions of the story and maybe coming away with the best of both worlds. Robert Zemeckis and crew have gained expertise in their use of the technique since \\"The Polar Express,\\" and it pays dividends here.<br /><br />The extras included are very interesting, especially a feature that takes us behind the scenes to see just how the motion-capture technology is put to the service of the film makers.<br /><br />So this is well worth owning, even if it does get numerous plays on various TV channels during the season and - strangely - throughout the rest of the year as well. As a bonus, the singing of the song \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" by the highly overrated Andrea Bocelli is limited to the credit run at the end of the film, so you can simply avoid having to hear it at all without missing a minute of the film itself!<br /><br />Four stars - excellent, but just a cut below my above-declared standard in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" movies.ved in this film's combination of acting, motion capture and animation.

B003YWUTJI|3.0|Definitely an eclectic mix of songs and styles on this album. But, I don't think it gave justice to Norah's individual talent. Although it showed a diverse range of her talent, the styles all belonged to others. In my opinion, not her best work.
0553805371|5.0|The Grand Design provides another classic survey by physicist Steven Hawking, who considers the laws of nature and physics as they apply to the concept of a 'grand design' to the universe's structure. Some forty years of Hawking's own research and a recent series of astronomical observations lend to new arguments that the scientific concern with the unified theory may be misplaced, and that a web of theories might hold the key to the universe's mysteries. Science and general holdings alike will relish this survey!
0312600844|3.0|I have to agree with the contrarians on Franzen.  I tried to like this book, and I did like parts very much, particularly the first section narrated by Patty.  But, in general, Franzen is old fashioned, cranky, a bit boring, and worst of all, he consistently looks down on his characters, like an ill-tempered God (\\"look how stupid these people I created are\\"), and almost worse than that, he obsesses over the present cultural clutter, as if it were interesting to draw our attention to the fact that kids whine about wanting to own the newest electronical gadgets or that George W. Bush and his cronies were fools, etc.  Updike did that sort of thing in his Rabbit books, in part, but his observations transcended the moment and got at something deeper in the American pysche.  Franzen does not. He insists upon his own importance. He's the satirist who lacks a sense of humor, and he doesn't seem to realize that the character based most closely on himself (the bird-watching husband) is an irritating jerk. This raises an interesting question:  what happenes when a self-important jerk (like Franzen) is also an amazingly talented writer?  Can he ever escape his own shortcomings as a person on the page?  When he doesn't bore me, he irritates me. But perhaps this is a failing on my part as a reader, because most everyone I know thinks this is a first-rate novel, even TIME magazine.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This new album is incredible!!  I don't think there is a track on here that I don't like . . . they are all just so good! \\"The Wandering Kind\\" is just a sweeping, yet playful instrumental song that transports me to the streets of Europe! \\"Bells of New York City\\" have a light & kind of haunting feel to it that just flows well.  \\"Galileo (Someone Like You)\\" is kind of like a discussion/ponderings put to song. The songs in Italian, French & Portuguese are lovely to listen to even if I can only pick out the meaning of a few words . . . at present.  \\"If I Walk Away\\" is a pleasant, low key song that is told with mandolins and violins that crecendos with piano towards the end . . . a simple, yet poignant plea.  \\"Love Only Knows\\" puts the question out there of \\"will what we have work out?\\" to music, it makes you pause and think and the title is the answer.  \\"War At Home\\" acknowledges the struggle of service men and women (whether domestic or overseas) adjusting to coming home after fighting in a touching and moving way.  \\"London Hymn\\" is a flowing and haunting, chant-like song that's like a small homage to music of the middle ages.  \\"Straight to You\\" is almost like a hymn that's being sung whenever things are falling apart and you're seeking comfort.  I love & am most familiar with the songs \\"Hidden Away\\" and \\"Higher Window\\" since I got the singles of them before the album released; these songs have just beautiful lyrics and moving piano playing.  \\"Hidden Away\\" is just a beautiful plea to reveal who you really are: that extraordinary part of you that you hide from the eyes of everyone else-which speaks to everyone since everyone does that in some way!  \\"Higher Window\\" is just a beautiful story of the various stages of two soulmates. I could just listen to these songs all day!! Don't buy just a few songs; buy the whole album!! I've been having it on repeat on my iPod since buying it!

0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is a very entertaining and powerful film and  although it started off as a box-office fluke and misunderstood by many it has rightfully deserved it's  place as one of the finest sci-fi films ever produced .  The elements that really buy this film to such epic proportions is it's Brilliant dark murky yet dense execution of a future los Angeles  also compained by a powerful complex intricate  and fascinating script with lots of fascinating sub-themes and connations and symbolism which although i didn't always quite spot when i heard of them it made me look back and see just how inspired these writers were  not only that the way the elements are mixed together film noir ,romance action-adventure and philosphy and existenal themes of life how long  we have to live it and the moral boundaries we posess as humans and how our prejudices and advances can in a way dehumanize or desentize us to common murder and the subtle way the film builds suspense is great.  Performance-wise no one really does a bad job Harrison Ford is perfect as Deckard he starts off the right amount of dry wit and reserved moody attitude but he turns more emotional and vigourous and commandering as the film goes by . Sean Young although not one of hollywood's most famous actresses brings the right amount of feisty and tender vunerability to the role and overall does excellent work and Ruget Hauer is phenomal as Roy Batty bringing the emotions of curiousity, intensity ruthlessness, wonder , sophistacation , desperation and fear and anguish and vegance together wonderfully and Daryl hannah holds her own well as Pris and johanna Cassiday is very tough fesity ,edgy and exotic as Zhora and Edward james Olmos as Gaff who is mostly slient still manages to be effective due to his unique way of communicating with Deckard with his orgamis and delivers one of the film's final lines very well and the guy who played Taffey Lewis was great too .  Fianlly the action sequences were very intense and realistic and were coordinated very well and not felt akward or out of place and the music by Vangelis was very good setting the tone very well as it communicates our emotions in a sense it has that mystical feel of awe when the film 1st opens and the sultry tone it has when Deckard starts to fall for Deckard and it has operatic crescendo feel when Batty attacks Tyrell and the fast-paced techhno-feel at the end was nice and the technology created for the film was very creative and well-used within the context of the film. Overall Blade runner is a perfectly excellent film with beautiful visuals fantastic rich writing great acting great score and very imagnative and exotic feel to it definitely worth checking out can't wait to see that blu-ray! 10 out of 10  \\" All those moments will be lost like tears in the rain.\\"
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was phenomenal! I absolutely couldn't put it down. Skloot has an amazing way of hooking the reader and making complicated medical situations easily understandable to the general public. She also made the family endearing, and made me deeply invested in their lives and what happened to them. This book is great for anyone. There is the extremely interesting science aspect and the deeply emotional family drama. Skloot handles each aspect brilliantly. This is the kind of book that makes you want to read more, learn more and dive into the topic. I instantly wanted to find someone to talk about HeLa cells with and share the story of the woman they came from. I can't recommend this book highly enough!

B0042JTDXK|1.0|I was thrilled to hear that Josh Groban was coming out with a new CD!!!  I have all of his other offerings, including in concerts DVD's and special releases from Hallmark.  I have been a fan of his since I first saw him on PBS in 2002.  That being said, I was hugely disappointed by this latest CD!!! I realize Josh has spent the last four years pouring his heart and soul into this music, shouldering the majority of the writing of most of the songs.  I really wanted to like it, but was so underwhelmed by \\"Illuminations.\\"  Almost all of the songs were sad, boring, and pretty much interchangeable.  I was taken by how depressing the entire album is!!!!  There is nothing uplifting or inspirational about any of the songs, which is so unlike all of his previous CD's.  While the melodies are beautiful and majestic, most of the lyrics are bland and very amateurish sounding--they just don't ring true.  I know Josh tends to gravitate toward melancholy songs (this is by his own admission), but does EVERY song have to be so sad?  In addition, I think he tried to remake the song \\"Vincent\\", the Don McLean classic that Josh covered on his first CD, into \\"Galileo,\\" which sort of has the same theme.  I must say, it just didn't work. In Josh's defense, \\"Hidden Away\\" and \\"The War at Home\\" were okay, but they were not enough to salvage the entire CD. Josh Groban can do better than this.  I hope his next CD returns to his glorious past.  Hopefully, he cheers up a little by then.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|I recently stumbled upon this band and thought they were okay. The more I listened to them the more I liked them. Then they came out with their second album (Science and Faith) which is way better than any other album I've heard before. You can tell they have grown as a band, and even if some of the songs are about heartbreak, they keep it upbeat and fun. I keep this CD on repeat and have yet to become sick of it. They have become my new favorite band. Normally I don't think sophomore albums are as good as the first, but this new album kicks the first albums ass by far. Highly recommend.

She gets a job as a waitress and rents a neglected, run-down cabin, but keeps to herself and says very little. Then Jo, a mysterious counselor, moves in next door and befriends her, and she meets Alex, a widower with two young children. She senses right away that Alex is a very good man who she's drawn to in spite of herself, and the feeling is mutual. But Katie is hiding a terrible secret from her past and is afraid to love, until Jo teaches her to let go and trust her instincts. When the past eventually catches up with her Katie shows her mettle in an ending that is both surprising and gratifying. A very good read.
B001DF68MA|3.0|The seat was easy to install (20 minutes).  My wife and I are satisfied with the manufacturer quality.  I do suggest avid bike riders to look for an alternative to this seat.  For extended bike rides the seat inhibits the normal pedaling motion making for an uncomfortable ride.  I am 6' tall and my wife has experienced the similiar problem at 5' 9\\" tall.  However if you just need a child seat to ride short distances, (e.g. ride to school with other siblings), the seat is fine and priced right.    Enjoy!    Mike
0439023513|4.0|I liked all of the books, this one was as good as the first two.  It was written for young adults, but I enjoyed it too (I'm a grown up).
B004259BMM|5.0|I love the song \\"Without You\\" very much.  The song was written by Dave Pahanish, and it really brings back great memories of my college days listening to our good friend play this song around the Pittsburgh bar scene.  Really makes me feel lucky to know a guy who has written so many #1 songs for great country artists like Jimmy Wayne, Toby Keith, Keith Urban and soon to be Tim McGraw!  Give \\"Without You\\" a listen... you will see, its the #1 single on this album!
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|You can go to AMC website where you can watch the first/pilot episode for free. Why should you pay for something that is free elsewhere?
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought this one over the cheaper ones on Amazon because of the 1 year warranty.  If it lasts a year it is worth the money.  All I use it for is from a HD Digital Cable box to the TV and it has worked great for that use.  I have had it 2 months and no problems yet.  So far, a great product.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I think Band of Horses might be the most famous band I've ever found on Vine. I know some people who really thought that Infinite Arms was the best album of  2010 so I had to them a try.     What I really like about Band of Horses is their unique sound. The sound like a pop band without being a pop band. They sound like an indie band without being an indie band. They even have some 70s/80s arena rock aspects to them. Their sound is very comforting and I found it soothing to listen to while I do work.      I think the third, fourth, and fifth songs (Laredo, Blue Beard, and On My Way Back Home) are my favorite tracks. Not every song on the album is a masterpiece, but there really aren't any bad songs on the album.     Band of Horses was a really pleasant surprise. I'm glad I was given the opportunity to check them out. I highly recommend them to any rock fans as their unique sound is really great to listen to.
B000I5XOW8|1.0|First off, I just want to clarify that this is a review of the product, NOT the movie.    The transfer was a complete ripoff, this in no way was a remastered dvd. It has about the same quality as a VHS, the first 2 minutes shows a perfect example how bad the quality of the supposed \\"Blu-ray\\" is, the blacks are completely washed out and throughout almost the whole movie the picture is soft.    What a joke.
B0026S7JQ2|4.0|I ordered this stand off this page and it works great.  One reviewer writes of it sliding off the stand, but the one I ordered came with 2 small clear plastic stops that would prevent that from happening.  Either Griffin added this as a fix or the reviewer did not install these.  Well designed and east to assemble.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Got the DVD three days ago and watched every single episode in an orgy of fun. Watched all the special features too.    There's a new Doctor Who with Matt Smith as The Doctor, and Karen Gillan as his companion.     Thoroughly enjoyed this season as I have enjoyed all the other seasons.    Doctor Who is the best science fiction I've ever seen on television.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A modern classic.  Unfortunately I didn't have a 1080P and a blu-ray player at the time I ordered these otherwise I would have got them in blu-ray format. Regardless, HBO makes great mini-series.  Band of Brothers is one of the best
068987474X|4.0|Overall I thought this was a great reminder of things to keep in mind. Of course there are some things in this book that were obvious to me and some things (that after talking to a few guys) that were not totally accurate. But overall I would recommend this book!
B0043ISH6O|3.0|A film about Facebook, the online phenomenon of the 21st century, doesn't sound especially interesting when you first think about it, but the history of its creation is actually quite fascinating. Mark Zuckerberg was a 20-year-old student at Harvard University when he and his roommate Dustin Moskovitz launched the first incarnation of Facebook into the world in 2004; despite various lawsuits, development problems, and other issues, Facebook eventually became the dominant social networking website with 500 million users worldwide, and eventually making Zuckerberg the world's youngest multi-billionaire, worth $6.9 billion according to the Forbes 2010 Rich List. The film is directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, and stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake and Rooney Mara.    The score for The Social Network is by Atticus Ross, who wrote the music for The Book of Eli earlier this year, and Trent Reznor, the founder of the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. Ross and Reznor have worked together before - Ross co-produced the Nine Inch Nails albums Year Zero, Ghosts and The Slip in 2007 and 2008 - but this is the first time Reznor has contributed original music to a film. Part of the pair's brief was to recapture the sound popularized by artists such as Vangelis and Tangerine Dream, and completely stay away from anything remotely orchestral.    As a result, the score for The Social Network is an oddly compelling combination of 80s pop instrumentals and modern synth/atmosphere scoring, with layer upon layer of electronic sound design giving the album an overarching sense of an incessent `wall of sound'. It's about as far away from traditional film scoring as one can imagine, but there's something relentlessly overpowering, gritty and real about this music. It seems to capture the socially awkward tenacity of Zuckerberg's personality, as well as the modern Zeitgeist in popular music that inhabits the same conceptual world as Facebookand its social media contemporaries.    The industrial effects buzz backwards and forwards across the speakers in cues such as \\"Hand Covers Bruise\\", and wailing electric guitars create a more dangerous atmosphere in \\"A Familiar Taste\\" and \\"Eventually We Find Our Way\\". Cues such as \\"In Motion\\", \\"Intriguing Possibilities\\", \\"Pieces from the Whole\\" the superb \\"Carbon Prevails\\" and \\"Complication with Optimistic Outcome\\" have a powerful groove combined with sampled voices, more electric guitars, and intentionally retro-sounding design elements which could have come from a classic Atari video game. \\"3:14 Every Night\\" is a very unusual cue in which a rattling synth percussion effect seems to mimic the desperate rattling of a computer keyboard, offset by stark industrial effects.    Having said that, there are some organic elements to the score too. The aforementioned \\"Hand Covers Bruise\\", as well as later cues such as \\"It Catches Up With You\\", \\"Penetration\\" the dirty-sounding \\"On We March\\", and the drunken, slightly off-kilter \\"The Gentle Hum of Anxiety\\" have a simple but effective piano melody running beneath the drones, while one or two others have a calmer, more meditative feel which is more in line with the music Ross wrote for The Book of Eli than anything in Reznor's musical past; \\"Almost Home\\" fop example, keeps threatening to turn into a performance of Harold Faltermeyer's famous Top Gun Anthem! It's also worth mentioning the all-synth, slightly abstract and spooky rendition of Grieg's famous classical piece \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" from Peer Gynt, which makes for an interesting diversion too.    Anyone who knows my musical tastes would not expect me to enjoy this score at all, but much to my own surprise, I do. It has a real sense of urgency to it which is quite compelling and the bubbling energy Reznor and Ross bring to the synth programming gets under your skin in a good way. Part of it also might be to do with my personal affinity for the 80s synth-pop soundthat more mainstream artists like Gary Numan and Pet Shop Boys had, as there is certainly a vague echo of that kind of music in the score. Strange as it may sound, if this film becomes a darling of the 2010 awards season, I can genuinely see this score picking up a Best Score Oscar nomination next year; it's the kind of hip, progressive stuff that Academy voters have seemed to appreciate in recent years (qv Slumdog Millionaire), and it undoubtedly catches the spirit of the film.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I'm so very happy that I can recommend this one without any hesitation at all!<br /><br />The last couple Harry Potter films disappointed me in a myriad of ways. My disappointment didn't cause me to hate them, but I did feel let down and I have to admit that I found Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince pretty forgettable. But, being a Potter fan, I still found myself rushing out to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I today. And to my great relief and happiness, I loved it - really loved it! Yeah!<br /><br />The chase of the Seven Potters by the Death Eaters and the trip to the Ministry of Magic are tense and exciting, the endless camping trip is just as effective at portraying the helplessness and frustration the characters are experiencing as it was in the book and the scene that gives us Hermione reading Beedle the Bard's \\"Tale of the Three Brothers\\" is riveting and wonderfully creative - much, much better than I would have thought it could be. We finally get to meet Bill (and Fleur's briefly-glimpsed wedding dress is gorgeous!) and the whipped cream on top of all this goodness is that the film is much more humorous than I expected. While not everything is included, of course, I didn't come out of this film grumbling things along the lines of \\"How could they leave out _____?\\" or \\"Why did they add ________when it wasn't even in the danged book?\\" - both comments I have been known to make after viewing some of the other films. Instead, I left the theater feeling like I'd seen a relatively faithful rendering of the \\"real\\" story. And there were even one or two things that I thought the film did better than the book, most notably the interruption of Harry & Ginny's kiss. The not-in-the-book added scene of Harry and Hermione dancing was both amusing and incredibly poignant - a true highlight of the film for me.<br /><br />For some reason, the enjoyment this film gave me seemed to lift some sort of weight off me - which seems a very odd thing to say, I know. I think it returned a good deal of the joy I found in the earlier films - when seeing the characters and the places come to life on the screen was so magical. (That first glimpse of Hogwarts!) In a way, I feel like I'm back *in* - that I'm once again immersed in the film version of the story in a way that more closely echoes the effect the books had on me. While the films, IMHO, can never hope to match the books, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part I, let me feel the magic again. For that I thank everyone involved with it.<br /><br />I thought the acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson was better than it's been in any of the Potter films - they really seem to have come into their own here. Helena Bonham Carter was freakishly perfect as usual, Jason Isaacs very good and Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood a welcome newcomer. The film sounds good - the score is a mood-setting addition to the film (especially effective, I thought, were the screeching radio sounds during many of the camping scenes) - and it looks even better. The shots of the English countryside are beautiful but often seem almost overwhelmingly empty and lonely - perfect for the story.<br /><br />When it was announced that Deathly Hallows would be split into two films, I was glad because I hoped that by doing so the filmmakers would be able to do justice to the complexities of Rowling's plot. And now, having seen Part I, I feel that they've succeeded in doing just that. After this, I can look forward to the last film, not with dread, but with pleasure. And I am incredibly thrilled to be able to say that.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!<br /><br />Some info and cautions on the products:<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Because there are reports of various versions of the DVD available from different sellers, I strongly suggest buyers check the packaging carefully to ensure the version they are considering contains everything they're looking for.<br /><br />I purchased the 3-Disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack offered here on Amazon.

B002ZG983M|3.0|Having not read the comic, I went into this w/ no expectations. Ultimately, the movie is entertaining for a Fri. Nite. But I would have liked less cardboard villians and more hit girl, the most interesting character.
0811729117|4.0|I think this was a good read. If one likes this kind of reading material this could be there book. Good exposer of Carius life and the life of other german tankers at that time in history. Ther were some gratical errors but I think that is to be expected when translation occurs. Over all I liked the book.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|The movie's hero is a 22 year old bum in a band -- not quite the anti-hero, but not far from it either. This movie follows him in pursuit of his dream girl while dealing with various obstacles, such as the obligations of his band, a high-school girl stalker, and 7 evil exes of his dream girl. Despite the impossible world he lives in, he is likable, you can always sympathize with him,<br />and manages to make all the crazy situations and environments believable.<br /><br />The connoisseur of old video games will be overcome by nostalgia.  The graphical presentations are almost comic-book like. While a martial artist might criticize the fights as being executed unrealistically, they are well executed choreographically, will remind you of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Mario Brothers. Much of the music, especially during the conflicts, will remind you of video game music from the 80's. Despite this, it all works very well together.<br /><br />The movie is very clever and funny. It is not serious, but the characters believe it is. It is complex enough that you will catch more humor the second time you watch it.<br /><br />While I loved the movie, it won't appeal to most people that don't play video games.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I am finally listening to Illuminations.  I have read some of the reviews, and while I appreciate the time it takes to write a review and how explicit some of them were, I will share just a short one:  How can you not love Josh?  He's adorable with a gift of voice that comes from God.  I have found with every CD Josh has done that after I listen to it a few times, I am lovin' it!  I fully expect this to be the same, whether it was a departure for him, whether it was stripped down, whether it was melancholy or not.  I am totally impressed that he collaborated on most of the songs!  Our boy is growing up and becoming a force!  Awesome!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I saw this movie when it first hit theaters. It was great! Ben Affleck did a wonderful job directing and acting along with all other cast members. The plot was very well written. I simply can't wait for the DVD!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed a serial port to talk to the door security system at the fire department and the adapter we had before would not work on the new 64 bit Win7 system. After looking around, I found this adapter and it works fine as long as you install the latest driver ([...]) and reboot before you plug the cable in the first time.

0307592839|4.0|Readers used to conventionally structured narratives may be frustrated with Jennifer Egan's music industry oriented novel  A Visit From The Goon Squad, at least initially, but for those willing to go along for the ride, it eventually more than pays off.  Its non-linear storyline, with multiple points of view, shuffling back and forth through several decades, might have been more frustrating than absorbing in lesser hands, but Egan's a talented enough writer that her second novel never devolves into a literary stunt.  It helps that the characters are compelling and that the writing is inventive, witty and often richly entertaining.
B00004CZIZ|1.0|Rating of 1 is too high.  I got this DVD after waiting forever as the purchase was international.  DVD player would not play DVD as the player indicated it was prohibited from playing due to my area.  If you are in the US, I highly recommend going to Best Buy to avoid headaches.
B000W796OM|5.0|\\"Not all wizards are good,\\" Hagrid told Harry before he ever passed through the gates at Hogwarts.  In the third installment of the franchise Harry learns that not all wizards--even good ones--are quite what they seem.  There's Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a recent escapee from the wizards' prison at Azkaban, who is believed to be seeking out our young hero with murderous intent; Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), the as-it-turns-out-far-too-aptly-named new instructor in Defense Against the Dark Arts; classmate Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), who begins to display some real competence at his magical studies; Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), who unexpectedly leaps in to defend Harry and his friends from peril; and even pal Ron Weasley's (Rupert Grint) pet rat Scabbers, who turns out to be the pivot-point of the whole tale.  Michael Gambon ably takes over from the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore, and all the old cast, including Hermione Granger, Hagrid, the Weasley family, Draco Malfoy, Fitch, Prof. McGonigle, and the horrible Dursleys, are back in fine form.  Harry begins to realize his true powers in this episode as he learns to summon a protective Patronus spell, and a terrifying new menace, the Dementors, appear, along with a splendid Hippogriff named Buckbeak.  This may be the best of the Potter saga and is certainly required viewing for its fans.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|There are basically no special features on DVD.  Even in the DVD packaging the special features are on BluRay.   You would think a 3 disk set in a DVD box labeled DVD + BluRay. at least 2 of the disks would be DVD.  I saw that there was a huge chunk of special features (font was too small for me to read) so I bought it and low and behold, I can only watch 2 of them.  I don't even get to listen to the commentaries.  anyway, BluRay+DVD or DVD+BluRay; either way DVD users lose.
B0000029AL|3.0|The average listener really doesnt know Aerosmiths debut album. Hell, few average listeners know classic early 70's Aerosmith to began with. But even the most commercial music fan who likes Jamies Got a Gun, Love In An Elevator, Dude, or Rag Doll is aware of some of the hits off the bands early records, this album however is devoid of airplay aside from one major song and maybe a little bit of another. Those bring Dream On and Mama Kin. But is their debut any good? Most call it uneven but AS fans even hard rock fans at least find a few gems on this debut album.     The truth is, it is a great album. There arent many stand out cuts on it. It's more of an album you play the whole way through. Make It, Somebody, One Way Street and Write Me are all competant rock songs, infused with that youthful energy and Stones-ish swagger. These guys definatly know what they're doing. Aerosmith were one of the most important bands of the 70's. Along with Zeppelin, Sabbath, the Who and Alice Cooper they started the idea of \\"album rock\\", songs that generally werent big singles but were so good, they warranted airplay for longer tracks, this of course mainly being served up on what was at the time the underground FM radio. This first album finds the boys out of Boston, trying to find their sound, sure it's underdeveloped but theres hints of what would become in not too long. Movin' Out has a famaliar riff and is a good song as well, but its the final song, a cover of Rufas Thomas' Walkin The Dog that really cooks. Previously done by the Stones (no surprise there), Aerosmith really brings the whole album together with this rocklicking barn burner.    As with most debut albums, there's always the band trying to find what theyre looking for, laying down those tracks they had been playing in smokey bars and clubs for the last year. Mama Kin is of course the energetic rocker that a few years later would finally become a recognizable track but it was Dream On that was the albums major sell point. Of course when released in early 72, it wasnt a hit. Most people dont realize it wasnt until around late 75/early 76 the song was re-released after the band were superstars and become one of thier staple tracks, it was actually on their debut. While Aerosmith is often cited as a major influence on the birth of American heavy metal, that MIGHT be so, but the band was way more steeped in the blues and Stones' style party till you die swaggering to be considered in along with Ozzy and the boys. This album may not appeal to everyone but for those curious as to where Aerosmith got their start, and a great slice of early 70's American rock n roll, check this record out.
0784011176|4.0|This is a great movie.  Holly Hunter is amazing.  Viewers should be warned that this movie is really intense.  It's not a happy fluffy romance.  There is violence, prejudice, bribery, and lots of other non-fluffly human emotions.  I don't usually like these movies but the actors made it impossible not to love.  If you're looking for intense and thought-provoking, this is a great pick.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This was sheer delight. Besides the fun story, great lines, wonderful visuals, incredible voices they got smth that few movies or cartoons have now - intelligence (like one of the reviewers already mentioned) and fantastic rythm. The soundtrack is captivating and so adds to the general merriment. I had an idea of watching for half an hour and then continuing the next day. A-ha... sat till 2 am in total rapture and giggled like crazy.     One drawback (for the audience) and I believe some viewers already stumbled on it - having sense of humor is a must.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I work in the industry and just love this movie!  Even my tired, jaded old eyes are excited by it!  The story is great fun for people who love Kung Fu movies, but is also told in a way that makes it enjoyable to a broader audience.  It has great humour throughout that's fun and charming without having to go to the vulgar side.    The animation is top notch.  This is my area of expertise, and I just love the animation. The physical believability is very good, and on top of it, the movement has been stylistically well thought out to have interesting texture to the timing and look lively and beautiful.  The acting is very nicely done.  Also, the introduction is in the hand-drawn style.  It's graphically simple, yet sophisticated and powerful.  The end credits also have a strong graphic quality that's just fun to watch.    Other areas in which I'm not totally expert still have importance, and I know what I like.  The sense of design throughout the movie is strong and cohesive.  It's appealing and understandable.  The art direction is wonderful.  Very pretty pictures with good understanding of colour and tonal value that support and enhance the mood of each part of the movie.  You get totally drawn into that world.  The choreography of the fight sequences is beautifully thought out.  It's exciting and entertaining.  Even the more outlandish moves have a ring of truth and believability.    The part of the panda has got to have been written with Jack Black in mind.  Even if that weren't necessarily so, from the writing to the voice acting to the animation performance, the teamwork to get this character to be like this is tight.  His sensibility permeates the character.  And you like him from the start of the movie, which makes it so easy to be pulling for him all the way through.  The rest of the characters in the movie, from the old master tortoise to the adoptive father goose are beautifully done and a joy to watch. The all star cast of voice actors add a dimension of fun without distracting from the story.    Also, the craftsmanship of the DVD and it's case are...     ..well, they're standard, aside from the nice cover art,   but the movie is really great!
B000VEF6DG|4.0|This is a particularly well written piece, although it may be percieved as a financial or wealth building book, I feel it is more of a study of psychology. The book breaks down the different personalities and fiscal lifestyles of various individuals, all of which have a net worth of over $1 mil USD.<br /><br />There is no real investment strategy or advice to structure your savings, rather, this is a directive to reduce consumerism, increase savings, do not rely on credit, cut costs where you can, drive used cars, etc. Basically the book outlines the fact that wealthy people do not become wealthy by spending.<br /><br />Great read, it certainly changed some of my lifestyle choices.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|The video & audio quality of this blu-ray are great, there's more special features than I think I can bring myself to watch and my POS blu-ray player that does not support updates plays it just fine. Clearly there were some liberties taken for the sake of plausibility (term used very loosely) instead of following the manga to the letter and for the sake of timeline. What took months in the manga takes place over the course of like 2 weeks in the movie.    This movie is a cameo fest though.  Bruce Willis' daughter from live free or die hard, Superman from superman returns, Thomas Jane (The Punisher), Bella's friend from Twilight, Romeo from Boondock Saints 2 and a handful of other are all through the movie.    This movie is based on a comic book/manga, and the story is a guy fighting for the woman he loves (literally fighting her 7 evil exes) with a bunch of video game reverences and over the top martial arts, it's campy and stars Michael Cera... if you're expecting culture and art you way want to depart the train now.    To everyone who gives these movies crappy reviews:  If you don't like comic book or video game based movies... stop watching them because you'll never be happy with one, and at this point you're just looking for something to complain about.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|OK, $90 for 2 classic and 2 near stinkers.. in this economy? And to top it off the transfer for the worse movies are the worst? Not sure how Fox planned on getting $90 out of my wallet for this set - not happening. Well, it looks like they added 700 hours of extras..... when a couple hours would have sufficed. Did I ask to be taken behind the scenes of the behind the scenes? No. Did I asked to be heavy-petted by an Alien? Apparently because that's what this feels like. I'm getting less hours at work these days and I have less patience for sets like this. Give me the first 2 movies separately for $15 each, or ok, I'll relent and take the set for $40-$50, until then get out of my face!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've always enjoyed this series from the moment I first watched it.  Each time I come back to it I thoroughly enjoy it again.      It's space cowboy sensibility is unusual and fresh.  The characters are all well defined and fit together nicely into this world, into which I just love to be drawn.  I like them all, from the more upright to the slightly darker and morally ambiguous.  There's also the fun battle between integrity and being practical that these smugglers, especially Nathan Fillion's \\"strong man of few words\\" character, struggle with.  They all have their issues, things to hide, and things they love or want, that make you want to keep watching them.  And their relationships with each other are very entertaining to watch.    And everyone's so beautiful that this whole world is put on a different aesthetic level.  Within it the more plain or ugly people might still be supermodels in the real world.    Supermodels, cowboys, science fiction.  It's a great combination.  What makes me come back is the great sharp clever stories with great characters with fascinating relationships.
B003L77G6A|3.0|I am a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory. I have Seasons 1-3 on DVD and while I want to get season 4 i've got one nagging issue.    I am so tired of the character of Amy Farrah Fowler. So much so that as of the last episode I no longer want to watch the show when it airs without an episode summary to let me know if she is in it or not.    Please I love this show but Amy Farrah Fowler is just killing it.

B0040JHWKS|4.0|DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN remains one of the pinnacle rock records.  It's a dark, brooding album about ordinary life and people--the working class captured in melody and lyric, which would become Springsteen's bread and butter for the remainder of his career.  THE PROMISE is a collection of tracks that didn't make the original cut.  There are obvious reasons for this (most of these songs don't stand up to anything on the original album), but it's still a collection worth a few repeated looks.<br /><br />Primarily, the collection serves as a sort of snapshot of the progression of a music icon.  \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight\\") stands as an example: the melody, and some of the lyric, is that of \\"Factory,\\" and other lyrics are from \\"Johnny Bye-Bye\\" (and possibly other songs).  Many of these tunes were eventually transformed; \\"Candy's Room\\" is more melodic than the original, and \\"The Promise\\" would eventually pop up on TRACKS (or at least the single-disc 18 TRACKS version; I forget if it was in the boxed set).  Others wound up on TRACKS as well, and \\"Racing in the Street\\" is a re-tooling (again, slightly more melodic) than the original.  In fact, there is a surprisingly large emphasis upon melody; \\"Fire\\" is more engaging and slightly less frenzied than the live version we all know (as is \\"Because the Night,\\" finally available in a studio version).  Few of these songs would actually have fit on the DARKNESS album itself (except \\"The Promise\\" and possibly \\"City at Night\\"), because they are just so catchy.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; collected here, they all fit, congealing into an album that isn't one of Springsteen's best, but is certainly one of his more danceable.<br /><br />Perhaps the most surprising thing is that, even though some of these songs have been reworked slightly (\\"Save My Love\\" is an entirely new recording of old lyrics), it's hard to tell which hail entirely from the seventies, and which have been retouched.  Springsteen and company sound and play, today, just as good as they ever did (remember that Super Bowl appearance?), and THE PROMISE captures the magic that was, and is, still with them.  It's not a necessity, perhaps, but it's still something most die-hard fans will want--and deserve--to own.s good as they ever did (remember that Super Bowl appearance?), and THE PROMISE captures the magic that was, and is, still with them.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|To me this is the mesmerizing Pink Floyd at their best. An awesome show with all the sounds and sights you'd hope for from this iconic group. You won't be disappointed and if you're not already a fan, you will be.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I am a reluctant Josh Groban fan, slowly admitting he is fantastic after my mother brought him into our lives when I was much younger.  Now I am constantly amazed at his work and I looked forward to this release for a while.  My special edition CD is a Christmas gift so I only have the digital copy for now, but I think that is more than sufficient for me to review the music within.  Many reviews complain that it sounds amateur and not polished.  I think it is brilliant.  My favorite thing about Josh is that his voice needs no adjustment to be album worthy.  I once saw him in a music awards show performing live and after all the famous pop stars sang horribly, he sang flawlessly and put them all to shame.  I appreciate his natural talent, and his songs are all touching, even the ones I cannot understand a word of.    My first run through of this album left me a little cold.  But that is not surprising to me because I think his music goes a little over my head the first time.  With more listens, I pick up more and more until I love the whole thing so much I don't want to turn it off.  I have several of the songs stuck in my head now and I love this time of learning lyrics for future sing-alongs.  He is an amazing artist, as ever, and I think his years of work have paid off.  People who miss the huge swelling music in every song just need to get over it because Josh can sound good without all that crap.  He sounds good with it too, but why not prove himself?  I love both sides, and I look forward to listening to my album even more in the future.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|All I will ay is very briefly, if you love Pink Martini and know their musical style then do not be surprised by this Holiday offering.  It is imaginative, creative, beautiful and joyful...yet with that avant-garde edge which is Pink Martini.  A must for any PM fan...not so sure a must for your Holiday music collection if you are not a PM fan!
0394826817|5.0|With all the usual suspects - particular favourites being Lowly worm and Huckle - this book is much more about just \\"Pleases\\" and \\"Thank Yous\\". It's a great way for kids to learn about manners, safety, and some simple rights and wrongs. It's a good pre-bedtime book, but also good for any time of the day. The pictures are great, and there's something for everyone to learn with this book (but mostly you won't even know you're learning it, because you're too busy enjoying the stories). I'm a big fan of Richard Scarry!!!
0446615641|5.0|This is a great book. No, it probably won't make the category of a literary classic like Moby Dick and such, but for adventure/suspense readers, this book does the trick. Those who rated it with one or two star must've been having a real bad day. How else could they give such a negative review to such a good book.     The character, John Carr (a.k.a. Oliver Stone - thus the title, STONE COLD), is an admirable personality, indeed - highly intelligent, modest and unassuming, strong convictions, fiercely loyal to his friends and principles, brooding over past deceptions to which he'd been victim, grieving over past sins & losses, and incredibly lethal when necessary. True hero material.    If any Hollywood producer happens to read this, which I doubt, STONE COLD (and the whole CAMEL CLUB series) would make for great cinema. Given the right director and screenplay writer, it has potential for a wonderful blend of cinematic humor, pathos, chemistry between the CAMEL CLUB's personalities, and a complex but engaging story line.     And I have a suggestion regarding who might make a great John Carr. Mark Harmon, who plays Leroy Jethro Gibbs on the TV show NCIS, could step right into the character without any trouble, although he may need to bulk up slightly to fit Carr's mold. Leroy Jethro Gibbs and John Carr are very similar - tough, honest, and determined men in a tough world. We need to see more of that.    No need to thank me, Hollywood. Just send me a cut of the profits! Yah, right, I won't hold my breath.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|The Blu ray version of this movie is more than worth the price.  I am mystified by reviewers who are disappointed or fail to see the improvement.  The color is much better and the amount of detail that is visible on a normal flat screen tv is just miles ahead of the old VHS and the previous dvd versions.  I didn't think anything could make me like this film better than I already did, but this just opens up the visual elements of the film and makes it even richer.  The outdoor scenes are gorgeous and really show off the English countryside as I know it.  And the dramatic interiors, costuming and actors are clear and crisp.  There really is no downside to this new version and I kind of think that the occasional whingey reviews here are way off the mark.  I also like the new \\"extras\\" but will certainly keep the old dvd because there are additional, totally different features on that version which are priceless.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Paired with the DSS these headphones are amazing with really good sound and solid bass.  Playing black ops is a treat with explosions rattling my teeth, and at the same time I can hear the faintest enemy footsteps trying to sneak up on me.   I am very happy with the purchase and do not have any complaints about it.       At first the construction seems flimsy, but it is not, merely lightweight, and actually very well built.  It looks the part as well.    I would not recommend this though if you do not like wires!
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|I ordered this movie as a gift for my mother and it arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  She has been trying to rebuild her movie collection ever since the switch from VHS to DVD and I know she will love to have this movie again.  It is one of her favorites.  I would recommend this seller and this product to a friend.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|I am highly praejudiced in favor of Pink Floyd's creators and associated.  This CD does not disappoint.  It's GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0043A0U94|5.0|The Ted Jensen remaster or the Sony Mastersound (out-of-print) are bright and compressed. I was curious, when Audio Fidelity announced \\"52nd Street.\\"  The Audio Fidelity sounds completely different, but in a very good way. A warm, balanced and dynamic mastering from beginning to end. I do prefer the Audio Fidelity pressing over any other version... of course that is my personal preference.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|\\"Illuminations\\" is not even mediocre.  Not one song demands a second listen.  For example, I'm sure Josh had Don McLean's \\"Vincent\\" (a Groban personal favorite) in mind when he wrote \\"Galileo\\", but his ode to the astronomist (\\"oh goody, I can sing about stars and skies again\\") is just plain odorous.  It's a piece of contrived emotion that fails miserably.  And the others are even worse.     Groban can sing, but whovever told him he could write did him a big disservice. There are plenty of penniless, passionate, \\"straight from the heart\\" songwriters out there who will stay broke because good intentions and a little bit of piano playing ability don't equate to song writing talent. Groban needs to write this album off as a horrific experiment and start seeking out the professionals who know how to create a memorable tune.     A great voice needs a great song.  There are plenty of well written standards that Josh could introduce to a new audience and make them his own.  But not this junk.  This stuff wouldn't make the grade in a middle school talent show. It's a waste of time, talent, effort and money for everyone involved, not to mention the huge disappointment to fans who plunked down good money for this crap expecting something of caliber.
0783225903|4.0|This is a very dark, very cynical look into the future from a couple of decades ago, which turned out to be relatively accurate. All the issues addressed have come to fruition here in 2010. I am so glad a friend of mine recommended this movie; I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark comedy, the slightly serious side of satire, and a bit of fantasy thrown in for flavor.
B001HN694K|5.0|I really love this movie! Like every Disney movie, it is full of details and excellent actors and voices. The animation is immaculate and very realistic (use your imagination)
1594481717|5.0|I thought that when I first starting reading this book it was going to be nothing but a lot of technical jargon that went way over my head. What I found was a fascinating book that brought to light what I feel is our next big avenue for success in our country.   I think the book clearly shows that our technical jobs will continue to leave our country at a fast pace. Why should we be doing something that a computer can do or why would we pay 5000 dollars a month when we could do it for 500? Does our demand for lower cost not insure this trend? Our next big thing is using our creativity.  I feel this book opened my mind to question is our education system on the right path to train our children to be more right brain thinkers than left brain. I would tend to say no since we place so much on test taking.  Read the book and just imagine the possibilities of what we could create by being creative. Give this book a chance for I don't feel you will be sorry. Use the resources that it suggests for further study on right brain thoughts.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|This album is a HUGE disappointment.  It's amateurish, the orchestrations are shallow, the lyrics are childish.  I hated it!!!  Josh, we've waited so long for a new album, and this is it? Bummer.
1935251740|5.0|Not being a quantum physicist, I can't really comment on the hard science in the book; however, the theory that is presented is really fascinating.<br /><br />My background is in literature and psychology and I found the book to be one of the most interesting that I have read.  The authors present a theory that is liberating and just plain fun to explore.  I have found myself rehashing the author's ideas at 3:00 a.m.  I believe the theory will be discussed for generations to come.<br /><br />I know this sounds a little \\"new wave\\"; however, after reading the book and mulling the ideas, I couldn't help but think that I've known much of this intuitively since I was a child.<br /><br />It really taps the reader's inquisitive nature.
B00408MS5S|4.0|Ignore the inconsistent way the tracks are labeled on Amazon -- all on the first disc are remastered, and all on the second disc are live. The 2010 remaster is quite a bump up from the original CD issue; not so noticeable (to my aging ears) from the 2002 remaster.     The real treat here is of course the second disc, which offers live versions for the first time of a number of tracks. \\"Oh Darling\\" and \\"Child of Vision\\" (from 'Breakfast') and \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\" have never appeared on a live album release; \\"Give a Little Bit\\" has only appeared live on a b-side. The disc also contains the only live version released of \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" before Roger Hodgson left the band. (Rick Davies sings lead, however Hodgson can be heard on backing vocals.)     The remaining tracks can't compete with definitive versions from Supertramp's height-of-career-capping live album 'Paris' but the banter before songs reveals a band proud of their latest offerings; and the performances show a different kind of exuberance than documented on the more polished and confident 'Paris'.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is the paradigm by which all Robin Hood films and actors are measured. This is a must have for all collections. People may forget Flynn's many roles, but this one will remain a favorite for many decades. Regardless of how many remakes are made in the future.
0802473156|5.0|This book is well written, easy to read, and simple to apply. This book will help you in your relationships and/or marriage. It came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others. I bought several copies to give as wedding/Christmas gifts.
0061537969|5.0|I love to read.  But it has been a very long time since a book has touched me like this one did.  I love dogs, but do not have even the slightest interest in auto racing.  I could barely set this book down; the story was just so captivating.  I laughed and cried.  A brilliant story.
1439177783|5.0|In Unbearable Lightness, Portia takes the reader into the dark and often misunderstood world of an eating disorder.  I was blown away by the honesty and emotional vulnerability in the book.  For someone who was so afraid to let people in, she is letting the world walk beside her as she relieves a tragic and dark past.  The most moving part was the epilogue.  Being an anorexic is hard work, but recovery is even harder.  The epilogue is one of the more moving pieces of literature I've read in a long time.  I appreciate how Portia gives voice to the desperation that people suffering from eating disorders experience; it's not glamours nor Hollywood, but hell.

9626343613|5.0|Juliet Stevenson is incomparable when it comes to telling Jane Austen's stories.  I have a nice collection going and prefer her above all others. She gives clear distinction to each character and her dramatizations are perfectly pitched.  I highly recommend listening to the unabridged versions as so much of Jane's stories end up on the cutting room floor otherwise. Give yourself an afternoon break by listening to a chapter or two of these insightful and softly painted word canvasses.  I love being a \\"Janeite\\"...won't you join me?
0312600844|1.0|I am a voracious reader with an appetite for a good story. I've never previously read a book by John Franzen, but I'd heard such glowing reviews about him as an author and storyteller that I eagerly decided to read his new novel.     Boy am I glad I checked this book out of the library instead of buying it outright. This book was PAINFUL to read. The characters were annoying and not at all interesting. It seems that Franzen was more adept at bringing more blah-blah-blah onto the pages rather than creating a world built upon creative storytelling that lets the reader's imagination take flight. The characters had no depth, their points of view were so shallow and unfathomable that I often found my eyes skipping way ahead just to find words worth reading.     As another reader pointed out - it took well into the page 300's before the story became slightly interesting. Then it fell off again. The one character that I thought would be the interesting one - Joey, was nothing more than a disappointment and his constant hatred of Patty was mean-spirited and was never really quantified. He was just a brat who was verbally abusive to his family.      After suffering for over 300 pages, I finished reading the book on principle. The last 50 pages went fairly rapidly - but that may have more to do with my desire to just finish-reading-the-boring-book-already than any real interest in the storyline.     meh.
B0016NF06O|4.0|Great CD !  Nothing instrumentally or vocally outstanding but it just works.  Very easy and pleasant to listen to with both blues and jazz overtones that complement each other beautifully.  Love it and would recommend to any blues/jazz fan !
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Groban does not disappoint! This album is a little folksier and more personal than others, but it's also got a slightly more contemporary feel. There are a few heartbreaking songs (missed opportunity at love) \\"Higher Window\\" is a great example. The disc also has a few powerhouse suprises like \\"Straight to You\\" from the gothic rocker Nick Cave. What a blast to hear what an orchestra and baritone can do with lyrics like that! As expected, Josh puts every fiber of his being into each and every word. The other kicker is that his beautiful voice has matured and he has managed to get lower and higher in range. This collection is awsome and the more you listen - the more you appreciate it.
0312600844|1.0|This book is a transparent excuse for a liberal diatribe. The tiresome cartoonish characters, graphic gratuitous sex scenes and scatological adolescent humor left me wondering why the book had gotten such good reviews. PU. I usually don't like Oprah's selections, and this was no exception.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|As I leaf through, listen, and view all of the material, I actually find myself saying, Wow, this was only $79.99?  What a bargain. I am just enthralled. It's kind of like being a kid at Disneyland.  You just need more than one visit to this thing in order to see it all.   The Notebook--Well that's just an intense and personal look at Bruce Springsteen.    The DVDs--Nice  The CDs--Wow. There's a lot of really good Bruce here.  So, with all this stuff sitting here before me, I can say no more because I must get back to it. If you love Bruce, you cannot be without this.  I have lived with and loved the man and all his music ( except the song Skin to Skin on The Rising ) for the last 37 years, many of those years with folks around here saying to me \\" Is he still alive?\\"   I always say, and I always mean it, \\"Guys, he never went anywhere. He just sits around and gets better and better.\\"  While maybe not new, it's still a deep, intense, personal look at the man, the band, the music.   I could not be happier with it.  I am not John, I am John's wife, Lisa,
B001NXDIMK|4.0|One word of advice going in to Damages Season 2...  on no accounts watch it without having seen Season 1.   Arguably every bit as good as the first season, we are once again embroiled in the law firm of which Glenn Close plays the matriarch, Patty Hewes.  Well, maybe that's inaccurate to call her a matriarch, after all, this is one of the ballsiest characters on the small screen at the moment.  And, this time around, we get to see more about how this character ticks.  Yes, there is a similarly convoluted plot with reveals and surprises, and once again an interestingly casual use of chronology to tell the story in the way that reveals most about the characters, rather than purely serving the storyline... however, with the addition of an excellent William Hurt, we peek under the hood of Glenn Closes character in a way that was only hinted at in the first season.  It's a brave and effective move, justifying what could have felt like a somewhat redundant second season.  All the characters from season 1 turn up at some point or other.. though Ted Danson's character feels rather awkwardly shoehorned in this time, and his character arc as he attempts spiritual enlightenment feels weakest.  In addition to Danson, we have an always excellent Timothy Olyphant, Marcia Gay Harden and able support from Tate Donovan and even Mario van Peebles amongst others.  While Glenn Close once again anchors the season, making it must see, the series loses its step with Rose Byrne as Ellen Parsons, around whom the plot revolves.  The character calls for a tightrope of vulnerability and toughness, balanced between poised composure and damaged soul... someone able to hold their own with Glenn Close.  Whether it's the writers, or her acting talent, her character fails to consistently hit the mark, and you sometimes wish her scenes could end and move on to the other more engaging characters.  Happily, they normally do.    All in all, if you liked season 1, then you should enjoy this at least as much.  If you didn't see Season 1 - it's not too late to catch up.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|After waiting 4 arduous years for this CD I was immensely disappointed in the amateurish and deficient music it had to offer.  It is erratic and unfinished; the songs go from simplistic and 'folksy' to mega orchestrations that make you feel like you should be in church on a kneeler and the only one who should be begging forgiveness is Groban himself who is offering up this unadorned, unassembled, incomplete work that doesn't compliment someone with such a classically trained voice at all.  True it would be a shame if he had been MIA for so many years and then fed his true fans more of the same ballads and classical pieces but these are what drew the fans to him in the first place.  Awake was very 'out of the box' for Groban and quite enjoyable but Illuminations feels like he dawdled for 4 years then threw together a cheese sandwich at the last minute and tossed to his starving fans who were chomping at the bit for something new to chew on.  I have heard this CD but I will not waste my money on buying it.  I have been a fan of Josh for 6 years and the fact that he put together such garbage and calls it 'the best he's ever done' really disappoints me and I'm not the only one.  There are many of his diehard fans who don't care for this tripe but are stomped to death by fans who are blinded by the fact that it's Josh and it's quantity over quality.  Try to see it this way; it's as though you have been going to a favorite restaurant every day for several years because they make the best soup you've ever tasted and then after not having this delicious concoction for a few days go back to discover that they've changed the recipe and it tastes awful ... you wouldn't go back, right?  You wouldn't waste your money on another bowl just to see if you could grow accustomed to the new flavor would you?  Well after listening to it a few times just to see if I might \\"learn\\" to like it I decided that if I have to force or teach myself to like it then I really don't and there's no point in making me want to poke my eardrums out with a hot knitting needle.

B003NFM3JK|2.0|Hey everyone, well I really wanted to like this movie... however it was just to weird... funny at very very few parts.... Sorry Disney my family gives this movie.. 2 out of 5 stars!!! This Christmas Carol Movie went very wrong!!!!<br /><br />Thanks<br />Its your Review from the Jay Guy
B000FGGE7C|5.0|As a die hard Milla fan, I had purchased this originally on standard def DVD, and was fairly satisfied with the pq & aq.  On a whim, I rented the BD, and was completely blown away.  Even given the highly stylized video presentation of the film, the BD pq & aq are vastly superior to the standard release.  Highly recommended!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I've seen these books in the store and was very reluctant to try it and when I did the first chapter was quite long and plainly put just down right boring it was kind of difficult with all the swedish names and places to get attached to the book but I decided to stick with it... and I'm so glad that I did once it started to pick up I could not put the book down I finished it in a couple of days and I already have The Girl who Played with Fire.

B002MW50KO|1.0|fails on every level: as a Bob Dylan album, as a Christmas album, as a musical album, as a mug coaster...it was dreadful to listen to, even with fast forwarding.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Big thanks to the parent that posted the review for this item as an accessory to their Uppa Baby Vista.  I tried several items, and this was by far the best fit.  It doesn't have a huge amount of space, but it is enough for a 3/4 liter camelbak bottle (fits well and can be removed and replaced with one hand with a little practice!), a sippy cup or bottle for my son, a cell phone, keys and a small wallet.  It is also sturdy enough that I wouldn't worry about a cup of tea in a travel cup spilling - that was my biggest concern.  I assumed that it would swing back and forth throughout our walks (I walk at least 3 miles with my son every day), but it is really very sturdy when it is weighted down with our gear.  There's even a small compartment for stashing a bit of cash/change as needed.  For $10, it is exactly what we needed.    For those who want something flashier, the Baby Jogger Parent Console with build in mp3 player also worked well on the Uppa Baby and was an easier fit for the camelbak (no learning curve on how to get it in and out with one hand), but for $50, the unnecessary additional of the mp3 speakers wasn't worth it to me (and it seemed somewhat obnoxious to boot!).
B000F4LPJ6|2.0|Have you read the original novel?  If not, then you are totally missing the story behind all this.  Maybe people just love action and violence, and not much else...  Even taking this purely as a standalone movie, it's not particularly great.  Sure, it had a potential of being much deeper and meaningful and showed flashes here and there, but without ever going into the details of why those kids had to fight the fights they fought.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|Real quick here - I thought the movie itself was just ok, the story was so-so, the villain wasn't authentic enough, Mickey Roarke played the part well, but the character involved him being a brainiac and a tough guy. The fight scenes were predictable and didn't like Cheadle playing his own Iron Man's sidekick.   Overall the movie does have some good action scenes but parts are boring too.   Paltrow was better in this than in Iron Man 2, and Scarlett Johansson was more or less eye candy. The real winner in this film is the great soundtrack. Great surround sound and the race scene was spectacular. Primarily for this reason I would want to own this movie. But not for $20 or so.
0756659841|5.0|This book is awesome for any little Lego fan!  There are tons of stickers.  Great, great,   great book, especially for the price.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|this movie (I think) was not a big production, but the fight scenes are very realist! Zoe Saldana fighting like a man was brilliant!!!<br />Very Great!
B000DZIGDU|1.0|The bottom line for me, a retired Marine, is that this movie is an insult to all Marines.  Unfortunatly due to location I purchase my movies... this one is for traget practice as I will never watch it again and would not want to pass it on to anyone.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|I haven't read any of the other reviews, but, I must say that I am surprised that this CD has so far only garnered 3 piddly little stars.  Maybe I love this CD so much because I didn't follow Kid Rock much as a rapper. I enjoyed some of his hard rock, but this CD is by far the best work I think he has ever done.  It's upbeat, it's passionate and it showcases his ability to play just about any musical genre.<br />FIVE STARS!!!!!
1592332803|5.0|LOVE IT. I'm surprised to see all the neg. reviews.  This is HANDS DOWN the BEST vegan cookbook I have tried.  Simple ingredients and instructions and results have been ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 9 times out of 10.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for vegans and non vegans alike.
031603438X|4.0|I guess anything written by a beatle or a rolling stone is of the utmost importance as a historic document for a rock and roll fan.This book has been awaited for quite some time and now it is only Mick´s who´s missing to complete the picture.  The hardcover edition is great,good pics and Keith´s writting is as fun as he is.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|I had watched the documentary on \\"The Promise\\" and was amazed first that there was so much unpublished music out there from Springsteen.  Darkness has always been one of my favorite Springsteen albums and The Promise delivers in a way that not many could expect.  To me, it takes the listener on a journey back to the late 70's and puts you into Springsteen when he was at his best (before he got political).  He writes of love and loss and the melodies he puts together rank up with some of his finest.  I was unsure on whether or not to buy the Blu-Ray package and I may down the road but for now, I am going to wear out the CD's.  This is a must buy for any fan of late 70's rock and of course for fans of The Boss.
B002436WFI|5.0|If you like fantasy mini-series, this is definitely a good one to check out! It's got all the hallmarks of the genere - magic, comedy, trials to overcome, fight scenes, etc. Tim Curry is fantastic as the main badguy, and the supporting cast of characters make for a lot of fun.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|It received my package pretty fast and it was sent to me as described. I will defiantly buy from the seller again.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|This is an amazing CD and I enjoy listening to every bit of it. Even my 3 year old daughter loves this CD.
0521675804|2.0|I purchased this book to help out an ESL student. I expected it to be excellent due to its glowing recommendations. It is awful. Instead of teaching grammatical structure with an organized layout, it is just a list of 2 page spreads that show examples of one small aspect of grammar. This is supposed to be easier than systematic approaches because it is more \\"real\\" or something.<br /><br />Basically, it never teaches you the tree, just a million leaves all mish-mash with no rhyme or reason. This is far more confusing, not only to me (a native), but to the the ESL student I'm working with. People keep bashing systematic grammar for religious reasons, but it is simply the easiest way to learn. Learning \\"a list of rules and exceptions\\" is far easier than learning a million and one patterns with no explanation/structure/logic behind it.<br /><br />This would only be good as \\"spot practice\\" for someone who has a firm grasp of English grammar already.
031603438X|5.0|This is possibly the best rock bio I have ever read,and it seems I have read everybodys. I am almost through and I am dreading finishing it,because as a reader you honestly feel like you are sitting to keith listening to all this. I have  read books thats were obvious strategiv career moves with no depth. I have read books that were tell alls on fellow celebrities,and while this book has a few stories in it,you really feel like it is nothing that those people have not heard from Keith himself. Some of what Keith says in the book has already been misquoted or overblown so dont take anyones word on it-read it yourself you wont be sorry.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Not only are these some of my favorite thought provoking songs, but I love the expression of the worldwide universality of the concepts. My 5th grade students rank this DVD as their number one choice. After giving my parents a copy, my brother and sister each wanted a copy for their families.
B00110K62U|1.0|I ordered 2 DVD's on Amazon.com:  - Les misérables  - Phanton of the Opera    I was so happy receiving them 2 weeks ago. To my deepest regret I cannot play them as the DVD's are written for zone 1 and as I am living in Europe my DVD is only supporting DVD's for zone 2.  I do not know what to do.  I have been searching for these DVD's (especially les misérables) for such a long time and now that I have finally found them I cannot play them.  Nowhere during the purchase of the DVD it is mentioned that it is suited only for zone 1.  Can you please help me to find a way to be able to play the DVD.  Is there a specific computer programme to converse the DVD or can we switch them to a DVD for zone 2 of for zone ALL?
0061537934|5.0|I gave this to my wife after a friend recommeneded it to me. She absolutely loved the book and basically consumed it in 24 hours.
1933492953|5.0|One of the most important books on composition and storytelling and the use of Black & White!  Exactly how to convey the reader's attention, for people like me, must be very careful about creating a compelling story, this book is very useful.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is absolutely AMAZING! I didn't know what to think when i saw the previews but when I watched it in theaters, I was blown away by the storyline, characters, and effects that I had to see it again! It is an incredible movie & I have been waiting (impatiently!!) for this movie to come out! I would definitely have to say this is the most interesting, mind-blowing, action-packed movie I have seen in a while and I highly recommend EVERYONE watch Inception at least once, maybe even twice!!
0394818237|5.0|I bought this book several months ago for my 3 year old son, but the first time my dad read it, he sat there and finished it long after my son's attention span expired and he ran off to do other things - it's that interesting! There is so much to look at and talk about on each page, and it is especially fascinating for those mechanically minded children who like to know how things work. There is a great deal of detail in the illustrations, making it a fun book for 2 year olds to skim over the high points, or for four and five year olds to really explore. My son loves trains and asks me to read \\"The Train Trip\\" to him often. I highly recommended this book.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I replaced a 305 that served me reliably for four years, then mysteriously just quit.  At the time I considered simply buying a replacement 305, but I figured Garmin must have something much better out by now, so I bought a 405CX.  The good news is the 405CX is no where near as clunky looking as the 305, it picks up the GPS satellites much quicker, the battery lasts a whole lot longer, and the chest strap seems to fit a little more comfortably although it looks the same as the old one.  I don't use the virtual partner or pace functions and I don't upload my workouts so I don't have an opinion on them.  The touch bezel and the way the menus are organized is why I only gave the 405CX two stars.  The bezel is really frustrating, if its cool and your body isn't sweaty it seems to work okay.  When it's raining or you're sweaty, however, the thing seems to have a mind of its own.  It switches screens when you don't want it to and it won't switch when you do.  I have to stop wipe it and my hands and arms off in order to get it back under control.  You don't even need to touch it with your fingers, if it brushes against your body or sweaty shirt, off it goes.  You can lock the bezel so it doesn't change, but then you don't get access to all the information you've selected.  The labels aren't very intuitive either so you'd better plan on spending a lot of quality time with the online instruction manual.  You also need to pay attention when you attach the charger, unlike the 305 that had a charging cradle, the 405CX employs a clip like device that has a couple of contacts you must make sure fit into to two indentations on the watch back.  Nothing more frustrating than to strap on the watch and discover the battery is dead because you didn't get the charging clip firmly on the contacts.  Like all Garmin devices it is well made and the GPS functions well, as does the heart monitor, but that touch bezel is too gimmicky for me.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Utilizing instruments from another age, Annie Lennox creates a unique Christmas CD.  She sings powerfully (and un-enhanced), presenting music that almost sounds as if it were recorded live--no auto-tuners here.  Her self-harmonizing adds to the overall effect (no one can harmonize better with a singer than him or herself). Standouts on the CD including her haunting renditions of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" and \\"The Holly and the Ivy.\\" Her \\"Universal Child\\" is the only song that seems out of place, more befitting a non-holiday CD than here amid Christmas standards, but it's a small quibble.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I impatiently waited for the release of this album and it was well worth the wait. Its dramatically different from her last dark and edgy CD. My favorite tracks are Cheers, Skin, California King Bed, Raining Men and What's My name. I'm looking forward to her next. I own them all :-)
B000EYK4GW|5.0|I ordered the video, \\"Dumbo (Big Top Edition), for my granddaughter.  She loves Dumbo, watching the video many times, especially the cartoons included.  The video I received was as advertised, i.e., in great shape, no noticeable scratches or smudges, high quality, packaged well, and sent promptly.  I am very satisfied with my order of this video.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban's  voice  in this  cd  keeps  getting better and  better and  more  powerful than ever!! I  know  it's  different from  his  other albums  but  this  is  an  amazing  collection!!! Can't stop  playing  since  I  got  it!! My favorite is  the  song Higher Window! A  song  filled  with so much emotions!! Thank you Josh  for  yet another GREAT MUSIC!!
B00415Z9VA|5.0|Man these guys are prolific; three CD releases in as many years.  Its kind of old school in a way; bands used to operate like this as opposed to the longer intervals that tend to be more common now.  Its nice to see though; there seems to more of a tendency for evolution rather than revolution between releases.  And that's pretty much what we have with AD's newest \\"End of Eden\\"; its about the same size a step from \\"Clouds\\" as \\"Clouds\\" was from \\"River\\".    So first off, its the same AD we all know and love.  Razor sharp, extremely melodic, pretty speedy, and exquisite vocals from Heidi.  Honestly, if I was in a Finnish metal band now I'd probably be depressed just because the technical standard is so high; I don't know how AD could be better in that respect.  As was the case with the previous two CDs; there are a couple of songs that just jumped out at me; that would be \\"Arctica\\" and \\"Field of Serpents\\".  \\"Arctica\\" just because its so catchy and crafted so well and \\"Field of Serpents\\" because of its little arrangement surprises.  Most of the other songs are really good as well; seems you start to get a little desensitized to how good they are that just because its so routine for AD.  Just as the previous two CDs, I do think \\"End of Eden\\" has some flat spots.  Those would \\"Virvatulen Laulu\\" and maybe, to some extent, within the closer \\"War in Heaven\\".  The former because its a straight operatic exercise that doesn't seem to fit in too well with the rest of the songs and the latter because its only good, not great (clunky male vocals and it just needs a bit more impact).    The differences this time are generally a plus.  \\"End of Eden\\" has a bigger more expansive sound. Its a got a nice consistent atmosphere; even though Tuomas Seppala has said its not a concept album, it does tend to create that kind of impression.  In \\"End of Eden\\", it really seems to me that Heidi's voice and the band's instrumentation is balanced much more evenly than before.  The previous two CDshad a bit of a feeling that Heidi's voice was floating on top of the band; it has a much more integrated feel here.  Its partly the result of a better mix, but more so, I think, of Tuomas & Heidi learning to mesh more effectively as time goes on.  To that last point, it seems that Heidi's vocal performance and arrangements are more restrained this time, but that could turn out to be a plus in terms of how this CD ages.  There are some longer songs on this and a bit less predictability - both pluses because one could contend that aspect of AD's writing (song structure, length, & arrangement) has been somewhat formulaic.  Its also heavier sounding, as Tuomas promised, and even though there is room for progress on mid-tempo heavy songs (eg \\"War in Heaven\\"), AD has taken some positive steps in that direction.      Tuomas has also said that he can't see any reason why AD wouldn't go on for 10 years or more; based on what we've seen so far, one would expect to see the pattern of frequent releases and evolutionary steps to continue.  AD is a really strong band with a lot of upside.   Part of me wants to see them take a giant step and push the whole genre forward; there are so many hints, within all three of their CDs, that they are capable of that.  But another part wants them to keep on going as they are; though one sometimes encounters a sentiment that there are boatloads of female fronted melodic metal bands around; I don't think there are enough, definitely not ones of this caliber.    So, which AD release to buy?  Doesn't really matter...all three are excellent.  Fans of power metal, melodic metal, more awesomeness from Finland, whatever you want to call it, should be well pleased with any AD release.  And for fans of female fronted version of same...no brainer...get all three of them!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I did not buy the BD version in April because I knew this version was coming later in the year. I am SOOOO happy I waited.   Simply Awesome.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Being a fan of Kid Rock for years, I was excited to hear some new music from him. I heard some of \\"Born Free\\" during the world series and liked the song. After getting the album, I realized that its the only song worth listening to on the album. Are they all terrible? No, not if you like honky tonk. This is by far the worst Kid Rock album. I understand that some artists want to expand their horizons, but in this case, it's a change for the worse. If this is the direction he's going, I won't buy another album of his. I'm glad that I didn't pay the full price for the CD and just got it from Amazon through their MP3 site for the marked down price. Only wasted $4.
0865479186|5.0|I never expected any popular technical writer to be able to top the Freakonomics books, but Dr Goldacre does a fantastic job of sucking you in and then engrossing you in what would seem to be the next dullest of subjects - medical statistics. Most of the cases and examples are of British origin but fortunately so is his wit. I am a professional in the field of health science and pay a lot of attention to the \\"evidence basis\\" of healthcare policy, but honestly I learned a lot from this book.<br /><br />He starts out with a frontal assault on homeopathy but turns more catholic in his debunking, including the purported quality of randomized clinical trials, and even the systematic reviews that are the bedrock of contemporary medical practice. Of course the pharmaceutical industry comes off as the villian it is, but more amusing is Goldacre's take on how the media promotes half-truths and outright lies in order to sell itsa product as well.  This has been made well known by Dr. Ioannides, whose article on the subject made history of sorts by being the most downloaded article in the past 5 years from any medical journal.<br /><br />This would be an extremely fun book only for the \\"Freakonomics\\" style humor and whimsical approach to a deadly serious subject, but the content makes it an essential read for anyone who has a self-image of being a careful consumer.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|I actually have a love/hate relationship with Trans-Europe Express.  On one side, you have really catchy beats and electronic sounds utilized in a melodic and commercialized kind of way, so that almost guarantees lots of instantly likeable and melodic ideas.      However, it also means Kraftwerk changed their style a little, so now their actual melodies consist of several beats and synths that repeat for several minutes in a row, and the entire first half consits of three songs that are *all* overlong by a good 3-4 minutes.    \\"Europe Endless\\" is well... endless.  At least that one repetitive drum pattern is.  It just keeps going and going.  Luckily there's a splendid vocal melody being sung, so -unlike so many of the newer dance/techno bands influenced by late 70's Kraftwerk- at least I can sing along to a pretty good melody in THIS case.  It definitely should have been shortened by a good 3 minutes though, or perhaps they should have just eliminated the last time the vocal melody makes an appearance.    Ever wonder what it would be like to go to a carnival late at night when nobody is around, with the lights shut off and the only sound you hear is the sound of the wind blowing?  Then you stumble across that one room most carnivals feature with those mirrors that play tricks with your head?  Well wonder no more, because \\"The Hall of Mirrors\\" will put that kind of spooky imagery in your head, haha.  I agree with the reviewer below that the song doesn't really contain a vocal melody, and the only time the lead singer even catches my attention is when the singer repeats the name of the title song by adding talking bits in place of a verse melody.  On the other hand, the synths are REALLY dreamy and just bizarre beyond belief, so I end up liking the song anyway.    \\"Showroom Dummies\\" definitely reveals Kraftwerk were way ahead of their time because it indicates something from the early 80's, not something from 1977 (and certainly not any disco songs I've ever heard).Even the vocal melody and the lyrics remind me of the golden early new wave days of the dance-crazed 80's scene.  Amazing.      Perhaps the best song is \\"Franz Schubert\\" because it's REALLY lush, dreamy and atmospheric.  Just a beautiful composition.  Now THIS is the song that needed to be extended a few more minutes.  I can't tell much of a difference between \\"Metal on Metal\\" and the title song, however both of them are perhaps a couple minutes overlong with too few actual musical ideas- just drum beats repeating the same notes over and over and never altering or building into an actual theme (not that that was the point of course).  However for a *little* while I enjoy these beats, and the synths work really well because, once again, they're very melodic.    Overall, perhaps not Kraftwerk's best album, but a pretty good one nonetheless.
B003UERZ88|1.0|No joke! just nausha feeling. i have to stop listening. i was really excited and couldnt wait to hear the metal god screams again. But, only got 1 song, The Mower, thats it! 15.00 bucks! This cd is boring, old style from the 70's. I dont want to hear that crap anymore! I was 14 15 yrs old when i heard this stuff! I am 51 now, and i love Halfords band, priest music is badass, not this pile of screwed up garbage. I think hes burned out. 40 yrs of writing has to end sometime, guess this is it. well as a singer, its still fun to sing and scream like he use to, I'll just remember those days, thats all.....   :  (...
B000007R1M|4.0|It's a fair complaint because Kraftwerk has done their whole electronic dance routine better on previous efforts, and done it in a much less repetitive and more interesting way.    \\"The Robots\\" has a vocal melody that uses robotic sounds instead of a normal singing voice, and even though it's catchy enough to satisfy me, it doesn't really excel in any kind of *creative* way so it ends up sounding mighty predictable and overlong to me.  Not necessarily a BIG complaint because it *is* a catchy vocal melody, but I get the feeling the songwriting ideas were starting to run low in a hurry for these guys around this time, despite the fact their next album titled Computer World is well-known these days as being the bands finest hour.    \\"Spacelab\\" is pretty awesome (and highly unusual) because it paints a perfect picture of being out in space somewhere alone and at total peace, and even features a noticeable sad tone thanks to that one repeating synth line.   When you consider the disco movement taking place at the same time this was recorded and released to the public, a song like \\"Spacelab\\" DOES sound really darn cool and original.  Probably my favorite song from Man Machine.    \\"Metropolis\\" is pretty hypnotic because it includes a slow-moving synth line in the beginning that gradually works its way into the main set of dance beats.  It's a pretty good song too.  The beats alter *just enough* to keep me interested in hearing it the entire way through.   This is something most experimental electronic bands would NOT implement into their style- a little bit of diversity to keep peoples attention.  Kraftwerk deserves some credit for this.      The fact Kraftwerk were the originators of such a huge movement actually means this small dose of diversity happened unintentionally- Kraftwerk didn't want to make their music *too* simplistic otherwise nobody would remember them, or probably even know who they were in the first place (other than the Germans of course, remembering them for being part of a very dated dance fad back in the late 70's).  I can't prove it, but that's my feeling on the matter.  They still had to write memorable songs, which they did.  Being original pays off doesn't it?    \\"Neon Light\\" reminds me of \\"Spacelab\\" quite a bit with the lovely synth lines and the beautiful vocal melody.  Actually the synths *do* sound a little bit dated because other bands from the 70's used the synths in an identical way.  That's a small complaint obviously because caring about music being dated is hardly a problem.    Overall Man Machine is a pretty good album but thanks to a desire to include more repetition in comparison to previous Kraftwerk albums, it definitely isn't in the same league.
0385340990|5.0|Thus is a charming, at times hilariously funny, and deeply tragic accounting of the people living on the Channel Islands during World War II.  The writing, in the form of letters, is captivating and insightful, taking you into the lives of this group of ordinary people living with enormous ingenuity through a challenging and tragic time.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh continues to shine with his incredible talent.  In this cd he writes songs, sings and plays piano.  It is a little different than his previous cd's.  As an artist he has more than one dimension and is showing a slightly different style.  The reviewers that were not favorable seem to object to this, but I don't like it when an artist becomes so predictable over the years that it becomes uninteresting.  This cd highlights several types of songs and the collection, when put together, is fabulous.  I think this was well worth the wait!
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|I have to admit, I rented this movie and it kind of freaked me out when I first saw it. The more I thought about it, the movie had a really interesting plot to it. I just don't know if I had kids if I would let them watch it under the age of 10. So I then decided to buy it, and I'm glad I did.
0385342039|5.0|LOVED IT!!!! Sophie Kinsella is and always be my favorite author!  It was refreshing to read something so unique and different than all other chic lit. A ghost???? I was skeptical, but looooved this book!!!
B000001FKF|5.0|I had this on cassette and was replacing it for my collection.  I received it in a timely manner and it was in great condition.  I bought it used.  I would recomment this dealer to anyone and of course, the CD to everyone that loves Bon Jovi, especially their original stuff.  I loved this concert, I was 104 degrees and the band kept spraying us with water due to the heat.  When they came on stage and everyone pushed forward, I was right up front.  They asked people to move back so we wouldn't get squished.  Excellent CD and Excellent concert!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I was a little disapointed at first because this wasn't written like Shopaholic.  But about 1/3 of the way through the book, I really got hooked on it and stayed up late to finish it.  I felt the 20's girl (ghost) was a little distracting and then by the end I was completely enamored of how she managed to make that character more real than  most of the others.  Definitely worth getting.  Less frothy than other Kinsella books but probably one of her more mature ones (writing wise).  Enjoy.
0061537969|5.0|This book was definitely one of my favorites, and I am an avid reader. So creative writing from the dog's perspective! I laughed and cried through the entire book, which I read in a day. You will not regret this read, and I am sure you will love Enzo and his owner as much as I did. It made me look at my own dog in a different light, what in the world is she thinking about!!
1401396135|4.0|If you are a fan of the ABC TV show Castle ([[ASIN:B003F3NDWG Castle: The Complete Second Season]]), you know that character Richard Castle is a mystery writer. Also He has created a character named Nikki Heat. Heat  is a thinly veiled version of Kate Beckett, an NYPD homicide officer Castle tags along with on cases. Jameson Rook for all purposes is a fantasy version of Castle Himself.<br /><br />Even without knowing these facts,  Naked Heat is a  good unabridged detective novel in audio. This book reminds this reviewer of the Thin Man ( [[ASIN:B0009GX1C4 The Complete Thin Man Collection (The Thin Man / After the Thin Man / Another Thin Man / Shadow of the Thin Man / The Thin Man Goes Home / Song of the Thin Man / Alias Nick and Nora)]])  series of movies with a slight sexual reversal (Female detective, male tag along partner). The mystery is a well crafted story of a death of a gossip columnist. Our two heroes , as in the show Castle, make a strange bedfellow as they need each other to solve this intriguing mystery.<br /><br />Narrator Johnny Heller, tries in his own way to capture of vocals of Nathan Fillion (Thr actor who plats Castle)/ There are times it works, but moreover it does not. That does not mean he does not do a great narrating job.<br /><br />Let me put it to you this way...Ever had too much fun listening to an audio presentation? This eleven and a half hours breeezed by. Whoever really writes these \\"Nikki Heat\\" Novels, you need to do more of them like the Jessica Fletchet \\"Murder She Wrote\\" series of books. You'd have me as a fan, especially if it is on cd  or download<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz<br />AUDIOWORLD
B000AP2ZLC|4.0|Can we rewind to a time before \\"The Unspoken King\\"?  I just remember so vividly listening to this for the first time, and being taken aback by the sheer power of it.  The drums are certainly \\"overpowering\\" and do sometimes bury the riffs a bit, but it works on this album in the same way it works on Nile's \\"Annihilation of the Wicked.\\"  If that comparison doesn't persuade you, no matter, because \\"Endless Cemetery\\" is all you need to be converted.  This album is NOT None So Vile, Lord Worm does not bark his whole way through it, there are many points where he is clear as day.  \\"Keeping the Cadaver Dogs Busy\\" starts with a quick drum roll and a weird sounding jazz guitar, then immediately thrusts into a evil riff.  \\"Curse of the Great\\" is a haunting malevolent piece of hatred.  The low points are few but present, \\"The Pestilence That Walketh In Darkness\\" belongs in the trash bin of ideas, and Luminum, despite being the last piece of music from the great Jon Levasseur before his departure, it is one messy as hell piece of garbabe.  Alex Auburn surprisingly holds his own very well on this record, even when Flo Mounier blasts away hiding his guitar lines.
1442337966|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Power\\", its very informative, exciting and encouraging. I like the positive and life changing details she brings along with others that share their stories and testimonials. If you are looking to change your mindset and learn of the power we have and not really using, this book/cd is for you.    I am a Christian and believe according to the Bible that the dead know not anything. We are asleep in Jesus Christ until His Second Coming. If listening to the CD, disk 5 then it will not be for you. But disks 1-4 are excellent!!!!!

0061537969|3.0|I'm a dog lover, and Enzo is a most loyal, humane canine - the saving grace of this book.  Formulaic plot, hard-to-swallow plot, one-dimensional characters, simplistic dialogue, and a main character who I found unsympathetic.  Were Denny a woman (let's call her Denise), doubt this book would have readership:    Denise can't breathe the first time she lays eyes on Adam (Eve).  She wants to be a F1 race car driver and spends days away from her husband as he works to support her dream.  Adam cleans for her.  He cooks for her.  He maintains her health insurance.  When they adopt a baby (take 9 months off when her F1 race career is at stake? Not Denise), Adam cares for the baby (a son) and her wonderful and wise cat Armani (c'mon, she's a gal, allright?)  Her in-laws are EVIL and don't quite get her and Adam's relationship, but Adam is devoted to her and believes in her.  So, when Adam dies, her in-laws seek custody since they've been caring for both Adam and the child.  Besides, Denise is grieving and drinking and her F1 career is now at stake.  Denise goes away to a family get-together and her 15-year-old nephew-in-law develops a crush on her.  He is not your average 15-year-old, gawky, not-fully-emotionally-developed teen - he is a sophisticated SEDUCER :-0   He manages to convince the grief-stricken Denise to drive him back home in a snow storm, and on the way, flatters Denise and gives her a neck massage - Denise, self-absorbed as she is, welcomes the massage, giving no thought to the boy's young age nor the appropriateness of what she's allowing to happen (she is, after all, an adult).  Rather than drive the boy to his home, she takes him to her home, where he SEDUCES her - she is lonely, horny, but resists his advances.  She is arrested for having sex with a 15 year-old-boy.  The EVIL in-laws, who have been caring for her child, attempt to gain custody.  She fights it, and eventually wins when she convinces (with the help of her devoted cat, Armani), how she lovedAdam, how she wants her son back.  Armani dies.  Cut to years in the future.  Her son is helping her out at the F1 racetrack she manages.  She is an F1 driver.  Her son drives up with a young girl and her mother.  \\"Mom,\\" her son says, \\"I want you to meet Armani - she wants to be a race care driver.\\"  Armani has been reincarnated!!!  As a Girl!!!  Who wants to drive F1 racecars - finally, the daughter she always dreamed of having.      I wanted to like this book....
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I just saw Josh in concert in San Diego and loved hearing his personality as that is what much of his concert was...but we did not hear much of his music. It was a trade off. I fell in love with the Italian and Spanish music that favored the vocal talents he has so abundantly. Although these are ballads on this album, they are in the mid vocal range and do not feature the wonderous voice that he has. I had it shipped early and am very, very disappointed that I paid so much. I should have ordered it thru Amazon for much less. The instruments that were added were wonderful and a few of the songs, not in English, the prelude was wonderful, and London and a few of the ballads, but overall where is that magnificent light opera voice. Not the quality ballads like Awake that feature his strong vocals. I know Josh expressed at his concert that he was so happy at the new route he is going with his new producer in NYC...but I am very discouraged.  I used to put on his music and do ballet/jazz and these songs do not fit that style.
0771068867|5.0|this is near the top of my best loved books. Beautiful, descriptive writing. A book whose complexity allows for a second or more visits to find hidden themes a single reading might miss.
0439023513|4.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" is the third and final installment in Suzanne Collins' wonderfully human thriller \\"The Hunger Games\\". While the series is targeted at young adults, I found them all to be terrific stories. They read fast, they're full of action, and thematically the books are more 'adult', than they are 'young'.    Normally, the conclusion to a series is not the highlight, but that might just be the case with \\"Mockingjay\\". This is the most adult of the three books, carrying heavy themes of teenage angst, love, and deep emotional turmoil. The root of the plot revolves around Katniss Everdeen (codename \\"Mockingjay\\"), who unwittingly ignites a cult of personality around which a rebellion burns. The heavy themes of this dystopic world and the brewing rebellion are energetic and violent and oftentimes emotionally raw.    There are numerous battle scenes which are vividly written and abrupt. There is only the barest of nods to a \\"Hollywood ending\\", so squeemish and emotional readers should beware. Not all of the major characters survive.    Collins does a terrific job of fleshing out her characters. Key characters have great impact on the drama despite having little interaction at the forefront of the story.    I can't say enough good things about this book - it's my favorite of the series. I'd highly recommend a shared reading experience for parents and their young adults.
0784010528|1.0|This is so stereotypical!!! This Oliver Stone guy...I thought he was awesome you know.  But now that I know the truth...The guys a quack.  This movie is not accurate.  It makes it into this Romeo and Juliet setting, but in this movie Romeo plays the part of Jekyll and Hyde.  If you know anything then you know all of those people who helped out in the film...they all backed out as they viewed the film because of the inaccuracies.  Everyone did...well everyone that mattered.  Patricia Keanley stated that she backed out the further the progression of the movie occurred.  The only value this movie has is Val Kilmer Nailed the Part.  He should have been in a real movie of the doors and Crispin Glover, he played his part...but not to real life, to the part that Stone wrote for them.  I am surprised they put interviews and such...if I were Patricia and Robby, I would sue for slander and such.  Here is one example.  I have read many books on The Doors. And no where...NO WHERE...did I read.  \\"Jim locks Pam in a closet, uses lighter fluid then sets door on fire!!!\\"  Then she would have been burned or died in real life from inhalation.  I can't believe anything the guy every touched.  Lloyd Kaufman doesn't like him either.  I mean really, A woman exposing herself at the Airport in front of reporters.  It wasn't Woodstock...in fact The Doors weren't even invited to Woodstock.  [[ASIN:B003H5WF3U When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors]].  Just imagine what could have been done with the movie NATURAL BORN KILLERS, if the guy who wrote the script (Quentin Tarantino), directed the movie???
0553386816|3.0|This book is several short stories in this book. Some of the stories were really good. Some stories I could not read because they just seemed long and boring.      When I finished all of the short stories, I felt if this was my first book I read of John Grisham, I would have never bought another book. It is the worst one of his that I have read. Don't get me wrong, there are some good stories but the whole book is not up to his standard. I just started the Confession and like it a lot so far.
0596806027|4.0|Summary  The book \\"HTML5: Up and running\\" By Mark Pilgrim is inspired from website [...] and is a wonderful start for someone who wants to get started and achieve proficiency with HTML5. Thoughts behind a design make user understand the design intent and code samples get your hand to work with real experience. The book also clearly specifies behavior in browsers to extent possible. The book is a good start for someone getting into HTML as well for someone who wants to increase his knowledge base.    Details  * The book starts with \\"Detecting HTML features\\" part, which is very essential and a very good start, given the fact that HTML5 specification and actual implementation by browsers might have disparities  * The book goes on with drawing canvas and video parts, providing adequate concepts wherever required. It covers all major and minor features in sufficient depth. Additional references are immensely helpful.  * The book focuses with enough depth on features that are already implemented in browsers at the same time shows the features which are yet to be implemented and what a developer can do with them    Likes and dislikes (What you like and dislike is up to you :) )    * Important rules of coding which might break/create issues in a code are well highlighted in \\"Professor Markup says\\" sections.  * At times the book goes back in history on how a tag name was formed etc etc. At times this explanation is relevant and helpful, and at times just another story. So you may want to jump these sections off whenever needed.  *  The book keeps the reader engaged with code examples, thoughts behind a design and humor at moments :)  * The references provided at the end of each chapter are really helpful to curious guys out there and allow you to explore more on topics of interest.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I went to see \\"The Expendables\\" with my son in the theatre.  It's exactly what you'd expect.  If you're old enough, you go to see how time had treated these action heros.  You can call it a feel-good movie; you feel better about having lasted long enough to see these guys in action again.  If you're young enough, you might be able to tolerate the re-cycled dialog.      Except for two minutes of genuine acting by Mickey Rourke about 2/3 through the picture, you are safe from needing any kind of critical thinking skills.  If this is what you're searching for....enjoy if for what it is; mindless, violent escapist fare.
B0000033WC|5.0|I noticed, while reading some reviews, that there are some professional Velvetoligists who are disappointed in this recording in ways that only professional critics and people with band-related obsessive-compulsive disorders can be.  Loaded was a great album, one of the greatest albums ever, and the \\"Demo Versions\\" extra tracks are a welcome addition. In fact, after listening to \\"Satellite of Love\\" four times in a row, I would say that the CD is worth the price of this track alone.  While The Grateful Dead left thousands of soundboard recordings and encouraged taping of all kinds, The VU left a scant legacy of live recordings. Any addition to their legacy is welcome to me.
B002ZG9968|4.0|The first scene sets the mood for this romantic comedy: J. Lo looks down at her feet, critiquing her her pedicure. While thinking about her toes, those same toes perch in the stirrups in a gynecologist's office as the doctor implants sperm from an anonymous donor. Would any real woman be focused on toenail polish on such a momentous occasion? Well, maybe.<br /><br />With that, our leading lady plunges into motherhood, despite a failed search for a promising father-candidate. Then, once she's got the mommy thing going on her own, The Right Guy suddenly appears. You can probably imagine the mixups, flareups, and making up that go with the romantic comedy genre, so I can't say there's anything special there. What makes this stand out is the earthy attitude toward the baby-making process, including a hilarious scene that turns delivery (not J. Lo's) into a team sport. The single mother's support group and especially its ever-so-earnest organizer offer amusing stereotypes to work with, as well.<br /><br />On the whole, I found it a funny, affectionate, and very forgettable bit of amusement.<br /><br />- wiredweird
B0013FDM7E|3.0|...this movie would of been so much better if they would of used live actors to portray the infected instead of using that fake looking CGI...the worst part is when you have the infected standing next to live actors which makes the infected look even more cartoonish, this is what ruined the movie for me...what was the director thinking!?...
B001AQT0ZO|4.0|The movie is great anyway you look at it, but is it on par with todays blu rays? not totally. Don't forget, this movie is at least 10 years old, and bringing it back to life is a hard task. I can say that at certain scenes, you can see A LOT of detail, like close ups of Leo and stuff, but on the whole, it was pretty much dvd quality, just a little bit better. The sound is amazing and some scenes show color so well. You might be disappointed if you are expecting stellar picture quality, but it does look better then standard dvd.
0156013983|4.0|I love this book and story. It is certainly geared for the young and the older person as well yet told by an amazing author. The story is delightful and presents many unique scenarios from a child's point of view.  It is a story of exploration and discovery. There are many lessons to be learned and morals to be valued. The story is also accompanied by child like drawings which almost transform the reader into<br />each magical realm of discovery.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it. Its very moving.   Now for the Blu ray, the picture is stunning. I never thought animated films can look any better then dvd, but it is. All the extras are great and a great way to waste your time if you have time to spare. Also, a great bonus is the added free digital copy of the movie. All in all, it is just a great movie, and it came quickly from Amazon
B001UV4XHY|4.0|The decision to split the final of J.K. Rowling's novels into two films was a wise one, for it allows for the inclusion of crucial details that simply couldn't be cut for the sake of time and pacing. This first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the most faithful adaptation since the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's also just like all the previous films in that it's spectacular entertainment - provided you don't mind the shadowy, deeply emotional, almost funereal direction the stories have been going in. The depth of character is amazing, in all likelihood because of the film's overwhelming seriousness. The plot is engaging, a mixture of a road film, a scavenger hunt, and a revenge fable. It balances it's solemnity with a healthy dose of magic and, in a few very appropriate places, humor. It's also the first film in the series to end with a cliffhanger, always a welcome addition.    Being faithful, of course, does have its drawbacks. The film is not only dependent on the viewer's knowledge of the previous installments, but also on the viewer's willingness to listen. Many, many important things are said by many, many people, and if you're not going to pay attention, you might as well see something else. Fortunately, just about everything is explained at one point or another; this is usually thanks to Hermione Granger, who after seven years is no less of a bookworm. We also have numerous scenes of the three leads piecing things together from little more than sheer speculation, and this is just as it has been since the very first film. What they will discover in Part 2 remains to be seen, but you can rest assured that some of what they thought about certain things will turn out to be incorrect.    Part 1 begins exactly where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince left off. With the magical world in chaos following the untimely death of Albus Dumbledore and a hostile takeover by Lord Volemort and his loathsome cronies, our heroesare forced to make drastic changes. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now the most wanted wizard in the world, ships his aunt, uncle, and cousin off to a safe location. At Harry's side are his two best friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). So too are members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and even Hogwarts gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). It will be hard to keep Harry's location a secret from the snake-faced Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), since it seems he can easily be traced.    A series of terrible events force Harry, Hermione, and Ron to go on the run; they magically transport themselves from one isolated location to another, taking refuge in a special tent that, like Dr. Who's telephone booth, holds more space than its outer dimensions suggest. Their mission: Seek and destroy magical objects called Horcruxes, all of which contain a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry thought he had found one at the end of the previous film, but that item - a locket - turned out to be a fake. Finding the real locket will involve an interrogation of a cranky house elf named Kreacher (voiced by Simon McBurney), the kidnapping of a shady wizard named Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden), and a carefully planned break-in into the Ministry of Magic, where, in disguise, our three friends will run into their old nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).    These and other events are carefully crafted, but they're also expected. Not so expected is the ways in which Harry, Hermione, and Ron are developed. The world as they knew it is gone - no more Quiddich games, no more visits to Hogsmeade, no more classes at Hogwarts. They've abandoned their former lives. In short, they've grown up. Yes, but why did they have grow up in this particular way? Why are Hermione and Ron following Harry when it's obvious he has nothing to go on apart from memories of vague conversations with Dumbledore? Was Dumbledore the great wizard Harry thought him to be, or were there chapters of his life he intentionally never revealed? Our three friends are lost, confused, and weary, stuck on a quest for objects that could literally be anywhere. These include the fabled Deathly Hallows, three magical items symbolized as a line within a circle within a triangle.    The Harry Potter films have gone from wonderfully whimsical to delightfully dark to terribly tragic. We've marveled at their heroes, shuddered at their villains, and mourned at the loss of beloved figures. They've ignited our imaginations and beckoned us to follow along with them. Before, I've taken the approach of the giddy fanboy, brimming with excitement and anticipation. In the case of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I take an approach of resignation and elegy. It's the beginning of the end. I always knew it was coming, but even after the passage of nine years - ten when Part 2 is released next summer - it still feels as if it's coming too soon. This new movie is wonderful, but I will always remember with longing the first time I saw three fresh-faced eleven year olds going on their first magical adventure.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This dark, bleak movie has a stark beauty with stunning photography. Ree Dolly, seventeen years old and living in the Ozarks of southern Missouri, must find her father who has jumped bond. Unless she finds him, she will lose her home and land which he put up for bond. He's a methamphetamine (crank) cooker turned snitch and Reese is determined to find him dead or alive so that she can keep her home. If she can prove he's dead, then that becomes a reasonable excuse for him not showing up for his bond hearing and she will not lose her home.<br /><br />Ree's mother is mentally ill and Ree has a younger brother and sister for whom she is responsible. The love she has for them shines throughout this film. The viewer is struck with the poverty of the Ozarks and the two-way sword of family. They are there for you when you need them and can also be your worst enemy. The film is based on the book of the same name Winter's Bone: A Novel by Woodrell. I hope to read it because there were some parts of the movie that I'd like to have fleshed out.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine piece of art, a film I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates beauty, can tolerate violence, and wants to be enriched by film.<br />Comment

B001Q9E9F6|4.0|The Long Tail  Summary   In \\"The Long Tail\\", author Chris Anderson analyzes how \\"hits\\" are not what they used to be in our society.  He talks about how in the times of yesterday, only \\"hits\\", i.e. songs, shows, movies, etc. that were popular enough to reach the mainstream in their respective genres, comprised of the majority of our selection for entertainment and choice.  The reason for this occurrence was because things that did not sell in great volume often had costs that outweighed their revenues.  As a result, TV shows that could not bring in enough viewers would not be seen, since they could not pay for their air time.  Similarly, songs that weren't popular and catchy enough to be well-received by the general public often did not gain a slot on the radio, since they would not bring in enough revenue.   As a result, Anderson explains that yesterday's generation was more \\"limited\\" to what it was exposed to and its variety of cultural selection.  However, with advances in technology such as the evolution of the digital world, the internet, and so on, this trend has changed greatly and is still changing today.  Now, songs, TV shows, and movies no longer have to be mainstream hits in order to be made available to potential consumers.  The internet has allowed our society the ability to search and seek out more information and entertainment than ever before.  Furthermore, digital technology has made many products (tangible and intangible) much cheaper to produce, as well as hold \\"in inventory\\" for its customers.  For example, Anderson talks about the 80/20 rule (a commonly referenced marketing rule of thumb that states that 20% of one's products account for 80% of its business), and how it correlates to the previously-held notion that \\"only hits sell\\".  This rule used to apply more so than it does now, when (as explained previously) the majority of what we were exposed to was that which sold the most (or only really \\"20%\\" of what was available to us).  Anderson explains that during a conversation with the CEO of Ecast, Robbie Vann-Adibé, the CEO asked him what percentage of the 10,000 albums in his digital jukeboxes he thought sold at least one track per quarter.  The author went out on a limb and guessed very high (50%, rather than 20% (which would have been based on the 80/20 rule)) since the jukeboxes were digital.  Vann-Adibé informed him however that it was not even his \\"high\\" estimation of 50%, but rather a whopping 98%!   Anderson was so amazed by this statistic that he went on to use it in many future speeches and in his philosophy that he eventually dubbed \\"The Long Tail\\".  The author explains that the name was taken from statistical graphs that have a high amount of concentration points at the \\"head\\", but have extremely \\"long tails\\" of smaller concentrations of statistics that never really seem to drop to zero, even very far off the grid.  Because these kinds of statistical distributions are called \\"long-tail distributions\\", this is where Anderson derived the name from.  His idea behind \\"The Long Tail\\" is that (as mentioned before) today, because of changes in technology and what is available to us as consumers, we are experiencing much more of a long-tail distribution in what we as consumers are purchasing.  And, because of easier means of availability and reduced costs for making material available to the general public, it has allowed for much more \\"niche\\" material to reach consumers than ever before.  Now, it is not just the \\"hits\\" that account for almost all of today's markets.   Anderson highlights three main observations in his \\"Long Tail\\" theory:    1) The tail of available variety is far longer than we realize    2) It is now within reach economically    3) Those niches, when aggregated, can make up a significant market   Anderson explains that because the costs of making niche products (that comprise of the long tail) is not nearly what it once was, these niches can now be kept available to us in the market, and (as stated in his third highlighted observation) when all of these niches are aggregated, they actually come together to account for a very large and wholly profitable market.    Response/Opinion   I enjoyed \\"The Long Tail\\" and what Chris Anderson had to say regarding today's trend in technology and how it is enabling us to be exposed to and take advantage of much more product and material, rather than being culturally limited to \\"hits\\", as many of our previous generations were.  I particularly liked the author's comparison of himself as a teenager/young adult to \\"Ben\\", and the differences in what they were exposed to and what was available to them.  For example, Anderson described how when he was young, there were only a handful of TV stations to watch, and the limited number of radio stations and summer blockbusters basically dictated the music that people listened to and the movies people saw.  Contrastingly, \\"Ben\\", a sixteen-year-old who grew up with the internet, has an mp3 player with thousands of songs on it, has a cell phone, and owns a Mac that is situated in his bedroom.  He has a much broader cultural landscape than Anderson did when he was Ben's age, in that Ben can listen to all kinds of different music, watch some mainstream TV shows but also dedicate much of his time towards watching more niche-type videos and shows that are available to him online via peer-to-peer file sharing, and so on.  Because of programs like iTunes, Ben can not only listen to mainstream hits and classics on his iPod like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, but he can also listen to a variety of video game soundtracks that he was able to pull offline.   I personally really enjoyed the author's message (and this example in particular) because, though I admittedly listen to the pop radio stations all day and have many interests that are \\"mainstream\\", I also have just as many interests that are extremely far-out from what is considered \\"popular\\" or mainstream.  In fact, just likeBen, I even have several video game soundtracks on my mp3 player since I have a strange affinity for much of this style of music.  I also like a wide variety of music in general.  For example, even though I listen to popular music that consists of artists like Lady Gaga and Usher, I also like a lot of New Age, old-school rap, house music, and so on.  When I tell people that some of my favorite songs include those of Michael Jackson and Dave Matthews, yet also of John Tesh (a new age artist), Genesis, Bel Biv Devoe (a New Jack Swing group from the early nineties), and that some of my favorite albums are from the \\"Ultimate Dance Party\\" collection, I tend to get very strange looks from people.  However, thanks to the availability of the internet and iTunes (as discussed by the author), I can satisfy my broad musical taste rather than being forced to limit myself to what is on the Philadelphia's hit music station, Q102.   I thought that Anderson made an excellent point in that not only has the internet increased our cultural availability and variety, but it and the digital world in general have extremely decreased inventory costs.  For example, he explains that \\"the marginal cost of manufacturing, shelving, and distribution is close to zero, and royalties are paid only when the goods are sold.  It's the ultimate on-demand market:  because goods are digital, they can be cloned and delivered as many times as needed, from zero to billions.\\"  Anderson again cites iTunes, as well as Rhapsody, as great examples of digital media services that demonstrate the aforementioned on-demand market model.  Because today's digital markets often do not require physical/tangible goods to be delivered when we purchase much of our products, it has greatly decreased costs.  Anderson makes an excellent point in explaining that these reduced costs are the reason that we are no longer solely being exposed to just the \\"hits\\" - now, we can be exposed to all types of music, movies, and other products due to the fact that the cost to make them available to us (even those that sell in very small quantities) still seldom outweighs the revenues and profits that they take in, simply because of the new digital age.   Overall, I think that Anderson makes some excellent points in his elaboration of our transition into the digital world, regarding our variety of cultural exposure.  I personally not only agree with Anderson, but I also think that where we are in this current transition is only the beginning, and I think we are going to be blown away by what is available to us in ten to twenty years from now.  Nevertheless, the internet and technology most certainly have broadened our horizons, and \\"hits\\" are no longer the only thing available to us.  In fact, if Anderson's argument remains true, and ever-growing technology continues to further-broaden our cultural horizons, Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" may remain the best-selling album of all-time possibly beyond our lifetimes!  Technology and the internet is forever changing the face of the \\"mainstream\\" as we have known it, and we as a society are going to have more availability and more exposure to a culture that will become almost infinitely broad as time progresses and we grow with the internet and the digital world into the future.
0792843584|4.0|This is a film that requires your attention. Cimino obviously follows the format he used so successfully with the Deer Hunter. The prologue of this film does not work as well as the prologue in the Deer Hunter - the wedding scenes and the deer hunting as prologue to Vietnam was very important in the development of the characters.  The Harvard graduation scene is a bit maudlin and drawn out. Once the story moves West, momentum builds. The story line is very easy to follow and the love triangle is very believable.  When Huppert asks Kristofferson, \\"Can't a woman love two men?\\" and Kristofferson replies,\\"Hell, yes....it's just not convenient,\\" you have the complexity of the story in microcosm.  The immigrant issue in this film is so similar to our present day problems.  It gives one pause.  The scenery is breathtaking, the cinematography superb and the acting all around is excellent and the music is wonderful.  I am glad I waited 30 years to see it.  I remember reading all the negative stuff when it came out and decided not to rush to see it.  It disappeared so fast that I never got to see it in release.  A couple of weeks ago I read an interview with Jeff Bridges and he talked about how it was one of his favorite films.  Well, I thought if the \\"Dude,\\" \\"Starman,\\" \\"Bad Blake,\\" \\"The Baker Boys,\\"  and \\"Duane\\" liked the film, maybe now was the time to watch.  Glad I did.  Not quite the \\"Wild Bunch,\\" but damn close.

B00475BUVM|2.0|I own this on Blu-Ray and enjoy the actual film BUT I saw this in \\"3D\\" in the theatre and the effects weren't very clear and the picture quality kind of sucked.    Honestly it looks BETTER on Blu-Ray. MAYBE the 3D Blu-Ray looks better than the theatre but I wouldn't risk paying the extra money for this title.    I am a fan of 3D movies, I thought the effects in How to Tame A Dragon & Resident Evil were amazing.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is the first TV show that I have ever actually purchased.  After seeing the commercials on TV I set my DVR to record but I was already 2 episodes behind.  I found the first one on Hulu but that was all they had and after a quick google search I found the second here on amazon and since it links up with my Roku I could stream it to my TV. Episode 2 had my daughter crawling up the back of the couch and yelling \\"hurry hurry!\\" due to the very dramatic suspense.  I also like Norman Reedus (Boondock Saints and Pandorum) who they brought in as the redneck brother...great selection there.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|This version comes in a three disc set that I'm sure is everything they say it is. But don't buy it.    Instead of putting each version of the movie on separate disks, the first part of all the versions is on disk one, and the second part of all the versions is on disk two. So, in the middle of this wonderful experience, the mood is broken by having to stop to put in disk two. Who wants to bother with that? Hello? Were DVD's invented yesterday at Fox?    In addition, the packaging is some convoluted paper 'dvd drawer' type deal that makes it almost impossible to remove the dvds without putting your fingers on the recorded surface. There has to be at least a million better ideas for unique packaging.    If you want to see the whole 3 hour experience uninterrupted, get it through some other means, not this one.
B00000JHAU|3.0|My first Belle& Sebastian CD was \\"The Pursuit of Life\\" which is brilliant in terms of lyrics and tasteful and innovative harmonic changes. I heard pieces of early Beatles, the Birds, The Hollies, often highlighted by a film score backwash---clever and entertaining. \\"Dear Castastrophe Waitness\\" was almost as good but pulled down by cuts 1 and especially 4(Piazza,New York Catcher). Nevertheless, the disc was musical, clever, and in some ways harmonically innovative. My next acquistion \\"Tigermilk\\" was a mistake. I believe I received a defective copy, but it is overly loud, and noisy. I realize this was there first work. The band does more experimenting with sound than creating music. There are  even a few attempts  creating Springsteen-like wall of sound and crescendo of instruments, but it fails miserably. The rest of the album is a washout of incoherency. I have only listened to \\"If you're feeling Sinister\\" twice, and still am undecided about its musical achievement. Several opening songs seem to have a repetitive organizing line that gets boring. In addition, there is too much Stuart Murdock. His voice is good, but becomes tiring after a while. At this point, my impressions are leaning toward the negative. I would not file this CD in the dustbin, which I have done to Tigermilk, but it will not get many plays in the future. I await the CD, \\"The Boy with the Arab Strap\\" which I heard a few cuts on Amazon.com. I am hoping this will recharge my enthusiasm for this generally unique and talented band..... Also on \\"Sinister\\" some songs seem underdeveloped, as if to hook out and rock is passe. I think this band has the capacity to wig-out more than just once in the while to give there songs new vigor and drive, e.g. \\"Another Sunny Day\\" from In Pursuir of Life. Growing up in the musical era of classic rock, where bands aspired to long term development, I hope B$S are not just going to record music once in the while and then disappear.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Listen to Bob sing \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and picture a drunk clinging to bottle of Night Train in a paper bag and hugging a gutter filled with dirty, slushy snow. In his fevered brain, he's dressed in a tux, crooning for a packed house at Radio City Music Hall, backed by the Ray Coniff Singers -- but a freezing splash from the tires of a passing taxi snap him back to the real world.     That should put you in the right frame of mind to listen to this album. Merry Christmas.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love this show!!!!!!! Great writing and great acting from all around. You can read all of the other reviews if you want more specific details of what is or isn't included in this DVD set (and I'm not entertaining enough for you to spend a great deal of time reading all about me), but trust me on this one -- you want to have a great time watching a great show -- you can't go wrong with Castle.
B003JG29LA|3.0|In an age when CGI seems to have taken over movies, [[ASIN:1933784032 Sculpting a Galaxy: Inside the Star Wars Model Shop]] is a nice tribute to ILM's Model Shop. It has some great close-up shots of the models and creatures. I was surprised to learn that even some of the later movies relied heavily on models. I don't think this book is quite as good as [[ASIN:B000J1087U Star Wars Chronicles]], which is much more comprehensive. [[ASIN:1933784032 Sculpting a Galaxy]] leaves out a few key ships and creatures, such as the Tie Bomber. Also, some of the pictures seem a bit fuzzy. However, the main reason I gave this only 3 stars is that its binding is horribly loose. There are gaps between some of the pages, which is especially annoying if the photo is a two-page spread. What a shame. Hopefully not all of the books in print are so poorly manufactured.
B001JV5B12|5.0|In a time when Vampires seem to be all the rage, I find this to be one of the best movies/series.  Kate Beckinsale is great and has fantastic chemistry with the leading man.

0670020745|3.0|I would have liked more details and less metaphysical stuff. She has a very good description of having her stroke in the early part of the book, but the last couple chapters are way to ethereal, \\"touchy-feely\\", metaphysical, and way out there for me. She seemed to be going out of her way to avoid giving God any credit for her healing, or for that matter, even existing; seemed to me to be trying to cover all the spiritual (small \\"s\\") bases and not offend anyone. I don't need a sermon, but I wish she had just picked a belief system and stuck with it. I don't need read all about all her searching for the \\"Great Spirit\\" or whatever.    The book could have been a bit longer also.    I would recommend this for anyone who is at risk of a stroke or who has had one, or if you have had a family member who had one. Just be advised that if you want a lot of practical advice, you will need to buy another book, this one deals more with feelings and emotions.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I went to see this movie with a group of 12 guys(not including myself) after a couple weeks of intense training in the swamps around Norfolk.   We all voted on what movie we should go see, Almost everyone voted for \\"The American\\". So we all get up thier spend our $10 dollars on a ticket and $6 bucks on snacks and drinks.(So we spend ~$200) Let me tell you, do not go see this movie. The 30 seconds of action in the trailer, Is all the action in the entire movie. And it does NOT have a good storyline to make up for it.(I am not at all an action movie junkie, If I want action I jump out of helicopters in real life.) Out of 13 guys, 9 were sleeping.(Unfortunatly I was not lucky enough to be able to fall asleep. It is the one time I regret having insomnia.) The entire movie is spent with you watching Clooney walk around some (desolate, aparently no extras were hired) small italian village. You watch him drive around a small italian village (Again, No other cars on the road). You watch Clooney slowely assemble and design parts for an improvised firearm(Again, You just watch all the tedious long boreing actions of him makeing each individual piece). You watch Clooney make love to a prostitute(Which Ironically, You only see ~13 seconds of). You watch him do many more tedious things as he pitters around. There is maybe 14 minutes of people actually talking in this movie.     The ENTIRE movie is spent watching Clooney pitter around town. Thats it. Thats what the theater made $200 bucks on. I will, and you can quote me on this, NEVER see another Clooney movie. I've had more fun trying to sleep on my H-Gear in a dilapadated building while stareing at the poisin ivy across the (4 foot) room. I understand movies show some of the most exciting parts in thier marketing, I get that. I'd do the same. But, they literally show you the only 30 seconds worth watching. Save your money even if your a diehard Clooney fan, and you've watched all the Oceans movies 50 times over while fantasizeing. Seriously, Even you will fall asleep.
0374290024|4.0|Ian Morris' Why the West Rules is certainly audacious.  As the subtitle suggests, Morris ventures to explain all of human history and, apparently still unsatisfied, to see into the future as well.  He appears to have read widely and deeply to match his scholarship to his ambition.  His exposition is clear and often seasoned with a light touch.<br /><br />This is not the sort of book many will be inclined to read fully in just a few long stretches, but on balance it is likely to engage and challenge persons with a serious interest in mega-history.  While some specialists in particular domains (say the British industrial revolution, for example) may disagree with some of Mr. Morris' interpretations or find them insufficiently nuanced, that is to be expected for works of broad historical synthesis such as this one.<br /><br />Morris starts with pre-human \\"ape-men\\" (he can turn a phrase) and traces comparative East-West \\"social development\\" to the present and beyond.  He has devised his own method for measuring it, a quantitative index that takes into account (1) energy capture (calories used); (2) organization, as measured by urbanization; (3) information processing, represented by literacy rates; and (4) the capacity to make war.  He graphically plots his estimates of the index scores of the East versus those of the West since 14,000 BCE.  The main body of the text describes the historical forces and events underlying the graphical patterns.<br /><br />There are many objections that might be raised against the quantitative index and Morris is aware of them.  He has stated that he nevertheless chose to construct it to help make more explicit what he means when he describes social development in any given period or region.  In my opinion, he could have well done without it: it leaves an overall impression of being artificially contrived and unnecessary, a sort of Rube Goldberg approach to assessment of historical development.<br /><br />Moreover, the question of who was \\"ahead\\" in any given epoch, East or West, turns out to be rather secondary to the salient lessons Morris draws from the sweep of history.  There is no \\"long-term lock-in,\\" he concludes, no factor established long-ago that has subsequently determined comparative advantage in perpetuity.  The \\"five horsemen of the apocalypse\\" -- climate change, disease, famine, migration, and state failure -- have at times radically disrupted development and could do so again.  So too, ascendant regions face the \\"paradox of social development\\" -- adaptations create new problems that call for further adaptations, possibly undermining the very forces that contributed to past success. Prior backwardness can even become advantageous (for a contemporary example think of low wages as an attraction to capital investment in China, an \\"advantage\\" that is eroding as Chinese development progresses).<br /><br />His rejection of long-term lock-in theories is creditable and well-supported, but Morris also contends that short-term accidents and human leadership do not matter much either in the longer term.  We could substitute \\"bungling idiots\\" for great men or vice-versa, he says, and at most things may have moved at a different pace to the same destination.  Nor, in his opinion, do ideas or culture ultimately help shape development; rather, it is the other way around.  These views are contestable, at the very least, and are bound to elicit objections from many other historians.<br /><br />For Morris the operative factors are biology and sociology, which explain global similarities, and geography, which explains regional differences. Geography has determined the probabilities of where development would rise fastest, but social development changes what geography means, he proposes.  For instance, when social development reached the stage where trans-oceanic commercial voyages were feasible, Western societies positioned on the Atlantic gained geographic advantages that in turn spurred further development.<br /><br />How is it, then, that the long history of comparative development might inform our current prognoses?  Morris projects that his index will soar, but faster in the East than the West, with a crossover to Eastern leadership by 2103 at the latest (he is that precise).  Yet, according to Morris, the East-West framework may or may not turn out to matter much.  Perhaps there will be an all-out East-West war, where even winning would be catastrophic, or maybe arguments about \\"who rules\\" will become pass&eacute; as we will see a need to cooperate further to address global problems.<br /><br />Morris shifts gears and reframes the question.  As he sees it, the world's future pretty much comes down to two possibilities: \\"Nightfall\\" or the \\"Singularity.\\"  If we can hold off the worst-case climate change outcomes and nuclear disaster (Nightfall) long enough, he suggests, we might morph into a post-human species (Ray Kurzweil's Singularity, where the full contents of our brains can be uploaded into computers), which he seems to regard as salvation.<br /><br />I have to say I found this eventual conclusion to be a bit surprising, even peculiar, a big leap from where readers were left before reaching the final chapter.  The chasm underscores a fundamental antinomy in Morris' message: we should study history to prepare for the future, but development will now accelerate so fast that history will leave us unprepared.story of comparative development might inform our current prognoses?

0061777250|5.0|The English translation is very clear and flows very well.  Although at times it may be a bit challenging for those who have no background in the field of medicine, the concepts introduced are explained in a rational but understandable way where one doesn't need a PH.D in medicine to comprehend.    Brings up many good points, and gives light to current explanations for the NDE and explains how they fall short and why.  It's a lengthy read and it's packed with information.  Many may find they can only read bits at a time, but give it a try.  it's well worth it, and I feel it's written exactly the way it should be written to not only be taken seriously, but to convey the message it's trying to convey.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones sounds like a bluesy version of Patsy Cline. She collaborates well with every one of the contributors, on all of the classics. On Love Me with the Little Willies, you swear that she was channeling Patsy Cline in her earlier works. This music will get you swaying and tapping your toes, to the old style slow music. It is enchanting and a throwback to a time when music was really enjoyable. She does a very exceptional job on a cd that you can listen to over and over again. As a member of One2One Network, I am privileged to review this cd

Poor Rihanna, She thought she could pull off another B'day or Thriller & it ended up as a complete & total FAIL. To start with, half the songs are str8 up FILLER. The other half is just okay. The Whole Album sounds like it was rushed, much of it is repetitive, much of the lyrics are about sex, just like a bunch of sad Rude Boy re-mixes with some Bland ballads thrown in. & it sounds like she was trying to re-do the likes of Pink, Katty Perry, Avril Laven, Kesha, Kelis & whomever else. This album truly fails to deliver in many ways & a far cry from her last 2 efforts. The only acceptable songs are Man Down, Raining Men, Skin, Cheers, S&M, & Only Girl is ok too. These are decent but the rest is totally FILLER. Im very disappointed, her last 2 albums were much better. I would actually give this a 2 or 3 if it hadnt been so overrated but since it is, 0.<br /><br />S&M 3.8/5<br />What's My Name? 2/5<br />Cheers (Drink To That): 3.5/5<br />Fading: 1/5<br />Only Girl 3/5<br />California King Bed 0.5/5<br />Man Down 4/5<br />Raining Men 4/5<br />Complicated 0.5/5<br />Skin 4/5<br />Love The Way You Lie 3/5<br /><br />Overall: 2.5/5
1607886278|5.0|Written from the prospective of a 5-year old boy, Room details what life might be like if you were born in captivity because your mother was abducted and enslaved as a teenager.  Though escaping is necessary, the author satisfactorily shows how difficult such a change would be to a boy who knew no other life but that Room (and to his mother.)  Ma has done the very best she could for her son under the circumstances.  I had great admiration for her ability to cleverly and imaginatively keep her son entertained and educated in a terrible situation.        I have recommended this book to my book group because it will make for interesting discussion.

Christmas music, especially that played in stores everywhere, only exacerbates this extreme melancholia.<br /><br />But THIS Christmas music....THIS has brought an almost shocking euphoria to the thought of the approaching holiday! When I hear Annie Lennox's version of Christmas, I can instantly visualize snowey scenes, gifts wrapped in metallic red, green, and silver, candles and an indoor-Christmas-warmth sensation. The gorgeous multi-layered vocals, the clarity of the strong voice, the addition of the African choir, and the ever-so-familiar Annie Lennox style make this a truly extraordinary experience.<br /><br />I sense we will be hearing this music played for many, many Christmas' to come. It will go on the list of most loved Christmas albums, to be sure.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I read the first 12 issues of Robert Kirkman's epic graphic novel The Walking Dead back in 2006. Late fans to the story can now pick up the first 48 issues of the graphic novel in a convenient single work titled [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead: Compendium One]]. As of today, Kirkman has published 80 issues in the series (that I now anxiously check my mailbox for every month).<br /><br />What's all that mean? It means that there are years and years of seasons ahead if this AMC TV series stays the course of excellence that it has so far done in the first season. And I think AMC must be quite pleased with how the show is shaping up because prior to the launch of the first season of only 6 episodes they renewed a second season of 13 episodes that will begin filming in early 2011.<br /><br />Director/Executive Producer Frank Darabont with Kirkman oversight have brought The Dead to life in surprisingly fabulous adaptation of the graphic novel series. Why surprisingly? Because it is a rare occasion that a film or TV adaptation is as good as and so true to the source material. Has the TV series already taken some liberties? Sure. But are those liberties just as well told as Kirkman originally laid out? So far so good. Actually, so far: excellent! This just could be the best new show on TV.<br /><br />The Walking Dead begins the story of Police Officer Rick Grimes as he wakes up from a coma after being shot months ago in a normal world. And ironically his waking throws him into a nightmare of a land that has been devastated by an apocalypse of The Dead. The beginning of the story starts kind of the way the film [[ASIN:B000XJ5TOK Resident Evil]] ended and the way [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]] began...with the lead character waking up from a coma in a world gone mad.<br /><br />Family gone. Friends gone. Civilization...all gone. Officer Grimes ventures out to find only a handful of survivors at a time. The entire world seemingly has been overrun by vicious hordes of the undead. But as the story matures, it is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.<br /><br />You'll find unfathomable chaos and horror in The Walking Dead as well as a hypothetical look at human nature in a new world: hordes of zombies, along with human survivors in desperate situations that do the unthinkable to stay alive (or entertained).<br /><br />The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama that will have you screaming for more after this short 6 episode season ends. But the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to catch up or get ahead.<br /><br />Like I said earlier.

B002HFP0R4|5.0|This is a definite must for any fan of the Bee Gees. Just holding it in my hands with the old Bee Gees insignia made me more excited to see what was inside. I find the contents very touching with personal excerpts from Barry, Robin and Yvonne , Peta, , Adam and Samantha Gibb. There are other tributes from friends and artists. What makes this greatest hit cd  different than others is it adds a personal touch with personal favorites added to each cd. And with it, an individual cd of each makes it even more special.

B003TEO3EI|5.0|In simple terms, this album shows many obvious similarities to past Blind Guardian albums. The song structure and choruses are nothing new for the most part, and \\"Curse My Name\\" sounds like the new Bard's Song. However, the orchestral additions make it a worthwhile addition to any Blind Guardian collection. Blind Guardian manages to do a bit of something new that I loved without sacrificing any of the lovely trademarks.
B004259BMM|1.0|Don't you love it how Keith tries to put on the American twang when he is singing. He was not born into country roots. I have listened to all these songs, and they are all same old same old, boring. The cover looks cheap too. This man is not exactly talented, and alot of women only like him because of his looks.  What alot of you don't realise is that Keith is not a good songwriter and often requires the help of ghostwriters.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I bought this two disc combo for my 4 year old grand daughter as a gift and she loved it.  The first day she watched the Tinker Bell movie at least 3 times.  She was absolutely thrilled.  My son watched with her and he liked it as well.  My grand daughter now pretends to be a fairy.
B0047O2HJC|5.0|Thanks to Columbia Records for continuing to mine the gold in their vaults for shiny new Bob Dylan nuggets. This box of Mono recordings assembles the first 8 Dylan albums from his 1962 debut through John Wesley Harding in 1967. They are without peer and without a doubt some of the greatest music made in the last half-century. The box itself is in the style of recent artist collections from Japan with mini-LP style discs. 60's inner sleeves, labels and inserts correctly replicate the original albums in every detail. A 60-page booklet includes previously unseen photos from these recording sessions, album details and an extensive essay by Greil Marcus. Also included is a link to mp3 downloads of this collection plus a bonus track, \\"Positively 4th Street\\". These mono mixes will be a revelation to those who've grown up with the stereo versions of these songs. At the time, stereo was just coming into use. The mono mix was given the full attention of the artist and producer, showing different musical choices from later stereo issues. This superbly designed box set belongs in every music collectors library. Hey, Capitol! How about a Beach Boys Mono Box?
0634022296|5.0|i think that this is for sure the best beatles songbook out there.it has all 194 songs the band wrote.just remember this is ONLY for acoustic guitar.if you want to dig deeper into their music and play the solos or the intros of the songs this one is not for you.it is suitable for strumming as it has only the chords and not the whole tab.anyway,i really think you can't get anything better than this,especially in this price.
B0029Q8C62|1.0|the beats are a nullity, the concept of bringing together two junkies on an album, only def-jam could do it for a second time
030726999X|2.0|As much as this trilogy is lauded by readers and critics alike, I have always had a hard time getting into the stories.  The first two books took a good 50 pages of reading before I was engaged and interested in what was going to happen.  This one seemed even worse and it just never took off for me.  Quite frankly, they are exhausting to read, but not in a challenging way, just a tiresome one.  I'm not sure I want there to be a supposed 4th installment.
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|NICE PIECE BY ROBERT PLANT WITH EXCELLENT-TALENTED BAND/GOOD FLOW AND THE TIGHT ENERGY OF BAND COMES OUT LOUD AND CLEAR/IT IS A SHAME THAT THIS BAND DID NOT WORK WITH ROBERT MORE!PEACE/THE SOUNDSTAGE DVD IS WELL WORTH IT-YOU CAN'T GO WRONG IF YOU ARE A FAN/
B002VECM6S|5.0|While I agree that this movie did not give Michael Oher nearly enough credit for his own success, it's a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone. As for all the reviewers claiming that this story has something to do with \\"white guilt\\" . . . like it or not, in this case a white family helped a black kid.  Why any person would feel guilty about another person's life choices is beyond me, no matter what color their skin is. Michael Oher's mother created her own situation (and Michael's) and no one should feel guilty about that but her.  White people aren't going around making movies to make themselves feel better about people who ruin their own lives.  Leave the lame, whiny politics out of it and just enjoy a very good movie based on the true story of an incredible young man and the family he chose for himself.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I was happy with the product that I recived. It was in the condition as listed. I am happy with this product.
B000Q67876|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever made.  If you haven't seen it, you should and soon!  This blu ray is great because it came with a book about the movie which was very interesting and informative. I just can't say enough about what a great movie this is!!!
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I went to see this movie, thinking that it would be a nice throwback to the 80's action films with Stallone and the rest of the gang.  I didn't expect an Academy Award movie, but I did at least expect a fun popcorn munching one.  It was just a train wreck of a movie with a horrible story and one extremely loud explosion or other noise after another.  At first, I thought it must have been the theater, but after speaking with several friends who saw it at other theaters, they also confirmed that this movie was just made loud for no apparent reason.  Hey Stallone, you don't have to make a movie good by making it so loud your ears hurt.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
0596805888|5.0|This book is so much fun.  I have yet to try any of the recopies, but it is just fun.
1439177783|5.0|I have to admit that I don't read a lot of books. And, I have no particular interest in the topic of eating disorders. But after stumbling across the Portia/Oprah interview while web-surfing, I decided to give this book a try. Good decision! It was such a page-turner that I read it in 2 days.     Unbearable Lightness takes you on a fascinating journey into one woman's battle with a severe eating disorder, delving into both the mechanical and emotional aspects of the experience. It is a riveting, distressing trek from which it is impossible to look away once you get started.     Portia wisely avoids a strictly sequential telling of events. Instead, she holds to a fairly ordered time line about the physical progression of her illness, while interlacing that with the emotional challenges from her early life that ultimately shaped her destiny.     One reviewer stated that they found it a bit tedious reading a litany of various encounters with tight-fitting clothes, portion-size anxiety, and exercise routines gone wild. However, I had a completely different reaction to the telling of those events. In fact, the true brilliance of the book was recounting (what sometimes amounted to) the same event, but enveloping it in a new emotional context. So, for example, Portia describes several instances when she becomes distressed after blowing her diet at a restaurant. However, each time this happens, you realize that the depth of her distress -- and ensuing reaction -- has mutated from the last encounter. You realize you are witnessing a slow descent into eating disorder hell, knowing that the next, inevitable trigger point will lure Portia down another step.    Ultimately, this cause/effect dynamic is typical of many emotional disorders: the trigger stays somewhat the same, but the reaction to the trigger changes. The book succeeds precisely because of this nuanced emotional context, particularly around the issues of low self-esteem. Anyone who has ever struggled with self esteem -- regardless of the cause or how that struggle ultimately manifested itself -- will likely relate to Portia's journey.     Portia's self esteem, of course, was tested on two fronts: 1) fitting into the Hollywood body-image ideal and 2)accepting her Lesbian identity while feeling she had to hide it. She addresses both without making the book a Hollywood tell-all or a treatise about the (very real) toll of gay oppression. That Portia has succeeded in conquering both of these challenges - retaining her career and living very openly as a Lesbian -- makes her victory over anorexia and bulimia that much more inspiring.
159448385X|5.0|The book A Thousand Splendid Suns is about two women who go through love, heart break, loneliness, and friendship.  While reading, I experienced many emotions.  The author, Khaled Housseini does a wonderful job pulling the reader into the emotions of the story and the characters.  I often lost myself in the lives of Mariam and Laila and their trials.
B000148KK2|5.0|I generally like Diana Krall; I can put on one of her CDs, sit by my desk, swing my feet up, keyboard in lap, start typing and get some work done; nice.    So I bot this one, \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\", to me a new album, expecting a similar pleasant experience but no.  I can't get anything done.  I keep having to stop and tell the empty room, \\"This is good!\\" or, \\"Wow that was well written!\\" or, \\"What tasty piano work\\" or \\"What an interesting take on Joni (or Bonnie)\\"    This is nutz.  I'm not getting a thing done.  When I listen to this CD I just have to listen to it.  Period.    I suppose it could be worse.
0786955716|2.0|I had hope that this would include many rooftops as implied by the cover. However it really only has tiles fit for making a sewer run and perhaps a seaside tavern. This can be useful of course but not exactly what was advertised.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is an AWESOME album...great to kick back and enjoy the holidays listening to!  It has beautiful orchestration complimenting the mello sound of James Taylor's voice.  I played this CD while working at a boutique at Christmas, and almost everyone that came in wanted to know whose CD we were playing so that they could purchase it.  One of my favorite songs is \\"River\\" which can only be heard if you purchase the CD...can't download the MP3...so do yourself a favor this Christmas and buy 'James Taylor At Christmas'...I guarantee you will not be sorry!    MERRY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYONE...BE SAFE!
B001THZAAI|4.0|Our experience with French films has been one of extremes.  French sensibilities do not always align with American, with the result that we either love them or hate them.  This mismatch sometimes extends to the decision making on what movies should be released here or not.  This movie suffered from this miscalculation.  It is our understanding that Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'tis was one of the biggest hits in recent years in France.  Yet, the decision was made not to release this film in the U.S., not even on DVD.  You will not find this movie on cable or on Netflix.  What a shame!  We had to track the film down on Amazon to buy a copy released in Quebec.  Our copy is now making its way through friends and family for them to enjoy.    Danny Boon has created a sweet, comic fish out of water story in which a post office manager is transferred, against his will, to the far north of France.  This is the french version of the boonies, the Appalachians or the deep south.  Much to his surprise he discovers that it is not what everyone assumes it to be.  Yet to maintain his credibility with his family and friends back home he must maintain the fiction of a man suffering when he visits them.  There is much humor in both places and in watching him go to greater extremes to maintain the lie as the story progresses.    The odds are the only way you will see this film is to buy the DVD. The cost is less than what you will waste taking someone to most movies.  My advice is to spring for the film, make some popcorn and curl up with family or friends and enjoy.
B00005LOLD|4.0|I enjoyed the book \\"Sayonara\\" by James Michener and looked forward to the movie, but I was a little disappointed by Marlon Brando's performance. For someone who is deeply in love, he came across to me as cold. Marlon's voice, his character's southern accent, and my less than perfect hearing, resulted in many hard-to-understand or missed lines. Fortunately, with a DVD, it is possible to skip back and hear the line again.  This 2 hour 27 minute story follows the book right up to the ending - which is very different from the book.  The movie is good ... but the book is better!
B004259BMM|5.0|I pre-ordered this album and got it the day it came out! I have never heard better music from Keith Urban. He sings about love with such harmony and great lyrics. I love all the songs which have been playing on repeat in my car for the past 4 days!! This is worth the buy!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Definately a top ten fantasy book to read.  Only wish the follow up book would materialize so much sooner.  We`ve been waiting sooo long!  Hurry before I blow away with the wind.
0439023513|5.0|I don't want to give away spoilers for this book or the previous two, so I'll just say here that this is the third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy, and it blew me away. If you've not yet read The Hunger Games, get off the computer immediately and go buy the whole trilogy. And then read it. I'm not kidding around here.<br /><br />Oh, Katniss, I really love you, but you break my heart. How you are not a puddle of goo on the floor by the end of the series, I'll never know. I love the characters in these books. I must admit that I've always been Team Gale, but this book for me was really all about Katniss. And Finnick a little bit. Okay, a lot. I loved Finnick. But so many of the characters in this book were broken down and at the end of their rope. It was hard to read at times. There were times when I had to put the book down so I could cry for a little bit. And there were times when I was literally sobbing.<br /><br />This series is set in the future in what used to be the United States. Collins has created an amazing world here, although definitely not one that I'd like to visit anytime soon. Or ever.<br /><br />Notable quotes:<br />\\"You're still trying to protect me. Real or not real,\\" he whispers.<br />\\"Real,\\" I answer. - \\"Because that's what you and I do, protect each other.\\"<br /><br />\\"Is that why you hate me?\\" I ask.<br />\\"Partly,\\" She admits. \\"Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you're a little hard to swallow. With your tacky romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn't an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please feel free to take this personally.\\"<br /><br />Read this if you're in the mood for the best book you've read in a long time. But first read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.<br /><br />In case I haven't made it clear, I loved this book. No, it wasn't perfect, but after waiting for this book all year, I wasn't disappointed at all. I'm only disappointed that I read it so fast and now I'm done. I don't want to read anything else right now because I'm afraid nothing will measure up. I haven't read the Underland Chronicles yet, so I'll be getting to those when I get a chance, and I'll definitely be reading anything else Collins writes.g will measure up. I haven't read the Underland Chronicles yet, so I'll be getting to those when I get a chance, and I'll definitely be reading anything else Collins writes.
1401324029|5.0|Watch the TV show faithfully, so the books are a bonus.  I ordered, and read both books.  These books then get passed around to about 7 of my friends.  The fast readers get it first!  We are all waiting for a third book.
0765326353|5.0|With a fantasy novel of this size, you'd think there'd be so many characters that it'd be hard to keep track of them. That's what I've generally found in these doorstopper epic fantasies. Not so in The Way of Kings. There really is only a small handful of main characters, and with the depth and detail in this book, you really get to know and love them, even the lesser characters. Kaladin was my favorite in the story, which I think it fitting since this book is mostly about him.<br /><br />This is the most amazing part of the book. The amount of worldbuilding that went into this book is quite possibly the best I've ever seen. Down to the smallest detail, Sanderson has created a world so different from ours, but not so alien that we can't relate to or care about the characters. I'll admit, I don't understand everything about how this fantasy world works, but I'm looking forward to reading more books and finding out.<br /><br />Notable quotes:<br />\\"Too many of us,\\" she said, \\"take great pains with what we ingest through our mouths, and far less with what we partake of through our ears and eyes. Wouldn't you say?\\"<br /><br />\\"Let the Vorin believe as they wish--the wise among them will find goodness and solace in their faith; the fools would be fools no matter what they believed.\\"<br /><br />\\"'And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.'\\"<br /><br />Read this if you're in the mood for an epic fantasy that has it all. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, and I'll continue to read everything he writes, especially this series. The second book can't come fast enough for me. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|I have Taylor's previous albums as well as the Itunes Soho Live one (more on this in a bit). I generally like her after avoiding her for years because of the endless hype. I've found that if someone/something is shoved in my face, my first impression of it will be biased bc of the (media) onslaught. So after a couple years, I gave her music a listen and found that it wasn't bad. I'd first heard her first cd during my makeup class, and thought it was generic/non-offensive enough to play in the background while doing a client's face. So I bought the second album...again, OK. Not earth-shattering, but it was easy listening. Nothing wrong w/that. One thing I remember a music producer tell me is that an artist should have songs that make listeners feel like they can sing. Her simple lyrics/catchy music plays right into that. However...    As for Speak Now, I was awaiting this album bc after the first two, I'd hoped the references to high school and teenage love would be gone. I felt that she's getting older, so those types of songs should no longer be relevant(she's at least 21 I think?). So I started listening and was impressed because I thought I'd heard maturity, and then I heard a reference to teen love/HS and shook my head. I'm going to assume that she has songs that she just wants to record, but I had hoped all of those references would be retired. The sound is familiar. 'Haunted' is the most unique song on the album. It's the only track that truly stands out in terms of sound. All the others are reminscent of previous songs. Sometimes with my musical tastes, I like for artists to have songs that I can't imagine anyone else singing. To use a pop example, there's not one song of Christina Aguilera's that I can imagine Jessica Simpson singing. However, I can easily hear Mandy Moore singing Taylor's songs. Mandy's voice is better for sure, but neither Mandy or Taylor are unique to their musical peers. I guess that also means Taylor sounds more pop than country to me.As I mentioned, I have the Soho album which is live. I don't think Taylor has a strong voice at all. It's evident in the live album, but even in the studio, her range seems minimal. She's not monotone, but it seems as though her voice has a limit. I think it lacks power, and as she progresses (assuming she has longevity), more is going to be expected of her voice. I can't imagine her \\"sound\\" working out for her when she turns 30. She actually does hit a note in the hook of 'The Story of Us' that caught me by surprise (past the range in the other albums); it was the only one I heard, and test is if she can do the same live.     I bought the digital album during the $3.99 special, which was a good deal. I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise. It's very easy to listen to, but it's definitely in the B range.    Top songs on the album:  *Back to December  *The Story of Us  *Haunted
0451450523|4.0|I can't believe that I've never read this before. It's about a unicorn who finds out she is the last of her kind. She sets off to find out what happened to the others. She meets up with a magician (who really can't do any magic) and a young woman who both help her on her way. This story is absolutely beautiful and magical and could be enjoyed by all ages.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time with this portion, because while I think the characters are very central to the story (the story is about the unicorn, after all), I really don't think the characters were that important. Is that weird? I just felt like the flow of the story, the poetic writing, and getting lost in the fairy tale were what it was all about.<br /><br />I didn't really get a good sense for the world in this story. There wasn't a whole lot of world-building, and even the kingdom of King Haggard that was described, I had a hard time picturing.<br /><br />Read this if you're in the mood for a classic fairy tale. It really is a sweet little story.<br />I'm not sure if I would read more by this author or not. I really liked this one, but not in a way that I would run out and try to find other books by the author.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Give a listen to both these remastered CD's (Red and Blue) and you will get the feeling it's Beatlemania all over again. If you were around (like I was) in those days when the Beatles burst on the scene, you will recall the giddy joy you felt at hearing these \\"mop top\\" \\"fab four\\" \\"lads from Liverpool\\" for the first time.  Their music, their appearance, and their instruments were like nothing you had seen before.  Musically, they were in a league of their own... inventers of a new musical style that featured new chording innovations, inspired lyrics and beautiful harmonies. If you were fortunate enough to see them in a live performance, then you witnessed Beatlemania first hand when their voices were young and lively. Give these CD's a listen and you will hear the clear raw energy of their music once more. It's like being transported back to those days of Beatlemania.
B002VGFZII|5.0|I am shocked that this film got such bad reviews. I mean, I really loved this film. Its just a fun, classic action film with tons of fights, explosions, chase scenes, and just general excitement. My favorite character, Snake-Eyes, gets more sceen-time than I expected, so for that, I am glad.    The film handled the character development well. Many of the characters got backstories, and they never felt boring. The action scenes are fast, and by the time the credits roll, you want even more. The only drawback is, for those fans who like Snake-Eyes and Scarlett to be together, the film doesn't go that route. I didn't mind though.    Maybe the most shocking thing about this is, I don't even care for the G.I. Joe franchise, yet I still loved this film. So whether you are a fan or not, you should still watch this film.
B0045VZSB6|5.0|This movie was awesome. All my family sat down to watch the blue ray version of the movie. We all smiled at the finish. We loved it.
142313494X|1.0|I was forced into watching this film rented by a friend who is staying with us right now.  It was boring and silly, and furthermore had nothing to do with the classic Greek myth.     The stealing of Harry Potter type scenes, one after the other, bad acting, and a botched story line bugged the h out of me.  Can't anyone do a film these days without attempting to copy some scenes from Harry? HP is unique.  Are the kids these days too  stupid or bored to watch a real Greek myth, instead of the cartoon type characatures?    Perseus was the legendary founder of the Mycenae kingdom and never went to school in the US or went to camp with other kids to learn how to be a demi god.  He was of the Perseid dynasty.  Look it up. Mycenae was once a mighty kingdom of ancient Greece, and it's ruler Agememnon was considered one of the greatest of them all. It's 8th grade history.  Perseus was the first of the mythic heroes of Greek mythology whose exploits in defeating various archaic monsters provided the founding myths of the Twelve Olympians. Perseus was the Greek hero who killed the Gorgon Medusa, and claimed Andromeda, having rescued her from a sea monster sent by Poseidon. This movie had nothing to do with the real classic myth.  I mean Las Vegas?  Come on. Bad movie, teaches nothing.
B003954I9C|5.0|I love this cd! AJ was always my favorite BSB member and I love his single.  It was less hip hoppy than I expected it to be but it was still a great cd!
B003YWUTJI|4.0|This is a very fun album with a variety of guests. I prefer Norah's earlier work when she sticks with her genre, but this is still a keeper. If you're considering this purchase, make sure you listen to the samples before going through with it.
B003ZSH606|5.0|The new CD is phenomenal! There is not a song on it I don't love(I love it when that happens,which is not very often); including the re-mixes ( I am usually not a fan of re-mixes). The band never fails to deliver, I don't know how they do it. Each song takes me to places I have been and never been all at the same time, I love it! It feels so good! Thank you Jamiroquai! The new Cd is a complete triumph in my book and I thank you. You are one of the few bands I know I can count on. In a time where everything on the radio (at least here in the U.S.) sounds the same. No variety, no imagination, whatever will sell ; as if sex,quick beats and a dash of shock and scandalous behavior don't get repetitive and down right boring.It is nice to know that there are still some true musicians who care about the product they create, albeit not many, but enough to keep seeing us through. Do yourself a favor and pick up the 'Deluxe Edition' So's not to miss out on the *Bonus Songs & Re-Mixes. An incredible addition to the \\"Jamiroquai Music Dynasty\\" and your music collection!
B004259BMM|5.0|Just wanted to encourage you all to buy the CD.  It's just awesome!  Beautiful music, songs and singing.  Can't get enough of it!  You need to buy it!
B003XQRZ7E|2.0|If you just haven't gotten enough Zeppelin and Deep Purple, then you might consider getting the whole record.  Personally, I've had enough of these bands, and the other songs on the album to me are just okay.  I think One Last Soul and the Great Divide are fantastic.  It is however, a thrill to hear Glenn sing, as his voice just sounds sensational as ever.    The guys dialing in 70's soounds and following their ancestors formulas for music of that time do nothing for me without a good, catchy song.  They're not bad, they're just so so (imho).  I feel like I'm listening to leftover tracks from sessions done in the 70's w Zep & Purple bandmembers.
B003WKFAIW|3.0|This is Maroon 5's third album, but the other two are better. I thought 'It Won't Be Soon Before Long' was thier strongest album but it took a while to warm to it. I think after listening to the album in full, you won't be blown away, but after more listens to it, the songs do grow on you. The songs will grow on you after a while but the other two albums overall were stronger than this one.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|If you liked \\"Raising Sand,\\" you'll enjoy this album as well.  Robert Plant's talents emerge in collaboration with a host of musicians.  Nothing wrong Led Zeppelin, but these later albums demonstrate different dimensions of Plant's ability.
006145785X|2.0|The two stars is for the audio.  This seems like an interesting and thought-provoking book however I gave up on the CD because the reader was just too annoying.  He reads the book in a pompous tone of voice as if he were playing Dean Wermer, or perhaps asking for Grey Poupon.  I'll have to try reading the book.
0061474355|1.0|this book is excedingly boring and uneventful. i thought this book sounded intresting enough but i couldnt have been more wrong. i was already 80% into the book when any real excitement came into the story and then we went back to being boring as heck 2 minutes later. characters were probably too logical for a fantasy story and whoever heard of a female heroine falling in love with another character but only spending about 10 minutes with him total?! thats utterly ridiculous. you want my advice? save time and money and dont even bother with this book.
B003ZDZ22U|5.0|Miley delivers on this album, unlike her last solo stinkfest (Can't be Tamed).  Several songs are more of a lament rather than just mindless bubblegum pop, sure several fun ones to be sure, but overall a display of growing up.  Miley's voice is well suited to this style of pop song fare, but better yet I have a feeling she would kill with pure country songs, with a country twang.  Something she should explore, I think, afterall she does have that faint Tennesse accent, ya'll.
B001AR4K8K|4.0|Great movie, obviously great picture in BR. I'd expect a bit more presentation/bonus since it got put in blu-ray. Enhanced picture obviously, but beyond that I wouldn't call it a great transition.
B004ATL2CM|5.0|My husband and I saw him in concert in '92 and I thought he was great.  We saw him last week on this Bare Bones tour and he was absolutely incredible!!!  I LOVE this sound.  His voice just completely ages well.  I think I am head over heels for him again lol
B00428ZRFE|1.0|This a stupid album, it couldn't have been more generic and boring if generic and boring sat on it's face. A friend lent me this cd and i returned it as fast as possible.    Maybe next time Rihanna, cause this effort was just worth crap. It seems like you were trying to rush after the sucess of \\"Rude Boy\\" to make something like it and make more money.    This album is full of stupid stupid stupid songs
B004B4RCDE|1.0|A flop of an album I think.  I love the beats behind \\"S&M\\" but the lyrics are vapid and others have mined that turf better before.  After the dark, reflective \\"Rated R\\" where Rihanna grew as an artist, this album is a step back.  Sadly it 'dbe good if it created bunch of sparkly pop gems but there are no standouts here in my book.  The songs are only ok.
B00418NXBK|5.0|The Kings don't ever let me down!!  They always rock my socks!    This album is definitely different from the last but if you ask me each album is different from the one before it.  I believe that is what makes this band so great.  They always progress.  Excellent lyrics and excellent music.  They make their own music their own way.  Definitely give it a listen and if you like this album check out their others.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I've long held this movie as easily my favorite comedic movie of all time. I've never seen dry humor done better. The lines are delivered perfectly. The script is brilliant. Love the soundtrack. The characters are easy to relate to and very likeable. Every movie seems to do slap stick comedy nowadays, this movie seems like art by comparison. Infinite replay value. That pretty much sums it up.
0739334026|2.0|I had never read (or in this case, heard) any of Grisham's works before.  I hope \\"The Firm\\" is better since I have that paperback and have yet to read it.<br /><br />I don't know what it was but I just couldn't get into it.  It got kind of interesting towards the end (about 1/2 way through the 4th disc of the abridged version) but that wasn't enough.<br /><br />And the narrator ... I really LIKE Dennis Boutsikaris but my GOD!  Even the people in my ride-share noted that his Italian accent was awful.<br /><br />Sorry, John.  Sorry, Dennis.  Sorry, Random House Audio.  This was a dud.
B0016MOWP0|4.0|Point Break Blu-ray Review     Distributor : 20th Century Fox     This US Blu-ray is in fact one of the main contributing factors behind my investing in a multi region Blu-ray player, as unfortunately it being a 20th Century Fox release, this one is region locked to A.     There is a Blu-ray available in Spain of this movie, but that one is presented in1080i and has lip sinc issues on the English audio track, making it one to avoid for English speaking collectors. This US release however, is presented with a 2.35:1 1080p transfer which really looks quite strong with decent colours and black levels throughout. The image quality is sharp and considering the age of the film, is more than likely the best that this film will ever look. It is certainly fair to say that the transfer is a noticeable improvement over the DVD releases, especially over the original first DVD release, which is still the only option currently available in the UK as the newer Pure Adrenaline Edition has never been made available over here on any format.     As this is the US disc, the film itself is also uncut, unlike the original UK release, which had some edits to some of the more violent scenes.     The audio on this Blu-ray is strong and impressive. Offering a lossless DTS HD track which again is a world away from the audio presented on the DVDs. Sound is crisp and clear throughout, whether you are listening to the slower dialogue scenes or the many louder action sequences.     As far as extra features are concerned, there are approx 4 featurettes, some theatrical trailers and a hand full of deleted scenes. Nothing to get too excited about, but at least there is something included here for fans of movie extras.     All things considered this is a worthwhile Blu-ray release. If you are a long time fan of the film, you will definitely appreciate the higher quality transfer and audio presented here. Quite why this hasn't made a UK release yet is anyone's guess, however with multi region Blu-rayplayers available these days from as little as £60, this US disc could just be one of a number of reasons to convert you over to multi region player freedom.     Definitely a movie of it's time and still just as enjoyable to this day. Point Break on Blu-ray comes highly recommended.     \\"IF YOU WANT THE ULTIMATE RUSH, YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE.\\"     Thankfully, that doesn't apply to the cost of this Blu-ray disc, which can be found reasonably cost effectively, from most on-line suppliers.

B003YK42LQ|3.0|Kings of Leon are a frustrating band. After five albums they still haven't quite found a successful formula to ascend to dizzying heights of fame. They came close with \\"Only By The Night\\", but \\"Come Around Sundown\\" is an entirely safe move as a follow up. They seem to have great potential, but each album squanders their chance for greater success.<br /><br />As is typical for myself, I began listening to Kings of Leon from the beginning, and moving forward sequentially, until I reached \\"Come Around Sundown\\". The problem with this new album is that there is little variation sonically or melodically. It's like someone took a lathe full of shellac and pasted over the proceedings in a thick Eagles, 70's, country-rock texture. This makes \\"Come Around Sundown\\" their least adventurous effort to date, and the band has been quite adventurous previously, and that's what's sorely missing here.<br /><br />\\"The End\\" is very similar to \\"Closer\\" from \\"Only By The Night\\", which is nice, but nothing new. I found myself liking tracks such as \\"Pyro\\", \\"Back Down South\\", \\"Beach Side\\", \\"Pony Up\\", \\"Mi Amigo\\" and \\"Pickup Truck\\". All of these tracks keep the album afloat because dull blues rockers like \\"Mary\\" and listless attempts at rock such as \\"Birthday\\", \\"The Immortals\\" and \\"No Money\\" just drag the album down. \\"Radioactive\\" is a grower, and \\"The Face\\" is a decent ballad.<br /><br />I downloaded and added the three bonus tracks to my listening experience, but I have to say what a waste of time. \\"Celebration\\" barely registered with me, \\"Radioactive (Remix)\\" did not sound that much different, and \\"Closer\\" (Presets Remix) was unsatisfying.<br /><br />After the moderate success of \\"Only By The Night\\" you'd have thought the band had hit pay dirt, but to follow up with this safe entry, well, you can only ask yourself what was the band thinking? They should have used a more adventurous producer like Rick Rubin, Brian Eno, Jimmy Iovine, Trevor Horn, Rupert Hine or Nigel Godrich.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Come Around Sundown\\" compares to Kings of Leon's previous work:<br /><br />2003 Youth & Young Manhood: Three Stars<br />2004 Aha Shake Heartbreak: Four Stars<br />2007 Because Of The Times: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Only By The Night: Four Stars<br />2010 Come Around Sundown: Three StarsKings of Leon's previous work:    2003 Youth & Young Manhood: Three Stars  2004 Aha Shake Heartbreak: Four Stars  2007 Because Of The Times: Three and a Half Stars  2008 Only By The Night: Four Stars  2010 Come Around Sundown: Three Stars
B003M98792|4.0|Shogun Assassin Blu-ray Review    Distributor: AnimEigo US    Never mind The Bride from Kill Bill, if you should find yourself embarking on a war against an army of crazed samurai killers, then Lone Wolf is the one warrior that you need on your side.    Originally taken from the Lone Wolf and Cub series, Shogun Assassin has built up a real cult following among various movie enthusiasts around the globe. From grind house theatres in the US, to one time video nasty status in the UK, the film has seen it's fair share of controversy over the years. At least two alternate edits of the film exist, including the original six part Lone Wolf / Baby Cart series and the Americanised movie version which splices together footage from two episodes and adds a brand new linking narration taken from the perspective of Lone Wolf's son Daigoro.     Previously released in the UK on video cassette and DVD, the film has always suffered from transfer problems including cropping and visible print damage. Released in 2006 in the US on DVD by the same distributor as this new Blu-ray release, the transfer was far superior to all other releases  and was widely thought to be the best the film would ever look. Rather surprisingly then, this Blu-ray release has had even more time and attention spent on it, easily making it the ultimate release of the film to date.         Shogun Assassin in it's 30th Anniversary Collectors Edition, marks the début Blu-ray release for the AnimEigo studio and to get the ultimate print of the film, they took original masters from the two Lone Wolf Episodes and re-edited them together to exactly match the movie as previously released. This process enabled the distributor to release a pristine wide-screen 1080p print of the film which is huge improvement over all previous releases. Although the distributor had also performed the same trick with their US DVD release, this is the first time that they were able to produce an HD master and the difference is easily noticeable. The new HD transfer is excellent throughout with background elements showing far more detail than ever before. Skin tones and colours are also strong with black levels also being impressive. Never before has the extreme bloodshed looked so  gloriously over the top, with reds gushing all over the screen in every angle conceivable.       As far as the audio is concerned, this movie was never going to present a sound effects fuelled extravaganza, however the dialogue is clean, crisp and free from distortion making Daigoro's narration seem all the more prominent and engrossing.    Extras here are also impressive. Exclusive to the Blu-ray release, there are a total of two audio commentaries. The first of which is with the films producer, the graphic designer and the voice actor for Daigoro himself. The second commentary track presents the thoughts of film scholar Ric Meyers and martial arts expert Steve Watson. Obviously there is a wealth of information available here, which should present even the greatest fans of the film with something new. Moving on from the commentaries, we are presented with a video interview with none other than Samuel L. Jackson who talks about his love for the film. Dating from his first initial viewing, to now modern day screenings, his genuine enthusiasm for movies of this kind is widely evident here.    All things considered, the Blu-ray release is definitely set to become the ultimate must own edition of the film. Whether or not the distributor will release the rest of the series on Blu-ray remains to be seen, however if their first step into the Blu market is anything to go by, they appear to be a company that puts a great deal of effort into their releases, so it will be interesting to see what follows. The only negative aspect concerning this Blu release is that it happens to be locked to Region A, further proof  if ever needed, that multi-region Blu-ray is the only way to go.    In summing up, the ultimate tag line for the movie isbest left to Daigoro's own narration.      \\"MY FATHER WASN'T SCARED OF THE SHOGUN...THE SHOGUN WAS SCARED OF HIM\\"        BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of those less mainstream releases find us on Facebook

B0042JTDXK|1.0|I am a big fan of Josh's but this cd is, sadly, just awful. I can't believe I wasted the money on this one, but I just assumed after loving all his previous cd's that this would at least be tolerable. I could barely sit through it once. The music is forgettable and the lyrics terrible. I know Josh wrote a lot of them but he really needs to realize that song writing is not his forte. That is not his talent but singing is and that is what he should stick with. Josh's music has brought so much joy to me through listening to it, but this album just disappoints especially since it was so long since the last one. I guess I will just have to be satisfied with his last several cd's until he comes out with another one. Please Josh go back to basics and use that glorious voice the way it was meant to be.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|It's difficult to separate \\"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\\" from the initial experience of viewing the film for the first time in 1982. I saw it at the local mall theater (bulldozed many years ago) in a sneak preview two weeks before it's release. The house was packed and none of us knew what to expect. Director Steven Spielberg's \\"boy wonder\\" glow had faded after his ill-advised [[ASIN:0783231032 1941 (Collector's Edition)]]. We were not thinking of that as we sat down. Memories of Spielberg's glorious [[ASIN:B000VECACG Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)]] inspired us to venture to the theater. Thanks to \\"E.T.,\\" the summer of '82 was Spielberg's official \\"comeback,\\" combined with the historical first punch of his 1981 classic [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]], and he would forever be branded a great director. And he is, though possessing a tendency uncommon to film-making prodigies (Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick) to make amazingly bad films ([[ASIN:B00000IQW5 Always]], [[ASIN:0767836324 Hook]], [[ASIN:B00003CXB6 The Lost World - Jurassic Park (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]) every few years. But when Steven finds his mark and hits the bull's-eye, as he did with \\"E.T.,\\" no arrow flies higher or faster.    OK, back to the sneak preview. We were enthralled, we cheered, we laughed (to this day I recall the audience roaring after the \\"penis breath\\" line) and when the film ended, there was enormous applause the likes of which I've never heard again and, frankly, not heard since that shark was blown up at the end of \\"Jaws.\\" Spielberg's great films have a way of eliciting amazing audience participation. When we left that theater so many summers ago, we knew without reservation we had seen a modern classic. I've seen the movie several times since, and it never fails to open my inner child. Spielberg's choice to film almost entirely from the viewpoint of ET and Elliott were instinctively correct, and he achieves poetic artistic levels because of it. His recreation of family life in the suburbs is so accurate (one of Steven's greatest strengths) we instantly identify with the characters and situations.     In so many ways, Spielberg is one of us. He's the nerdy middle America kid toting an 8mm camera to the woods to make war movies, and then having backyard premieres on a sheet hanging from a tree. Hey, I grew up in the suburbs. There was indeed a patch of woods near my home as eerie and ominous as the towering forest in Spielberg's American canvas. At night, ghosts, aliens and werewolves walked there, and I would close the curtains when the sun went down. Spielberg has recaptured these childhood fears in \\"E.T.\\" He also evoked amazing performances from his varied cast, including Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton as the children, and especially Dee Wallace in an underrated turn as mother Mary. It was perfect casting, another strength of Spielberg's best films.    I don't know if we can call \\"E.T.\\" a classic on the level of, say \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"City Lights,\\" or [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]]]. But in terms of fantasy and family films, it's a masterpiece as perfectly realized as [[ASIN:B002DYYGQK The Wizard of Oz (70th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. It will terrify, excite and charm, even if having ET die and resurrect is blatant manipulation. Spielberg has wisely left much to imagination and interpretation, further propelling his deeply emotional work into the realm of classic myth. I have never quite understood the reasoning behind having a psychic connection between ET and Elliott, though enjoy the scene at the school caused by the consumption of beer.     Deep down of what appears to be a pure soul, Spielberg has an old-fashionedeye classically born within the studio sets of MGM, the films of Frank Capra and the pathos of Charles Dickens. These sensibilities are cleverly mixed with a modern post-World War II and, to a lessor extent, post-Vietnam age. It's a sentimental heart amidst increasing waves of modern cynicism. Spielberg's body of work overflows with all the strengths and weaknesses of such middle class values. When we see the sun each morning, it is brutally hopeful no matter the carnage. In \\"E.T.,\\" we saw the sun in 1982, and continue to see it today.
0316044938|4.0|Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon is walking home from high school, taking a shortcut across a cornfield in early December dusk. The man who calls to her is a neighbor, so why should she be afraid of him? Susie has no idea he's a serial killer who has left a string of other victims behind in the other towns where he has lived. The only part of her body the police find is an elbow. Her murderer knows his business, from disposing of the body to keeping the police (and just about everyone else, too) convinced that he's harmless.<br /><br />From her new home in heaven, Susie watches her family as they grieve. She also watches her friends, and the rest of her community. As she adjusts to heaven, those who loved her try to make their own adjustments - a process that gradually tears her family apart. Her father soon guesses who killed his child, and being unable to prove it obsesses him. Her mother wants only to hide. Her baby brother understands in his own way, and her sister - quite close to Susie in age - sets out to prove what their father believes. Even if that puts her, too, in danger.<br /><br />How can a novel that starts with its adolescent narrator's murder work at all, let alone make an engaging and at times downright fascinating read? Especially when it's by no means a murder mystery, but rather a multifaceted character study? After reading through it much faster than I expected, I would say that its author has managed to tap into the basics of how an American community operates. The fundamental ways in which its people relate to each other, both within their family units and as individuals. She does a particularly good job of showing how these people are shaped by both the events they experience, and the choices they make.<br /><br />The book's final scenes give the characters closure, especially protagonist Susie who needs that closure in order to move on to her heaven's next phase. These scenes will either work for you or they won't. They worked for me, so I put the book down feeling satisfied even though I do have to admit it was too neat a wrap-up to fit well with the rest of the story's often painful realism.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This little mic has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and a very nice audio quality.  I can't believe that something that sounds this professional is being sold for under $100.<br /><br />The cables and components all feel cheap to the touch, however.  The mic lav clip doesn't rotate like the Shure SM11's does, and the little windscreen doesn't stay on the mic well.  The cables are a bit too long for ungrounded cables, and I wish they just gave us 2 feet of room so it could be plugged into a field recorder, transmitter, etc... and save on the extra noise in the audio as a result of the long cabling.<br /><br />Comes with a battery; not sure how long it lasts yet, but it's nice that one was included.<br /><br />If this thing breaks in 6 months I'll buy another.  If it breaks in 3 months I'll just buy a better mic.  At this price point, though, it's worth finding out.

None of the songs really grab me (exception is the lead single, great tune). Thankfully he puts records out yearly, so I'll look forward to what he does in 2011, but most of these songs will be well forgotten in a few years.

B003TML0VO|1.0|I grew up with Santana from their first album, through all of the permutations of the band - some good and some really bad - up until today. I find it awfully sad that someone who contributed to some incredibly classic recordings (Santana's version of Black Magic Woman / Gypsy Queen / Oye Como Va), finds it a good idea to phone in guitar solos over \\"ok\\" cover versions of oddly selected tunes.<br /><br />When a guitar player kills time, he or she \\"noodles\\" while music is playing. That's all these albums are to me. Carlos Santana noodling, with maybe a chord chart in front of him. There's no structure to his involvement. During the verse - noodling, during the chorus - noodling, during the solo spot - nothing special.<br /><br />That all said, I absolutely agree with all of the other comments that the selection of songs - being considered the \\"Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time\\" is ridiculous. Few of the represented bands would make anyone's top-40.<br /><br />Terribly disappointing - a true guitar legend just padding his wallet...
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Given that the concluding novel in the Harry Potter series covers so much in terms of plot and characterization, it is fitting that the movie was divided into two parts. I was quite wary about this latest installment in the HP franchise after some of the liberties taken with HP and the Half-Blood Prince (though I still loved it). I feel that HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is one of the most (if not, the most) faithful adaptation of a HP novel to be brought to the silver screen. There is a perfect synergy of all the elements that made me fall in love with the story of HP as written in the books - great characterization made possible by credible and amazing acting; gorgeous cinematography; a score that perfectly captures the angst, tension, and drama of the unfolding story; and special effects that awe without overwhelming the audience or detract from the story.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to mention and I feel is important is that this particular installment really does require prior knowledge of the Harry Potter novels. This movie takes it for granted that viewers will be able to fill in the blanks, like why does Hermione have to perform a spell on her parents which erases her existence from their memories? Throughout the movie, little snippets of Potter lore are sprinkled about which will delight any devoted fan but might confound and frustrate any newcomer to the series (which is why I would recommend starting from the first movie and working one's way through the series, in order). To really understand all that is going on, and the significance of certain things unfolding during the movie, I would recommend reading the book (to be able to see a particular scene and think, \\"That's exactly how I imagined it would happen!\\" or \\"Ahh, so that's the significance of the ...\\" was an enriching and immensely satisfying experience for me).<br /><br />I am not going to rehash the plot in detail - basically, this movie takes off some time after HP and the Half-Blood Prince ended. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) sends the Dursleys off to a safe spot as he prepares to go on his quest for the remaining Horcruxes which hold parts of Voldemort's soul. He is joined by best pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Part One of Deathly Hallows traces the trio's journey and sense of aimlessness (for they know not where the remaining horcruxes are); tension and strife between Ron and Harry; Hermione's sadnesss at losing Ron briefly; the constant pressure of being on the run; and perhaps most significantly, discovering that each of them truly have a purpose, that it is together and not individually that they are able to gain advantage over the Dark Lord. The actors who play the leads have truly come into their own and it is just amazing to see these young actors mature into and inhabit each of their roles with credibility and assurance, playing their characters with great depth. It is even more amazing given that they have been playing these roles for more than a decade, yet never do they show that they are tiring of their roles or just doing it for the money - there's real passion here.<br /><br />My only grouse is that Snape (Alan Rickman) does not get much screen time, but I'm sure that will be redressed in Part Two where he plays a more significant role. Helena Bonham-Carter was a hoot to watch as usual, playing the maniacal role of Bellatrix Lestrange with a fervor unmatched by any screen villainess in recent time (at least in my opinion). Ralph Fiennes portrays the Dark Lord with a credible sense of evil and malignancy, though his appearances in this installment are mainly via flashbacks and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's thoughts.<br /><br />Three things that caught my interest (well, many things actually, but these three were unique): The dramatization of the tale of the three brothers, i.e. the Peverell brothers was done via animation, and it is gloriously done, with understatement yet is effective inconveying to the viewer the significance of this tale to Harry's quest. Another was the controversial scene between Harry and Hermione (spoiler ahead!) - Hermione and Harry are shown in an intimate embrace during a confrontation with the Dark Lord's soul and Ron who has been beseeched with doubts regarding their relationship flounders whilst the clock is ticking. This scene was tastefully done, and not explicit at all (except for kissing), so the PG-13 rating is safe! Finally, the scenes of persecution against the Mud-Bloods were so well-done and captured the hysteria that was so reminiscent of another time in the past, i.e. Nazi Germany during WW II.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is a great set-up to the final installment in the HP series, and will especially please ardent fans of the novels. There is a perfect blend of drama, tension, bleakness, and even humor. Recommended!ificance of this tale to Harry's quest.

0316098337|5.0|Although it begins as a mystery, and evolves into a psychology science fiction - its fictional nature calling all the more attention to its trenchant insightfulness and accuracy - \\"Room\\" ultimately becomes something more - a book capable of realigning our perceptions of our own lives - even our goals.  Seeing Jack discover the world - but even more importantly noting how people deal with him and one another - in the latter part of the book is revelatory, inspiring, deflating and heartbreaking all at once.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|It took a lot of patience on my part but here we are. I waited for these films to come in one package. Not buying the DVD versions. Waited when the third film came out in theaters and Disney released the previous two on Blu-Ray in separate packs. Waited, despite the begging from my wife and daughter to get the films already. But I held out... And now THEY ARE MINE! (Insert evil laughter here.)<br /><br />So is it everything I had hoped for? Well, I have to say yes. Here is my take on it.<br /><br />The set comes in a beautiful box that is as colorful as the films themselves. Open it reveals a mini version of Andy's toy box and opening that reveals the discs, held in place by pre-formed foam. The toy box itself is adorable and I don't mind the lack of jewel cases. The only problem is that the slots where the discs slid into are delicate and continuous use will probably wear them out. Plus its very easy to confuse the slots and place the discs in the wrong slot. Aside from that, the presentation looks awesome in my opinion. Some better execution would have made it better. The box now sits proudly at the top of my movie collection.<br /><br />The collection has 10 discs. A BD version of the films, a DVD version and a Digital Copy version, which is pretty much par for the course for a Disney release. The DVD versions will of course have permanent play on our mini-van. The tenth disc is the Bonus Features of the stand alone release of the third film. Many have cried foul over this fact as many were hoping the tenth disc was going to be unique for this release but alas, it was not to be. For me, there are two possible explanations: 1) Disney simply tried to homogenize the release. the other two films have their respective previous special features. The third film is the only one of the three released in the Blu-Ray era so to be faithful, they threw that in. 2) In an effort two make us double dip, they held out any new extra content for a future inevitable anniversary edition of this collection. The reaction to this is completely understandable I think, considering just how good the extras on Pixar films have been but here is the reason it doesn't bother me one bit:<br /><br />The transfers to BD of all three films is SO good, I forget everything else.<br /><br />As it turns out, my patience was rewarded twice. In my stubbornness to wait out this collection I found myself asking my brother to lend me his DVD versions of Toy Story 1 & 2 1 week before this box came out hoping to calm my daughter's desperation as she simply loves these films. This gave me the opportunity to make a side by side comparison and I have to tell you. These transfers are impressive. Most impressive. The BD editions simply blow any previous releases out of the water. Those familiar with Pixar Blu-Rays will find no surprises in that last comment but since Toy Story is the first (and therefore oldest) film n the Pixar canon, I wondered how it would turn out but I should not have worried. Watching these films on Blu makes watching the DVD versions look like trying to watch a movie screen through a screen door. You have not watched these films until you watch them on Blu-Ray. Even if you saw them in theaters. They are that good.<br /><br />So, is it worth it? For me, absolutely. Since I don't own a previous version of any of the films included here, this collection is downright perfect. However, owners of previous editions who might be looking for more can be(and have been) dissapointed.  So despite the little flaws in the packaging I give it a solid 4 stars. The digital transfers alone are worth the price of admission and besides, buying all three films separately costs pretty much the same anyway. Highly recommended.The reaction to this is completely understandable I think, considering just how good the extras on Pixar films have been but here is the reason it doesn't bother me one bit:    The transfers to BD of all three films is SO good, I forget everything else.

In my stubbornness to wait out this collection I found myself asking my brother to lend me his DVD versions of Toy Story 1 & 2 1 week before this box came out hoping to calm my daughter's desperation as she simply loves these films. This gave me the opportunity to make a side by side comparison and I have to tell you. These transfers are impressive. Most impressive. The BD editions simply blow any previous releases out of the water. Those familiar with Pixar Blu-Rays will find no surprises in that last comment but since Toy Story is the first (and therefore oldest) film n the Pixar canon, I wondered how it would turn out but I should not have worried. Watching these films on Blu makes watching the DVD versions look like trying to watch a movie screen through a screen door. You have not watched these films until you watch them on Blu-Ray. Even if you saw them in theaters. They are that good.    So, is it worth it? For me, absolutely. Since I don't own a previous version of any of the films included here, this collection is downright perfect. However, owners of previous editions who might be looking for more can be(and have been) dissapointed.  So despite the little flaws in the packaging I give it a solid 4 stars. The digital transfers alone are worth the price of admission and besides, buying all three films separately costs pretty much the same anyway. Highly recommended.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I won't review the content of this book since there are already so many good reviews.  Needless to say I love this book!<br /><br />This is a review specifically of the Kindle Edition.<br /><br />The Kindle Edition of this book is FULL of errors.  There are MANY typos and misspellings.  For instance DORNE is spelled DOME (rn looks a lot like m).  Obviously to make the Kindle Edition a copy of the book was scanned and the scanning failed in a LOT of places.<br /><br />Throughout the book you will find misplaced parentheses: in the middle of some words or sentences.<br /><br />I don't really want to enumerate every error so let's just say there are just too many errors to make reading this on the Kindle enjoyable.  Let this be a warning!
B0029LHX1W|5.0|I picked this novel up for a quick vacation-read and was pleasantly surprised by the depth and historical detail as well as the entertainment value of it.  Smith offers Western readers a picture of Stalinist Russia that is worth the read on its own.  The story is well written with a variety of character types.  Smith draws from actual events and real situations for the novel.  I thought initially that none of the characters would be endearing or overly interesting, but I was quickly proved wrong as he develops his characters and draws readers into their lives and complexities.  What a world Smith creates compared to our culture of abundance and consumerism.  Stalinist Russia was quite a contrast, and Smith brings it to life in these pages.  The ending of the book is climactic and does not disappoint. It makes me want to immediately buy the sequel which I will do.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra was awesome in this movie - I recommend it for anyone, even my 10 year old could watch it.
0439023521|5.0|It's so rare to find a book that draws you in and leaves you totally absorbed from the 1st page to the last.  \\"Hunger Games\\" is one of those rare gems.  I sped through this book in a matter of a couple days then jumped right in to book two of the trilogy.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|My children and I loved it - I was shown really close to the book. By far the best one yet.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|This album is receiving a lot more bad reviews than it should. I am not surprised by this, but kind of confused by the critique it is getting.     A lot of the complaints are that Josh should go back to his roots, where he got his start. This album does just that, it goes back to the style of his self-titled album and somewhat replicates 'Closer' in places, this is not at all like 'Awake' which many deemed a style change for him. It is very classical, with some pop inspiration and a tiny bit of 'folk' in places. It's a lot closer to his \\"original\\" style than 'Awake' was (which, for the record, I very much liked).    There is also the complaint that he uses too much 'falsetto', I do agree with this, I wish he would spend a little bit more time in his lower range and while I can't ridicule him for wanting to get out of his comfort zone, I think he could have done it a little more sparingly. But that is a personal preference, we have far too many tenors out there, and a rarity in gorgeous baritones.     All that being said, this album has a lot to offer, and while it might not be as good (in my opinion) as 'Awake' or 'Closer' it's still clearly Josh and he makes beautiful music. 'The Bells of New York' and 'Love Only Knows' are two of my favorites and the Prelude makes me smile. While this album is darker than his others, I think it just explores a new side of his music and art and it's interesting and wonderful. It might take some time to get used to this new style but the same thing happened when 'Awake' came out, and that turned out to be my favorite album of his, and I anticipate, in time, I will love this album dearly too.     Yes, this album is different, it doesn't make him less talented or his art less beautiful.     Signed,  A non-fanatic Grobanite who appreciates the album for what it is.

B0043GAZYS|1.0|Time again for another comic-to-movie disaster. This one is SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, and it's so bad that it's in Airbender territory.<br /><br />First, let me tell you the premise of SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. For me to do this is a great kindness since you have to wait more than half an hour for the movie to hint at it and almost a full hour to get a fuller description. Even then, you have to wait until the very end to be told why any of it is happening at all. But to the point - Scott Pilgrim has fallen for a girl, but to be with her, he has to fight seven of her previous boy/girl friends in real life parodies of arcade parodies of movie parodies of real life martial arts duels. Need I say more? I struggled through the mind-numbing tedium with my tween-aged daughter who had wanted to see this flick. But after the first hour, even she wanted me to hit the FF button.<br /><br />The performances in SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD are all okay, except for Johnny One-Note Michael Cera. He plays the same character in every movie and I'm bored with it. It's not like he's Sean Connery, who can get away with it. Worse, he reminds me here of Aaron Johnson's character in Kick-Ass. Ack! Now I'm comparing those two movies. Double Ack! They're both really bad! Ahhh!!! My brain!<br /><br />Wow. That was close. I did trip on over to Rotten Tomatoes to see what the consensus over there was, and I was stunned to find that a great majority of reviewers and normal folks liked SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. So what am I missing? It's got good production values, the music is fine for what it is, and the actors can act (mostly), but I expect all of that from any movie. The plot is ethereal and meandering, and most of the characters are one-dimensional. But the worse sin of all is that it is boring. How do you recover from that? For me, SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD is a KO and down for the count.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|You would think with all the money that they put into makeing this movie, they would have given it a better plot. Special effects are awesome, but the movie is pretty boring. Worst movie of all time in my opinion.
031603438X|2.0|A really, really disappointing book. The only parts I think I enjoyed were when he was talking about his guitar methodology, especially his 5-string open-G tuning. The book is too long, too rambling, and too loosely thrown together. Most of the people he mentions in the book are presented as incomplete, unsatisfying caricatures. I have read a lot of Stones books and I can tell you, definitely, this will be the last time.
0061801313|5.0|Bought this set after the T.V. show came out.  I wish they would come out with a box set for the rest of the books.  This is a really good series.
B002ZG9788|4.0|Good movie to watch and own if you like this type of genre.  Nice adaptation of the old version - but if you were looking for a remake of the old Harry Hamlin version [[ASIN:B003L7DK60 Clash of the Titans [Blu-ray]]] this is not it so don't expect it.  Nice action and CGI scenes - don't focus on the acting so much as the overall plot and general story line and you should enjoy the flick!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I am somewhat of a crime, psychology, and maternal junkie, so it was a very good fit for me.  Given the subject matter, this book was surprisingly uplifting....more a story about survival and love between mother and son than anything else. It gives a thought provoking look into what the world might be like for someone in this circumstance....better than you'd imagine in some ways while worse in others.    I didn't want to put this book down and was always eager to get back to it, and not many books hold my attention like that.  I like to read but have trouble finding books that hold my interest.  It isn't that it was so suspenseful (there was some of that), but that it was so thought provoking.
B003WTE886|5.0|I have to admit, when I first listened to this album I was not impressed at all.  I kept going through the songs, wondering when I would get to one that I actually liked.  But like most albums I buy, after a few listens, I was hooked, and now I am convinced that this is one of the best albums of the year.    Not only has Taylor Swift's voice matured greatly, her songwriting has become so much better.  I still love all her songs from \\"Taylor Swift\\" and \\"Fearless\\", but I feel as if now, more than ever, is the perfect time for Taylor Swift's songs to change.  There are so many well-written, well-thought out songs on this album...    1. Mine- It took me a couple of listens to really get into this song, but I love it.  The lyrics are great and they go well with the music.  It's not my favorite song on the CD, however, nor is it my favorite of Taylor's singles. 4/5    2. Sparks Fly- Such a catchy song.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's the next single.  I think everyone can relate to this song at some point in time.  Perfect single material. 5/5    3. Back to December- At first listen, I was not impressed with this song.  I thought it sounded so typical and overdone.  But the more I listened, the more I realized that this is among Taylor's best.  The lyrics are so well written, they go perfectly with the music.  This song is very well penned.    4. Speak Now- I didn't like this song at all the first time I heard it.  It's still not one of my favorites, but it's grown on me.  It's cute and has snarky, clever lyrics.  4/5    5. Dear John- Wow.  This song is amazing.  It really tugs at your heart.  I admire Taylor so much for writing a song about John Mayer and being shameless about it.  Everything from the oh-so-familiar guitar wailing at the beginning to the clever words to Taylor's flawless vocal makes this song one of her best.  5/5    6. Mean- Another song that had to grow on me, but I like it now.  Reminds me of older Taylor Swift.  Catchy and funny to sing with someonein mind. 4.5/5    7. The Story of Us- Another one that was supposedly written about John Mayer.  This song is easy to relate to for anyone.  It's catchy.  Could be a single. 5/5    8. Never Grow Up- The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  The simplicity of the song is so sweet- just guitars and Taylor singing.  Cute song. 4/5    9. Enchanted- Not only is this my favorite song off the album, it's also probably my favorite Taylor song ever.  Everything about this song is perfect.  The lyrics portray and innocence we can all relate to and the music is fairytale-like.  The song is almost 6 minutes long but I enjoy every single second.  The song is just a masterpiece. 5+/5    10. Better Than Revenge- It's obvious that Taylor had Paramore's \\"Misery Business\\" in mind when writing this song- it's basically the story from the other girl's point of view.  It works so well though.  The song is catchy and clever.  I especially like at the end when Taylor sings \\"Show me how much better you are\\"- a reference to the Jonas Brother song.  5/5    11. Innocent- While I like the theme of this song, it's still taking some time to grow on me.  Another song I admire, though, just for who it's written to and what Taylor has to say to him.  4/5    12. Haunted- It's still growing on me.  I feel like the theme of \\"Haunted\\" has been overdone though- the dissonant strings, the hard guitars, and the loud vocals.  It just seems overdone.  3.5/5    13. Last Kiss- Probably the only song I ever skip.  It drones on and it's much too long for a song with so little material.  3/5    14. Long Live- Reminds me of \\"Change\\".  A song about overcoming obstacles and breaking down barriers.  It's growing on me, but it also seems overdone.  4/5
B000000OQF|5.0|When i heard this album i was 10 years old at the time it was hardest album i ever heard it blew me away the lyrics and the guitars and the bass were mind blowing i love the song its so easy and out to get me the guitars are so effin awesome on those songs i love rocket queen thats the best song on the album your so crazy is good but i like the one off of gnr lies better lets say that this album is one of my favorite albums of all time slash is one of the greatest guitarists of all time his solos are amesome i put him in my top ten of all time best guitar players and dont forget izzy stradlin hes  great too and together they make great guitar noise which is some great music

The quality is absolutely breathtaking the absolute best I've ever seen from a Chaplin restoration. I hope to god they will release all of the feature films (& maybe shorts?) on blu ray! The picture is so vivid it's as if I'm in the room with the cast. Please purchase this & please release more!!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I know that when I first heard that yet ANOTHER version of a movie about Robin Hood was coming out, I greeted that news with a yawn.  Another one?!  Even so, I made it to the theater to check it out, since I am sort of a Robin Hood fan.  I've seen earlier versions several times each, including versions starring Errol Flynn [[ASIN:B00005JKEZ The Adventures of Robin Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], Kevin Costner [[ASIN:B000092T6M Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (Two-Disc Special Extended Edition)]], Patrick Bergin [[ASIN:B0001NBMEY Robin Hood]], and even Disney's silly animated version of this tale [[ASIN:B000ICM5T4 Robin Hood (Most Wanted Edition)]].<br /><br />Of the earlier versions I definitely rank them (In order of lead actor): Bergin, Costner, Flynn, and Disney.  The version starring Bergin has been my favorite for years, even though it never had a theatrical release (it was released on TV), since it would have been going head to head with Costner's version.  I liked its setting, costuming, storyline, acting, etc.<br /><br />Now we have a new version of Robin Hood starring Crowe.  I went with rather mixed expectations, since it's a much-used tale, yet I very much enjoy Crowe ([[ASIN:B000FVQLQQ A Beautiful Mind]][[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator (Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B000ARTN3I Cinderella Man (Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B0001HLVS2 Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World (Widescreen Edition)]], etc.).  And, on the other hand, we have had a good dose of action films lately, and I wondered how this show would stack up.  You know, films like Iron Man 1&2, Prince of Persia, Inception, Avatar, Sherlock Holmes, Angels and Demons, Star Trek, etc.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I realized that I enjoyed Crowe's version of Robin Hood more than any of those other films, except maybe Star Trek!  I liked it so much that I did something I seldom do...I bought a copy of this DVD as soon as it was released.<br /><br />I thought the original storyline was an especially innovative approach to this legend.  This version actually leaves off about when most Robin Hood stories begin.  It was interesting to see where this screenwriter suggested that Robin Hood came from, as well as Little John, Will Scarlett, Allan aDayle.  I also enjoyed seeing Max VonSydow in a fatherly rather than a sinister role.  Other cast members were also fantastic, e.g., Cate Blanchett, William Hurt, Mark Strong, et al.  And Ridley Scott pulled it all off without a hitch.<br /><br />When I combined storyline, acting, sets, costumes, and so on, it was a sell!  As I mentioned earlier, I picked this up just a few days after the DVD release, and I've watched it at least four times since that time (Sept 2010).  That in itself is a testament to how impresed I've been.<br /><br />So, all in all, this movie is different that all earlier Robin Hood offerings, but its just as good in my opinion as the version starring Patrick Bergin, and far outdistances the Costner version.<br /><br />5 solid stars.

B0048PU7TC|5.0|. . . Featuring by Norah Jones      My first music review!  I was so excited to be selected by the One 2 One network to review Norah Jones latest CD . . . Featuring.  This CD spans her entire career and includes performances with The Foo Fighters, Ryan Adams and Dolly Parton - just to name a few.  I loved it!  It has a very laid back - bluesy appeal.  The kind of CD you want to slip in on a cold Sunday afternoon and sit in front of the fire with your sweetheart. I must say though, that my favorite was probably Blue Bayou followed closely by Baby, It's Cold Outside.  This would be a great stocking stuffer for the music lover in your life!    [...]
0375846735|3.0|Volume 1 was real good, volume 2 fell off drastically and volume 3 continued from volume 2. I was disappointed, to say the least. The only real reason to read the book is to find out how the story ended, to me the ending was a disappointment. I read some of the other reviews, to me there was very little need to comment on the view of religion shown, treat it solely as a writer's device for an aid to the plot and read, no need to worry about an assault on your own religious views no matter what they are. That said, more on the plot. There were all sorts of tales therein, a lot partially developed and then either ignored or just terminated, adding nothing to the story line or anything else. I never felt tht the Dust was fully explained, how the battle of the Gods started, the ending if there was one, the forbidden romance between Lyra and Will and their acceptance of the outcome. There were many other subplots occurring and left dangling, several introduced but why? What did they do for the plot?        Was the story interesting? Sadly muddled, yes, finished, probably not and, even considered done, the outcome was highly disappointing. However if you want to know an ending, you need to read the book. If you are interested in any of the subplots, you may not find the ending. All I can say is, read the book and take your chances.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|this product is wonderful the box it comes in is so cute!!! and it comes with bonus fetures that are fun for kids of all ages the bottom line is that this product is a little pricey but this is a great buy if you don't have toy story  1 or 2 or even 3.
B00002RASO|4.0|Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the package details of the product offered on this page.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.    This VHS version probably tallies closest with the version I saw streaming, as I was forced to watch it dubbed, and even though I eventually got used to the actor's voice who substituted for Franco Nero, I thought it was exremely distracting and took a great deal away from the film.  Apparently there are now new transfers, in both blu-ray and regular DVD with alternate tracks that contain Nero's own voice, which I hope to find under the tree this Christmas.  But even dubbed, this is a must see for fans of Italian Westerns, a flawed classic with crazy imperfections that just don't matter.      This film is over-the-top from the very start, with Nero walking through boot-top-high mud as the opening credits roll, dragging a coffin behind him.  If you don't have a good guess at what's really in the coffin, then you just haven't seen enough Italian westerns, at least Sergio Corbucci style.  Next, the man we eventually learn is Django interupts the attractive (what else?) Loredana Nusciak as she is falling out the frying pan of getting flogged by Mexican Bandits, and into the fire of a private army of Southern marauders who intend to burn her alive.  Rescuing her puts Django in between these two forces which are battling one another for supremacy in the area - but despite the similarity in the beginning to 'For a Few Dollars More' (released a year earlier), 'Django' departs radically from Leone's film into its own bull-in-a-china-shop brand of storytelling.          Turns out Django has a private grievance with the leader of the Southerners, Major Jackson, and a previous friendship with the self styled general of the bandits, General Rodriquez.  Together, Django and the general plot against Major Jackson, and cook up a plan to rob a ton of gold from both Jackson and the Mexican Army.  I thought it would be interesting to see if I could keep track of the body count in this film, and though I was able to score the first few scenes, my mental arithmetic petered out around 55 or so, which is well before Django and his bandit friends even assault the Federales garrison, and before the eventual, inevitable falling out between Django and the General.      All the hallmarks of the genre are here - crosses and double-crosses, high body counts and the impression that human life isn't worth spit, impossible gunplay, sneering bandits with bad teeth, quicksand, machine guns, an iconic finale, and of course the horrible, Christ-like torture of the main character before he redeems everyone's soul with hot lead.  I don't think there's really anything more one could ask for in a picture like this.      Obviously this film is going to appeal to Italian western fans, and quite possible NOT appeal to American western fans - I think there are elements within these two genres that are often diametrically opposed to one another.  Regardless, if you are not a fan of this type of film, it's doubtful that 'Django' is going to win you over.  If, however, you have enjoyed Spaghetti Westerns before but have not seen 'Django', then I highly recommend it - though I would consider watching the updated version, either in blu-ray or in the regular edition.  I thought the biggest drawback to the film was the dubbed voices, especially Nero's, and I'm excited to watch it as it was originally filmed.  But even in this dubbed, slightly washed out version, I'd still rank 'Django' on the same level as 'Duck You Sucker', and much better than 'Fistful of Dollars' and 'A Few Dollars More'.  A genre classic.

B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones' new release, \\"Featuring\\" includes such greats as Ray Charles, Foo Fighters, Outkast, and Dolly Parton. My favorites were \\"Love Me\\" (The Little Willies) - a bluesey ballad, \\"The Best Part\\" (El Madmo) - a haunting, soulful, and moody tune, \\"Here We Go Again\\" (Ray Charles) - Ray Charles, need I say more? and \\"More Than This\\" (Charlie Hunter) - a new take on the 80's favorite.    I would consider this album \\"easy listening.\\" If you are looking for something more upbeat, I wouldn't recommend it. If you would a relaxing and unique compilation CD, this would be a great choice.    Thank you to One2One Network for sending me this CD to review.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|This is the best dance movie I have ever seen. This movie is so great. It is about a girl hiphop dancer who gets into trouble and is told to go to a dance school. There she teaches the school that it is not about the steps but the passion and styal. She and some of the other students create a dance crew and compete with other crews.  This movie is not good for young children.  It has language and inapproprate context. Etherwise this is a very well made movie.
1439152780|5.0|I never write reviews but I loved this book so much I had to write one.  I spent a solid 4 hours or so reading this on a Sunday, I could barely put it down for about a week.  Morton creates such a beautiful, mysterious fairytale air in all of her books.  This book was so well written and so full of description I felt like I was inside the pages.  Morton's writing reminds me of gothic novelists of old, full of secrets, castles and beautiful, strong women.  I won't divulge the plot here because that would spoil all of the fun.  Get this book!!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Although this movie is not exactical like the book it is still a great movie.  I think they did a very good job.  This movie has enough suspence to keep you watching and waiting for what is going to happen next. I would have liked some of the sceans to be more like the book but over all it was a great movie.
B00417HV14|5.0|The performance is top notch.  This is dvd for your collection.  Joe is really a polished performer and cares about the sound of his music.  He pulls the sound out of each guitar.  A true artist.  I will see him when Joe is in my area.

B003L16FAE|5.0|I don't know what the fuss is about the quality of this Blu-Ray is about I think certain reviewers aren't fully aware of the remastering process involved in taking a movie this old recorded on analog film and mastering it into Blu-Ray format I'll explain that a bit throughout this review. I've been watching this movie since I was a kid on VHS and I've been looking at the same DVD copy of it for a long time. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray simply because it seemed pertinent to get one of my all time favorite movies in the highest possible quality and plus I needed to add something to my purchase to get free super saver shipping, ha. But anyways, this is an old movie and inherent in the type of film stock the film was made with is a bit of grain. The idea that Blu-Ray imparts digital remastering on films making them \\"perfect\\" looking images is a false one to say the least. Blu-Ray does bring out the colors allowing for a more clear and defined picture but along with that it will also cause grain to become more prevalent which is something people should be mindful of when purchasing a film this old in this particular format. Think of it this way, basically Blu-Ray raises the scale of the video your watching and with the bigger scale the the grain also gets bigger. Now there is a process to remove this grain from films such as this the grain/noise removal process is basically a filter that blurs the image slightly to make the grain go away, which is nice although heavily grained films such as this one it makes the image very, very blurry and causes a \\"soft focus\\" effect which can cause you to to miss out on more subtle things in the frame. Look to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn on Blu-Ray to see just how terrible a price you pay for a grain free picture. Personally I much prefer being to see subtle movements on actors faces over there being a bit of grain on the screen. It bugs me that people buy these things and then rail them for not being painstakingly restored frame by frame by whatever company decided to put it out. That's a very costly and time consuming process that is reserved much more popular films.<br /><br />I apologize for rambling I'll continue on to my review of the disc now. This is a great looking version of Predator the colors are as vibrant as they've ever been and I've owned this film in virtually every format since the late 80s. I'm guessing this disc was put out as part of promotion for the new \\"Predators\\" film because most of the special features originally on the two disc DVD collectors edition have been replaced by stuff featuring the the film makers from Predators but that's not such a big deal the two disc collectors edition DVD is still quite affordable and easy to find online and really it's kinda nice that they at least attempted to add something new instead of just rehashing the original release. The best bits of the original special features are included.<br /><br />The film it's self is 80's sci-fi at it's best it starts out with a space ship entering orbit and then turns into a pretty straight forward 80's military action film and towards the middle reverts back into a terrestrial sci-fi action and suvivalism film. It's really one of Schwarzenegger's best performances in that he actually appears to be threatened for once. The problem with his films is not that he's a bad actor, it's that he has this aura of invincibility due to his physique and generally cool demeanor but that all gets stripped away when he is confronted by an alien creature who is bigger, stronger and more equipped in literally every way. Arnold gets chased and beaten and brutalized by the Predator and never does the thought cross your mind, \\"awww Arnie could take that guy what a phony movie\\" for example the fight scene with Bennett in the film Commando. This film also features a great score, a wonderful premise, and an involving cast of supporting characters who all have great moments throughout the course of the film. I highlyrecommend this film to any one but the decision is up to as to your preferred format although I quite like the quality of this Blu-Ray.film to any one but the decision is up to as to your preferred format although I quite like the quality of this Blu-Ray.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Bottom Line, The Expendables is great, brainless, macho fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly but I would have loved it if Sly didn't play my man Jet Li. All of the active Expendables kick serious tail including Jet but he's the butt of numerous short jokes and especially comes off weak in two fights with Dolph Lundgren. In fact, most of the choice hand to hand battles feature Jason Statham and that's great but Sly knew Jet's fans wanted more from him. Jet broke through Hollywood's glass ceiling long ago so it's awkward seeing the killing machine from War, Fearless, The One, Fist Of Legend, Cradle To The Grave and other awesome flicks playing third banana. Other than that, Schwarzenegger and Willis appear in cool cameos, Rourke adds another notch to his comeback belt, Terry Crews gets the ball and runs with it, Randy Couture and Steve Austin give us a bout that neither The WWE or UFC could make happen, and even Gary Daniels gets to flex some Martial Arts muscle. Oh, and Eric Roberts is in it too. So, overall The Expendables is a good time in the tradition of The Dirty Dozen, Force 10 From Navarone, The Delta Force, Commando, and Stallone's Rambo epics with lots of explosions, gunplay, MMA action, and some of the toughest cats in film history. It's definitely worth owning if you're a true action fan. Just make sure you have a good Jet Li disc nearby if you really want to see him shine.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|The saying goes \\"You'll always remember your first Doctor\\".<br />Matt Smith is not my first Doctor but is steadily becoming one of my favorites.  He is quirky, fun, brilliant, mad, lovable, just everything a Doctor should be. I see glimpses of almost all of the previous Doctors:<br />-Hartnell's ability to lure his companions on in The Eleventh Hour. \\"Just 20 minutes. Believe for just 20 minutes...\\".<br />-Eccleston's fiery temper at the Ironsides in Victory of the Dalek's. \\"YOU - ARE - MY - ENEMY -- and I am yours....\\".<br />-Tom Baker's lunatic method of problem solving is sprinkled through out but best seen by building a contraption in The Lodger. (a big helping of Davison in that episode as well).<br />But Smith forges his own personality around those brief flashes to the past. He really is some how young at heart but impossibly old.<br /><br />What is even more impressive is the brilliant companion Karen Gillian portrays. They have as much chemistry as Tennant and Piper without falling into the heart wrenching love spiral that had to end badly. It feels like the Doctor has learned from the regeneration and grown a bit older/younger instead of just being - well here you go new actor/new Doctor.<br /><br />request for the BBC - a really good multiple Doctor story. would love to see Smith acting with any of the previous incarnations be it from new or old series.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|In CHANGELING, director/producer Clint Eastwood has proven yet again what he has emphasized in nearly all of his films as a director or actor: that the human spirit can be bent but need not be broken.  Eastwood has taken a true to life story of a boy's kidnapping and from that (which is certainly horrifying enough) adds a lifting of the rock examination of the underside of a corrupt LA police force in 1928.  This mixture of the boy's abduction added to the sleazy side of real world police corruption forms two sides of a damning socio-political triangle that has an entrenched male chauvinism as the prickly third side.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is a single mother trying  to raise her son and is doing a creditable job.  She works as a phone company supervisor and is told by her boss that women are rarely trusted with such a position but he likes her spirit and wants her to be promoted to manager.  She stays late at work and returns home to find her son missing.  The police are less than helpful.  Rather, it is the media, led by an evangelist (John Malkovich) who try to find him even if it means exposing the cesspool that is the LAPD.  After six months, the LAPD locate him and return him to his mother amidst great fanfare.  The problem is that she declares that the boy is not hers.  The police chief insists that she is wrong.  Even after the boy's dentist and teacher back up her claim, the police chief is adamant.  What we soon learn about this chief of police is that he is corrupt to his shoelaces and wants only to close this case that Jolie insists remain open.<br /><br />The viewer sees the underside of a society that is more interested in maintaining the profitable status quo than in achieving true justice.  An equally corrupt police captain illegally declares the mother mentally ill and consigns her to a mental institution where she quickly learns the Rules of the Game: do as you're told and do not complain.  There are several scenes of brutish treatment of female inmates by matrons who are early versions of Nurse Ratchet from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.  Even after the police locate the boy's abductor and find a mass burial ground of his victims, both the police chief and captain insist that they were merely following standard operating procedures.  The climax occurs when the mother confronts her son's abductor in prison and grabs him, shouting: \\"Did you kill my son?\\"  Several reviewers have objected to what seems like a rather lengthy denouement, which concludes with the trial, the execution of the condemned, and the playing out of the details concerning whether her boy yet lives. But this I think is precisely Eastwood's point.  Far too often, justice is a messy affair and only in Perry Mason type dramas is the loose ending so neatly tied up.  Too often, as in CHANGELING, are human feelings bashed and crushed by a society that is either uncaring or criminal.  Yet, Eastwood goes to great pains to show that even in a mother's worst nightmare, there are good people like the reverend and a kindly female inmate, both of whom risk their lives to help.  Sometimes, a messy or overdue ending is needed to show that.atrons who are early versions of Nurse Ratchet from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.

I wasn't a big fan of the hip hop/rap side of Rock but I had seen him with Hank Williams and loved what they done together. I loved his voice at that moment. I've been waiting for something like this album to come along and I am not disappointed. I think this album will just draw more fans to him and I am looking forward to seeing more music such as this from this artist. This one is a winner in my book and I'm about to go purchase it!!
B001VNB54A|4.0|War is unforgiving. We see nobility and horrors in a mixed display that demonstrates what makes us unique but also how compassionate we can be as well as unmoored from our own morality some of us can become if the circumstances are forced upon us. Both are on display in \\"The Pacific\\" a companion piece to the exceptional \\"Band of Brothers\\". \\"The Pacific\\" gives us the perspective of the average Marine fighting in the Pacific theater during World War II. My father served in the Pacific on Tinian island towards the end of his service in the military but prior to that had fought in some truly difficult areas in the Pacific and while he was reluctant to share much from his days fighting the Japanese, his stories are well reflected in \\"The Pacific\\" a terrific mini-series that aired on HBO and was produced by Tom Hanks (like its predecessor \\"Band of Brothers\\") and Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Many other reviews have suggested that this mini-series is anti-American because it focuses on atrocities committed by U.S. Marines during the World War II; I couldn't disagree more. The focus of this film ISN'T on the Japanese side and, yes, it's pretty well known that they committed horrible atrocities during WWII (and before)including but the Rape of Nanking, medical experiments conducted on other Asian peoples (such as giving plague contaminated food to villages and then dissecting their victims while still alive after; drenching people with water in freezing temperatures to discover whether or not the effects of frost bite could be reversed, etc.)and considered anyone who wasn't Japanese to be inferior instead it focuses on our side and what we did both good and bad during the war. \\"The Pacific\\" let's us peak through the crack and see some of what happened including what veterans faced during and after battle.<br /><br />I rented the DVD prior to buying the Blu-ray and while the DVD looks quite good some of the night scenes are a bit murky and indistinct so, if you have a Blu-ray player, I'd suggest going with the sharper, clearer and more vibrant looking Blu-ray set. It's more expensive but the action is more distinct and image clarity is remarkably good. Audio is outstanding throughout the series with a nice active presentation in the surround speakers.<br /><br />Producers Tom Hanks and Steve Spielberg insured that the show based on a pair of books by two former soldiers Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie who served in the Pacific was as accurate as possible consulting with experts on World War II. There has been some debate about the atrocities shown where some U.S. soldiers committed (taking the gold fillings out of a deceased Japanese soldiers mouth for example)and while no atrocity is excusable (and the Japanese military committed their fair share of them as well)but every war is filled with stories of nobility, courage and compassion just as it is filled with horror stories. \\"The Pacific\\" gives us a balanced view in an environment where killing and surviving are the two most important things without white washing history or making one side look more savage than the other. Keep in mind though that this is the story of OUR troops not the Japanese so the focus is as it should be on what we did both good and bad.<br /><br />The extras include the following: timeline for events, two Blu-ray-exclusive interactive companion features across all 10 parts: Enhanced Viewing, Field Guide Profiles of The Pacific: Delve into the lives of the real Marines featured in The Pacific.<br /><br />We also get \\"Making The Pacific\\" which take us behind the scenes and take an inside look at the making of the miniseries and \\"Anatomy of the Pacific War\\": allowing us to explore the historical influences and cultural perceptions that led to the merciless brutality in the Pacific theater of World War II.<br /><br />I would have liked to have production commentary tracks from the actors, writers, directors, producers as well as commentary tracks from military/historyadvisors to give us perspective but that is a small complaint for such an exceptional series.<br /><br />Keep in mind that \\"The Pacific\\" isn't \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" or any of the \\"big\\" Hollywood World War II films that were popular in the 50's and 60's--\\"The Pacific\\" focuses on the common soldiers, their experience, the sense of brotherhood fighting under horrible conditions, the good, bad and the ugly of battle. This smaller, more intimate presentation allows the producers to focus on the characters not the events and that's all to the good. Highly recommended.small complaint for such an exceptional series.

B000A6EXNO|5.0|I've tried this eye cup over 10years ago, and I've never gone back to not having one on my SLR, or DSLR.<br />It's designed to cut stray light from becoming a distraction while shooting.<br />With DK-19 it there is no more glares on the view finder.<br /><br />The only down side is that it can fog up easily in cold weather, or if you're sweating heavily. The solution is to rub a little anti fog agent, or you can buy the pre-treated eye piece glass: DK-17A from Nikon.<br /><br />User tip: Make sure it's tighten well. Otherwise the rubber eye cup and act as an extra leverage, which can loosen up over time. This results in loss of the glass eye piece along with the eye cup.<br /><br />It fits most full frames with round view finder glass piece such as:<br />Nikon F4, D700, D800, Df, D2x, D2Xs, D2H, D3, D3s, D3x, D4.<br />Except for D600 & D610, which uses square eye cups.
B00447G2MK|3.0|If, like me, you were expecting something completely new from pop-rock giants A Day to Remember, then this isn't the album for you. With Treason and Homesick, they had their own sound that wasn't easy to duplicate. On this album however, they went with the money and produced the typical pop-rock songs you hear on the radio. While I admit there are a few heavy songs on here ex: Sticks and Bricks, 2nd Sucks, You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic, it just isn't enough to satiate the usual ADTR fan's cravings. This was honestly one of my most anticipated albums, and it completely fell short of my expectations. So if you've been a ADTR fan since the Treason days, I wouldn't recommend this at all. But if you're one of those people that likes the usual pop-rock sound, then this is for you.

B000056VJ7|5.0|I'm gonna keep it kinda short - since I think that whatever needs to be said about this album - has already been said by more than 20m record buyers all over the world. I just wanna concentrate on one part of the title song - one that doesn't get mentioned as much as it should be - and that is Todd Rundgren's guitar solos.    Every note is inspired, and I think the solos - especially the motorcycle solo at 6.44 - is probably the best guitar solo in the context of a rock song. Don't get me wrong - I think great of the solos in Hotel California, or Comfortably Numb etc.     But a great solo is one, which in my opinion, can't be repeated again. Ever. Not in any lifetime. And no live performance of Bat Out of Hell after the recording has ever captured the essence of what Todd did in the original solo.     The way that it builds up in intensity and purpose - all contributes to the monumental effect of the song, and act as a great spoiler to Meatloaf's tenor vocal. Do you realize that the guitar sounds like a violin, and not like how a typical 70s rock guitar does?     Greatness can sometimes be emulated, but never repeated.    Todd Rundgren achieved a thing of greatness in Bat Out of Hell.     And my life was never the same after that.
1615890122|5.0|Clearly I don't have to really review the content of the book. This book is a classic timeless piece with priceless information and knowledge, and anyone thinking of buying it just go ahead and buy it!...........Just not from this publisher. I know that its not about the actual book, its about the contents and what you take from it, but this version from Megalodon Entertainment? Is a little sloppy to say the least. Call me old-fashioned, but if I pay for something that is categorized as \\"new\\", I expect it to be professional! Plus I also like my books to be of good quality. The main thing that bothered me about this printing was in part 9 when the font size gets obviously larger than the rest of the book and then in part 10 it goes back to normal size. Look if you really want to buy this book and keep it for your collection to pass down to friends and loved ones...please buy a hardcover from a quality publisher. It might be a little more expensive but as the saying goes, \\"you get what you pay for.\\"
B0042JTDXK|2.0|This album is a total letdown. I wouldn't consider myself a fan since I only have a few of his CD's. Anyway, this album is extremely difficult to sit through. He definitely is trying to expand his horizon by trying to sing notes that are outside his range. Boyz, it backfires badly. It's just so painful to hear.  Trying to sit through the entire album is like being in a room with a shreaking nine year old throwing a tantrum. Really can't see the \\"illuminations\\" anywhere.  Hope he does better next time.

B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah has an amazing voice - so unique and captivating.  Whatever she sings is bound to sound great based on the quality of her voice alone, but given the right song and collaborating singer, she is able to produce even more amazing, listenable music.  Most of the songs on this album are familiar and recognizable, yet Norah adds a layer of sensuality and creativity to each.  I preferred those that echoed her natural sound over those that were out of her normal genre, and many of the songs that had more of a country twist or twang were among my favorites - \\"Bull Rider\\" with Sasha Dobson and \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton.  Less appealing to me were songs where she shared equal voice time with the featured artists, such as \\"Virginia Moon\\" with the Foo Fighters.  And I had high hopes for something really cool to come out of collaborating with Outkast, and \\"Take Off Your Cool\\" was a disappointment.  The great beat of \\"Life Is Better\\" with Q-Tip was a pleasant surprise and reminded me a little of a Groove Theory sound.  Maybe I am just a Norah purist, but it is her voice alone that makes each and every song for me.
B00428ZRFY|5.0|This CD is amazing. I'm talking Grammy material people! Every song is super powerful and the dvd is totally worth it.

Nicki Minaj, \\"Man Down\\", and \\"Love The Way You Lie PartII\\". The last one is a really good part 2 for a classic song.<br />Congratulations for RiRi!
0446195529|4.0|Overall, a good read and right there with rest of the Camel Club tales. The introduction of a British agent was a nice touch except for the strained attempt at making her \\"sound English,\\" using an overabundance of clichéd terms that probably wouldn't enter into a normal British conversation so frequently. Still, it is a good tale even with that minor annoyance.
B0041V1R7O|5.0|Where others may look backwards and sideways for inspiration, putting new spins on old sounds and ideas, Cave forges straight ahead and pulls from within, creating something wholly original, inimitable, and downright great.  Like Bob Dylan and Tom Waits, Cave is unceasingly making new, intensely forward-looking, insistently vibrant, non-derivative, unapologetic art.  Stasis, for him, is death.  To simply pat the Grinderman albums on the back as another aging artist's war-cry against the encroachment of old age or the impending loss of virility, is to sorely miss the point.  This latest iteration of Cave's work is a repudiation and total vanquishing of the artistic staleness and myriad conventions -- whether of the \\"alternative\\" or \\"retro\\" varieties -- that sadly plague most contemporary music.  It soars.
B00065GX64|2.0|I know my comments will provoke the ire of movie fans who hold this movie in high regard, but I can't remain silent about a movie that fails to deliver in the end, especially after all the exaggerated reviews I've read concerning its place in film history. What's more, from what I could see, most of \\"M\\" is bogged down by excessive talk that doesn't propel the story forward. In fact, these moments of verbiage make the movie less engaging. Case in point, in one scene, you have the chief of police on the phone talking to his superior about what's being done to capture the killer. I think 10 minutes or more elapsed before the next scene even appeared. Why Lang decided to cover the minutiae of the investigation is beyond me. It just wasn't necessary, especially when a superficial account would have sufficed.<br /><br />Also, Lang took so much away from Lorre's character just to focus the film on the volk, in terms of their fears, helplessness, and anger over the situation they'd been thrown into. Instead, he should have redirected his efforts on Lorre so we, the viewer, could understand what twisted forces compelled \\"Hans Beckert\\" to kill little girls.<br /><br />I'm sorry but the accolades are undeserved, except for Lorre's acting which was top notch in my opinion. And another thing I'd like to point out, just because Criterion releases a film they deem is deserving of their Rolls-Royce treatment doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a winner.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|First off, apologies for the terrible title. Now, about the game. Steve Jackson is a game designer with a lot of fun games to his credit and Zombie Dice is definitely among the good ones. The object is simple, throw the dice, which represent humans, and try to get as many brains as you can. Each side and color (red, yellow and green, from hardest to easiest) have a different combination of brains (points), feet (throw again) and shotgun blasts (get 3 and no points for you!). You have to throw 3 dice to score points and can bank your points anytime before deciding to throw. The first to 13 points wins.<br /><br />I played Zombie Dice with 6 friends to decide turn order in another board game and we had almost as much fun as with the other game itself! It's great for non-gamers because they get it and connects them to their inner gambler I think. Check it out for a quick, easy and fun game to get into.

Her reading was so animated that she got a big applause and a prize.  She was absolutely mesmerized by the story in the book.  So, it was only natural that I would get her the video/movie.  When it arrived in the mail she called me to thank me profusely.  She called me again after she viewed it.  She was ecstatic.  Except for a few parts in the film that didn't follow the book (needless to say she was looking for each detail - as kids do), she totally loved it.  The fantasy of the story was carried out beautifully in the video.  The quality of the DVD was perfect.  Delivery was timely.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Walking out of the screeing, one of my friends remarked that he hated this Harry Potter film, stating it is the \\"worst\\" in the series. I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Pt. 1 is just buildup.<br /><br />If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticize anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.<br /><br />Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron.  In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine.<br />The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.<br /><br />The deathly Hollows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.oes not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.

0553277472|1.0|11/20/10 Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance   I've heard of this title and found it in the biography section of our library.  The rave reviews encouraged me to read it.  The story is of a man and his son who set out on a motorcycle trip across the upper West and Northwest eventually coming down the coast to California.  The man is schizophrenic and interspersed with the travelogue are musings of his other personality (Phaedrus) on everything from motorcycle maintenance to Greek philosophy.   Chris, his son, has problems of his own - mostly in dealing with the terrifying illness of his father.  As the book progresses that travelogue sections grow shorter and long ramblings on philosophy and meaning-of-life take over.    I found myself identifying with the son Chris throughout the book.  It was a long joyless ride.  I found myself slightly depressed everytime I read a portion.  I was glad when I finished.  I almost quit a few times but wanted to push through to the end.  If this is Zen philosophy I want nothing to do with it. \\"the road became so dark I have to turn on my headlight now to follow it through these mists and rains.\\" (pg 491)
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This in my opinion is the best cinema version of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol to date.  The story stays very close the original version and really brings brings it to life with the 3d motion capture.  The ghosts are superb, the acting is top notch and Jim Carrey makes a great scrooge.  I went into this movie thinking I would hate it but I was thankfully dead wrong, I left knowing I was going to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out, it is an instant holiday classic for me.  I watched the blu ray  the other night and it looked great, now I want to get a 3D tv so I can check out the 3d version of the movie.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|I have been waiting for Pink to come out with a greatest hits and this one is awesome! It has all the favorites and then some! It will be nice to have them all in one place instead of waiting on you tube to load them all individually. And I can burn them to a CD and play them in my car. It costs just as much as buying the CD in the store, only I dont have to pay the gas money to get there and I can get it instantly!
B000001E7V|5.0|It is an exemplary! In fact, it is an absolutely fascinating album but for those who have deeper imagination.º   The more I  listen to Tricky¡¦s compilations, the more ¡§dark¡¨ corners I discover. His poetry as mysterious as this new style in music. A must have album in one¡¦s library.  Now, I own every single Tricky¡¦s album, thanks to Maxinquaye!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I have never written a review after having been an Amazon customer for over 8 years now at least, however, after seeing the dreadful amount of reviews for the movie, I had to make sure I gave it a 5 star review.  I consider myself a \\"Christmas Carol\\" movie buff (of my own making of course), and this version is so close to perfect that it deserves the highest of all reviews.  For those who say that this was meant to be an uplifting story and is too 'scary', I suppose you have never taken the time to read the book.  It is a story of redemption, and of turning a miserable miser into a completely uplifted new man.  A man that was given a second chance at life...and I am sorry, but it would have sickened me to see them portray this otherwise.  In order for man to change, they must see their wrongs and the repercussions that will happen if life is continued being lived without care of others, and this is exactly what Dicken's was portraying, and what the movie came across as. To see it all 'fluffed' up and 'Disney'd' up would just be ridiculing what Dicken's was trying to prove.  I personally love the version with George C. Scott, as well as the classic with Alastair Sim, but when I saw this first last year, I knew that there was a new classic.  All the parts, minor as they may be, that have been left out of previous versions were included, and I thought that this movie hit the book to the 't' and am so glad to have this movie to pass down to others, to show what the book was truly supposed to be like when coming to life in Hollywood.  For those who feel it is too scary, I suggest you show your children Sesame Street or something of the like, because I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but guess what?  Life is not always good, sometimes it can be downright harsh....and this movie put to life what happens when a man who has been a terrible person both inside his heart and out gets a chance at redemption...a second chance to live, and if this is not something your children may understand at their young age, then you may want to just put this on the shelf for a few more years until they realize that life is not full of marshmallows and happiness 24 hours a day....otherwise, sit down and enjoy the movie of a lifetime!may understand at their young age, then you may want to just put this on the shelf for a few more years until they realize that life is not full of marshmallows and happiness 24 hours a day....otherwise, sit down and enjoy the movie of a lifetime!
0307473465|4.0|One gets weary of WW2 novels but this was clever. Young man meets an older lady and has a relationship that becomes part of his life and hers. Fast forward and back and the tale is complete. She is constant through their relationship. He waffles and stays close. His connection keeps him from developing as an adult male. She completes her journey through life. The main concern is that his voice never changes much as he grows older. She stays consistant.
B001H9MYPW|3.0|I did not like the people who played the characters in this season.  Diane Wiest was exceptional as usual.  Disk 4 in my series wouldn't play and when I realized this my time with amazon to exchange for another copy had run out.  I could have purchased it at my local Sams Club for less money and not waited a week to get it and they would have exchanged it no with no problem or hassle.  So I am done buying from amazon I got screwed on the last two transactions with them.
B000001FTS|3.0|While im a child of the 80s and now 40 i remember this album well- in fact i remember it as well as any album from my teenage years! Sometimes when nostalgia hits me ill play this to pass the time. Some of the songs are great- particulary the opening track which has almost a jazz feel- albeit with an electronic underpinning and the closing track which has a soundtrack vibe to it and sounds open sonically and progressive in nature! But the next four(tracks 2-3-4-5) are dreadfully shown to be bogged down by bad 80s production and a rigidness that even germans would say is to uptight. And alot of the digital synths are annoying and frozen in time and the beat is clockwork but without any real groove. (I love electronic music especially vintage analog 70s stuff like tangerine dream klaus schulze and some of the 90s triphop stuff ala portishead- unkle etc). In my opinion the mid 80s were the worst for production and sound and Propaganda while trying to be cutting edge come across as dated. However the album ends strongly and the main songwriters can write some offkilter pop and theres an artfilm approach to the lyrics etc that make it more than throwaway 80s electronic pop ala very early OMD. Both Freytag and Brucken have interesting voices and i do love their spoken word and poetry bits that are scattered among the breaks and choruses. In fact its the underlying weirdness that makes this atleast a neccessary part of your itunes or cd collection- just be prepared to burn or listen to only half of it.
044654759X|5.0|I have read so many different reviews  from other readers of this book  all the way from litterly hating the book  to high praise for it. My self I could not put the book down. Sure it made have been predictible but then so are many other books one may read. The suspense in the book was not knowing that he was going to find his wife , because we knew he would  but it was  when!! It would be hard to say which one of Nicholas Sparks books are my favorite but I have to say this one tops up there with The Guardian which tops as one of my favorites .<br /><br />I gave the book 5 stars because I felt it was deserving. If an author writes the same story line over and over  in their books one finally becomes tired of their style of writing and I have  gave up on several authors for that reason. I knew if I read one they would all be the same. I like a little diversity in my books and feel like Mr. Sparks has done that in his book Safe Haven.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I would agree with the reviewer who said something to the effect that this was a fitting conclusion to a great trilogy.  I am very sad, because it is the end of a wonderful series, which seemed to get better as they went along, although in the long run, I think that the second book was the best of the three.  I wonder what Mr. Larsson has in mind at the time of his death, and what was going to happen to his intriguing characters.  I tell everyone that they simply HAVE to read the three books.  You will not be disappointed.
006091307X|5.0|What does a reader encounter in a Thomas Pynchon novel? Well, there's an offering of mock, but real-sounding, science and history; an assortment of cartoonish characters who, nonetheless, face moving existential questions and emotional issues; wonderful flights of the intellect that are both larky and profound; amazing writing featuring both strange associations and great insight; and a playful voice examining a troubled world of serendipitous connections. In the fast-moving THE CRYING OF LOT 49, a reader encounters all of these Pynchonesque elements, this time used by the Pynch to tell the story of young Oedipa Mass as she tries to determine whether Tristero, an alternate mail system appealing to society's outcasts and Ayn Rand-thinking engineers, is a rich man's hoax or a real service with deadly methods.<br /><br />In TCoL49, Pynchon moves Oedipa through what is basically a fascinating and highly imaginative mystery set in California in the 1960s. This mystery concludes brilliantly in the novel's final chapter, where the crying of lot 49 (they're a selection of stamps at an auction) occurs. But along the way, there are many highpoints, which for me include: a performance of \\"The Courier's Tragedy\\", a hilarious parody of a Jacobean revenge play; the amusing Hollywood-like conjecture of the academic Emory Bortz; Oedipa's wandering and disturbing encounters with the muted horn; and the elusive metaphor of Maxwell's Demon, a perpetual motion machine that operates, in theory, like a philosophical system developed by the Scurvhamites, who have historical connection to Tristero.<br /><br />This is actually my second reading of TCoL49 and my second time through my paperback edition, which has a March 1972 printing date ($.95). Since my copy has yellowed pages and a dry spine, I thought: Why not download a copy to my Kindle? That way, I can have a fresh copy but preserve space on my crowded bookshelves. But nope: TCoL49 is not available on Kindle. Harper (or whoever), please fix.<br /><br />TCoL49 is a truly enjoyable book with a voice that is funny and still completely fresh. Highly recommended.TCoL49 is a truly enjoyable book with a voice that is funny and still completely fresh. Highly recommended.
B00003CWL6|5.0|If I had to name one american movie that is an example of great cinema done during the nineties, one movie that manages to stand out from the lot, both artistically and thematically, and which deserves all its awards, it should be American Beauty.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />First of all because Alan Ball, who became more respected with this movie, with Six Feet Under and True Blood, forces us to take a closer look to what we take for granted, to see how one family, the Burnhams, really looks like inside its house, behind its curtains and perfect roses, how the wonderful suburban dream is one big lie. Just like Desperate Housewives, which was heavily influenced by this movie, Lester Burnham, who died under strange circumstances, make us witness how his family's interactions with new friends and neighbors make them do things they never did before, things that bring forth a tragedy.<br /><br />Secondly, Sam Mendes, with his gorgeous directing, show us the Burnhams lives in a very touching and comic fashion. He creates a dramedy so powerful that even its most funniest scenes, especially in the Burnham dining room, are also the most dramatic. This mix of comedy and drama may not please everyone, will shock and outrage some people, but it adds layers to this drama, which is also a powerful satire on the american dream. Not only that, Sam Mendes gives a more interesting ending. Instead of following the original script, which had trial scenes, tv news, and a big epilogue with a ghostly Lester Burnham flying over his neighborhood, Mendes ends \\"American Beauty\\" on a cliffhanger and encourages us to think of what we watched, to wonder how a family and a neighborhood will live on after what happened to one of them.<br /><br />Thirdly, Thomas Newman's soundtrack gives a mysterious and eerie atmosphere to the lives of the Burnhams. Scenes that would seem banal under the hands of a different composer, and director, become touching and incredibly moving, especially one involving a plastic bag floating under the wind.<br /><br />Finally, all the actors give wonderful interpretations to their characters, performances that stay in the viewer's memories. All the actors manage to turn their characters into real people, people who we may try to defend their actions, even when they are not the most honorable.<br /><br />In the end, it is such a powerful movie that everyone, whether they like it or not, should see once in their life. Not only to see a great story, but also to take a closer look towards what we may not have looked at in the first place.ind.

B002EC3932|5.0|I expected a departure from the normal small group piano performance. And, yes, it is a different piano interpretation. Iyer maintains a high level of interest and expresses thoroughly different ideas.
B0048PU7TC|4.0|Being a fan of Norah Jones, when I was given the opportunity to review this album before it hit the stores as a member of One2One Network, I was pretty excited.    When I received it, I immediately tucked into the packaging, popped it into my computer and imported the songs to my iPod.     I didn't want to get any ideas about the album before I received it, and just knew the basics: Norah Jones, collaborative songs.    I was disappointed when I realized all the songs sounded familiar, they've all been released before and there is no original music on the album, BUT, that didn't stop me from bobbing my head along with \\"Life Is Better\\" and \\"Take Off Your Cool\\".     The album is good, Norah Jones sounds great, as per usual. There was no real reach in this album, while the artists are as different as they come, there is no versatility in Norah Jones' performance, but it does showcase some of the collaborative artists' versatility for sure. \\"More Than This\\" is definitely a favorite of mine, along with the two I mentioned above. I didn't like ALL of the tracks, I found \\"Blue Bayou\\" to be pretty flat, and I've never liked any version of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" so that's certainly on my list of dislikes.     I would not have bought the album for myself, personally. But I'm thankful for the opportunity to review it, and look forward to listening to it occasionally, especially with the cold weather coming through. I could warm up with a few songs from this album on a frosty day.
0786956291|5.0|I got this to introduce my son and neighborhood boys to the game, ages 8 - 12. It served it's purpose perfectly. At first I didn't like it because I am a seasoned player and this is simplistic.     But after having it for a while, and having the boys beg me to play, until now we are finally through the encounters and they are eager for more, I realize that simplicity was key to grabbing their attention, and saving me money. This box was not really designed for ME, it was designed for new players.     I wanted to be sure they were really going to want to play this game before shelling out lots of money for minis and tiles. The box comes with (very) simplified player handbook, an adventure to get them to level 2, map, one set of dice, player and monster tokens, and 4 pre-gen character, Cleric, Rogue, Fighter,Wizard.     The adventure story is great. The kids loved it, especially that they got to talk to, and defeat, a Dragon. The map, dice, and tokens are adequate. The pre-gen characters I hated, and ended up printing my own from Character Builder, but I'm sure they would be fine for new players to use.    If you have never played the game, or you are DM'ing for a new group of plyers and you don't have tiles and minis, this is a great way to start, to see if they will want to continue. At which point, yes, you are going to have to start spending some money.     If you are already SURE that your group wants to play D&D, and you DON'T need to test the waters, just buy the Essentials Players Handbooks, the DM kit, and the Monster Vault kit. There is a token for every monster in the Monster Vault kit, its great!    I also found the Dungeon Master box kit very helpful, and the Monster Vault kit. Now I can still avoid shelling out big bucks for minis! Though I will have to buy tiles.     Also, you can download free Campaign Adventures from D&D Insider, which is also where the indispensable Character Builder can be found.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|No other actress in the history of movies depicted class like Miss Hepburn.  She was a beautiful person INSIDE and OUTSIDE.  Today's actors should look at this lady as the example to follow.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Great album and very listenable the whole way through.  I felt this album really rocked it and has been the first album in a long time where it didn't feel forced or had throwaways.   This is also a record that was constantly a staple for my car for over a year where as the last 2 albums I listened two maybe for a month or two and then shelved them.     Love the energy of the first 4 songs right out of the gate.  Those along with the more mellow tracks like Just Breathe / The End with anthemic songs such as Amongst the Waves and Unknown Thought are terrific.
0132350882|4.0|Without a doubt, it's a great book to all people who love to program and know to apreciate a well coded software.  I can say this is a must have book to all computer science students, and an appropriate complement to Martin Fowler's \\"Refactoring\\" book.    By the way, at the same time this can be a good complement to \\"Refactoring\\" book, maybe it doesn't bring to too more new information.  The heuristics and tips to code are a common sense list of practices that are, at the last level, based on practices to fight bad smells in code.    So, if you already read \\"Refactoring\\" and you would like to get deeper in how to create good and maintanable software, or if you are looking for more reference material about that, this book is definitely for you.
B0043A0PXU|1.0|I pre-ordered this album before the audio clips were posted.  I wish I had waited as I would have heard how really bad this album is.  I love Annie, but she really screeches these out as if she were on-stage with no microphone.  She doesn't seem comfortable singing this kind of music and rushes through them with no real connection to the material.  For die-hard Annie fans only!
B0000CABBW|5.0|I love this movie. It sends a good message about girl power. I don't believe in leaving spoilers, so this review will be very short. I had watched this on television several years ago and fell in love with it. I had a problem finding it in stores. I was so happy to find it on this site. I consider this dvd a beloved classic. It's perfect if you're having a bad day. It is perfect for ages 12 and up. Besides, you may just learn a thing or two about New Zealand's culture.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This album is a wonderful addition to the body of work produced by this artist. It is nice to have her return to the Celtic roots that have inspired her in the past. Very nice renditions of some classic Celtic Folk music. A must have for anyone who loves Loreena McKennitt's music.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|First, let me say that I really like Josh Groban. And I wanted to like his CD.  His voice truly is amazing and much of his previous material resonates with me (e.g.\\"February Song\\" is a particular favorite). Plus, he seems like a great guy.  That said, this new CD is quite disappointing.  I'm all in favor of a more \\"organic\\" style for this artist, but in order to utilize this style successfully requires strong lyrics and melodies.  Painfully few songs on \\"Illuminations\\" can claim this.  Surely Josh Groban and Dan Wilson are capable of less shallow words -- When you read these without the music, they sound laughable -- and better melodies.  I see why the decision was made to release \\"Hidden Away\\" and \\"Higher Window\\" early, as these are the only memorable melodies of the bunch.  The piano prelude with no vocals( that Josh came up with when he was 12!!), much to my surprise, may be my favorite song on the entire CD.      Even if you've been a big fan of Josh Groban in the past, I urge potential buyers to listen to this CD before taking the plunge to buy. I suspect that only the most diehard fans (and there are many) will want to add this album to their collection.
B00061QJZI|4.0|I finally got to see this Will Ferrell vehicle.  Parts of the film were just hilarious, parts not so much, some gross (well, more than some, but we're talking Will Ferrel here), and some tender and romantic (just kidding!).<br /><br />With over 400 reviews here, I'm not going to re-state the plot or comment on much other than my over-all reaction to the film.  First of all, if you're a Ferrell fan, this is a must-see.  Even if you're not, it's worth the price of admission.  Ferrell is his typical over-grown teenager (again) in Anchorman.  He plays a man-child who is vain, dumb, clueless, awkward, and somewhat sentimental.  He loves his dog, his own mug, his friends, and not much else.<br /><br />There are fights, sing-alongs, dog punting, dog survival, bikers, women-libbers, homoeroticism, cute girls, sterile apartments, teleprompters, and a zoo.<br /><br />Mildly recommended.  If the film were edited down a bit to get rid of some of the more stupid scenes (arms getting ripped off, a wild melee between news crews), this would be a better film.  Ferrell is terrifically talented, but only in a set way.  One can compare Ferrell with another SNL alumnus, Bill Murray.  Murray shows range in films such as 'The Razor's Edge' and 'Lost in Translation'.  One cannot imagine Ferrell pulling off either of those films.<br /><br />Three-and-a-half stars for 'Anchorman'.
1439133948|4.0|It is a very involving story, though, sadly, not much showing about Barryar, even if both Vorkosigan siblings make an appearance.
B003RUZKC8|5.0|If you are looking for a movie with lots of action, this is it.  Or, you could read the reviews of the wannabe critics and base your decision on those.  I recommend ignoring the long-winded garbage that people write.  This is movie is way worth watching, period.
B003VB5D84|1.0|Unlike the other \\"Guitar Festival DVD's, this one did not show enough close-ups of the guitar playing. I really enjoy watching the lead player. For example, John Mayer is a real pleasure to watch what he can do with his guitar, on this DVD, forget it. You see him play a bit, then it goes to another view of his band. So, in my opinion, just not enough guitar. After all, this is the 'Crossroads GUITAR Festival' !!!
031603973X|5.0|This is such a fantastic book.  I can't believe the amount of detail that is in this pop up book.  The art really enhances the story.  The original story is contained in small booklets pocketed on each fold out.  This would be perfect to read out loud, covering one section each night leading up to Christmas.  I think this would capture the attention of even the most jaded child or adult.  This is the first book by Chuck Fischer that I have ever seen, but it won't be my last.
006176759X|3.0|This book is alright, it didn't really grip me the way The Hills did. It seems like it was written for a pre-teen audience (I'm in my late 20's) Also, it seems like the author didn't really develop her characters ahead of time. Like, there are certain things that happen throughout the book where it seems out of character for the person who said/did it. Also, you're over a hundred pages in before the story really starts. You realize that during the first hundred-something pages, nothing really had happened. I bought these books as a set of 3, hopefully the next 2 will be more interesting.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Fantastic action and photography with a sense of realism.  The story line keeps your interested and leaves you wanting to know more.  Lots of nudity, but not just for the sake of nudity, it is there as it mostly likely was in those times.   Well worth the money and time to watch, but only for adult eyes and ears.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Not a big huge paragraph, but just chiming in to say I'm glad I bought them.  Accurate and capable, lasted a tour in Iraq no problem and it's what I see all of the TV and movie sound guys using.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I received these headphones as an early Christmas present from my girlfriend, and they have completely fulfilled my expectations. I read countless reviews on a wide variety of websites, and I have to say, everything I read was true. They are so comfortable, that I sometimes forget that I'm wearing them. The sound quality is perfect, and it isn't overpowering. I was worried that the 9 foot cord was going to be unmanageably long, but it's the perfect size for every day use. I would recommend these headphones to anyone, you will not be disappointed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This one will make even the hardest heart melt. If you have even the smallest bit of love in your heart for a dog, past or present, tears will fill your eyes and a lump will form in your throat when you watch this movie. Based on a true story, this tale ( no pun intended) epitomizes everything you've ever been taught about the love, loyalty and bond that exists between a man and his dog. Stories like this one, Greyfreyer's Bobby, A Dog of Flanders,A Dog Named Christmas and other similar tales are the kind of stories that will live forever in the hearts of those who watch them.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|I don't care what this woman sings . .with that voice and that passion . .it could be the ruddy phone book and I would buy it!  Annie is my personal muse as she is probably the best female artist in the entire world, in my humble opinion.  Not only is she an artist, but her passionate humanitarian efforts make her a top notch human being as well.  I've read a lot of flack recently about her inclusion of \\"Universal Child\\" on this record, and I'd like to say that it fits with the spirit of the season.  Christmas has always been the season of the child in everyone's soul, and there are children out there who don't get to experience the over indulgent, over greedy, materialistic holidays that we United States children demand every year.  Her inclusion of this song is a plea that children that she has experienced in other countries (Yes, USA, there are other countries out there) that are dealing with poverty, disease, and lack of education could for once have everything they need to be happy ,healthy children.  So, sue her for wanting to express it in song.<br /><br />The album itself is amazing.  I love all of the songs she has chosen, and the Lennox take on them will be enjoyed for years to come.  Plus, the proceeds from the previously mentioned song all go to the Annie Lennox foundation, which is fighting to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in South Africa.<br /><br />Annie is a treasure of a human being.  Enjoy your Christmases!
B000050HTO|4.0|Ordered this for my son, a Dylan fan, and he has enjoyed it thoroughly.  It contains a large selection of songs...all on a 2 disc set.  Wonderful collection at a very reasonable price.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah Jones has one of those fabulous, near flawless voice.  And she dings with a jazzy, twangy, gospelly, hip style.  You get to here a sampling of her talents on this album.  She sings with a variety of stars form hip hop to gospel.  Some songs are better then others, but they all are intriguing.  The album has a strange flow, but listen a few times and you will come to appreciate it.  One of those albums that doesn't wow you at first, but you won't get sick of it either. And the Blue Bayou song is truly incredible.  Listen and enjoy.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Well-written, as all his books are.  I would have preferred a denser, shorter read to get through all the cool ideas.  not sure I needed last chapter on his own background.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I don't give very many five star reviews, but after careful thought, I couldn't give this film anything but.  It set out to do something and achieved what it wanted to, 100%.<br />I had been reading O'Malley's books for years, but when I heard Scott Pilgrim was being made into a movie, I just rolled my eyes.  As a friend in the comics business once told me, \\"They're going to screw your book.  Just decide how much you want to be paid to get screwed.\\"  Now, this isn't as true as it used to be--a new generation of directors who understand comics are finally producing good work, like Watchmen--but it's still the way to bet.  Which I why I was surprised when I heard from Bryan that he was pretty excited about it.  Still....<br />I was aware the film was being made but was too nervous to keep track of it.  Even after it came out I dragged my feet about seeing it, then finally went near the end of the run.<br />And I LOVED it!<br />Not only is it the best possible adaptation of the book, it is pure 100% fun.  I was talking to a comic book artist I know and raving about it.  He's a HUGE Scott Pilgrim fan and loved it.  Then he said: \\"Too bad it bombed, huh?\\"  I was truly shocked--I had no idea.  I couldn't believe how anyone couldn't like the movie.  It's imaginative, original, well-written, well-acted, and awesomely, perfectly over-the-top.<br />And now that I have the BR and have rewatched it twice (plus 3x with all the commentaries) I am still agog that it wasn't a huge hit.  (Michael Cera has glumly said \\"We got blindsided by eight guys called The Expendables\\".)  I think the problem some people have with it is that they aren't willing to just go with the flow and accept the strange reality the movie takes place in.<br />Edgar put his heart and soul into this movie and it shows on every frame.  I don't know how many times I'd have to watch it to catch all the references and inside jokes, and the backgrounds are so fill of tidbits I've had to step through some scenes almost frame-by-frame in a probably futile attempt to catch them all.  The details are amazing, from the note-perfect Bollywood style of the fight with Patel (eg, the demon sisters all have big racks, and if you've ever watched a Bollywood film...) to the promo posters for the bands and the way the lyrics of the music often intercut and play off the script.<br />The actors committed to this film above and beyond the call of duty.  Let's face it, training Michael Cera to do long choreographed fight shots and look good doing it must have taken a hell of a lot of work on his part and the part of the fight choreographers.  Cera commented that the thing he looked forward to most at the end of filming was \\"never doing another pushup again in my life.\\"  But like them or not, he did them anyway during the filming.<br />And of course for several of the actors, they had to go from wondering what side of their musical instrument was up to playing live and recording the soundtrack.  Only Cera and Larson had previous experience, and neither of them professionally.  (Larson has a lovely voice!)<br />Cera's acting does the job it needs to.  He's pretty Scott Pilgrim-like.  (I howled with laughter at his delivery of the line \\"But it's haaaard!\\")  Culkin steals the movie, as others have noted here.  Most of the other parts don't call for ACTING! as much as in most movies, but again, most of the actors do their work.  The exception is the clumsy and leaden performance by Anna Kendrick as Stacey Pilgrim.  My god, she's awful.  But I need to give a special shout-out to Alison Pill who IS Kim Pine.  It was almost creepy.  Oh yeah, and Jason Schwatzman is brilliant as Gideon.  A complete a-hole, just as he should be.<br />I doubt anyone who has read this far (if anyone ever does) is not already a fan of the movie.  But talk a few people into watching it with you, or lend out the disk.  I think this movie will be a (semi) cult classic, and hopefully after a few years it will at least make itsmoney back.  It's just too cruel that Scott Pilgrim vs the World should be a Bob-omb.<br />Scott Pilgrim FTW!at Scott Pilgrim vs the World should be a Bob-omb.  Scott Pilgrim FTW!

B00005JPTK|5.0|\\"I am Legend\\" is a really exciting and scary zombie movie. Technically it is a vampire movie since the zombies can't go out in daylight and in the original novel by Richard Matheson the monsters are supposed to be vampires, but it is otherwise more like a zombie movie.    \\"I am Legend\\" is about a scientist called Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) who survives a plague that turns people into raging bloodsucking vampires. He lives in New York with his dog as his ownly companion. Everyone in New York besides him is a vampire and the city is overrun with wild animals. Since the vampires can't go out in the daylight because their skin gets burned, this allows Robert Neville to travel around the city when the sun is in the sky without fear of danger as long as he stays out of dark buildings. He regularly goes to an abandoned video store to pick out movies to watch at home.    \\"I am Legend\\" has a lot of suspense. When the main character drives around the abandoned city I was really scared that something was going to happen. The main character seems really vulnerable even in the daylight. The movie makes a clever use of mannequins in several scenes that really creeped me out the first time I saw the movie. This movie isn't the ultimate zombie film but it definitely is a good zombie film and it kept my interest the whole way through.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Great little device!  I have all three different versions: The SD, the BT, and now this AUX.  They all have their advantages.  Because of the display and the on-screen options, this is the one I would recommend for the \\"average user.\\"  I listen to audio books and talk radio on my in-dash unit, and use this device when I want to take a break and listen to some music without losing my place on the other stereo.  Carry a HUGE music collecion on a single SD card, and have the option to play it over the air.  One of my favorite gadgets ever.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I watched Toy Story 3 with my boyfriend based on the great reviews on the Rotten Tomatoes website.  Not knowing what to expect, I had my eyes glued to the screen the entire length of the movie.  I smiled, I laughed, I smirked, and I teared.  My boyfriend teared a little too (although he won't admit it but I did see his eyes well up), and the movie made us left the theater feeling more appreciative of all that we've got in our lives.  I love Disney and Pixar films, and Toy Story 3 has been added to my collection as one of my faves...it's a must see for anyone of any age.  Enjoy!!!
0439023491|5.0|but still worth five stars. Read it in about three days! Other reviewers have mentioned the pacing problems and the love triangle, but I can overlook that because of the story.<br /><br />Now I am waiting to read the final book, and then will be waiting for the movie.
0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life is one of the most inspiring books I've read in a long, long time.  This book has helped me to cultivate a spirit of what is possible when I disregard all of the excuses I call reasons for not achieving my dreams and letting my spirit soar...  I highly recommend this book.  Read it with an open heart and a healthy disrespect for the impossible...
0316098337|3.0|This book got a strong review in the print media and apparently it's short-listed for some prestigious prizes. Therefore I added this book to my \\"Must Read\\" list.<br /><br />True, the book was compelling. I wish I'd saved it for a tedious airplane trip or waiting room. However, it's more like suspense than literary fiction.<br /><br />If I hadn't read the reviews, I might have been more surprised and responded more strongly to the plot points. But without the reviews, I'd have given up after a few pages. It's difficult to maintain a book written from a child's perspective; to her credit, the author manages to avoid sounding syrupy or whiny.<br /><br />--Spoilers start here --<br /><br />It's hard to review the book without sharing some twists and turns of the plot. For one thing, the book's premise - mother and son in locked room - changes before we reach the half way point. The main part of the book focuses on the way the mother and child adjust to being back in the world. The more we learn about the circumstances that led to the two in the room, the more horrifying their story appears.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this part of the book just isn't as unusual. The lawyers and psychotherapists take over.  I felt that I was reading a clinical case rather than a novel; there were no more turns or twists, let alone conflict.<br /><br />And for a reader, it's hard to avoid the game of, \\"Is this realistic?\\" as we watch the struggle they undergo.<br /><br />Would a five-year-old boy talk this way? Would a young mom have the strength and wisdom this young woman shows? She was snatched at age 19 and has had no interactions with others; she learns from watching the television.<br /><br />Would they have to depend on donations to get money? Wouldn't there be funds for crime victims and medical support? Would all the medical staff be so kind and supportive?<br /><br />These questions are fine for an escapist read and we don't demand answers. So if that's what you're looking for, you'll be satisfied. I would ask more of a book with higher aspirations.ons.
B001152TL6|1.0|I saw this on some cable channel.  OK, no story line, no structure.  Lots of cliched dream sequences.  The usual Lynch stuff, audio run backward, film sped up.  Overpaid, well past the A list, actors, who at times seem comatose.  Who really wants to remember Richard Pryor this way?  Like most of Lynch's later work it is nothing more than a visual presentation of a bad seizure.  The mystery for me is never his movies, but who finances this crap?
0439023521|3.0|I don't know why Scholastic, the publisher of Harry Potter, would publish this disgrace. I had to read this for a summer reading assignment for my English class. After so much trash I've read from YA categories, I thought that this would at least be worthwhile since it was recommended by English teachers. I was left with disappointment. Now, I have reached the conclusion that YA authors are only writing to gain popularity.    The plot is interesting; however, one have to ask, if this is the \\"future\\", then why does it seem like the society and lifestyle stepped back about eighty years or more except for the rich? A classmate of mine told me the reason for that is so that the government can punish the people for rebelling. So... they would continue to use the same old-style coal mines from ten years before this present year (2010) and destroy the Earth just to punish their citizens? I don't get it. I guess that's only one area I'm hitting, but just this one makes me believe that Collins didn't really think through the background info. Speaking of old-fashioned, the idea of the Hunger Games just seem like civilization stepped backwards when gladiators and human sacrifices were needed to keep the authorities happy. Some may argue with me that the battle is what makes a story epic. Well, a battle does, but this is just a fight. Yeah, it can make it epic to an extent, but not in a way that's memorable.    Collins is a good writer, don't get me wrong. However, she is still pretty mediocre. Honestly, I think the book would've been so much better if it was written in third-person. There's no need for the reader to go through every single thought of a teenage girl. It just gets annoying. No matter how \\"mature\\" the character is. Plus, the style just seems very forced. It doesn't seem like it would even come from the mind of anyone. Again, it's not even necessary just for students to get a feel of what the situation is. Also, there's no need to introduce new characters and putso much emphasis on them if they have no real connection with the plot (the red-haired Avox and her companion). If one does, then great. Find a way to include them in the overall plot. If one can't, then stop mentioning them over and over. The first half of the book was general background info about the characters that should really only take up a fourth of the book at most. The characters needs a little more, well, characteristics. All I learned about Katniss is that she is a dreadful teenager, who would fit in the \\"emo\\" clique if she was in high school now. Peeta is probably the best constructed character from the book. Overall was pretty impressive, well for YA at least.    Why do I give it a three-star? I like it enough to give it such a high rating, I guess. It's a lot better than Twilight, which is unusual to find in modern literature. However, I only want to remember enough to ace the class and after that, I'll drown it out with some C. S. Lewis, Mark Twain, and J. K. Rowling.
B00005JKJA|1.0|David Lynch is an acquired taste, bad taste.  Another example of overused and underdeveloped Lynch film cliches.  I can only imagine that folks who think this is a great film, 5 stars, are afraid that people might think they are unsophisticated if they do not drool over this and other Lynch films.  Not worth purchasing for a dime at a garage sale.  I mean how many damn times can one director use the dream as allegory?  Alice Cooper did it better in Welcome To My Nightmare.  Maybe Lynch can pick a few bucks up making bad videos for Metal Bands.
0321647440|4.0|For a program like Aperture 3 you must learn by doing and thats what this book is about. following the directions to optimize the many photos that come with the book, you will learn keyboard commands through repetition. Most topics are covered in detail. My main criticism is with the author's light treatment of \\"Corves\\" , an important and almost overlooked topic. After reading the section on curves three times, I still had no idea as to what I was doing. Overall, this book is a winner.
0061997811|5.0|Awesome book filled with so many interactive items like howlers, Uleball invitation, Hogwarts letter and much more.  A must for all fans, this book won't disappoint.
030726999X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is the main fictional character in all three of the Stieg Larsson novels beginning with \\"The Girl .......\\"<br /><br />Lisbeth is the most interesting fictional character to me since Hannibal Lecter.  You are strongly advised to read all three in the correct chronological order:  1. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, 2.  The Girl Who Played With Fire, and 3. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />You probably should watch the 3 associated movies with the Swedish actress playing Lisbeth.  I doubt that what Hollywood will do with Lisbeth will be a pretty story.  Almost makes you suspect that Lisbeth will rise from the written page and extract justice from Hollywood using her own unique methods of revenge.

B004097IKW|5.0|My history of Puritani goes back to a performance at the San Francisco Opera with Beverly Sills in the twilight of her career. I didn't know the opera but was thrilled to see Sills. Then the reviews came out. The SF Chronicle headlined - \\"As Bellini said - Suffer.\\" After trying unsuccessfully to sell my ticket outside the opera house I went in. After all I could always get up and leave. Well, I was completely blown away. In fact I returned another night; something I had never done before. Is there another opera with so many beautiful,jaw dropping, luscious melodies gathered in one piece? I don't think so.      So for me Puritani has not been primarily about the singers, but about the music. And when you put the music first this DVD succeeds. The other reviewers take various singers, orchestra and maestro to task. Although I am not that well versed in the technicalities of singing, I will say that this Puritani kept me entertained and captivated throughout. Yes, Florez is a miracle. But I did not find the other singers as distressing as the other reviewers.      Most important in this performance is the opening of various cuts. Seen in its entirety Puritani is not just a compilation of show off numbers, but a decent drama. Yes, the heroine is full blown bipolar. Knowing that, her mad scenes make more sense than just an opportunity for canary fanciers. I think that both the singers and the production help this happen. Sure the sets are dark and gloomy, but the Puritans were hardly a joyful people. The chorus is kept pretty static which is better than having them run and emote all over the place as some directors would have it. The principles show good acting skills as well as singing.      Yes, the primary reason for this DVD, the other reviewers agree, is Florez. But I believe this is the DVD to have (not a crowded field) as much for giving Bellini his just due as for that knock out tenor.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The detail that made the first half of the book interesting, simply could not be supported in the film...we'd be watching until next Tuesday if that were the case!  School is out for Harry, Ron and Hermione  and things are very dark in the wizarding and the muggle world as Voldemort and the Death Eaters take over.  There is a horrible sense of foreboding and despair in this film and the tension is not so much in the action, as in the minds of our three heroes.  The actors did an excellent job of portraying three children who suddenly had to not only grow up, but also fight an evil that adults were failing to contain.    I badly wanted the movie to keep going through to the end of the story.  My hope is that when part II comes out, the theaters run part one and two together (with an Intermission...remember those?)    See Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in the theater, then get the DVD ... you'll appreciate a lot of the nuances that went by quickly on the big screen.  And we'll all count the days until July 15, 2011.
1400079144|1.0|Dan Brown is a writer more famous for stirring up controversy rather than his meticulous research. Although the media noise surrounding his last two books treats them as historic novels, they are much more fiction than fact. Understandably; were they treated as works of wild fiction there would had been nothing to argue about. And if there ever was a writing career built on controversy...<br /><br />I will refrain from letting any spoilers slip through and, instead, I shall make clear why this is one of THE WORSE books I have ever read - and that is not solely because I refused to be fed unadulterated Masonic propaganda. The book is haphazardly researched, badly written and the plot runs in circles - just like a Masonic ...ourovoros.<br /><br />Allow me to give a couple cases in point.<br />The over and over glorified \\"field\\" of Noetics is nothing but a New Age philosophy masquerading as \\"science\\" only to peddle warmed up ancient ideas as scientific. I never heard of Noetics before reading this book and I am not surprised. If the best arguments supporting the notions that human (and why is it only human?) ...thoughts have a direct effect on reality and that there is a soul and it can be...weighted are the ones presented in this book, well snake-oils and good-luck charms should start to look pretty \\"scientific\\" by now.<br /><br />In his attempt to substantiate a scientific basis of the idea of Global Consciousness (in yet another excuse for the Masonic efforts towards a Global Government), Brown presents some very shaky \\"facts\\". On p.70, he claims that following 9/11 \\"37 Random Events Generators\\"(sic) (and I am guessing that since they are capitalized they must be some... Serious Scientific Equipment, right?) \\"suddenly became significantly less random\\". Wow, hold the presses! Shouldn't we wake the President?<br />Even if someone were to ignore the question of ...what exactly are these 37 generators measuring, can someone give us a precise time frame of these \\"events\\" following 9/11, to establish even a mere time-line of causality? For how long were these generators been monitored to be sure that a similar \\"event\\" did not occur, say when Vettel took the checkered flag at Abu Dabi's F1 race last week? And if it took a catastrophic event of the magnitude of 9/11 to get a \\"significantly less random\\" measurement, what are chances of this pseudoscience getting anything measured ever again?<br /><br />As to ...weighting the soul, is he serious? What are his scientific references, the ...movie \\"[[ASIN:B000FVQLJ8 21 Grams]]\\"? Was he not aware that the actual scientific explanation for the (dubious) weight difference is the release of the residual air from the collapsing lugs? But that was not fitting with the rest of the \\"theory\\" so it had to be cut to size. Here is an expression to work out the etymology of Dan: Procrustean methods!<br /><br />By the way, I doubt that anyone hiding out in a Greek island would remain inconspicuous for long with the ridiculously made-up name of...\\"Andros Dareios\\". The correct spelling is Darius and it is a ancient Persian, not a Greek name. What's more, the word \\"andros\\" is the name of a Greek...island, it means \\"lair\\" and it is not a proper name - yet another example of how epidermal and self-serving his \\"research\\" really is. Just think how many heads would turn to the name...\\"Piratecove Adolph\\".<br /><br />Nevertheless, the most serious issue with this book is its incessant Masonic propaganda. Their rituals are glorified, their beliefs are polished and presented again and again whereas the political implications are (conveniently) glossed over.<br />Brown expresses his condescending outrage to the masses that would fail to comprehend that \\"Senators, Chief Justices and CIA directors are all Masonic brothers\\". Really Dan? Do you fail to grasp the implications of a judge having to pass judgment on a Masonic brother he has sworn to protect? Is it too complicated for you to comprehend how a Mason CIA director or a Secretary of State may promote the interests of his Brotherhood above those of his country?<br /><br />And exactly how ...enlightened can a secret society be when it refuses to accept women and shunts minorities? I am also wondering why there was not even a pip about Nazis' obsession with the occult Ancient Mysteries and the Illuminati (the German offshoot of Freemasonry) or and the role of the infamous Masonic Temple P2 of Rome in connecting the Fascist regime of Mussolini with the Sicilian mafia bosses. Dan's silence is deafening on these matters.<br />Any free-thinking person would be very suspicious of groups operating under blood-oaths of secrecy, enforcing strict obedience to their (selected and not-elected) hierarchy and wielding the ability to undermine every pillar of a democratic society, from the judiciary to the executive branch, when their members are called upon to \\"support a brother\\".<br /><br />I for one do not buy the \\"if I were an Mason I could not be writing about all this because of the secrecy oaths\\" argument. As if repaying a debt, Dan Brown goes to great lengths to function as a loud PR department to the Masons. His descriptions of the Masonic rituals are peculiarly selective - and they are strictly limited to what is already public knowledge. With some selective omissions of course.<br />Why is there no description of Baphomet, the hoofed and horned deity ever Mason upon reaching the 33th degree has to declare allegiance to? Is this not the final \\"Truth\\" that is revealed at the 33rd degree?<br /><br />Judging by his ramblings in the last pages of this book, I am guessing his next book to be on the bogus...Bible Code. For someone who has been attacking the Bible so vehemently he sure seems obsessed with it. Well, I am curious to see how he is going to twist the serpents' suggestion of \\"Ye are Gods\\" into something \\"enlightening\\" Masonic.<br /><br />If the Masons wanted to improve their image, maybe they should had picked a better writer.<br />No matter how much this guy is pushed and pulled, sure, he may be selling books - but he is convincing no one.of his Brotherhood above those of his country?

B003YWUTJI|3.0|Would like to start off by saying Norah Jones is one of my favorite artist, her recent release Featuring Norah Jones has a collection of duets with such artist as Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Foo Fighter, Outcast and more. With the variety of artist means diverse styles of music, country, rap, blues, jazz to name a few. Listening to the cd I was not sure what to expect from song to song, it seemed to be group together with music styles.   I would recommend Featuring Norah Jones to anyone who enjoys her music but would also say not all the songs would be for everyone. There were some songs we really enjoyed and some not sure why they were put on the cd.

0345444051|4.0|There are similarities between \\"Childhood's End\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Both books advance Clarke's view of a human evolution ending in humanity evolving into a completely non-physical, mental existence. Although this end of humanity according to Clarke is probably more transparent in \\"Childhood's End\\" and easier to grasp than how it's presented in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Also, as Clarke notes in the prologue, there are similarities to (and perhaps borrowings from) \\"Childhood's End\\" and the T.V. series \\"V.\\"     \\"Childhood's End\\" affirms the validity of the idea that much of human artistic creativity is grounded in the pain of a world filled with suffering, disease, war, and poverty. And in a utopian world largely free of suffering, human artistic creativity would be stifled.     Ultimately though, the novel does reveal Clarke's rather limited view of religion. If \\"what the old religions were trying to say\\" is represented by humanity one day evolving into the star-like beauty of the universal \\"Overmind\\" than it seems fair to wonder if we shouldn't all feel a little cheated.     Further, it's valid that not all the world's religions can be true. However, in suggesting that \\"science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets,\\" Clarke reveals once more the limitations of his religious view -- tenets of faith can be disbelieved, not because they have been examined and found wanting, but because they can be ignored. A counter-argument to this is presented by N.T. Wright in examining the chief tenet of Christianity in his book \\"The Resurrection of the Son of God.\\"

Nevertheless, I have always kind of liked his voice and he was great at a concert we attended.  When I first heard this new CD, I thought it was decent.  After hearing it several times I am finding that I really like it more than his previous CDs. It is more raw and personal.  His voice is remarkable, yet very human and emotional.

B00445JSX2|5.0|At the urging of a co-worker back in October of 1984 I purchased an album called Some Great Reward by a band with a funny name. A teenager at the time, I tended to like any music with synth's in it or any kind of weird sounds. Needless to say, before the needle on my turn table plowed through track one, Something To Do, I had a new favorite band. In the twenty six years between then and now Depeche Mode occupy an elevated status above simply being my favorite band. I like many other bands a lot and collect everything they record, but not one of them has as consistently elated me with nearly everything they release the way Depeche Mode has. Like many other fans I was grief stricken upon hearing SOFAD, but even that album started to be regarded as being simply another great DM album as time passed. It's always a question of time. SOFAD does hold one major distinction for me to this day; it is the only DM album to have two songs that I don't like at all. But the rest of the album is mostly brilliant.       I couldn't find this DVD in an actual store the day that it came out so I had to order and wait for it. I became a little concerned reading all of the negativity being heaped upon it by other fans. Much to my relief as I sit here watching it for the third time in 24 hours I can't, with all due respect to other reviewers, find but one thing wrong in the performance. What is it? Well, as the intro to In Your Room begins I was expecting them to play the utterly brilliant album version, but after the intro they settle into the utterly wretched and disgusting single version of the song. The album version still sends shivers down my spine when played at the right volume and is quite possibly the most moving and heart-felt song Martin has ever written and that's saying a lot.        As for the complaint's about the vocals; Dave's voice has always been a little nasal at the beginning of the shows, and this is no exception, but really? It is not bad at all. Consider thisas well; In Chains isn't the easiest DM song to sing. That he pulls it off as the first song of the performance is a testament to his continuing metamorphasis from a front man to a singer capable of drenching each song with more emotion and skill. Over the course of the last three or four albums he has really expanded his abilities as a singer. Nearly every song in this set is performed with the intensity many bands can only work up for the encores which explains why the set ends with a slow number sung by Martin and Dave at the end of the runway in the audience. A very funny moment occurs when Dave forgets his line and Martin laughs out loud with his distinctive laugh. During Never Let Me Down Again when the crowd waves their arms in unison as they have been doing for over two decades now I found myself choked up a bit. When Martin performed Home and the crowd continued to sing it well after Dave had come back onto the stage seemed very spontaneous and it was very moving. This crowd, mostly very handsome Spanish men, react to nearly every song as if Spain had just won the World Cup. The crowd is very into this show and they add to this being a great way for those of us who couldn't attend the shows to experience it. The crowds reaction is often very moving. I'm glad they experienced it because they appreciated it so much that I'm not even jealous. This is as close to perfect as a concert DVD gets.
0345505387|3.0|**Review might be a bit spoilerish**<br /><br />I'm not going to go into great detail here, the plot is fairly simple and outside of a new character should be familiar ground to those who have read Outlander. Exile starts upon Jamie's return to Scotland and meets Claire Randall, stranded accidental time traveller and ends at the time when Jamie decides Claire should return to her own time through the stones.<br /><br />As I said, if you've read the book you know the basics and if you haven't Exile is not the place to start - read the book. My thoughts?  While the addition of the mysterious Kenneth and his relationship to witch/time traveller Gellis was intriguing, there really wasn't much else here to enhance the Outlander experience. I wasn't overly fond of the graphics, the men looked too similar at times (and overly angsty at that), I really really didn't need to see Jamie's entire backside (twice, mind you) and as for Claire? Those were some seriously heaving bosoms that took on a life of their own and kept growing and growing and growing...<br /><br />Well, you get the picture - oh and her hair could stay in perfectly Farrah blow-dry style with nary a droop ever. Honestly, I thought the way Claire was depicted was an insult to the intelligent woman we've met in the books. I would have much preferred the image of Claire shown in the back with the author's notes.<br /><br />Recommended for die-hard Outlander fans, otherwise library only then buy it if you love it.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I have updated firmware and got the message on the blu Ray that my firmware needed updating. Returned today. Guess I'll wait for the fix.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|A post over at AVSForum points out a pair of 3D bonus features are available as Easter Eggs on the third disc of Avatar: Extended Collector's Edition on Blu-ray. Curious to see these for myself I popped in the third disc just now, moved to the far right of the main menu and then clicked right again. Sure enough 3D options came up for the Avatar Trailer and Pandora Discovered featurette.     I got this ooff of a HD forum. Have not gotten the movie yet. Have The original movie on blu-ray Great flick.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|The stories are great and I enjoy watching.  But the qualiy of the dvd's is VERY poor.  Some of the stories will not even play.  It is quite frustrating.  Some of the best and most interesting stories (as the Quinn Sully wedding, etc) WILL NOT play.  I could never recommend this series because of the quality of the dvd's.
B0041OOJNU|4.0|Nice album but I like Fijacion Oral better. I always enjoy her Spanish music more so I'm happy she put this album out.
031603438X|4.0|A must read if you are a Stones fan or or want an intimate behind the scenes look at the rock n' roll lifestyle  shared by our mate Keith 'Keef' Richards. Rock on mate..Rock on!
0756665949|4.0|Now I will readily admit that I do not actually own the book yet (I'm planning on ordering it ASAP), but I have read some of it at local bookstores and so far I do think it will be worth the purchase, and a nice complementary book to the LOST series. I did notice that some entries were oddly ordered, and although I haven't read much, I did notice an error in Alex's entry -- in reference to the episode \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" from season three, it stated that Alex opened the door of Jack's cell in the Hydra station so that he could stop Juliet's trial, which was not true -- in the episode \\"I Do,\\" she unlocked Jack's cell door in the Hydra station which led to him seeing Kate and Sawyer on the monitor, but in the episode about Juliet's trial, Alex actually broke Jack out of one of the cages OUTSIDE of the Hydra station, when Jack asked to see Ben (so that he could save Juliet). I know this may be a minor mistake, and I may not have a right to gripe since I don't actually own this book yet, but as a rabid LOST/Jack fan, mistakes like that rub at me the wrong way. I also don't understand why some minor characters (like the undercover cop in one of Locke's flash back episodes), had a picture in his entry, but other characters (like Ben's childhood sweetheart, Annie) did not. Was it a space issue, or could they not get permission to use them? It was more likely the first, but still, that doesn't seem right to me. Especially since this is an offical encyclopedia.    Also, I wish that the book had a section devoted to the Flash-sideways - not like the one in the back of the book, but a special one that explains characters only in that world (i.e, Sayid's brother, and David Shephard), and the events that took place. I wasn't expecting answers to be explained that weren't in the show (Lindelof and Cuse are determined to be cagey about those), but a whole season was devoted to the Flash-sideways, and although those stories may have confused/pissed off people, I liked themajority of them, and would've liked them included. To have them omitted feels to me like they weren't a part of LOST - like the writers had \\"buyer's remorse\\" a little too late. But it WAS LOST, and they should be in the book! It makes me sad that they weren't.    And to the reviewer who mentioned the ordering of the characters listed in the Flashsideways - I think it begins with Desmond and ends with Jack because they were the two most important people in the FS. At least, that's what I think...?    Overall, though, I will gladly get this book in a few weeks if I can. It's a nice looking book, and the LOSTIE in me demands it. =)
B00008QSA5|4.0|I almost forgot how good this album was when I first bought it early 70ies. It is a must have if only for the Season of the Witch 2 versions on album.
0307454541|4.0|This is a perfect `airplane' book.  Think `Da Vinci Code', `The Time Traveler's Wife' or `Harry Potter'.  Actually I put off reading it for just that comparison.  When a good friend whose opinion I respect told me how much they liked it I took my nose out of the air and stuck it in the book.  Larson is(was) a great entertainer.  There are lots of surprises and excitement.  The girl character aka Salander steals the show because you can never quite figure out her motivations and Larson does a good job of pre-figuring his upcoming books through her.  He gives you just enough information on her background to make you want to read more.<br /><br />As a side note I usually have issues reading in translation because I worry I'm missing nuances but this was a very well done Swedish to English version.  By the way the Swedish movie version is excellent and fairly true to the book, one of those rare movies that are almost better than the book.
0151001634|5.0|Although this is described as a large-print version of the novel, this edition does not have oversize print and is easier to handle than the small paperback.  It would also be more durable than your average paperback, a plus for me as a teacher.
B002ZG9968|1.0|Don't waste your time this is horrible and a waste of time. People who are giving this movie a 3 stars or above should be ashame of themselves.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I received this CD to review and I have been listening to it ever since I got it. She is very talented and all these duets showcase her different sides. My favorites are Virginia Moon and Turn Them. I highly recommend this CD.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I like Radiohead I like Depeche Mode and I now like Muse. Don't like the politics (fake lefties), but I do likethe music, energy & production. And I'm an old guy (66) Viet Vet (63-68) Not exactly in their demographics, but hey its a free country (so far).
B00322PK2G|1.0|I ordered the watch and was confirmed by a third party, but i did not recieve it because the item was somehow rejected, and I will get a refund from the failed transaction. I don't know if this has happened to anyone.
0062007297|5.0|I read this book in one sitting - I really couldn't put it down.  It's an easy read and the photos are amazing.  The book follows closely to the documentary (there are some direct quotes) but the book has more details.  Really gives insight into how the band has remained successful for so long. A must have for any Bon Jovi fan!
B004B4RCDE|4.0|Rihanna for me never fails to disappoint. One album will mine the fields of pain in her personal life while the next will be a club banger. While this album is definitely the club banger it still has a couple tracks which are emotional. Unlike Rated R even the songs which are emotional don't veer into the territory of gothiness that so many (excluding myself) found problematic about her last album. Standout tracks are the singles of course but also S & M, Raining Men, and Man Down - all potential number one's. The other standout tracks are Cheers (with an odd but amazing Avril Lavigne sample), Complicated and Love the Way You Lie (Part II) which flips the structure of Eminem's version and puts Ri-Ri front and center while Eminem gets one verse at the end. Overall another solid album in a string of winners from what's come to be one of the best and most reliable pop stars in music today.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love the show.  Definitely a nice gift to buy someone or yourself.  Worth every penny.  Received the product on time.
B00005NTJM|4.0|The album sounds better to me now then it did in 1970. Too bad Ian Anderson got so affected with the Aqualung albums onward. The later on tounge in cheek stuff grew old, this album sounded fresh.
0316069485|4.0|Good start slow middle great ending. Easy read with the usual Connelly attention to reality location detail and logical aternative plot twists.
B00006F2TV|5.0|I ordered this dvd for my two young cousins ages 6&7 because their first copy had gotten lost. They love it and it plays perfectly with no problems whatsoever. Thank You!
B00026WU4G|5.0|Teeming with some of Dylan's most richly poetic lyrics ever, the rock-and-reggae-driven \\"Infidels\\" was hailed as a something of a return to form in 1983, coming as it did on the heels of the three more overtly born again Christian efforts that he had released in the late seventies and very early eighties. However, even the generally favorable reviews the record garnered at the time of its release failed to adequately acknowledge just how great an album it actually was. As had been true a few years previously in the case of 1978's [[ASIN:B00026WUAU Street Legal (Reis)]], a finely crafted, beautifully arranged and preformed set that showcased all the things the master does so brilliantly was unaccountably dismissed as merely a \\"good\\" album. This crisp and vital remastering should change that. Every track here is a stone gem. My personal favorite is the darkly-nuanced, surreal narrative \\"Sweetheart Like You,\\" whose richly evocative and often frightening imagery upends the apparent cliche in the title, as Dylan snarls: \\"What's a sweetheart like you / Doin' in a dump like this?\\" Like \\"Street Legal,\\" \\"Infidels\\" has aged well; it remains one of my very favorite Dylan albums, and I have worn out several copies, on various formats, over the years. \\"Infidels\\" was the first really classic Dylan album since 1975's [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks (Reis)]], and we would see nothing of comparable quality again until [[ASIN:B00005NI5Y \\"Love and Theft\\"]] nearly two decades later. (Yes, I do think that \\"Infidels\\" easily surpasses both [[ASIN:B00026WU3M Oh Mercy (Reis)]] and [[ASIN:B000002C2E Time Out of Mind]], which, while they are certainly solid outings, strike me as accomplished, but not brilliant.) \\"Infidels,\\" on the other hand, is genuinely brilliant, through and through. I recommend it most highly for anyone interested in Bob Dylan, or interested in serious, enduring popular music in general.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Long time fan, seen it over 150 times...  Great edition and on Blu-ray it looks incredible and all the extras!  A must have for any Rocky Horror fan and a good intro for those looking to get into the cult.
B00000B9BD|5.0|This album is a gem beginning to end, makes me almost feel spiritual, that is a hard task, but this is on my top 20 albums of all time.
B003IPC5SO|2.0|This latest album by Kylie is very much overrated. Most of the tunes have a sameness/blandness that causes one to simply tune out. On the basis of this much praised (People, etc.) album, I will never waste money on another.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I have never really had any of Norah Jones CD's before and was given this one to review.  I really like the mix of songs on here.  She has some great duets with people ranging from Dolly Parton to Ray Charles.    Creepin In with Dolly Parton is especially excellent.  I love this cd.
B004259BMM|5.0|I bought the Deluxe CD from Target the day it was released. It's been playing through my iPod or in my car ever since.  In my opinion, this is the best CD from Keith yet. His vocals in this record are just outstanding.  I can hear a new confidence in his singing and for that matter, in his playing.  Sonically, this record is just amazing.  Georgia Woods just blew me away.  I don't know how many times I've listened to it.  Right On Back To You, Shut Out The Lights, Luxury of Knowing (on the Deluxe version), Big Promises (also on the Deluxe version, Without You, and All For You are my favorites although You Gunna Fly and Long Hot Summer are wonderful, too.  Every time as I'm listening to a song I think I want to hear this one again, then the next one starts before I can hit replay and I'm hooked on listening to that one.  I can't stop listening.  I don't want to stop listening.  I can't wait to hear some of these live in concert - it's going to kick butt.    If you love great music, do yourself a favor and go to Target, spend the $11.99, go TODAY, and buy this album.  This will make a fantastic gift also!!!
