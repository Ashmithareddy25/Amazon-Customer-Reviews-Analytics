B005CM9DX6|3.0|Going in a new direction is fine.  Wanting to be constantly evolving as an artist is fine.  I'm also not wedded to death metal vocals either, having loved Damnation.  But count me in the camp that felt that Opeth was one of the best metal bands in the world because they could blend genres in a unique, melodic way, but do it while still maintaining the harshness of death metal. I get it that Mikael is bored with playing death metal, really I do.  Make no mistake I am completely fine with prog, but I have to love the songs, and to me the songwriting seems just very sporadic on this release.  There are a few songs on here that simply fall flat in my opinion and it's because of odd transitions/sequences that do not lead to any real cohesiveness to the songs, especially when rolling them up and looking at the album as a whole work.  I realize that being \\"cohesive\\" is not exactly a trademark of prog, but I think MA just needs more polish here if he is going to take the band full bore in this direction.  This record really feels like it is a culmination of alot of solid ideas/riffs, but not alot of memorable songs that I can't live without.  This speaks positively to the future for this band, but given this is really their first bold move in a new direction it is hard for me to give this one a masterpiece label at this point.
B0034G4P80|4.0|There's a raft of superhero movies out and about - the twitchy fun of \\"Iron Man\\", the self-effacing \\"Green Lantern\\", the snarky \\"Green Hornet\\"..and for the most part, they're all pretty forgettable. \\"Iron Man\\" takes the best stab at being grounded in a real person, but Iron Man 2 really tried my patience. On top of this, I'm really getting sick of comic-book action movies.   I think these films either try too hard to be dark and gritty (\\"Dark Night\\"), or glibly play with the material and, in my opinion, will age badly. (\\"Green Lantern\\" and \\"Green Hornet\\" were past their sell-by date when they came out...). Enjoy them while they're out because they're not worth buying.   \\"Thor\\", though, is something else. The production values are top-notch, the effects beyond what's needed, but at the core is a very simple story that will last: The story of two boys' and their relationship with their father. In this case, father is Odin, King of the Gods (but then again the best stories about dysfunctional families are about the Gods). The children of Odin - Thor and Loki - and their trajectories they take to appease their father and establish themselves what drives the movie, and that theme is timeless.   At one level, it's a boy's movie. It's big and brash and all about discovering your potential. On the other hand, it's about relationships and their motivations. \\"Thor\\" is extraordinarily character-driven, something many comic-book movies lack, and it took 5-10 minutes to shift gears, but once the characters get to bounce off each other. Kenneth Brannagh's touch is clearly present here, and that solid sense of character is what makes the battle between Thor and Loki so believable - two brothers, on different and opposite paths...what will it take to break that bond? How far will they go?    Besides the many, many subtle nods to the comic, their take on Norse mythology is quite faithful and engaging without feeling dated. On top of these details, there's so much personality and wit, so much charm and honor in how the story is told: the god who fell to Earth & learns how to be a good man...it really stands up to repeated viewing. I only wish there were more scenes with Natalie Portman; that part seems far too rushed, as are scenes with Lady Sif and his Warriors cohorts. (In norse mythology, Thor marries Sif - makes you wonder what they plan next...)  It may be that if you're very young or middle-aged and older, you might respond more readily to \\"Thor\\". I think teens, thinking more about impressing and less about consequences, may look at it as a bit too preachy, but sorry kids - it's a wise old tale for a reason. Fathers and sons, fathers and sons..  Grand, romantic and shakespearian in tone, honest in it's reasoning. I only came away wanting more - I'm sure it was cut down to under 2 hours but I could have used another 20-30 minutes more to flesh out the characters--that's what sequels are for, I guess--hence the 4-stars. Still - Brannagh has created a winner. Great movie - I want a Director's Cut!
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I loved the original Fright Night (1985) and owned it for years. Saw it for the first time in the early nineties. I wound up inadvertently giving the DVD away not that long ago, but it definitely held up over the years. I also found it scary as hell, Chris Sarandon was effortlessly sexy, and I really liked Charley, Amy, Evil Ed and even Charley's mom (played by the oft neglected Dorothy Fielding). The nightclub scene is classic.    Now, on to the remake. I was really excited about seeing it because I loved the original story so much. Tom Holland is one of my favorite screenwriters and I always keep an eye out for anything of his. And I ended up loving the remake. I've gone back 5 times to see it in theaters, and I've never done that before in my life.    There are some spoilers in the remainder of my review, so please don't read further if you haven't yet seen this film...  ____________________________________________________________________________________________    I find this Fright Night incredibly funny and also scary at the same time. Maybe I scare easily, but so many scenes had me at the edge of my seat, starting with the beginning when Evil Ed visits Adam's house and we see Jerry lurking outside the door. The subsequent chase and Jerry turning Ed into a vampire scared the crap out of me. As did so many scenes thereafter - Charley's rescue of Doris, their escape from Jerry's house, the car chase scene (this one had me at the edge of my seat, clutching my friend who had gone with me to see it the 1st time!) - and I loved Chris Sarandon's cameo. That was awesome - one Jerry sinking his fangs into his predecessor. If only William Ragsdale had shown up in some capacity as well - as a disbelieving neighbor or policeman. Ah, well.    I thought the scene between Jerry and Charley when Charley isn't inviting Jerry in (and Jerry's realization that Charley is deliberately stonewalling him) was incredible. Both Colin and Anton did a fantastic job. The analogous scene in the original (Jerry being invited in by Charley's mother) was also clever. But I enjoyed this scene more.    I really enjoyed the comedic aspects. Colin mixed humor and menace very effectively. I loved the way he paid homage to Chris's Jerry by angrily biting into an apple the first time when Charley goes off to meet Ed at Adam's house, and amusingly biting into an apple a second time when Charley and Doris escape his house. My favorite line: when Charley says \\"Jerry? That's a TERRIBLE vampire name - JERRY?\\", Ed counters: \\"I didn't name him, man. I'm just reporting the FACTS.\\" Christopher Mintz-Plasse delivered that line perfectly. It's a priceless moment.    I found Colin Farrell incredibly sexy and I've become a fan of his for life. No one else could've pulled off the role of Jerry the vampire the way he did. He is truly in his element. Perhaps best of all, the entire cast seems to having a riotously good time here. Overall - as a true lover of the original Fright Night (one of my favorite movies ever!) - I loved, loved, loved the remake. Every time I watch it, I discover another subtlety that I didn't catch earlier. I like this version of Fright Night better, but for emotional reasons that I can't fully verbalize. I can't wait for the DVD to come out!
B004ZISVWC|5.0|An excellent way to spend an idle evening.  Has raw-style elements of Blair Witch and Cloverfield but is far better than either.  Try it.  You'll like it.
B0011ZWMVS|5.0|I like Hans Zimmer.  Sure, he gets a lot of flack from soundtrack buffs, but I still like him, in general.  This particular score has become an unexpected favorite of mine, racking up roughly 40 (full album) plays in the last 3 months (thank you last.fm).  It has some simple themes that just stir up my heart somehow; after seeing the movie, this is even more accentuated.<br /><br />Although quite different, I'd also recommend Zimmer fans take a look at Beyond Rangoon - it's one of his older scores that doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.<br /><br />If you'd like to see what else I tend to listen to (to judge whether you should pay any attention at all to what I've written here), look me up on last.fm with the username xiongchiamiov.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|I love this violin player. Whatever he plays, he is playing with passion and deep feelings, no matter whether it is classical music, or modern music. His Rock Symphonies give you different look at his great talent and endlessly rising spirit. Great music!
1402760663|5.0|A beautiful heart-rending story of the conquest of the Wild West. One of the most well written books on the subject. The illustrations are excellent.
B005DR64OQ|1.0|The movie is horrible. The acting is also as bad. I didn't like it at all. It will be unsucessfull, because that Nicholas Cage'movies didn't do very well lately and that NicoleKidman, by now is \\"box office poisson\\". I wouldn't recomend this movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is a difference - big time - with the new Blu Ray.  All of the movies look better.  The sound is beyond awesome.<br /><br />Watching this new version of Empire Strikes Back was like being transported back in time and seeing the movie for the first time; and, yes, I saw it when it originally came out.<br /><br />All of the movies in this package are big and bold, just the way Star Wars is meant to be.<br /><br />All that said, I struggle with episodes I - III; but I also realize there is no way they could live up to my expectations.  In fact, originally, Episode VI did not live up to my expectations.  It is only when I step back and view the whole story that I can appreciate the genius of Lucas.<br /><br />I spent this past weekend with my five year old daughter, telling her about Luke and his father, and how anger leads to the dark side.  The new movies did not let us down.  It was more fun than I thought possible.<br /><br />Sure, folks can complain about the changes, but I'm afraid they miss the bigger point - in my humble opinion.  Lucas rolled the dice with episode IV long ago.  Sure, he got rich, but, over the years, we have been lucky to have these films, these memories.  His risk has become our cultural gold mine.<br /><br />If Mr. Lucas wants to make changes then so be it; I, for one, will be in line to check it out.  The joy he has given me outweigh any negative feelings I might have about his constant tinkering with the originals.<br /><br />One note: if you're considering buying these movies, read over the negative reviews.  Decide whether or not you can accept the changes.  Remember, many of the negative reviews were written months before this package was released, which means they did not actually watch the movies.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna at her BEST! Flawless sound, stunning everything! Must have seen it 20 times and heard the CD of it at least 100 times. It is a Devine experience and I mean it! Phenomenal work...
0307595579|5.0|Loved it, fantastic price. I cannot stand paper back books they have no class and are easily damaged, the pages curl and you have to press to keep flat.These books are hard back and made the old fashioned way which gives it that something special. Worth buying at the cost neat package.
1451629184|5.0|This book is VERY SAD and very heartfelt. I'm happy that i bought it though even though it made me cry at times.
034552554X|5.0|I bought it as a pre-release and bumped it up to the front of my reading list.  Love the skill of the writer with the knitting of the romance of flowers with the harsh realty of foster life.  It's just behind White Oleander for it genre.  Highly recommended it.
B0032JTV6U|4.0|I chose a used dvd, so I knew the risks. The disk skips and sticks in some places. It's not a really big thing, less than ten minutes in two separate episodes. The case and dvd's don't show any damage, it's just that little glitch. For the price, it's not so bad; but next time I think I'll go for something that's closer to new than this was.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a very fun game. I'm hooked and play it every day. It is worth the dollar and I recommend it. ^.^
B003UESJH4|5.0|Besides the terrific casting of Colin Firth as the king, I also noticed a face that looked vaguely familiar, but couldn't quite place her. I'm writing about the wife of the king. (This before I checked the names of all the cast on the cover).  Something about her reminded me of other films I'd seen her in before, but I wasn't sure because whe looked and sounded so totally different.  The same thing happened when I saw her in Harry Potter playing the evil witch, Bellatrix Lestrang. Again, something familiar about her. So, I checked to make sure it was the same wonderful actress I saw in Howard's End, Helen Schlegel.  It was. And now the the king's wife, yet another entirely different role. The wife of \\"Bertie\\", the King. I'm writing of course of Helena Bonham Carter.  In each film she looked and sounded entirely different.  What a great actress she is!  This, so different from so many Hollywood actresses who keep playing the same type role in every film.  (This doesn't apply, of course, to Meryl Streep who can play any role in any film and play it perfectly.) Examples of a few recent ones:  Julie and Julia: playing Julia Childs, a happy go lucky incredible chef with a great sense of humor,  Doubt, playing Sister Aloysius Beauvier, an overly suspicious nun, and The Devil Wears Prada, whose head of a famous fashion magazine, considered by some movie reviewers to be the greatest living film actress in that particular film. Can they all be the same person?  Can that nun, that chef and that fashion editor and the many other roles she's played all be the same actress.       Well, anyway, back to The King's Speech.  A perfect film.  I'm so glad I watched it.  I'd seen a bit of it before with a friend who had just rented it and was playing it at my house for a short time, but I saw so little, I couldn't possibly have gotten more than a tiny taste of it.  Then after buying the film, and watching the whole thing, I was stunned.  It absolutely was a great movie, a fascinating story, inspiring, and everyone in the cast was perfect. I'm also happy they chose Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) to play the king, and Geoffrey Rush, one of Australia's most popular and distinguished actors to be his tutor.  They were great together!
B002ZG997C|5.0|I got this for my religious sister who will believe that this is a true story. Mabey it is but i hope she likes it.
0470876417|2.0|I purchased this book to refine what I know about business models, which always seemed like an ill-defined concept when found in popular writings and even through my business school experience.  I wanted to know about the fundamentals of a business model and its creation as well as providing sound examples of business model structures along with the underpinnings of when they work and why.  This book seemed perfect for my undertaking but falls short of an essential book on the subject, coming off merely as an overview with some random unrelated business topics thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />One problem that proliferates throughout the book is in how it categorizes components when dissecting model elements.  Their categories are time and again overlapping and incomplete - thus appearing arbitrary.  For example, when detailing the different types of revenue streams, the following categories are given as distinct and complete:  Asset Sale, Usage Fee, Subscription Fee, Lending/Renting/Leasing, Licensing, Brokerage Fees, and, Advertising.  How would you categorize the hotel business?  The authors put this under Usage Fee.  Why?  It seems a lot like Renting to me.  How about Gillette's razor blade model?  The authors talk about it later in the book (termed the Bait-And-Hook model), but do not categorize this type of revenue stream here.  Odd.  But the overarching problem is that the categorization throughout the book is consistently arbitrary, and reminds me of Michael Scott from The Office proclaiming, \\"There are four kinds of businesses: tourism, food service, rail roads, and sales, ... and hospitals/manufacturing, ... and air travel\\".<br /><br />Another problem is that the book delves into topics that are ancillary at best to the primary topic and are better covered in books dedicated to the topic.  For example, under the guise of how to design a business model, the authors get diverted into the topic of creating an innovative ideation process.  If you really want to know how to do this, read Innovation Tournaments by Terwiesch & Ulrich.  The section of the book about scenario planning is cursory at best and overly simplistic at worst.  Read The Entrepreneurial Mindset by McGrath & MacMillan to learn about discovery-driven planning, a very useful framework which isn't even covered in Business Model Generation.<br /><br />The book contains a major section on strategy, which is nothing more than a bastardization of Porter's 5-Force model.  The issue here is that Porter's model is clear and concise whereas the BMG book again suffers from bad categorization.  I am not sure why they felt they needed to re-invent Porter's framework (perhaps copyright restrictions), but what really bothered me was the misapplication of the framework.  Porter's model, contained within the Positioning school of strategic thought, deals only with static corporate strategy, i.e. the question of in which businesses you should compete assuming they are not changing.  It does not tell you how to compete once your business is chosen.  At the time of generating business models, I would assume that your business is already chosen.  Sure, it is fundamental to have a deep understanding of the business itself, so at the time of generating a business model, if you haven't already done a 5-Forces analysis, you should probably do it post-haste.  In fairness, the authors use their bastardized strategy analysis with hopes of developing a disruptive business model. They defer to the popular book Blue Ocean Strategy by Kim and Mauborgne, but if you really want to learn how to generate disruptive ideas, read both The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution by Christenson.<br /><br />The part of the book that I most looked forward to was the section on Patterns, i.e. the primary architectures of business models.  This was indeed a good section, but it is hardly a treatise on the subject, and what's more, has a bent toward IT examples and the dotcom mindset -which proliferates throughout the entire book.  I was hoping for something more academic and fundamental.  I wanted to know what patterns work in which situations and why.  There was no depth to be found here.<br /><br />One point that struck me as particularly curious is that on one of the final pages of the book, the authors admit that the business model is only one part of the full business plan.  It would seem to me better to write a book about generating business plans, in total, with business models contributing a meaty chapter.<br /><br />The best part of the book is their Business Model Canvas, which is a template used to dissect and even generate business models.  It would be useful when doing strategy cases in business school, and I am sure I can find some application for it in my strategy work.  It's novel, but not groundbreaking - plus you can download it for free from their website.
B000002KCI|5.0|I bought this for myself cause i don't hear it on the radio  at all anymore. It sounds great to hear it again.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|This is such a good adaptation! Anyone in love with the book needs to see this one! You will die of girliness and passionate, gothic love :)

B005CM9DX6|5.0|I am a big Opeth fan but not a good reviewer, so I'm just writing this to spread some love for the band.    I own all their CD's and have been a big fan for a while and I was very excited about hearing their new album.  This album blew my mind in a way I didn't think possible for Opeth, because they have already amazed me so much on their previous outings. I am a big prog fan, listening to both new and old prog, like Yes, King Crimson, Porcupine Tree, Riverside and a lot more obscure bands. That's probably why I loved this album so much. If you're not that into prog rock and love their previous CD's, this CD might confuse and disappoint you. It's not easy listening, it will challenge you. If you can embrace their new style though, you'll discover a great prog record. The sound is great on this album and their musicianship has never been better. Mikael has reached a new level with his vocals as well. I hear some mixed opinions on this CD, but if you have some trouble getting into it, open your mind, take the journey, embrace it and maybe you'll be as amazed as I am. Give it a few spins, it might grow on you if you have trouble getting into their new style.    This is already my favorite Opeth CD and I hope the rest of their fans will embrace it. I have the special edition and the 5.1 is fantastic as well. Definitely worth buying.    Go buy this CD :)    Sorry for my english.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This band has come a long way and has alot of good song on their cd's. I have yet to complete my collection.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I bought this for my teenager sister's birthday. She is a huge movie and music buff and cannot stop raving about how nice it is to be able to watch videos and Netflix in her bedroom on the television instead of on her laptop, which makes group movie nights difficult. She has not had any problems with it and says it is very easy to use.    I am glad that I read beforehand that this will only work for Netflix and other apps that do not come automatically installed on the iPod/iPhone if it is a 4th generation (or, in the future, newer). Otherwise, I might have bought one for myself and been very disappointed, me having a 3rd generation.    This is just one more electronic tool that makes life a little better.
B000002V1D|5.0|I hadda replace my scratched up one with this one. This one has a lot of good cuts on it
B000FBFN1U|1.0|Nothing good ever happens in these books. I read for enjoyment and these books just made me frustrated and depressed. Maybe people like that sort of thing but I would rather read something good.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|I ordered this for my sister who lives in the back woods and watches westerns all day,hopin to see john wayne ride up.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Just finished reading this book, and as someone who grew up in the '80's, I thought it was great.  A fun, puzzle-filled novel with a good pace that weaves '80s pop culture in perfectly.  I now want to read it to my kids (although I may have to censor a few words/parts ;-))
B0045ODPKY|5.0|I got this dvd for a friend that loves action flicks. This is a good one for her to watch it's got it all.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|5++ stars. (A rating I rarely give, and I have read over a thousand romances). I loved this one. Master of Crows is a wonderful fantasy/PNR romance with a great balance of rich world building (felt like a medieval/Persia kind of world, loved it!), mixed with a solid, steamy hot romance and great chemistry between the H/h (Silhara of Nieth, the Master of Crows, and Martise of Asher, a slave girl with an unexpected magical gift).  This book slowly paints an intricate world with Gods, priest clans, mages, giants, soul eaters (and other creatures) living among ordinary humans.<br /><br />The story often had a darker feel to it, yet it kept surprising me with bits of light humorous moments that would make me grin ear to ear.  Silhara and Martise had some of the best dialogue between each other, and his relationship with his Giant servant and his smelly dog were a hoot. Initially Silhara and Martise are enemies that must work together, and then they slowly built a relationship that was so strong and believable.  I loved how the relationship was never lost in all the world building, including Silhara's need to strike down the God of Corruption and battle his enemies.<br /><br />Silhara really is one of the best romance heroes in my eyes. I love the strong alpha type hero but can't stand it when an author turns him into a brooding ogre. Silhara was simply fantastic as a strong hero that was not afraid to admit his feelings for Martise (despite plenty of effort to resist her).  He was so hot!  Martise was great too.  I loved how she would put him in his place at times.  In short, I thought the writing was simply amazing.  Grace Draven has a new fan.
0385534639|5.0|I had seen this around on the blogosphere all of a sudden, read the summary and was immediately hooked. I had to have this book. So on the release day I went straight to my bookstore (The one that fails half the time with new releases I want and not having them), and OH MY GOD THEY HAD IT. I had to make sure I didn't jump up and down squealing and looking like a crazy person. So I brought it home and just held it and stared at it. The Night Circus is a gorgeous book. Inside and out.<br /><br />On to the review itself. This book was perfect. Enough said, end review. Haha, no not really. But honestly I love this book. I love the pacing, I love the atmosphere, I love the characters. The only thing I didn't love was that there wasn't quite as much romance between Marco and Celia in person. Most of it was them doing feats of magic for each other from long distance. Usually that would enchant me just as much as actual face time between characters, but this time it didn't.<br /><br />Pacing and atmosphere. I will say for those who aren't very patient, the pacing for this is slow, even though it takes place over the course of nearly three decades. But the slow pace didn't keep me from wanting to read this, it actually made me want to tear through it so I could know what happens next. Instead I forced myself to read it for four or five days so I could savor it. I don't really know what to say about the atmosphere, I find it hard to explain. It's obviously magical, and enchanting. I feel like this book is to me what the circus was to the rêveurs. Rêveurs by the way are circus goers who follow the circus in any way that they can. To get a hint of what the atmosphere is like I would suggest watching the book trailer for this, which I have posted a day or so ago.<br /><br />There are so many characters in this story, but none get thrown to the curb. All the supporting cast have a rhyme and reason for why they are present, and they are each vital to the movement of the story. And they all feel like they are their own person, with no overlapping. My favorite secondary characters were Mr. Barris, the Burgess twins, and especially Friedrick Thiessen, the clockmaker.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what else to say to convey my absolute love of this book to you guys. It's become my favorite read of 2011, but also my favorite read of all time. I'm lending this out to a few friends over the next few weeks, but as soon as I get it back I am rereading this. I recommend this to anyone who loves to read. I'm looking forward to the screen adaptation, though I'm nervous about the film doing justice to the book. We shall see! Go get yourself a copy of this ASAP, and hopefully you guys will enjoy it as much as I did!hey are their own person, with no overlapping.

B000021YQV|5.0|I can't say enough about this album.  Truly a classic.  Extremely 'fun' to listen to. Yes, fun is exactly what I mean.    For the other parents out there...this album is explicit, though only a few songs on this one are 'profane'.
B004V98UKS|4.0|its a nice game somewhat similar to 90s PC games. It makes one to think so I would ask anyone to try
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Another great SOAD album. Right up there with Toxicity.    For the other parents out there...this album is explicit, more than half the songs on this one are 'profane'.
B0051OJCUY|5.0|This is a box of Jimmy Smith's first 8 releases on 4 cd's. The music is, of course, superb. I can't imagine reading this and not having some knowledge of Jimmy's music, but just in case:    Jimmy Smith is the king of the b-3. I will happily defer to your opinion if you think someone else is better, but Jimmy is really synonomous with the jazz organ, much like BB is to Blues and Bob Wills is to Western Swing.   Jimmy played straight jazz, blues, swing, funk (later), Soul Jazz - he even recorded with large bands at times. The early recordings just seem so spontaneous and joyful; as if Jimmy was plugged in to the b-3!    As to the recordings, these do not sound like the RVG Remasters, so I guess they come from an earlier master. The sound is fine, especially given the price . . .    and what a price!!!!! Many, in fact MOST of you who see this have the RVG's, the earlier issues and the vinyl - I do! This is perfect for cruising in the car, parties, or anywhere you are concerned your discs will get damaged. I paid $8 + postage and have been listening in the car.    If you really need a blow-by-blow of the music, check the (many) reviews of the individual discs. One last note: there are not bonus tracks, they are straight reissues.    Enjoy!!!!
1603425381|5.0|I write my own amigurmi and blanket patterns. This book has been amazingly useful for adding trims and creating things like pettiskirts and sleeves for my creations. Love it and it is now always in my crochet bag.
0811879542|5.0|I ordered this book for the eight and three year old sons of a friend. They loved it from the first page and have not been able to put it down since. And, quite honestly, I loved it too! There's no age limit to enjoy this book - it brings out the kid in everyone.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Very happy with the quality of the two discs.  No problems at all with them.  My only complaint though is that they did not come in a Little Mermaid case.  Just in a little plastic sleeve.  That should be stated so people know before ordering.
0385534639|5.0|I won't spoil anything, other than to say that getting into books is very difficult for me. This book grabbed my attention right away, and I finished it in a matter of days. It's a beautiful, and imaginative, and almost dream-like. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but nonetheless, it's a very good, if not great, book. I'm happy to own it and actually look forward to reading it again someday!
B003VIWZNS|4.0|‘Winter’s Bone’, co-written and directed by Debra Granik, is a bleak and downbeat story of the marginalised underclass of dirt-poor rural white people in the Ozark Mountains; a welcome dose of realism in contrast to the usual fare of vacuous, glossy and lavish-budget Hollywood escapism/action movies. It’s an uncompromising film with a simple plot line and features an astounding performance from the young Jennifer Lawrence as the female lead. You are likely to wake up the next day still thinking about this film, and its haunting images may linger long in memory.<br /><br />I know the Ozarks in NW Arkansas and southern Missouri, and the film’s social detail is exactly right. This is a side of America rarely featured in film: life lived in the raw by an isolated population in the backwoods, predominantly unemployed/self-sufficient and semi-destitute, the wreckage of broken-down old cars and appliances rusting in the yards of tumbledown shacks barely fit for habitation; subsistence living far from a complex urban consumer-society in which they have no stake. There is no non-white tokenism in the film’s cast, so in this detail it’s also uncompromisingly true to life. These folks live by an ancient code of blood ties, extended family bonds and militant non-co-operation with the law; illegal ‘cooking’ of and addiction to life-wrecking methamphetamine – known as ‘crank’ - is common. Another realistic detail is that no-one in the film has a cellphone or a computer or can even aspire to owning one: those everyday gadgets of the global consumer-matrix are as alien in this environment as they might be to someone in the 16th century. The most hi-tech life ever gets out here is a rusty old pick-up truck, a chain-saw and a gun.<br /><br />Lawrence plays Ree Dolly, a 17-year old forced to grow up fast and take on the role of the only responsible adult in the rural shack they call home. Ree cares for her catatonic, mentally incapable mother and her younger brother and sister. She is told her estranged father, arrested for distilling crank, put up the family shack as a bail bond and subsequently disappeared: if he doesn’t turn up for his court date, the family shack will be forfeit and Ree and her siblings “…be thrown out into the fields, to live like dogs” - bleak indeed.<br /><br />The film’s simple, slow-paced plot principally involves Ree searching for her father, to find out if he’s alive or dead and so save the family home (if she can prove he’s dead, the bail will be annulled). In her search she demonstrates patience, resilience and determination and is in turn met by hostility, non-co-operation and eventually physical violence from the scattered community whose code of honor is that “ya don’t ask no questions, and ya don’t never tell.” Her quiet and principled persistence eventually wins over some unlikely allies, and there is a resolution of sorts but hardly a ‘happy ending.’<br /><br />The film has many poignant and harrowing scenes, but Lawrence’s performance throughout is truly outstanding and utterly convincing (she was raised in Tennessee in a similar rural environment to that portrayed in the film). The cast are mostly unknowns and portray to perfection the kind of people you’d cross the street to avoid and never, ever pick a fight with – the women as well as the men. There is no humor in the film, but the serious tone throughout is somehow right for the sombre subject matter. You will utterly, completely believe in the characters and in the story: in style it’s more like documentary than fictional drama, with a welcome absence of melodrama and no attempt to emotionally manipulate the audience. So if it’s lightweight entertainment and laughs you’re after, you better steer clear of this film.<br /><br />‘Winter’s Bone’ has received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for (though didn’t win) a number of 2011 Academy Awards, and picked up both the GrandJury Prize for Dramatic Films and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The soundtrack is also excellent: genuine Ozark musicians playing mountain music on banjo and guitar. The film is very, very good, and I only drop it from 5 stars due to its rather bleak storyline and slightly less than satisfying (though not unbelievable) denouement. If you appreciate good, serious, quality film making you should definitely see it.Jury Prize for Dramatic Films and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|I am sick of my favorite people dying!!!  What author kills off so many of the main starting characters!!!  I have had enough with this series and will not continue with anymore of the books.
0345529057|5.0|George Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is a great epic fantasy that will keep you on the edge on every book, even in \\"A Storm of Crows\\" that has received a lot of criticism but it's stil a great book although not as good as the past 3. Hope the 6th and 7th come faster than the fifht because i can't wait to know what happens with the story.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Just orderd ,estimated delivery 4 oct.  This is just the best show, period.  I watched all seasons and cant wait to  see the extended, the extra's and especially  the HD Blu-ray quality.  Must have
B004DF3S7A|5.0|I love all of these American Songbook CD's. Rod did a great job. I listen to them all the time with great pleasure.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|it's very addictive. Tons of fun and not too easy.  currently stuck on a level and love how it's making me work to figure it out.
B003L77GRO|4.0|My wife and I both were worried about where the show would go after that horrible, cliche of an ending to season 4. Both of us felt that the show had jumped the shark but we figured one bad idea might not ruin the whole series.  Thankfully we were right.  I loved the story line in this season and how they took their time getting into it rather than cramming it down our throats from the get go.  I won't say too much so as to not leave any spoliers, just that the story was intriguing and definitely worthy of a Dexter season.  I will ask one thing though.  Just how much money does a blood spatter analyst make?  The guy has a boat, house, apartment, full time nanny and he's raising kids.
B0037QGRZG|4.0|I'm going to review another franchise The Karate Kid series starting off with of course The Karate Kid released in 1984 & what can I say that's not already been said it's a classic movie a solid film. Directed by John G Avildsen he directed Rocky 1 & Rocky V, KK II & III & 8 Seconds. Stars Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi, Ralph Macchio as Daniel Larusso, Elisabeth Shue as Ali Mills, Martin Kove as John Kreese & William Zabka as Johnny Laurence. Story is you have a boy named Daniel who's moving to Califonia from New Jersey him mother wants to move there to open up a restaurant. Daniel gets invited to a beach party. He meets this girl named Ali but her ex boyfriend shows up Johnnny he takes Ali's radio & breaks it Daniel stands up for her Johnny beats him up. He has to deal with these guys at school they are part of The Kobra Kai Dojo. Daniel becomes friends with The Matience Man Mr Miyagi. While riding his bike home he's attacked by Johnny & his friends his bike breaks & he has a good scene where he says he wants to leave Califonia. Then you get to The Halloween Dance this scene is too funny Daniel's costume is wtf if you've never seen this movie it is funny. Where Daniel takes the hose puts it in the stall where Johnny is at & Johnny's reaction classic. Daniel runs to the apartment complex as he climbs the fence he he's pulled down & Johnny & his buddies beat the                              s       h          i       t   our of him. Mr Miyagi saves him from the pounding Miyagi tries to end the problems he confronts The Kobra Kai Sensi John Kreese. Kreese isn't going to end it cause he believes in no mercy. Miyagi enters Daniel into The All Valley Tournament Miyagi & Kreese agree that none of Kreese's students can attack Daniel & Daniel can't attack The Kobra Kai students but if he doesn't show Kreese says \\"It's open season on him & you.\\" You have the classic training scenes waxing the cars sanding the wood classic lines like wax on wax off. You  learn about Miyagi servingin WW II & he had a wife & kid who died in a interment camp. Daniel has problems with Ali her parents are very high brow they want her to date Johnnny you have a scene where Daniel though Johnny & Ali were kissing later he finds out that she punched Johnny so they make up. So at the tournament Daniel suprises everyone & he makes it to the finals Kreese instructs 1 of his students Bobby Brown to hurt Daniel so Johnny will win. I don't know if anyone finds it funny but Bobby Brown. A Dr tells Daniel he's unable to compete Miyagi uses a Pain Supression Technique & Daniel returns before The Trophy is given to Johnny. Kreese tells Johnny to sweep the leg a classic line. Daniel uses The Crane Kick & defeats Johnny. Johnny hands him The Trophy. Ok I  know I might of skipped over some of the plot but Karate Kid is a solid & classic movie. Directing is great by John G Avildsen. Bill Conti's score was good. Pat Morita was great. Ralph Macchio did a very good job rememberable interaction between Morita & Macchio. Elisabeth Shue was good. Martin Kove wasn't in a huge role but he is very rememberable as Kreese. William Zabka was good in his role. So I will review Karate Kid II next.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I love so much about this film it's hard to know where to begin. The parallel narratives are credible, the acting is outstanding, the famous set and costumes are lavish and authentic, the story itself thematizes so many currents in American culture then that resonate even now: the political status of women (Margaret), racism (Chalky), the buying of votes (Nucky), the cynical attitude of the rich toward the law (Nucky and others), the plight of new immigrants whose dreams of America meet harsh reality (Margaret), the plight of returning veterans (Jimmy and Richard), religious fanaticism (the FBI director) the role of the mob, as well, of course. And what the film makes clear is that every ethnic group (not just the Italians) had elements that were involved in organized crime. Not that everything is depicted in a negative light. The music is so beautiful, nostalgic and well-performed. And Scorcese makes sure to remind us that the people living in the 20's were very modern: they had telephones, airplanes, went to the movies often . . . I just can't say enough. Get this series. It takes a couple episodes to put all the characters into place, but when it does . . . wow, I honestly haven't seen this kind of masterful filmmaking since \\"The Godfather\\" series!
B0038M2RL2|5.0|I'm going to review the 2nd Karate Kid movies Karate Kid II which is my favorite out of all 5 KK films 1&2 make a awesome double feature. Karate Kid II is underated imo. Released in 1986 directed by John G Avildsen. Pat Morita & Ralph Macchio return you also have Martin Kove in here for a small role. It also stars Tamlyn Tomita as Kumiko, Danny Kamelkona as Saito, Yuji Okumoto as Chozen, & Nobie McCarthy as Yukie. Story picks up after the 1st movie. You see Kreese is po'd that Johnny didn't win the tournament he breaks his 2nd Place Trophy & starts hitting him. Miyagi stops him Kreese wants to fight Miyagi he goes for a punch Miyagi moves out of the way & his fist goes through a windshield & tries to punch him again & the same thing happens you think Miyagi is going for the death blow but tweaks his nose & says HONK! 6 months later his Girlfriend Ali broke up with him Daniel's mom got a job in Fresno so he will live with Mr Miyagi. Miyagi gets a letter from Okinawa about his father dying he wants to see him 1 last time. Miyagi left Okinawa when he was 18 he loved a woman named Yukie who had an arranged marriage with Miyagi's friend Saito. 1 day Miyagi announced his love for her & he wanted to marry her in front of the whole town Saito felt betrayed & challenged him to a fight to the death. He left Okinawa rather than fight his friend. Daniel goes with him & when they arrive in Okinawa they are met by Chozen who is Saito's Nephew they are taken to a building where Saito shows up & hasn't forgiven him he still wants to fight him & he thinks that Miyagi is a coward. After WW II Saito took the village over & because an Industrial Business  Man. He took over the fishing population that was income for the villagers. They had to turn to farming. When Miyagi & Daniel come to the village their greeted by Yukie & her  Niece Kumiko. Yukie tells Miyagi that she never married Saito or at all. Miyagi's Father's dying wish is for his son & student to make peace but Saito tells Miyagi he has 3 days to mourn then they fight. Daniel reveals that Chozen's grocery business is a scam & that p       i           s          s         es  him off he & his henchies constantly stalks Daniel & Kumiko they have a few scuffles. You have a relationship with Daniel & Kumiko she shows him the old castle where The O Bon Festival used to be held before Saito takes over. They go into town & Miyagi & Yukie happen to there too. Good scene in the bar with Daniel breaking the sheets of ice.Saito threatens to tear down the village & redevelop  if Miyagi doesn't fight him which he agree's to. Before the fight is to take place a Typoon hits Okinawa & hit The Shack where Saito was preparing. Miyagi & Daniel help Saito & he forgives him. Daniel goes to help this girl stuck in The Bell Tower Saito tells Chozen to help he doesn't & in a moment of anger he tells Chozen \\"You are dead to me!\\" Chozen runs off. The next morning Saito & a bunch of workers show up to rebuild the village he allows The O Bon Festival to be held in castle again. During The O Bon Festival Kumiko is perfoming a dance Chozen decides to crash The Festival he wants to kill Daniel he is going down the same road as Saito. If Daniel doesn't fight him he will kill Kumiko. He agrees to it. The fight is better than the fight with Johnny in part 1. It's more physical & it's a fight to the death. He tries The Crane Kick doesn't work but uses a new technique called The Drum Technique.  He beats Chozen & says \\"Live or die man!?\\" Chozen says \\"Die!\\" Daniel tweaks the nose says honk cheesy yes but it works. The Glory Of Love by Peter Catera is great. John G Avildsen did a great job. Pat Morita was good again. Ralph Macchio was good again he had more to do. Tamlyn Tomita was good I liked her better than Elisabeth Shue as the love interest. Yujo Okumoto was good I liked him more than William Zabka & he's definitely better than that s  h      i      tt      y     p       i   ss      an t  soap            o  p        era actor in KK III. Nobu McCarthy was good. Danny Kamelkona wasn't bad & I bought that he was sorry. I know I did a bad job going through the plot. Next will be the worst sequel ever. Karate Kid III                          D            A    M        N!
B005974CDU|2.0|I'm not into reviewing music, but I felt I had no choice but to review their latest release.  I've been a huge DT fan since the early 90's.  Drums are my thing, and the news that MP was leaving left me void for many weeks, thinking that was the end of DT as I knew it.  I think I was right.  This CD is lacking pretty much off of the elements that make the great DT CD's so memorable.  It's obvious that every member of DT is insanely proficient at their instrument, but this CD doesn't do much for them.  It, to me, sounds like it was recorded under water.  It's very muddy sounding.  The drums are tucked way in the background and have really no attack whatsoever.  Might as well be a drum machine.  I think that without Portnoy's artistic leadership and in-your-face drumming style, DT may sink further in nothingness.  I'm not saying Mangini doesn't play well, he does.  But Portnoy has something that's I can't describe, but I can hear.  I've never heard any other drummer have it.  Portnoy was right, the band should have taken a break to recharge then regroup with a fresh outlook.  THAT would have made for a wicked album.  There's not one spot on A Dramatic Turn of Events that give me goosebumps.  THAT'S when you know you have a good album.  This one, just doesn't do it for me at all.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Nooooooooooo more changes.  Please re-release the original trilogy on blu-ray.  That would make me really happy and I would be willing to give you some more money in exchange.  Thanks.
B004V98UKS|2.0|The controls are terrible. If you mess up you have to quit or restart with a time penalty! Uninstalled until the developer puts more thought into a game before just throwing it out on the market to make a buck.
B005LZSOFW|5.0|Seriously, I've always been a big fan of Lady Gaga remixes, and these Yoü and I remixes do not disappoint. Sure, Lady Gaga remixes perhaps haven't been the huge hits that they used to be but once again, you will not be disappointed if you get these and they are a must for any Lady Gaga fan.
0062511408|5.0|El Alquimista: Una Fabula Para Seguir Tus Suenos, El Alquimista (Spanish Edition)  by Paulo Coelho (Kindle Edition)     Dicen que los libros llegan a la vida de uno en el momento preciso, aquellos libros que tienen un mensaje que va ayudar a darle lo el ajuste necesario al rumbo que lleva tu caminar (si es que sabes que vas en camino a algún lugar). Paolo Caelho tiene la magia con la que a través de sus palabras en una narración completamente fascinante y espectacular logra atraparte en un viaje fantástico lleno de sabiduría, ingenio, e intriga a abrirte el camino de tu propia alma, corazón y de tu propio ser interior como si fuese una meditación de transición continua y te sumerge a reencontrarte con ese poder inmenso que cada uno poseemos y hacernos ver que somos el actor principal de esta obra de vida en la que ahora mismo estamos jugando ese papel.    Es la primera obra que leo de Paolo Coelho y lo considero como una obra de motivación, auto ayuda, una herramienta eficaz para subir la auto estima, un componente esencial para redirigir el camino de la vida y además en estos tiempos de crisis que amenaza a todos los sistemas de vida de nuestro planeta se convierte en un concientizador para este problema.    Definitivamente Paolo Coelho es un genio con su pluma.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I watched the movie \\"Once\\" and the sound track was great and I wanted more.  The Swell Season is very good, I can listen to it over and over.
B00000K3D4|4.0|The Labyrinth has always been one of my favorite films since I first watched it as a young girl. The movie allows the viewer to escape to a world unknown with surprises and twists around every corner. The movie combines the world of fantasy with real life issues many people face while growing up. The movie features the well established puppet master Jim Henson's creative creations, musical numbers by the shockingly entrancing David Bowie, and a coming of age story all rolled into a fanciful plot.    The main character of this film is Sarah played by a young Jennifer Connolly. She is a girl trying to bridge the gap between being a child and becoming an adult.  In a childish moment she is angry that one of her teddy bears has been given to her newborn half-brother she wishes him away in a moment of selfishness. In that moment the goblins (puppets) show up to whisk her brother away to the castle in the center of the Labyrinth that is presided over by Jareth the Goblin King.  Jareth is played by the one and only David Bowie sporting and 80s hair band type hairdo and a lot of eyeliner. His character is convincingly creepy and elusive in his interactions with Sarah. The movie includes original songs sung by David Bowie that are incredibly catchy. I can recite the lyrics too most all of them with a little too much ease. The interactions between Sarah and Jareth are a very interesting dynamic of the film most notably the ballroom scene that has a Cinderella-esque feel to it until like the song David Bowie is singing says \\"As the world falls down\\" the world quite literally comes crashing down around them.          Jim Henson's puppets play the other main characters in this film.  The puppets in this film come in many shapes and sizes and their personalities and qualities range from endearing to funny to just plain creepy. The main puppets in this film actually develop as characters throughout the film learning important lessons and making new friends. I personally liked theinclusion of real people in this film compared to Jim Henson's previous film \\"The Dark Crystal\\" but the puppets remained the starts of the show.    The sets in this movie were pretty incredible considering it came out in 1986..  I was amazed at the diversity of environments that inhabit the labyrinth. There is everything from a royal garden to a \\"bog of eternal stench\\". The puppets are unique to each environment they are shown in. The set design really showcases the fanciful land of the labyrinth.    I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy and a good story. I thought the movie was incredibly creative and very unique. I personally love David Bowie so his role in the movie was very fun to watch. I continue to come back and watch this film every once in a while when I want to escape to a new land and listen to some catchy original songs.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|What a rare privelege it is to read a political autobiography that was clearly actually written by the subject, and is so forthright, honest and readable. There are no doubt other good examples of political biography, but I am not a big reader of the genre and consequently cannot think of one as good as this.     This books greatest advantage is it was written long before Obama had any thought of being elected as president of the United States. Consequently he gives us the kind of reflective account that reveals the true man, without showing signs of editing by political advisers.     Not that this book was written without any focus on future career. The book is reflective, but it is heavily influenced by issues of race and what it means to be a black man in modern America. The reader is left with an impression of a vision that is not spelled out in so many words, but hinted at. You feel that Obama has a hope for a new kind of conversation between races in America - but the book merely brings tensions and issues and hostory to the surface, without being in any way didactic.     Ultimately though this is a personal story of Obama's own self discovery as he comes to terms with who his father was - the absent father he never knew. As he describes the family grave in Kenya, you have to wonder - was there ever a president of the United States befoe whose father's grave was so unaddorned (I suspect this has changed by now, of course - but nevertheless, the point is that you just feel so connected to Obama here).     Elected the first black president of the United States, Obama's place in history is assured - whatever happens now. This book will be an invaluable aid to historians of the future - a real and personal first hand account in the words of the man that history will remember.     Reading the book, and particularly his searching for faith in the churches of Chicago, I felt that maybe he has not yet found what he is looking for. The section closed on an emotional note, describing the sermon on \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" - a title he took for his next book. But nowhere did there seem to be any mention of the Christian gospel and how he responded to that personally. That is not a criticism of the book though - it is just something revealing in the work.     All in all this was an excellent book. Off my usual subject matter but well worth reading.
0143034901|4.0|The Shadow of the Wind is a dark, richly layered mystery that speaks right to the heart of the book lover. Daniel's father, the owner of a Barcelona book store, takes him one night to a mystical and secret place known as the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Allowed to choose any book as his own to protect and keep, Daniel chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax. Entranced by his new book, Daniel sets out to find other works by Carax only to discover that the books are being destroyed. The copy Daniel has may be the last Carax book that exists. As Daniel uncovers the mystery surrounded the author Julian Carax, he puts himself and his friends in danger but also reveals the direction of his own life.<br /><br />Provocative and dangerous, Zafon writes a fascinating and glorious mystery. Daniel is surrounded by unique and perplexing characters--broken, brutal and haunted. Using just enough foreshadowing of peril and threat to keep the reader absolutely intrigued, the writer is taken deep into the shadows of a city struggling to return to it's pre-war grandeur. The city of Barcelona makes a fabulous Gothic setting and very nearly becomes a character in it's own right.<br /><br />Zafon is a brilliant story teller. I can't wait to read his other novels.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Pierce as ex-president makes us laughing at last.   He is the real actor.  This movie is very serious for the first sight but laughing at the end.  I can recommend it.

076115678X|5.0|I love the CG Handbook ! I have been doing my hair this way for 1 month now and it looks and feels great!  I like doing the daily routine and I have learned to not comb, brush, rub, scrub or otherwise interfere with my curl units.  I got my micro-fiber towel on clearance at the hardware store--it was for washing cars.  I have used some of the homemade products--lavendar water, avocado deep conditioner and they work very well. I feel confident enough now to let my hair grow longer.   I have given this book to my daugher who is a wavy girl and my sister who is a curly girl and they are into it too.  I wish I had this book when I was in high school--it would have saved me from years of hair torture.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|This album grew on me. I liked it on the first listen, but the more I listen the better it gets. It's complicated, but melodic. It's emotional, but easy to listen to while doing other things. It's one of the best albums I've bought in a while. Florence's voice is haunting and beautiful and every person who put together this album as talent at what they do. I look forward to seeing what the second album brings from this band.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|it's not even been out for a month and it's half off    at first i thought it was a great deal.. then i saw some of the \\"improvements\\"    I wouldn't even really care that much if they also included the original version just transferred to a higher res from the film    ugh
0385504225|3.0|I admit to being a fan of Dan Brown's books and have read them all, but I waited to read this one until I could find a cheap copy at a yard sale, since the reviews have been pretty negative. I just finished reading it and I had to make myself finish the last few chapters. The ending is a real letdown and a total departure from reality. We have a character whose hand was chopped off by a madman who then tortured him in inhuman ways, but once he is rescued, his main interest is in launching a tour for Robert Langdon of some important buildings of Washington DC. Oh yes, his sister, who had been abducted and put through a terrifying experience, relaxes by going with Langdon and enjoying the view atop the Capitol Bldg. Of course, all this is by way of explaining the final \\"secret\\" of an incredibly labyrinthine series of coded messages involving a pyramid, a capstone, and a mysterious box. But wouldn't these people be so traumatized and exhausted after their all night ordeal that watching the sun come up from the top of the Capital Bldg. would not be on their list of what to do right away?<br /><br />The bad guy in this book is REALLY bad, and there is a surprise about who he really is (although it seems other reviewers figured this out on their own). I could not get my mind around this guy and found his actions kind of unbelievable. The involvement of the CIA and the urgent actions of the weird security head Sato led me to think we were going to hear about a real national security threat if the \\"secret\\" got out, but what followed was a monumental letdown. It was just more of the Washington elite protecting its own.<br /><br />What this book DID do for me though was to spark an interest in the monuments in our nation's capital. It's got me thinking about a trip to DC to see these places. This book is a reminder that our founding fathers were, in fact, Masons and their Masonic training DID influence the design of our capital city. It also must have influenced their thinking on other matters too. Dan Brown clearly did plenty of research, both on the Masons and on the buildings in Washington DC. But, interesting as it is as a city, Washington DC doesn't quite match the (for me) exotic venues in DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons.<br /><br />The stuff about blood sacrifice ended up in strange contradictions as to whether this is part of the Dark Side or the Light Side. The book also has a definite \\"Star Wars\\" scene concerning father and son. And while the Masonic rituals get a defense in this book, they are depicted as being confusing to the masses, and so must be kept secret.<br /><br />This book ended up being too preachy about stuff that did not illuminate the characters or the plot. I am familiar with a lot of the \\"science\\" of Katherine Solomon, but I doubt any of it will change the world. The experiment about a small weight loss at the moment of death is a real experiment done back in the early Twentieth Century by Duncan MaDougall, with the stated result (there is a very small weight loss of 21 grams at the moment of death), but it has not led to everyone accepting the existence of the soul. There is plenty of evidence for the continuation of consciousness after death, but it is not the kind of evidence that can be replicated on command and lots of people never inform themselves on these matters, so it has not caused a mass change of belief. Nor did Noetic Science have much to do with the plot in the same way as the revelations (speculations?) in The DaVinci Code. It just seemed like the author wanted to work in a lot of stuff about human consciousness and the oneness of the universe, but it ended up being extra baggage.<br /><br />This book would have been better if the characters had been more developed and more realistic, if the plot had taken fewer twists and turns that kept you reading more but enjoying it less, and the author had refrained from endlessly preaching to us about the coming enlightenment of mankind. Dan Brown hasplenty of advice here in these reviews, so I'll look forward to seeing what he does next.ws, so I'll look forward to seeing what he does next.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|I was a little skeptical buying shoes online because of the sizing issues other reviewers had but i took a leap and ordered a pair of size 9s which is the same size as my walmart galoshes, though in regular shoes I normally wear between a 7.5-8.5, and figured if they didn't fit me they would fit my bigger footed step-daughters or my smaller footed mother. They came in this morning and the foot fit is a little big but not too big that its bothersome and the calf fit is snug (my calves are on the more muscled side) which I like because with the walmart pair there is a gap for  fiddleback spiders to fall into and bite me when hauling wood which happened to me a few weeks ago lol.I don't find them awkward to walk in but i'm used to working in galoshes.I love the thicker toe which seems like it will help cushion the impact when a large farm animal steps on my foot. Anyway today is the real test as we will be working on a chicken coop and pig pen if I don't like them after that I will edit my review, if I still love them I will just leave this one up.
0143039881|5.0|Arendt's 'Eichmann in Jerusalem' is a fascinating study at multiple levels.  Her knowledge of the history and bureaucracy of the Haolocaust is amazing in and of itself.  Her knowledge of Eichmann's participation is also fascinating.  At the same time, while not questioning the justice of Eichmann's execution, she is rightly critical--even contemptuous--of the kidnapping and the two years long 'legal' prosecution of Eichmann.  At one point she actually denies that her work is a study on the nature of evil but, in my opinion, the totality of Arendt's work is--whether she intended it herself--is precisely a study of a PARTICULAR kind of evil.  The subtitle of the book, 'The Banality of Evil', is a fair summation of Arendt's opinion.<br /><br />Eichmann, in fact, was relatively small-fry in terms of the policies and philosophies of Nazi genocide.  He was an apparachnik, no more, no less.  He definitely wasn't the 'sadistic killer' the Jerusalem court adjudged him to be.  He wasn't even particularly anti-semitic and he wasn't by nature either a torturer or murderer.  He was the perfect gear in a complex, illogical and totally cynical machine.  If the Nazi political machine had been 'good'-- if it had genuinely tried to help the Jews and all other peoples--Eichmann would have performed his 'good' role with equal dedication and skill.  If the system had required Eichmann to perform the role of a Mother Theresa, Eichmann would have tried to prove himself the ideal saint.<br /><br />Success, order, social standing and acceptance were the gods Eichmann worshipped.  With some truth, Eichmann complained that his Nazi leaders misused Eichmann's highest qualities  Initially his job was relatively--ahhh--banal.  He was to help get Jews out of Germany, sometimes to Palestine, itself.  If things had stopped at this point, Eichmann would now be regarded as something of a pro-Zionist.  Things, however, didn't stop there and the system gradually, gradually, gradually morphed into an incomparable killing machine.  Eichmann morphed right along with it.<br /><br />Still this is a small part of the story and couldn't justify the Israel's fracturing of international law to kidnap such a non-entity in Buenos Aires.  On the face of it, Eichmann simply wasn't worth it.  Ben Gurion must have known it but reckoned that Eichmann--and a 'trial' against Eichman--could serve Israeli purposes.  Eichmann wasn't the point of the trial.  The TRIAL was the purpose of the trial.  Eichmann's presence afforded the prosecutors to--once again once--bring forth the voluminous evidence of the Nazi genocidal atrocity.  Most of the 'evidence' had absolutely nothing to do with Eichmann.  It was an Israeli effort to gain 'justice', publicity and sympathy for the Jewish plight and Israeli survival.  As such, it certainly didn't end with Eichmann's death.  'We must never forget', declared Simon Wiesenthal, as he hunted down Nazi war criminals.  But what if we run out of 'war criminals'?  What happens--as it has already happened--that they are all captured, punished or, especially dead of old age?  The category of 'war criminal' therefore reaches downward to young guards drafted into service of a criminal regime.  What happens when even these are gone?<br /><br />No matter.  Who are the guilty?  Is an Eichmann or even a Heydrich, more evil than Ted Bundy?  Bundy--up close and personal--kidnapped, raped, slowly tortured and murdured dozens of young women.  Bundy gained physical pleasure and gratification in acts that unquestionably would have made even the most Jew-hating Nazi sick to his stomach.  Eichmann, Heydrich and many, many others certainly did more harm, in a numerical sense, than did Bundy.  So is evil a function of numbers?  Is a person who kills ten people less evil than a person who kills ten thousand?  Is a Communist who expedites the murder of an entire class of people, such as the Kulaks of the Soviet Union, less evil than a person who expedites the murder of ethnic groups in Nazi-occupied Europe?<br /><br />At the same time it can be argued that Bundy and all those like him are 'sick' which somehow moderates the enormity of their crimes.  Then again, how do we know they are 'sick'?  Does the nature of the crime define mental illness?  If so, maybe Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and Eichmann were simply diseased souls--victims of their heredities and environments--who simply couldn't help themselves when presented with a certain set of circumstances.  Maybe none of us are ultimately responsible for anything.  I don't know but I do know that any society that adopts this nihilist philosophy--which many 'liberal' western societies have toyed with--the world is genuinely lost.e?

B004SBB0LU|4.0|I finally got to see Queen in 2009 when they played with Paul Rogers.  I have every cd and around 9 dvds of the group.  Back in the 70's people would make fun of me for worshiping a band with such openly gay undertones.  It didn't matter to me, their music was easily the best.  The rarities aren't that special with only five or six per cd but the remastered sound is a vast improvement over previous versions.  While other bands will fade away in future years Queen will  always be heard as long as there are sporting events.  We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions are eternal.  I appreciate the exclusive Amazon edition with five cds coming in a protective box.  I was debating on buying it now or waiting to see if after all 15 are released if there would be a special edition that carried all 15 studio albums but couldn't wait that long.  If you decide to update your Queen catalog the best and most affordable place to do so is with Amazon.com.
0345522478|5.0|This book is certainly different. It combines ancient myth with modern times. Our 2100 year old Druid, Atticus O'Sullivan, living in Arizona has been hounded by Aenghus Og a powerful figure from Irish mythology for centuries. Atticus who is a handsome Irish guy appearing to be 21 who owns an occult book store, has a magic sword that Aenghus Og intends to take from him. Atticus has an interesting array of \\"maybe\\" friends including The Morrigan who is a seductive Goddess of death who can turn into a crow at will. Atticus has a great deal of power which he draws from the earth and has studied magic for centuries which has enabled him to stay alive. It does appear quite a few very powerful entities want him dead. Told in the first person, Atticus is funny, clever and witty and then there is his dog. Oberon is an Irish Wolf Hound who through some magic spells can communicate with his master using telepathy. Oberon has as good a sense of humor as Atticus so their banter is just great.    Did I mention witches and werewolves. There are some good and some very bad witches involved in the story and Atticus's attornies are - werewolves and a vampire. A doctor who does some work on him after a very bad fight is also part of the pack. Adding to the humor and revealing a little of our Druid's soft side is his neighbor, an elderly Irish lady whose yard he takes care of for her. Their interaction is funny and sweet too.    Okay, I admit there is just no way to explain this book, so just read it if you want a fun and interesting trip pulling ancient Celtic Gods into modern day Arizona. You will laugh but you will also have some tense moments, because these guys play serious and it's not all fun and games. There are swordfights and magic flying back and forth. There is no romance in this book but I suspect there is to be some in the next book. You can tell this is a book about a guy and his dog written by a guy - that is probably what made it fun.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett duets with the some of the biggest names in music. My favorite track is \\"Who Can I Turn To When Nobody Needs Me\\".  Tony sings this song with Queen Latifah.  This song is very soothing.  It is refreshing to hear a softer side of this rap star.  \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" is an engaging duet with Lady Gaga.  She sounds playful here.  This song is a delightful surprise.  I love the sax playing on this song.  \\"One More For My Baby And One More For The Road\\" is a song I can see myself listening to with a friend while enjoying a drink in a bar. Amy Winehouse lends her vocal talents on the song \\"Body And Soul\\". Her vocals have a pleasant jazzy quality.  The piano playing is beautiful on this song. Yesterday I Heard The Rain is a song featuring a singer named Alejandro Sanz.  This song is sung partly in Spanish.  It is a lovely language to listen to.  The horns playing on the song are just superb.  \\"On The Sunny Side Of The Street\\" featuring Willie Nelson.  The guitar playing on this track is smooth and such a treat to listen to. \\"Stranger In Paradise\\" is a song featuring Andrea Bocelli.  Andrea's voice is very uplifting.  \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\\" is a classic song featuring Aretha Franklin.  Her soulful voice matches Tony's voice perfectly on this song.  Carrie Underwood sings on the song \\"It Had To Be You\\".  This song is very pretty and romantic. Carrie can sing anything flawlessly.  \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" is a song with Michael Buble.  I like the upbeat tone of this song.  \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a song I can relax to at the end of the day. KD Lang and Tony sound so smooth singing together.  The music on this CD is very enjoyable.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Okay, I've bought the Star Wars movies like 3 times now, and I will not buy it again.  This is where I draw the line.  I don't care that it's now in a new format or that a few tiny things have been changed, I just don't care.  It's the SAME DAMN MOVIE!!!  I've probably spent over $200.00 USD over the years on these movies alone.<br /><br />First of all, I don't care about all the special features, I don't care about the bonus materials, I don't care about the original scripts, or the interviews, or the commentaries, I just want the movies.  That's all I want!  Say what you will about VHS, but at least in those days you had like 3 previews, the FBI warning, and then it was the movie, and you didn't have the price jacked up because of all these special features that no one really gives a rip about!<br /><br />Okay, now I know everyone is up in arms about the changes that George made to the movies and frankly I am ticked off too.  The only good changes that he's ever made were putting the animation of the sandcrawler actually moving in A New Hope, that looked cool, the revised explosions of both Death Stars, definite improvement, and finally the extended wampa scene in Empire Strikes Back, that was done very well.  Everything else was garbage and unnecessary!<br /><br />As far as the new changes, I really don't care about the Ewoks blinking, seriously, I don't.  But when you make Darth Vader, the biggest baddest guy in the Galaxy whine out the lines, \\"No...NOOOO!!!!\\"  Like a whiny emo teenager, that is UNFORGIVEABLE!!!  That scene was already a masterpiece!  Adding that line of dialogue was the equivalent of putting a Snidley Whiplash mustache on the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />George, if you really want to \\"fix\\" one of your movies, go back and FIX Howard the Duck.  Go back and FIX Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  THOSE movies need fixing!  Star Wars was perfect the way it was, and you just keep screwing it up more and more every single time you re-release it.  And why are you re-releasing it every 5 years or so?  Do you not have anything better to do with your time?  Instead why don't you go work on the Star Wars TV series that you promised fans would be done by 2009???<br />Also, if you really want to change the mythos of Star Wars or add something to the storyline, why don't you just MAKE ANOTHER DAMN MOVIE!?!  Seriously!!!  Just go make another movie and stop trying to fix what ISN'T BROKEN!!!<br /><br />George, I've been a fan of Star Wars my whole life, I've played the games, I've watched the movies, I've watched BOTH animated Clone Wars series, I've collected the action figures, and I've even done the Star Wars roleplaying game, BOTH versions, d6 and d20, I've also read most of the books and comics.  And frankly between the declining quality of the books, the crappy comics that are being released, and now this unholy abomination, I'm surprised you even still have a fanbase.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS!!!r so?  Do you not have anything better to do with your time?  Instead why don't you go work on the Star Wars TV series that you promised fans would be done by 2009???  Also, if you really want to change the mythos of Star Wars or add something to the storyline, why don't you just MAKE ANOTHER DAMN MOVIE!?!  Seriously!!!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Video quality ranges from reference quality (Revenge of the Sith and Empire Strikes Back) to excellent (Attack of the Clones, A New Hope, and Return of the Jedi) to very good (The Phantom Menace). Reference quality audio throughout all six, though it's the best in Phantom Menace.  Loads of extras and simply a must have purchase for home theater buffs as well as science fiction fans.  As a guy who grew up with these movies from the original theatrical releases, the edits many are complaining about just aren't that big of a deal.
B005974CNA|5.0|A Dramatic Turn of Events is definitely my favorite post Scenes From a Memory release. My favorite DT albums are Scenes and Awake because both albums have an undeniable vibe running through them that is lacking from other releases. I like all of the releases, but those two have always been special to me. This album is similarly special. It is difficult to explain why, but everything just seems to click. I have always wondered what DT would have sounded like if their label didn't interfere with Falling Into Infinity and they were able to really record the follow up to Awake. In some ways A Dramatic Turn of Events has that sound to me. It is more modern sounding and has a more Jordan Rudess feel, but at the same time the songs have a similar vibe.    My favorite song on the album at the moment is \\"Outcry\\" which has received far less attention. In many ways, I feel like that is the DT song I have been waiting to hear for a long time. Apart from the fact that it is a well written song, it is a summary of DT's history in one song that still maintains the ability to add new ideas and look forward to the future. There are sections that recall concepts from Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings as well as a clear \\"Metropolis\\" section and yet the song avoids feeling stale and redundant.    Musically, the album has all five members performing much better than they have on recent releases. Petrucci and Rudess and up to their usual tricks and Myung has reestablished being a presence in the band. James LaBrie is definitely the standout performer on this album in my mind. In recent years, his parts have seemed less impressive than they used to be. A lot of people claim that this is due to his vocal injury, but his solo record have always yielded very impressive vocals. DT has finally let him sing the way he should be singing and it is great to hear James LaBrie being James LaBrie again. I love his performance on this record. I'm sure the James LaBrie haters will still complain, but I never understood why someone who hates James's voice would bother listening to DT in the first place. He's been in the band for 20 years now and has sung on 10 of the 11 albums. He's as much at part of DT as anyone else.    Finally, Mike Mangini has been getting some complaints from people needlessly. The drums are mixed fine and I never found myself wishing there were more drums in the mix. His performance is amazing. It is a little bit more restrained than it could be (considering his abilities), but it always fits the song, which is what a good drummer should do. Honestly, I forgot that they changed drummers listening to the album because many of his fills are what Mike Portnoy would have played.     As a final note I will say this. I know a lot of people are concerned about the future of DT and Mike Mangini vs Mike Portnoy. DT has changed a bit and there will be differences, but I am looking forward to the future. Mike Portnoy wasn't feeling DT anymore (which is his right to do) so his heart would not have been in the record. I am not wishing he was back in the band because I'm sure there would be conflict or they would get stale as a result of his lack of interest. However, watching the documentary will show you just how much Mike Mangini wants to be in DT. I don't think anyone in the world will ever be as excited about anything as he was when he found out he was in the band. So in my mind, DT are in a better place now than they would have been if there was no line-up change and they have released an incredible album. So, stop worrying about the future of DT and just enjoy their new masterpiece.

B0009UC7HA|5.0|I love these adventure movies that Disney keeps putting out. The action is good, the puzzles are fun to try to solve as the movie progresses, and the violence isn't over the top. Just a good fun movie for the whole family.
0061784788|4.0|It makes sense that Rollins was selected to author the latest of the Indiana Jones book series as his style and interests align perfectly. And that's exactly the same feel that you get when you read his latest, \\"Devil Colony,\\" an adventuresome thrill ride across America (physically and historically) and the globe during a battle between good (Sigma Force) and evil (the Guild). A suspension of disbelief is certainly required as Rollins attempts to illuminate historic mysteries (the downfall of the Anastasi people, the connection between early Americans and Hebrews, and what appears to be ancient nanotechnology), but if you can manage that, this book is a fun ride.<br /><br />Though, this is the latest in a series of Sigma Force novels, the author fills the reader in with necessary back story seamlessly so as to ensure a smooth story and while the villains are comic book-thin, they are interesting and provide for a compelling conflict. If you can handle the use of words like \\"now,\\" \\"ago,\\" \\"this,\\" in third-person past tense narrative and the aforementioned suspension of disbelief, you will love this novel!
B004RC8NXI|3.0|This was an ok movie. Kind of sappy and cheesy, not a bad date-night movie, but not Ashton Kutcher's best work. I'm stoked that I could get the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital combo, then again, this isn't a movie you'd want to watch on an ipod, not that great for solo viewing.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|While fantasy action and special effects have been a trademark to the X-Men movie franchise since the beginning, the character development and plot has been less than spectacular, some outings much more than others.<br /><br />While X-Men: First Class is part reboot, part prequel, where it fails to stay consistent with the other movie's plotlines, it does in fact deliver where it counts: an engrossing story that sets the moods and characters up for you to experience and enjoy.<br /><br />As with the 90's Batman movies, X-Men traditionally just assumed you knew the characters, and skipped all that \\"character development\\" stuff, because who doesn't know Wolverine, right? That mentality isn't present in this latest film, and aside from a couple references that only returners to the series will catch, First Class lets the complete newcomer walk straight into the series without having prior knowledge of the comics or films.<br /><br />All in all, a brilliant, enjoyable action/adventure/drama flick that is enjoyable to sci-fi/fantasy buffs and X-Men fans alike.
B0001I55NS|5.0|THe movie is good. I'm a history buff, so for me it's fun to imagine that such a thing is possible. Good acting, good settings, good action without going overboard with the violence.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well, what can I say that all the other reviewers haven't yet? It's been over 30 years since the original theatrical release of Star Wars premiered and every release since has slowly been hacked, remodeled, tossed like pizza dough and dipped in 6 month old ludafisk. In layman's terms, this movie STINKS! I mean come on!! You wonder why George Lucas only directed 4 of the 6 movies (three of them being episodes I thru III....ehh). And this is the guy that just HAD to have Jar Jar Binks in his films, a character that is undoubtedly the most obnoxious and irritating alien creature ever created.<br /><br />That said, I can say that the movies do look good, I mean, besides all the countless CGI additions that look ridiculously fake. I liked the old method of using actual models for all the ships and vehicles which looked realistic. I also liked the old Yoda muppet which had real skin, hair, and meshed well with the human characters on screen. But now everything seems to be computer generated because George Lucas thinks it's cooooool, he loves this stuff. Hell, might as well make Luke Skywalker a CGI character and Han Solo into a long eared Gungan. But I was never a fan of the prequel trilogy, i thought the Phantom Menace was extremely boring and the whole Jar Jar Binks as comedic relief was just plain awful. But I suppose if the Imperial Empire can be defeated my some primitive Ewoks [that now blink their eyes?] who fight with sharp wooden sticks then I guess anything is possible in Lucas Land. The new movies were obviously targeting the younger demographic who may have been too young to see the old trilogy when it was re-released in theaters, when really it should be targeting the older folks who have seen it.<br /><br />I am a die hard original trilogy supporter, but the changes that were implemented in the new Blu Ray release (which took WAY too long to release in my opinion) were unnecessary and only detracted from the story. I'm not sure what compelled Lucas to suddenly add some garbage dialogue and make things look more unrealistic, but I guess they are his movies and he has the supreme power to do what he wants with them. But overall, I'm glad to have a high definition Star Wars series at my disposal and I GUESSSSSS I can [grudgingly] overlook these stupid changes. I waited far to long for this release to boycott it completely. But if you are a true to the bone Star Wars fan I may advise waiting for a re-release (If it actually happens) that has removed these unusual changes; i.e. Darth Vader's now infamous NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO in episode VI or Ben Kenobi's elementary scream in episode IV.<br /><br />When it ain't broke, don't fix it George. Listen to your fans, stop tinkering with your masterpieces!bage dialogue and make things look more unrealistic, but I guess they are his movies and he has the supreme power to do what he wants with them.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|I recently bought Centennial and Blue&Gray, both pretty good, but the Blu-Ray version of Lonesome Dove was very surprising in that the video and audio quality were both excellent.  If not for the somewhat-cheesy writing and acting of older movies (and excess fill lighting), you would think you were watching a new show. Overall, excellent.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|Once I started this book I couldn't put it down - such a thriller and every chapter brought new, and sometimes conflicting information - but this just makes you want to keep reading to figure out what is true and what isn't.<br /><br />Waking up every day with no memory, Christine must piece together her whole life. Her husband Ben is there to help her and so is a psychologist who suggests she keep a journal every day. It's through this journal that Christine begins learning and remembering more about her life. It's there we learn that Christine hasn't told her husband she's meeting a psychologist to help her with her memory - but why would she keep this from him? We also learn that her husband doesn't tell her the whole truth every day and as she begins remembering small things she begins to question everything and everyone - who is lying and who is telling the truth? Can she trust these re-emerging memories or are the false memories?<br /><br />As I read this book my idea of what was true changed with every chapter I finished - it was an excellent book that kept me guessing till the very end.

B00005RHGL|5.0|Ok  I'm probably the odd one here but I liked BOTH Tombstone and Wyatt Earp.  The story was being told in two different ways...  the Costner movie gave you the back ground of Wyatt Earp from as a child to \\"Tombstone\\".  I think they were trying to explain why Wyatt Earp what the way he was,  where as the Russell movie started later when they were adults.  Different takes on the same story.  Too bad they came out at the same time.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|The novel opens with a dramatic scene: a woman and her young daughter see someone they love - we don't yet know who - hanging from a tree, having just been lynched. From there the story goes back to the beginning but this dramatic opening had me hooked! Lavinia, who is called several variations of this name throughout the book, is an Irish orphan who is taken as a servant, a white girl who feels most at home with the black slaves she works alongside - these people become her family and the people she loves and trusts more than anything. Her world is turned upside down when she's suddenly sent to live with another family (the white family's sister) and suddenly she can no longer be close to those she's considered her real family. We follow Lavinia from childhood to young adulthood, where she moves from an orphaned servant girl, to a young woman of status who after marriage, returns to her childhood home - only instead of being a servant she's now being served. Woven in are the stories of the other characters - the strong and wise  Papa, the kind and generous Captain, the horrid Rankin. Every character is written so well you either love them or hate them - which I'm certain is exactly what the author intended. Overall an excellent read that kept me captivated and wanting more.

1609611543|5.0|I have Hashimoto's Disease and should not eat gluten products.  This book was very helpful and explains a lot of the reason why I have gained back 10 pounds this past year, (lost 70 pounds 5 years ago) while eating no more than I ever did and only \\"diet\\" foods.   Most \\"diet\\" meals contained wheat so that is why I continued to hang on to the weight and couldn't seem to lose any more.  I got a juicer and juice at least twice daily, eat nuts, nut butters and rice products to supplement.  I've lost a few pounds and feel much better.  Highly recommend this book.
0786838655|5.0|i am 13 years old now but i was 11 when i read percy jackson. before i started to read the book i did not mind reading but i did not do for fun. then i started to read HP but only when i had nothing else to do. anyway every body in my class was reading percy, so i decicided to read the 1st chapter. and that was the start of my reading career. i was hooked! it has what every kid loves action,adventure,betrail, and so much more. when people say books take you to wonderful places will this book does. it takes you to lotus casino,underworld,its fantastic. i have the series to thank for my A in the greek mythology portion of languge arts. this is a must read page turner.every character is likeible (well not all characters) in so many ways and im a boy saying that! i'd give it 10 if i could.you rock Rick!!!!

B002JCSRKC|5.0|I wanted a simple but cute rain boot for year round use.  I have heavy Sorels for winter weather and just wanted something light for those rainy days.  This one certainly fits the bill.  Because of the lighter material, I don't know if it would keep my feet warm in the winter even when worn with those fleece boot liners.  But that's not what I got it for, so I don't care.<br /><br />The material doesn't look cheap like some other brands and the boots are light as a feather.  They even have some minimal but useful arch support.  I've been taking my dog for walks with them on and at no point did they get uncomfortable.  I have wider feet and average size calves and found the fit to be true to size.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|At first hearing samples, I was thinking, this release was the one that was gonna lose me. Then I heard \\"Tragedy\\" in full and bought the album...either way I had to, it had been way to long since a Primus album. I can say now I'm enjoying this much more than later releases and is working its way right up with their classic stuff. Love the lyrics. Wish they would have given us more album artwork with this one....with these lyrics endless possibilties but a minor complaint. Musically fantastic and it is a real grower for me. Sit with this one if it don't take right away, you might be suprised.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Just got this Blu-Ray.  Was very happy to pre-order this only to find out when it gets there that the discs won't play in anything.  In fact, it completely locked up my Blu-Ray player (Samsung BD-P3600) so that I could not even eject the disc.  Luckily the power button still worked and I was able to power down and then hit the eject button to power back up, which ejected the disc before it tried to read it.  Tried to play it in my brand new Dell XPS-17 and again the movie doesn't respond to commands at all- just get to the opening splash screen where you can select \\"Play\\", but you can't actually select it, so you can't watch the movie.  Obviously there is something new about these movies that no players have the ability to play them, so why even release it yet?  What a disappointment.  UPDATE:  I bought an OPPO BDP-93 from Amazon and it has no problem playing any of the discs, so I changed the rating to 4 stars.  Deduct one star for the \\"Noooooooooo\\" added in \\"The Return of the Jedi\\".  Really, Lucas?  Just cheesy.
B005DZMP00|5.0|Two discs-78,77 minutes each approximately.  The sound is very good-crisp and clean, with good separation between instruments.  The packaging is a bit strange.  It's the usual tri-fold wallet style holder, with the discs slipping inside cardboard pockets, along with the booklet.  The best way to slide the discs out is to slightly squeeze the top and bottom of the holder, and the disc will slip out enough to grab it.  This will, hopefully, prevent tearing the cardboard.  But the graphics on the front and back covers are upside down relative to each other.  Inside there's no information, photos, or graphics of any kind-it's blank, except for a list of tracks, times, and locations, and band personnel.  That information too,is upside down relative to the front cover.  The 8 page booklet is filled with small color photos from the tour-there's no essay or information, except for a tour itinerary.  But the \\"Ice Cream Kid\\" is back, thanks to Stanley Mouse, who was partially responsible (with Alton Kelley) for the original album's artwork-a nice touch.<br /><br />This compilation is taken from the 73 CD set that's been released on the Dead website.  All the music from the '72 tour can be purchased as a package from the Dead.  This 2 disc release only begins to hint at the musical treasures from the 22 concerts in '72.  Hopefully Rhino will release individual sets in the future,but if you can swing it, the complete series is fantastic.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS FOR DEADHEADS!  AS OF A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THE FIRST SIX SHOWS CAN NOW BE PURCHASED INDIVIDUALLY, WITH THE REMAINING SHOWS BEING RELEASED IN ORDER IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  There's so much great music from each concert that picking single shows is difficult.  I'm listening to the shows chronologically once again, and it's difficult to pick one show over another.  The \\"Dark Star\\" concerts are always a favorite, and  appears in 11 of the 22 sets, and when they do play it (and \\"The Other One\\"), those concerts seem to rise to the top.  Cheers.<br /><br />If you've heard the remastered original \\"Europe '72\\" release, \\"Hundred Year Hall\\", \\"Steppin' Out\\", or \\"Rockin' The Rhein\\", you'll know what to expect as far as sound/music quality.  Depending on the venue the sound will range from close-up and warm, to a punchy live feel.  But don't worry, the sound never gets in the way of the music.<br /><br />Highlights are many.  \\"Bertha\\", from the fourth concert, is full of that energy and good time feel only the Dead can relay.  \\"Chinatown Shuffle\\", from the same concert, is just that-a great shuffle that gives Pigpen another chance to step up to the mic.  \\"Beat It On Down The Line\\" (by the great Jesse Fuller), recorded in Luxembourg from the last half of the tour, is representative of an old Dead favorite played with energy.  \\"Black-Throated Wind\\", from the same Copenhagen concert as \\"Bertha\\", is a prime example of the band at their best-this is one of the best renditions of this song from the tour.  \\"Dire Wolf\\" is from the concert that was released as \\"Hundred Year Hall\\", and, again, is one of the best versions from the tour.  \\"Not Fade Away\\", from the first concert at Wembley, is part of an intense second half where the Dead are firing on all cylinders.  The band begins this song and then segues into \\"Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad\\", which flows back into \\"Not Fade Away\\"-all in a fine 13 minutes of the Dead doing what they do best.<br /><br />Arguably, the true highlight of this compilation is \\"Dark Star\\"-\\"Drums\\"-\\"The Other One\\", from the Bickershaw Festival.  The 19 minutes of \\"Dark Star\\" is one of the best on the tour.  The short \\"Drums\\" flows into \\"The Other One\\", which ebbs and flows for 30 minutes into different forms (like \\"Dark Star\\") before coming back to Earth.  This is the Dead at one of their improvisational peaks.  But fans of the band will have their own highlights-there's so much great music here.<br /><br />\\"Music has infinite space.  Music is an infinite cylinder, it's open-ended, it's space\\".  Jerry Garcia speaking on the tour about their music.  Listening to this compilation you begin to understand what he meant.r music.

B0015DROBO|2.0|I did not like this book. I did not like this book's writing. I can't even...a critic of mine once claimed that I often \\"confused dialogue and action for summary\\" and this hurt my storytelling. Having read TGwtDT I can now safely say, \\"THANK GOD I CONFUSE DIALOGUE AND ACTION FOR SUMMARY.\\" Nothing happens in this book. Nothing. We are told that a lot happens but the entire thing reads like a sum up. In fact, at one point the lead character is introduced and we are told that she writes excellent summaries of the people she spies on. I couldn't help thinking throughout this book that it was written just like one of those excellent summaries, which is so very boring. At no point are we given any feeling for the characters, we never walk a minute in their shoes, we never feel their pain. We are told that they are cold, or that they are sad, or whatever, but nothing with any heart. Oh, and we also get a detailed list of every ingredient that anyone puts on a sandwich. So, yeah, my pulse never went up while reading but I knew whether or not our hero had capers on her sandwich. And, just to really break all the rules, we are also told whenever one of our detectives is *going* to find a break in the case in the near future. Oh the suspense.<br /><br />Annoyingly there's a great murder mystery buried under all of this, but the writing was just baffling to me.<br /><br />No thank you.
B000KP62MA|5.0|This is a great CD/DVD set. I LOVE 30 STM, and this is great for any fan. IMO A Beautiful Lie is the best record ever, and the addition of a DVD made it even better. I LOVE the live performances, and The Kill video. If you are a Mars fan don't hesitate on this one.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom Selleck has always been an actor I enjoy watching but he was fantastic in this show along with the other six in the series. Most programs today use bloody shootings, blowing things up or torture as entertainment. Not so here. If you want good acting with likeable, along with a few hateful characters, this is a show I think you would enjoy. it is easy on the ears as well since foul language and swearing are not used. What makes it special? Tom Selleck's character is flawed.........yet his \\"want\\" for justice and his acting on that want the best way he can, make you anxious to see what will happen next. The scenery is a real bonus.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|By double album I mean something Opeth fans would have really dug. Heritage released with another album with the death vocals and all the trimmings, would have made this a much more accepted album and thats coming from a longtime Bloodbath/Opeth fan. This one is way heavy, just a much different kind of heavy. I love the vintage feel. The drums and bass are exceptional and worth it all. This one is gonna take listens, repeatedly, to fully appreciate. I enjoy this much more than Damnation by far since so many people seem to be comparing. Many will never accept this but it is a great album with full potential to be seen. I do miss those qualities of old people are missing but I'm gonna sink my teeth into this.
B003INBNXO|5.0|The BEST Martial Arts movie ever, for HONOR!!! Ip Man challenged a Japanese General to a duel, based on a true story, that makes this movie even better....Great fighting scenes too, just PHENOMENAL!!! It deserves more recognition than what it's gotten that's for sure. Now I must purchase Ip Man 2.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|Three discs-62,64,72 minutes each approximately.  The sound is good, with good separation between the instruments, except the bass which is recorded/mixed a bit low in the music.  The DVD is about 1 hour long.  This is the same DVD released as part of the 2009 70 CD package of Davis' music, and it gives you a feel for the depth of playing from consummate musicians in  this band.  The discs are snapped inside a quad-fold wallet style cardboard holder.  The 26 page booklet is loose inside the package-there's no \\"slot\\" for it, and it could easily fall out.  There's an essay by Ashley Kahn, who has written about Davis, Coltrane, and other jazz greats.  There's also a number of period b & w photos throughout the booklet.  Track information is printed on the back of the package-some details in very small font-and also inside the booklet.<br /><br />This has been a fine summer/fall for music, with the GRATEFUL DEAD releasing a 73 CD, Europe '72 package, the 4 CD Jimi Hendrix at Winterland compilation, and now this release from Miles Davis.  It's also interesting that each of these groups had something in common-namely to push music somewhere new, exciting, and different.<br /><br />This music, by Davis' second great band, was recorded in Europe while the band was part of the \\"Newport Jazz Festival in Europe\\" package.  Also performing were Gary Burton, Archie Shepp, Thelonious Monk, Sarah Vaughan, and others.  This music by Davis' band has been bootlegged for years, so it's nice to hear an officially sanctioned release with good sound.  If you've heard \\"Winter In Europe 1967\\", or the massive but fine \\"Live at the Plugged Nickel\\" set, then you have an idea in what direction this music is going.<br /><br />  Davis and the band were looking to play jazz in a new direction-\\"Even we didn't know where it was all going to.  And every night I would have to react\\". As Davis has said about this band.  Gone were the standard jazz changes-this band played a cooler, more abstract music, while still based in the blues.  The band plays with a combination of logic, trust, and emotion.  While the basic melody was used, Davis was playing in a more modal style.  Even the format had changed-Davis would now blend the end of one song into the next, with no formal start or stop.  His playing is lively and intelligent, and contains a lot of excitement.  Shorter's sax,  with a debt to Coltrane, was emotional and intelligent.  Hancock could play anything from swing to be-bop, to this new style of jazz-listen to his piano playing, from rapid notes to delicate fills.  Carter was an intelligent, sensitive bassist, and Williams (still a teenager) was a powerhouse drummer, who drove the band, yet could play with great finesse-listen to his cymbal work.  George Wein (producer-\\"Newport Jazz Festival in Europe\\") was right when he said, \\"That group was not ahead of it's time.  They were the time\\".<br /><br />A number of these compositions are perfect examples of this new style.  Listen to \\"Agitation\\", \\"Footprints\\", or even a well played tune like \\"Round Midnight\\", and you will hear a band that changed the music every night.  Davis has said the band would discuss their playing every night (sometimes all night) and that the music changed every night-everything was in flux.  But this band had a rhythm section that played as a single unit, and was a perfect foundation for both Shorter and Davis.<br /><br />Having the chance to hear several compositions played throughout the tour is a chance to hear how the music did change every night.  Something you might hear one night is gone the next.  And in it's place is something else new-and that might disappear the next night.  And that's what makes this box set so valuable, so exciting.  Not only is the music first rate, but it's played differently in every composition.  This band played so intuitively-both as a group and individually, that the music still swung, still had emotion, even when playing in uncharted waters.  A numberof tracks are lengthy, which gives the band time to expand and explore the music, especially in front of a European audience, who appreciate jazz on a level far higher than in the U.S.  Can you imagine what it must have been like to walk into a concert hall, knowing you're about to hear one of the best groups in jazz history, to actually watch these artists, as they laid out this music in front of you-live in the moment?  The DVD accompanying this set is, unfortunately not as well done as most would like.  It's simply not up to most fans standards.  It does give a good idea of what the looked and sounded like, but the quality, from TV station tapes, isn't all that great.  But for me the music portion of this release is the most important.<br /><br />This is one of the most exciting bands Davis ever had.  And now with this set, we can hear the proof of that.  This music was a living thing-it moved and morphed constantly.  And with a band like this, the music was never less than good, and was, at it's best, some of the finest jazz in the world.  Just sit back and listen to Davis solo, or Hancock, or Shorter, or Williams, or (occasionally) Carter, and you'll hear jazz at it's best.to expand and explore the music, especially in front of a European audience, who appreciate jazz on a level far higher than in the U.S.  Can you imagine what it must have been like to walk into a concert hall, knowing you're about to hear one of the best groups in jazz history, to actually watch these artists, as they laid out this music in front of you-live in the moment?

B0055FR5PS|2.0|This is a way to make war seem cool for kids as marines battle against some aliens. This is what its like in the middle east except peoples heads, guts, and limbs are getting blown to pieces. A slap in the face for marines who really have to live this against other people. Those who died and suffer should not have their efforts twisted into some alien recruiting film towards teenagers that this corrupt government wants to ship out to war.     Whats worse is the people in the middle east have to live this kind of ravaging warfare in their homelands as their homes are destroyed and children bombed. Hollywood has stumped to a new low.

0446693804|3.0|Disclaimer: I am an avid reader. I read 5+ books a week on slow weeks. I am NOT the target \\"Twilight and My Sister's Keeper are the only books I have ever read\\" audience. I have actually read good, deep and involving literature.    This was my very first Nicholas Sparks novel. I needed something fast to read between epic novels and this was on my Kindle collecting virtual dust. I absolutely LOVE The Notebook (film) and figured that if his writing was any good, I'd enjoy this one.    Eh.    Praise: I adored Jamie. She was well written and had many different sides to her, it was nice getting to see through Landon's eyes. I really did think the last scene with her was sweet and touching. It was enjoyable to read about Landon and his growing up as well.    Negatives: There is a saying that someone in film with a cough in the first act will be dead by the third. The not so subtle hints to her health were pretty much a dead giveaway that she wasn't going to make it to the end. My major complaint is that book is pretty much porn for girls. This book is all about being able to know what is going on in a man's head, being able to read about a relationship where they go super slow and focus on the falling in love (and not the making love). Women care less about the physical, more about the mental and I could tell that this was meant to pull at my heartstrings. Unfortunately it just wasn't realistic. It was sweet but I would sooner believe in spaceships invading or wizards (depending on the next book I read) than a 17 year old making a friend and falling in love over the course of 6 months and pining for her for the next 50 years.    If you want a super fluff piece that doesn't try to hide the fact it is pulling at your heartstrings, this or any other Sparks novel is definitely up your alley. If you are looking for a tragic love story, why not try The Time Traveler's Wife or something similar instead?
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|When I heard three+ years ago, that Leonard was touring after too many years, my wife and I flew to Dallas to see him and then when he added Atlanta to his tour, we saw him again.  Since then we watch this video every few months to relish in the memory of the two magical nights......  Our only regret is that he didn't include \\"famous blue raincoat\\" or \\"joan of arc\\" or maybe \\"because of a few songs\\".  Leonard sings poetry.  I can't describe it in any other way. He is just amazing and this is the closest that most of you will ever come to experiencing \\"Leonard\\".

B005974CNA|4.0|DT has been my favorite band for the last 16 years and all the drama leading up to this release showed my expectations for the new CD to be at an all-time low.  As a drummer, the thing I listen to first in any music (classical excluded) is what the drummer is playing.  MP's playing is what I listened to DT for.    That said, I was pleasantly surprised with the new CD.  Don't kid yourself...Mike Mangini has got some serious game!  He has shown himself to be a perfect fit.  He is everybit as good a drummer as MP.  His style is a bit different.  His playing, at this point is a bit constrained, but I think that is a product of his being thrown into the mix during such a turbulent time in the band.  I can't wait to see what the next CD will be like with him adding to the creative process.  I think then he will prove to be even more than a phenomenal drummer....he will shine as a creative giant equal to the rest of the band.    The only real criticism for this release is the mixing on a the second track \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\".  You really have to listen close to tell what Mike is doing on the drums.  The keyboards are way too high in the mix.  God knows I love Jordan's work, but the balance just isn't there on that track.
B005KH928E|4.0|I never thought I'd hear Clapton playing Dixieland music with Wynton Marsalis, but here it is.  This is an excellent CD!  My only complaint is that, despite the title, the music here emphasizes Wynton's band over Clapton's presence.  Apparently Clapton chose almost all the songs for the concert, but Marsalis and his band take most of the spotlight, and Clapton appears to play a supporting role in many of the songs.  Those who idolize Clapton may take issue with this, and I too would like to hear more from him on the CD, but that doesn't change the fact that this is great music.<br /><br />Wynton Marsalis is known for being a strict Jazz purist, and many have said that his views put a straight jacket on Jazz so tight that the genre has no room to grow, expand and incorporate a diversity of other musical genres.  This CD may indicate that he's loosening his straight jacket, or perhaps that this criticism of his views is a little too harsh.  After all, this is the guy who recently released a collaboration CD with Willie Nelson.  But I also suspect that that his strict view of Jazz may in part explain why the CD sounds so much more like Marsalis than Clapton.<br /><br />But on the other hand, I believe Clapton to be a very generous musician.  He often gives his collaborators top billing (Marsalis, B. B. King, J. J. Cale), and he often gives others the first solo in a song, voluntarily taking a back seat to showcase the talents of others.  I suspect this is the biggest reason for the sound of this concert.  And if you're willing to let Clapton take the back seat in this concert, you can appreciate it for what it is--great live music.  \\"Kidman Blues\\" is my favorite track, and I really enjoyed the new arrangement for Layla--that song will never grow old.
B005COO1X6|1.0|This book is by far one of the worst pieces of literature I have personally read. It starts out as a very well written text that has an easy to follow story that instantly pulls you in. The very next chapter it becomes random and is poorly put together. The context of the entire book lacks imagination and really left me asking \\"what is the point of even putting these words to paper\\". I understand the author is a legend to be sure but that does not mean that readers should automatically give his books a stellar review based solely on his previous works. I really feel that this book does not deserve all the praise that continues to be thrown at it. If you are looking for a series of short tales loosely thrown together and called a novel then by all means pick up this book. If you are looking for an expertly written compelling story, continue looking this is not it. I am very disappointed and I am afraid to say I have lost all faith in one of my once favorite writers.

I am a retired man, who generally controls his emotions, but the final release of her ordeal, had me weeping several tears on the pages and was hard to continue reading, several times, because tears were blinding me. I had to walk it off, saying out loud to myself \\"WOW, this is Heavy Duty\\". 18 long, freakin years of physical and mental abuse. And now, the media has her imprisoned again, from learning to live a free life. I guess the media feel they deserve it more, to make their money, than Jaycee deserves her freedom. Media is already taking so much that she wants to do, from her. I feel so much for her.
B00009AQMJ|5.0|I am a great fan of Rachmaninov and I chose this particular CD because it already had so many well written 5 star reviews on Amazon. The many reviewers did not let me down! With his four concertos PLUS his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini in this set, it is a real jewel and the best rendition of each of them that I have heard.
B002BEXFNW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find the Alpha version of the 1922 silent version of \\"Oliver Twist\\" done in a first class manner. The picture is excellent, along with the intertitles and background music.     After watching brilliant director David Lean's incredible 1948 version of \\"Oliver Twist,\\" if was hard for me to watch some of the other versions of Dickens' classic tale of survival. However, while I was watching the Jackie Coogan/Lon Chaney 1922 version, it seemed to me that Mr. Lean not only watched this film, but studied it very closely.    It also seemed to me that Mr. Lean may have used the 1922 version of \\"Oliver Twist\\" as a textbook example for fashioning his own incredible version of \\"Oliver Twist.\\" Many visual elements in the silent version seemed to have been enhanced and expanded in Mr. Lean's \\"Oliver Twist.\\"    Don't get me wrong, in my opinion, David Lean's 1948 version of \\"Oliver Twist\\" is still the greatest film version of the Dickens novel. But the 1922 silent version runs a close second. And the silent version is about half the running time of the 1948 version, but still remains true to the book.    Even for those who don't usually care for silent films, I think many viewers will be totally entralled and entertained by this wonderful 1922 version of \\"Oliver Twist.\\" When the film ended, it left me saying, \\"Please, sir, I want some more.\\"
B004SIP6WW|4.0|Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro<br />star in this 1997 crime drama. A New Jersey sheriff uncovers<br />a criminal conspiracy of the cops he idolizes. This is good<br />and Sly is great in it as usual. This dvd not only has nice<br />picture and sound, but the director's cut with some neat<br />extras. I recommend this.

0596805527|5.0|I'll say this from the outset, this is not a book for beginners! That said, it is an absolutely outstanding reference for those that are experienced programmers wanting to learn JavaScript and JavaScript programmers that need a reference book on their shelf.         It contains thorough coverage of the differences between ECMAScript3 and 5. Cursory mentioning of Ajax, JSON and jQuery are given.    There are code errors but nothing that can't be corrected easily. Besides, in my experience it is a very rare event for a book on programming and language to not have some anyway.    All in all, well worth the price if you take the previous caveats into account.
B005CM9DX6|3.0|Firstly, I wasn't immediately knocked out with this album. It took a few listens to understand and appreciate it. It's very different to anything Opeth have done before, and combines different styles and influences. Most songs feature variations in tempo and style, combining heavier sections with piano-based compositions, jazz, acoustic and classical. Not that 'Heritage' falls completely into any of these categories, it has a unique sound overall, but it's influences can be clearly heard.   The vocals are clean throughout, and most songs have unpredictable transitions and structures. Compared with 'Damnation', Opeth's other clean album, 'Heritage' tends to be more challenging listening, at least till the listener becomes familiar with the album's structure. Personally, after a few plays, I found this to be a really enjoyable album, generally quite laid back, but still with some surprising twists, moments of power and haunting melodies.   I would recommend 'Heritage' to anyone who appreciates good music, and is willing to give a cd a few spins to absorb it's complexity. By the way, I'm not a huge fan of prog rock, so don't feel you have to be to enjoy this album!

0756405890|2.0|A hundred pages into \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" I was hooked. The main character had a tragedy, a mystery and a menace on his hands, and his own story was part of all three. The writing was spare and direct. The loose ends were more like vast twisting caverns to explore.<br /><br />If the next hundred pages focused on the tragedy, that made perfect sense. The main character was losing his childhood and passing three years in utter poverty, and then rising from that to manage to get to the University. (The hero's name changes inexplicably: Kvothe, or Kote, or something. This might have made sense if the world had been better defined.)<br /><br />But there all the wheels fell off. Nothing made sense. Events seemed decided by dice: on about day two, he's set up to be banished from the Wonderful Library, and he never gets back. Worse, love enters his life, but it's all chaos. She hardly seems worthy of our hero's adoration, but she's never established as the Bad Girl either. She's a cipher.<br /><br />The nature of the villain often tells me whether the story is going to have staying power: Tolkien's poor all-powerful Sauron; Rowling's very real Tom Riddle; Lovecraft's Curwen who is just trying to live forever. But Rothfuss's many villains are just jerks. They don't seem to be villainous out of self interest: they're flat black smirkers.<br /><br />The first book wanders to an imprecise ending. Did our hero and his love find the Chandrian? Or did they just find the remains of a drug factory and perhaps a wandering dragon? And what exactly told Mr Rothfuss to stop where he did? It all seemed so random.<br /><br />Perhaps it will all make sense in Book Two. I'll never know. I've persisted with ill-defined trilogies before, and my experience is that the second volume never validates the first one; if the series is going to be any good, it'll be good from the start. And no, this is not. I'm going to reread Tolkien, Rowling and Lovecraft instead.

1594744769|3.0|The title was one of the first things that grabbed me about this book.  The alliteration was brilliant.  I first spotted it in Entertainment Weekly.  It was there, too, that I read a bit of history about the book, which intrigued me even more.  It seems that the book all started with a bunch of peculiar photographs that were found at flea markets, garage sales, etc.  From those, the author Ransom Riggs wove a tale of mystery.  I think the author should have had an introduction that detailed this instead of at the end in the \\"credits\\" section.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what started out like a school assignment/writing project, also felt like one.  The photographs interspersed throughout the novel didn't seem to be woven into the story very well.  Some were random.  Others, the author would plainly point out, \\"And here's the related photograph...\\"  That's where it felt like a school assignment to me.<br /><br />I like the idea of \\"Peculiar Children.\\"  They're like little X-Men with special abilities.  However, instead of being called mutants, or gifted, or special, or unique, they're called peculiar.  They're shunned for their abilities as outcasts, living in the WWII era.<br /><br />I didn't realize this was a young adult (YA) book at first, as I found it among the adult titles in a bookstore.  It also had the look of an adult mystery/ghost story.  Halfway through, I thought, \\"Why isn't this in the young adult section?\\"  I thought maybe it was miscategorized because there were no vampires or sex in the novel.  It was more in the vein of Harry Potter than Stephen King.<br /><br />The novel started out with some intrigue and mystery, but then slowly dissolved away as I turned the pages.  I expected more peculiarity and creepiness, and I never got it.  The action sequences at the climax of the book were kind of humdrum as well.  I wasn't really interested in and didn't get to know the characters very well, so I didn't care what happened to them.  Although I knew of their special powers, I never got to know them as people.  Their personalities weren't very well defined or distinct enough.  I never even felt anything toward the main character, Jacob, who was in almost every scene.<br /><br />The author leaves the book open for sequels, a la every young adult novel series.  I expect there will be more novels to follow, as there will always be odd photographs to discover.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be onboard except to flip through and check out the photos.<br /><br />Best line of the book, spoken by Miss Peregrine: \\"Forgive me.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|So first things first, like all aftermarket coolers, this thing is gigantic. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A GOOD SIZED CASE. Things will get difficult otherwise. The setup was a bit difficult, only because the bracket was a tad difficult to secure to my MOBO (Asus P8P67 Deluxe), may be different with others. But for the price, this is absolutely wonderful. Keeps my i7 2600K at about 31C idle, and maybe up to 36 under load. Sitting in an Antec 900 Case, which already has plenty of fans, so that maybe help a bit. Can't really gauge noise, because, as I said, my case already makes a good amount of noise. As long as you are cognizant of noise, and read all the directions when installing it, you should be fine.

B005H5GEQM|4.0|saw this movie in a theater at Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, Al. I am a huge Formula One fan and was eager to see it as I was told it was not yet in general release. Imagine my surprise when I found this online for cheaps. Had no problem playing it in my player, but this is obviously an earlier edit of the movie I saw in the theater. Some of the interviews which were in English (notably Senna's sister) with English subtitles for clarity's sake, are in Portugese here with what could only be described as pidgin English subtitles - quite different from the English subtitles I saw, and a comically bad translation. Content is also somewhat different, though not radically.     All in all, it was worth what I paid for it, though I will probably buy the \\"real\\" US version when available.
B003L77G06|5.0|When \\"Modern Family\\" premiered in the fall of 2009, it was a breath of fresh air. An incredibly brilliant, well written and acted series depicting family life of the Pritchett/Dunphy clan. It was one of the best things I had seen on network TV in years. From start to finish, the debut season was an instant classic, and the show deservedly got the attention from critics and award shows. But then came the obvious question. Can they do it again? Was the show a one season wonder? Would they suffer from the ever dreadful 'sophomore slump'? When season two premiered in the fall of 2010, it was apparent right away, especially with the first few episodes, that any fears or doubt were instantly washed away. Season 2 premiered as strong as ever, and rolled out 24 high quality episodes. But first....    A little catch up. The series features Pritchett family patriarch, Jay (the fantastic Ed'o'Neill), who is married to a much younger columbian woman named Gloria (Sofia Vergara), and step-father to Manny. His daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil (Ty Burrell), and they have three children, Haley, Luke, and Alex. Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) lives with his partner, Cameron (the hilarious Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted daughter, Lily.    Season 2 got things off on the right foot. The season premiere, \\"The Old Wagon\\", was a strong welcome back that showcased everything that makes the show so great. Humor and heart. The episode dealt with Phil finally deciding to get rid of the old family car, but not without one last trip down memory lane. One of the season's best episodes for sure. Next up is \\"The Kiss\\". The show had had some controvery surrounding the gay characters of Mitchell and Cameron never kissing. This hilarious episode focuses on Mitchell's growing concern of Cameron's reluctance to show passion in public. It was such a well done episode that made the ballyhoo surrounding it into nothing, as the episode handled it in such a normal, natural way, and didn't make a big deal out of it. Brilliant! Episode 3, \\"Earthquake\\", was supposed to be the season premiere, but was pushed back to be the 3rd episode. It doesn't take much to figure out what the episode is about. \\"Unplugged\\" is a great episode that features Phil and Claire persuading the kids to all give up their electronical devices and learn to communicate better with each other. \\"Halloween\\" is another instant classic. Claire goes all out for the holiday and has everyone playing a part, but of course, it doesn't go too well. Elsewhere, \\"Caught In The Act\\" is an unflinchingly funny and honest episode where the 3 Dunphy kids catch their parents 'in the act '. Valentine's Day laughs return in the hilarious \\"Bixby's Back\\", and Nathan Lane shines as a Mitchell/Cam buddy who befriends Jay in \\"Boys' Night\\". \\"See You Next Fall\\" deals with Alex's middle school graduation, and the hilarity that ensues trying to get there. The season ends with Jay's birthday and him just wanting to go fishing, but his family has other plans in \\"The One That Got Away\\". There's so much more!    Some say season 2 DID in fact suffer from a sophomore slump, but I just don't see it. The second half of the season isn't as strong as the first, but that doesn't mean anything. It's still great. The overall season is yet another testament to the great writing, acting, and directing that was established in season one. Each character is still fully fleshed out and with their own unique personalities. The incredibly talented cast continue to make their charcaters full fledged, fully fleshed out characters we love, care about, and laugh with. It doesn't hurt that the writing is so sharp, so clever, so relatable, and the humor as top notch as ever, for the actors to once again display why they are the best ensemble cast on television. I love how the show never shys away from the sweet moments, how almost every episode ends with something nice. That's just not something you get a lot of on televisionthese days. It's the show that not only makes me laugh, but can also move me and make me feel for these people. I can't remember the last time I said that about a network television show.    The season 2 set also comes pretty well packed with special features. Just like the season 1 set, it comes with Deleted Family Interviews, Deleted And Extended Scenes, and a Gag Reel. For the rest, we are treated to 6 featurettes (2 more than season 1) and a music video for \\"Imagine Me Naked\\", the song Dylan wrote for Haley. The new featurettes are \\"At Home With Modern Family\\", \\"Modern Family Holidays\\", \\"Mitch's Flash Mob\\", \\"Strangers On A Treadmill - Table Read\\", \\"Waiting For Oprah\\", and \\"Chatting With Steve Levitan\\".    Season 2 of \\"Modern Family\\" is worth every penny. Some special guests include Shelley Long, Matt Dillon, Natahn Lane, Elizabeth Banks, and more. In addition to it's cast, it can't help but have great guest stars too! Simply put, \\"Modern Family\\" is divine television. The rare show that deserves all the hype, all the praise, and gives me hope for network comedy. Season 2 is great. Pick it up now.
0811879542|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old son laughed out loud the 1st time we read this book together.  About a dozen times later, he's still cracking up.  There are so many underlying lessons in this very simply illustrated book.  It covers a few basic colors, paterns, counting, teaches left from right and most importantly...it made him listen and follow instructions.      We've read other interactive books before, but they were ususally more \\"predictable\\".  We had books where you opened flaps and books with different materials and textures (e.g. Pat the Bunny), but none has yet elicited the same reaction as Press Here.  Maybe now that he's a \\"sophisticated\\" pre-schooler, he's drawn to the cause and effect aspect of this delightful book.

B005HG4C4C|5.0|I've been a fan of DT ever since seeing the video for Pull Me Under on MTV's Headbanger's Ball way back in 92.  I have purchased every album they have released, but since SDOIT, I have been disappointed in every album over the past decade for one reason or another.  Trite, meaningless lyrics; over the top drum fills; pompous keyboard solos; death metal growls; etc have marred each album beginning with ToT.  While all of the albums since then have also had flashes of brilliance, they have been way too inconsistent.  But with Portnoy's departure (and thus his stranglehold over the writing process, band management, etc) DT seems to have listened to all of the fans' complaints and used them as fuel to create their most cohesive and diverse album since Images and Words in my opinion.    I&W has long been my favorite DT release.  There have been rumors floating around that the band wrote ADTOE based on the I&W song structures.  I can certainly hear many similarities throughout the album and I for one am extremely happy that they used it for inspiration.  The songwriting, both musics and lyrics, are stronger than ever and this will be the first tour that I support since Metropolis 2000.    I won't bore you with song by song analysis since it's already been done.  If you're a fan of early DT and got sick of them trying to be a thrash metal band then you will be extremely happy with this album.  A true return to their prog rock roots and destined to be one of their classic albums that will age very gracefully unlike ToT, BCASL, etc.

B005KWL2IW|4.0|I feel about this album very much like I felt about Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" when it came out.  Two very different stories between Anthrax and Metallica leading up to reclaiming the metal with these albums, of course.  We all know what happened with the release of Metallica's \\"Black Album\\" in 1991, where it took them, and the positive (and negative) influence it had on metal as we now know it.<br /><br />There was that time called the 1990's, which was a very grim era for metal (particularly thrash) as the industry's gears changed with the over-commercialized chaos of the Seattle scene (I will not use a narrow-minded word like \\"grunge\\" to describe many of these great bands).  In fact, the impact of the Seattle scene changed things so much that there are skeletons in the closet which are now avoided from that era where you had headlines in magazines like, \\"Kirk Hammett discusses why Metallica will never be metal again\\" and Scott Ian talking about how Anthrax guitarist Danny Spitz was fired from the band because he was always \\"the metal guy\\" and how Anthrax wanted to grow past being a metal band.  Anthrax had a lot of growing up, career decisions, reality checks, hesitant changes, the decline of their genre, and the addition of vocalist John Bush (who I personally welcomed into the band as Joey's replacement) to work through.<br /><br />Here in 2011, I can't entirely say that Anthrax has returned to their original 1984-1991 Joey-era form... but I feel that they shouldn't entirely need to.  They've actually blossomed from there to quite a degree; depending on YOUR expectations, versus a band moving forward with its vision and career.  The material on \\"Worship Music\\" in and of itself may as well be a move ahead in an almost contradictory rear-view mirror tribute to metal itself.  There is so much CLASSIC metal sound here intertwined with the thrash essence and meat of the old Anthrax sound, the vibe and tone of the John Bush era, and the pride of letting their influences shine.  \\"In The End\\" is without a doubt the best example of this.  Ronnie James Dio and Bruce Dickinson are clearly channeled by Joey, the guitar solo is Thin Lizzy as hell, and second half of the song vibes Iron Maiden's \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\" so hard that you can't help but respect the band's respect for metal itself.  This album leaves no doubt that Anthrax really IS a metal band again, and they've been trying to justify that since the turn of the century after being tainted by the 1990's.  In turn, having Joey back in the lineup also should leave any reasonable Anthrax fan no doubt that Anthrax really is ANTHRAX again.<br /><br />With \\"Worship Music,\\" do I think every song on the album is incredible?  No.  Do I think the album is a little overproduced (especially in the vocal department) and heavily digitally recorded/edited-sounding?  Yes.<br /><br />But fact remains that, like \\"Death Magnetic,\\" the album sounds HUGE (if not, MORE HUGE) and there are extremely cool elements of the band we wanted to hear all over the album in every song.  Some in new forms.  Others in oldschool, more familiar forms.  And most importantly, at least a few great songs to walk away with and keep in your heart.  For me, there are four songs in particular that effect me as such.  They are:<br /><br />1. \\"Earth On Hell.\\"  The opening morsel that harkens back to the vibe of \\"Aftershock\\" from \\"Spreading The Disease.\\"  The rather cheesy \\"people will die\\" growl, I can get over (I can only assume that was forced upon Joey when Scott should've just done it himself).<br /><br />2. \\"Fight Em Til You Can't,\\" containing every element of Anthrax that one could hope for in a radio-single type track (even if the main riff sounds a bit TOO in the vein of \\"Gridlock\\" from \\"Persistence Of Time\\").  I realize \\"The Devil You Know\\" is currently their lead single, but I personally don't find it to hold up to this track as well in comparison listen-after-listen.  Be sure to have a good listen to all of Charlie Benante's insanity at 3:20.<br /><br />3. \\"In The End.\\"  Charlie believes this is Anthrax's best song ever.  Although I can't agree with him... it's a damn good song; let alone for anyone who carries metal, its history, and its legacy in their hearts.  Damn good.<br /><br />4. \\"Judas Priest.\\"  This is where I give Anthrax credit for moving classic metal and their own sound ahead.  I've never heard any Anthrax song like this and I'm just flat out glad it exists.  By far the biggest balls on the album.<br /><br />Not to say that there aren't other songs on the album I like.  They simply just don't strike me as hard as those four do.  I will, however, agree with many reviewers by saying that \\"Crawl\\" is my least favorite track on the album.  It just feels like filler to me, not very much like Anthrax, and it happens to be a slower/softer tune by coincidence.  There are things ABOUT it I like.  Just not the song ITSELF.  By the way, the opening riff of \\"The Constant\\" should put any Dimebag Darrell fan on stun for a few seconds.<br /><br />I have no idea how Anthrax will pull it off live or if it will simply seem bare, but the amount of vocals and vocal overdubs on this album are present way more than on any other Anthrax album.  WAY MORE.  Some are totally overdone.  Others are just brilliant.  Harmonies galore.  Unlike previous releases, it's quite difficult to tell Joey's overdubs apart from Frank Bello's vocal tracks, but I know there's a lotta Frankie in there and the two of them sound killer together.<br /><br />Anyway, the Amazon stars won't rate in halves but I give \\"Worship Music\\" 3.5 stars (4 to be nice because it's not a \\"bad\\" album and it's just so good to hear the guys with Joey again)... 1 star off because of me wanting more of the genre Anthrax helped create and what made me love them in the first place: thrash... an additional star off for overall songwriting not granting me with more favorites on the album... and a .5 star off for overproduction, although it's still a very well produced album for being self-produced by Rob with the band.  Bravo, men.  But hey, I'm also a huge lover of oldschool punk and hardcore.  And when it comes to production, sometimes less is much more.<br /><br />Now had \\"Worship Music\\" been a 4-song E.P. containing the four tracks I pointed out above?  5 stars.  Without a doubt.

B003L77GRO|5.0|**Spoiler alert - I don't reveal much, just don't read if you want to be totally surprised by watching it**     As soon as this season came out on DVD I had to snatch it up since I've been watching Dexter since season 1.  Unfortunately, I moved and don't have Show Time anymore so i had to wait almost a year after the premier of the season to watch it, but boy was it worth the wait!  I was initially skeptical when I heard Dexter was going to have a new female in his life, however, reading the other reviews, I kept an open mind.  Although I preferred Rita, there's not much I can do since she is no longer alive.  I felt they introduced Lumen a little too close after Rita's death, but considering that Dexter is supposed to be void of emotions, it was not a huge surprise.  What was a little strange was that Dexter became strongly emotionally attached to Lumen, perhaps stronger than he and Rita's connection, due to the \\"dark passenger\\" that resides in Lumen.      All-in-all the plot, however skeptical I was, worked out fantastically.  I couldn't keep myself from watching several episodes per night, even though I said I was going to watch 1 per week (so it would be as if I was watching it on Show Time :P) The introduction of Lumen gave Dexter a new dimension, a feeling that he may be more human than Harry thought.  Their (Dexter and Lumen's) victims were not too different from Dexter's previous victims (there are only but so many ways to be a bad guy right?), but there was a little twist on the usual serial killer.  They always seem to make Debra closer and closer to finding out Dexter's true identity and continue to put the single father through previously unseen circumstances that keep you glued to the tv.
B001R4MEYS|3.0|After the epic awesome that was Blood Mountain I was sort of disappointed by Crack. They have a great atmosphere on this disc, awesome tones, and cool ideas but the songs never develop into the whallop of powerful prog-metal that we have come to know and love from Mastodon.   There is just no bite. Only nibbles. After 5 or 6 tracks of old school classic rock jamming with some typical Mastodon dissonance in the mix I was ready for a change but the rest of the cd provided more of the same. Overall I think they reached too far back into their southern rock/Pink Floyd/psychedelic/1960's British prog roots and left behind their meaty neurosis based doomy yet upbeat brand of metal.   I look foreword the The Hunter where they reportedly get back on track.     Is it an accident or by design that Opeth's Heritage goes to almost exactly the same place?  I don't know but the similarities are uncanny. Both bands were known for being heavy yet melodic, fast yet controlled, and very progressive and experimental. Then inexplicably they turn back the clock and down the volume and put out something from decades past. Even though the band members weren't really there to experience that era first hand. It's s few years off but it seems like the same mentality from both bands. This is kind of an interesting trend, but I hope it passes and they get back to what they are good at. Intelligent face melting.
0670022411|5.0|I have to say that I was a bit surprised when I saw the number of people who rated this book so poorly.  But if you think about it, maybe not so surprised since books of this nature written for actual adults that involve actual thought and knowledge without offering continual gratuitous sex scenes are few and far between.  People have simply gotten too used to reading Harry Potter (written for young adults), Sookie Stackhouse (written for adults who are bored or sexually deprived), and the like.  Do not get me wrong, I have read both afore-mentioned book series myself when I am looking to read something that requires little thought.  This book falls completely out of those categories.  It was very well researched and few books are written in such a thought provoking manner these days.  You definitely get buried in this story and all of the characters' nuances.  The characters are very well developed and you find your heart reaching out to them as you delve further in and learn more about them and their pasts.  I personally cannot wait until the next book comes out and was actually happy for once when I realized that it was to be part of a series and that I was going to get to see these characters again and hear more about them.  I do not believe in giving the specifics of stories away but I say that this is a must read... unless you are simply looking for mindless entertainment.

0385342039|5.0|I have read and enjoyed most of Sophie Kinsella's novels, but this is by far my favorite. Even though it's a fantasy, the protagonist is the most believable character Kinsella has created. The plot is so clever, I just have to marvel at the author's imagination and creativity!

B004WKOCP8|2.0|With all the review slamming going on about expectations, I have to say _I_ didn't have any expectations, _except_ to be entertained/amused by my _favorite_ band.<br /><br />Well, that didn't happen.<br /><br />I purchased this CD before a very long road trip, and was immensely disappointed. Repetitive lyrics and melodies, enough so that I became agitated and wanted to flip the thing off. I suppose the whole water torture thingy is a good comparison. The entire CD was a slow, monotonous, repetitive torture. There wasn't an exciting bit in the whole thing. I plan on taking the songs in smaller doses. Maybe individually, I'll be able to appreciate them. As it stands though, this CD was not worth the effort: the band creating it nor me purchasing it.

B005974CNA|5.0|I have loved listening to Dream Theater since I bought \\"Images & Words\\" in 1992.  While I was sad to see the mess between Mike Portnoy and the rest of the DT camp, I can agree that change was needed.  I was long past tired of Portnoy's 12 Steps songs and constant need to make music influenced by nu-metal.  DT is at their best with long epic, moving songs like Metropolis, Change of Seasons, Nightmare to Remember, Octavarium, etc.  A Dramatic Turn of Events brings out some of the best stuff DT has done in several years  Highlights for me are This Is the Life, Bridges in the Sky, Outcry, and Beneath the Surface.  It is also nice to see James Labrie and John Myung contributing lyrics once again.  Jordan Rudess provides some great atmospheric background sounds that give a lot of these songs an almost \\"sountrack\\" epicness, while Mike Mangini seems very restrained and tasteful with his drum tracks.  If you haven't listened to DT in a while, you must at least give this disc a try!
B001OQCV6K|1.0|Unfortunately, my DVD seemed like a pirated copy of the film I thought I was purchasing. It not only randomly would glitch and go back to certain points in the movie over and over again, but I had no access to the menu items like the extras or the chapters.I went back online to Walmart and purchased a real copy
1451629184|5.0|I gave this a five star because you have to remember Jaycee Dugard wrote this book with just her fifth grade education, so the writing isn't perfect.  The book is disturbing in the sense that I cannot believe sick people in this work exist such as Phillip Garrido.  What that man did to Jaycee was so disturbing.  I felt ill just reading about it.  Jaycee's attitude towards what Phillip did to her and her captivity is inspiring though.  She has an excellent and mature attitude about her past and about moving forward and having a positive outlook on the future.
0385534639|3.0|Definitely a magical book (makes me wish that kind of circus existed) but the story did not live up to the advanced hype. The description of the circus and tents was incredible. I wanted to be a reveur. However I didn't care enough about the contest, the contestants nor their outcome...save how it affected the circus.    I did enjoy the book but it isn't one that I can recommend to just about anyone. I would only recommend to a select few people who I think would truly enjoy it.
0790729601|5.0|I ended up paying a very chap price elsewhere for this movie but thought I'd let you know it is a good one and full of action. The acting is not the absolute best but who watches Arnold for the acting anyway? LOL!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary has won all of the major awards, including Best Documentary (2010) Oscar and it got top reviews at the national level.  The \\"beauty\\" of this film is the interviews, particularly with university economics professors. You see for yourself the verbal fumbling and averted gazes and attempts to change the subject when: they are asked about all their non-teaching income and why they didn't disclose they were being paid to write positive papers about deregulation and those fraudulent \\"derivatives\\" that triggered this recession (which is NOT over as claimed).   Obama: Inside job shows why he has had nothing but lame \\"recovery\\" plans and why he has done nothing to spur U.S.. Justice to launch investigations and bring charges. The truth is: not only professors and Wall Street types have been bought, our very own government is now working for the millionaires who betrayed us, doubled the federal debt and left millions of Americans without jobs and homes.        Inside Job covers Alan Greenspan and does a good job.  This guy was head of the Federal Reserve for a long time and everyone thought he was a financial genius working to ensure our economy worked properly.  Well - I met Alan Greenspan way back in 1970 after a speech he gave.  I shook his hand and, with a few others, got to talk to him for a few minutes.   He was just a wealthy bond trader then: but he was already promoting the idea that \\"Capitalists\\" are some kind of hero and shouldn't be put under \\"terrible regulations\\" which \\"stifles their genius.\\"\\"  He didn't talk about taxing the rich but you could tell he thought anyone making a million bucks a year should not have to \\"support freeloaders\\" - meaning the real tax payers & job holders.   The gap between rich and \\"average\\" in this country is now larger than in any of the developed countries.   Hah!          Five stars all the way for Inside Job.  Everyone should have the DVD and play it every month or so just to stay mad about how we've been swindled.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  I loved how the author tied in an historic event with a story.  I liked the combination of telling the story both at the time of WWII and in modern day and how she connected the two together.  This is one of my favorite books I have read this year!  Would definitely read her other books now.
B003AMAOW4|5.0|Riuscitissima la produzione del Lohengrin di Richard Jones che coniuga ad un cast stellare una regia moderna ma mai fuori luogo. Un particolare plauso ai due protagonisti Jonas Kaufmann che dimostra ancora una volta, oltre di avere una voce stupenda, anche di essere finissimo artista sia nel gusto della parola che nella ricerca del bel suono: meritano menzione i tantissimi filati perfetti che il tenore riesce ad ottenere lungo tutta l'opera e l'intimit&agrave; che riesce a dare al discorso con la forte intenzione emotiva che d&agrave; al personaggio; e Anja Harteros nel difficilissimo ruolo di Elsa che grazie alla sua ottima vocalit&agrave; riesce ad interpretare a tutto tondo passando da scene di puro lirismo ad altre di introspezione senza dimenticare l'importante parte scenica. Ad affiancare questi due Giganti la magnifica Ortrud della Schuster, l'intenso Friedrich di Koch e il regale Heinrich di Fischesser. Un Lohengrin, dunque, particolarmente ben riuscito, intimo e semplice nella sua complessit&agrave;.

0380486032|4.0|After reading many more recent books where other reviewers made parallels to Rebecca, I felt like it was a gap in my reading list.  I have been enjoying what I term \\"literary mysteries\\" for several years, many of which could also carry the \\"gothic\\" label, and this seemed to be a frequently cited model for the genre.<br /><br />This book, penned in the 1903s, presents an unnamed narrator who marries a man about whom she knows very little.  The marriage thrusts her into an upper-class world that is unfamiliar and takes her to his famed estate, Manderley.  The narrator feels haunted by the memories that her husband, townsfolk, and the staff (especially the head housekeeper) have of the husband's first wife, Rebecca.  It is hard to say much more without creating spoilers of things that unfold towards the middle and end of the novel.<br /><br />I'm having more trouble than normal organizing my thoughts on Rebecca.  I'm giving it four stars, although it definitely dragged.  In many ways, it felt more like a \\"novel of manners\\" (throwback phrase from my English-major days) and a romance than a mystery.  But I do think the subtlety of Rebecca's presence is very well done and much more realistically drawn than a lot of novels garnering the \\"gothic\\" label.  It is a mental and emotional haunting, not a story of ghosts.  I never developed a very firm opinion of the narrator, which may explain my hesitation on the four stars.  But the prose, while lengthy, is quite lovely and held me through the whole story.  I appreciated the was the author built the intrigue in a story that is largely about mental and emotional struggles (the \\"action\\" starts late).  I also appreciate that the novel clearly lays a foundation for future works and for future women authors.  Worth a read for book lovers captured by more recent titles who want to see a bit of their \\"roots\\" and have the patience for a slower paced read.
0756405890|5.0|No need for spoilers, or a discussion of the plot - simply put, it is the best thing I've read in years. I have read so many mediocre books lately that I thought I had exhausted the store of truly compelling fiction. I'm glad to be proven wrong. I've just started book two, and it's like meeting up with old friends again. For those turned off by fantasy fiction, don't be fooled. With a few minor tweaks, this could easily find it's way into the general fiction section. It's not the names of strange lands that's important, but the personal interactions of a few characters, not so different from The Prince of Tides, or A Prayer for Owen Meany. I have a feeling I will be giving this to friends for years to come.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just got my product in the mail.  I have had a chance to view many of the discs and special feature discs.  I couldn't wait to write a quick review.    First off, to all the zealots that have posted negative reviews for a product that wasn't even released yet, I say you are idiots!  You are the ones that give all of us normal Star Wars fans a bad name.  Just had to say that.  Anyway...    I am very pleased with this purchase!  I would definitely recommend this set to anyone.   The video and sound quality is absolutely amazing.  The packaging is first rate.  The set includes 3 extra special features discs.  They are jam packed with all kinds of great material.  The small changes made to the films are totally fine and do not detract in any way.  The great thing about them is that they bring a continuity to the entire saga that is really nice.  Whole new generations of Star Wars fans can enjoy these movies in a new and improved context that has never been available before.  Truly awesome!    Thanks George Lucas for creating such an awesome movie saga and and fantastic BluRay set!

B004HD61KE|1.0|This book was recommended to me by Amazon Kindle. I even got the free sample. It seemed like a really good story so I bought it. I started to read it and the next chapter started in on my religion. If an author is going to write about a religion he should do a lot more research on it. For those of you that care. The REAL name of my church is \\"The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints\\". We do not believe in affairs or pre-marital sex. We so not use the Lords name in vain, we DO NOT smoke or condone having a cigar in our mouth. (even if it is not lit). I would really like to get my money back but if not then I hope others will read this an either reconsider buying the book. Because he is making statements concerning the Mormons that are misleading for the greater majority of the Church.

1401223176|5.0|This story originally came out around ten years ago, and this is the most recent re-printing of the story, and also the most economical. (Why DC waits so long to collect entire storylines into a single collections is beyond me, but I refuse to buy stories in two parts at jacked-up prices!)<br /><br />This book succeeds on pretty much every level, and is a good example of what can be accomplished in this medium. Like a near-perfect summer blockbuster movie event, this book has it all: Heroic champions, mysterious and deadly villains, beautiful ladies, exotic locales, fisticuffs, explosions, gadgets, friends who won't let you down, surprise plot twists, a great director (in this case, the writer Jeph Loeb), great special effects and cinematography (in this case, the masterful visuals of penciler Jim Lee - my favorite comic artist ever!), and a cast of famous actors (in this case, practically every popular Batman villain and ally you'd be familiar with). This book literally has it all, and it is just a joy to read and share with friends. Really, you can't go wrong with this book unless you hate Batman. If that's the case, why would you be reading this?<br /><br />As I said before, this is the most economical version of the story to purchase, and one of only a couple ways you can get the complete story in one package. If you really want to spend more and have it in a very nice, larger-print version, you can always spring for this version: [[ASIN:1401204260 Absolute Batman: Hush]]. Though I doubt most people want to spend that kind of money on one book. Either way, I really doubt anyone is going to be disappointed with this book. It is one of the best Batman stories ever written, and there is NO better-looking Batman book anywhere to be found!

1451629184|3.0|I wish that I had purchased this book on my Kindle to read. It was only OK for me and certainly not one I want to keep on my shelf. I am still glad that I read it though. Jaycee proves that she is very courageous and strong. Not many people would have been able to endure 18 years of tourture, like she did, which began as a young child and ended as a 31 year old adult. I am sure that there were times that she felt that her situation was hopeless but she was able to somehow cope by focusing on her animals and then her children when they were born. Although her children were conceived by violent rapes, his wonderful woman never gives the impression in the book that she has anything but complete love for her two children. Not many people would be able to look at children conceived like this without resentment and maybe even hatred. I got the feeling during the reading of this book that Jaycee is more emotionally healthy that a lot of people who never went through something like this. Three stars to the book but 5 plus stars to Jaycee!

0060899190|1.0|I find this book shameful.  Not the secrets, but the marketing.<br /><br />I don't think the guy knew how much this would take off when he started it.  In the beginning it was like a public service, where you could air your darkest secrets on the DL.<br /><br />But then the guy realized that people were basically writing his books for him.  He quit his jobs and started publishing these books, for which he did very little work.  He also changed his website so that instead of a gallery of confessions (the way it used to be), he only has a handful of teasers up there at any moment, the better to get you to buy his books with.<br /><br />No, no:  this should be a public service.  Why can't he put his entire collection of confessions online?  If, as he claims, viewing them is purgative and salubrious, then why not?<br /><br />Simple:  If he did that, nobody would buy his books.  And then he'd have to go back to his job.<br /><br />In a way, I see this guy as violating the public's trust.  A noble soul would have risen to the role of a custodian, a confessor.  Instead, this guy just wants to make money with the idea.<br /><br />Don't send this guy any secrets, please.  He's not interested in helping you:  he's interested in relaxing in an armchair and not working.
1592402690|5.0|My title should clue you in. I've read dozens of books about the Beatles, but none - not even Lewisohn's exhaustive day-by-day recording studio accounts - made me feel so much like I was there with the group. Emerick really was there, and that makes all the difference.    Emerick does an excellent job describing in minute detail how the band put their songs together, came up with incredible ideas like the feedback intro to I Feel Fine, and interacted among themselves and with the recording engineers in the studio. The book offers wonderful insight into the characters of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and is brutally honest about the author's opinions of each of them - both their good and bad qualities. It's fascinating to read about George Harrison's early struggles to find a place in the band, and his ultimate triumph in songwriting and guitar playing by the time of Abbey Road. Or about Lennon's clever yet mercurial personality, Ringo's shyness and Paul's musical and creative leadership.    There's no doubt Emerick empathizes most with Paul, but Paul is not spared Emerick's criticism for his part in breaking up the group (Paul swearing at George Martin as he struggled to get the vocal right for \\"Obla Di Obla Da\\" was the final straw in Emerick's decision to walk out on the band during the White Album recording - he came back for Abbey Road). Still, it seems pretty obvious from reading this that John's infatuation with Yoko Ono and his insistence on having her accompany him to each recording session from 1968 on, including having a bed brought to the studio so she could lie there while ill, was the prime reason for the group's downfall.    Every Beatles fan should read this.

B00005JLWN|1.0|The thing I couldn't get past with this movie was the premise.  It seemed like a thinly-veiled ripoff of the \\"books are banned\\" premise from Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  Only there, the premise worked.  Here, the premise is that emotion has been banned.<br /><br />I couldn't buy this for a second.  According to the movie, emotion is caused by things such as old lamps, paintings, and carpets.  In reality, since emotions are caused by, say, having a baby, getting a promotion at work, watching the rain in the afternoon, whatever -- they would be difficult to ban.  Or, if they wanted to ban them, they'd have to go about it in an entirely different way from the method employed in this movie:  antique sofas are now banned, so the public won't be emotional?<br /><br />Beyond that, there was a lot of unnecessary kung-fu, whose connection to the issue of emotional suppression raised by the plot was not clear to me.
B003DZX44I|5.0|We have this movie running about 10 times a day.  When it's over, we just start it all over again. I ask my 2 1/2 son what he wants to watch and he says \\"Beast\\", over and over again.  The movie came so quickly in the mail. Love ordering through Amazon.

0312427565|5.0|This is a people-oriented look at America's entry into space. It begins with test pilots in the late 1940s and into the 1950s, especially with the guy who broke the sound barrier, Chuck Yeager. Then, after America's space program gets a jolt from the USSR's launching of the Sputnik, the story proceeds through Project Mercury to the last Mercury mission in 1963.<br /><br />Be advised, Tom Wolfe does not give us a comprehensive account of Project Mercury. The astronauts, their wives, NASA people, Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy, and a few other characters play roles in the story, and sometimes--particularly regarding the astronauts and their wives--the focus on them is close. But a great amount of material regarding the Mercury missions is omitted or is given only cursory examination. Obviously there is more to the history of America's early space program than the people. Even so, I doubt if the formal history, THIS NEW OCEAN: A HISTORY OF PROJECT MERCURY, includes the information about people that Wolfe includes. I may change my mind after reading THIS NEW OCEAN, but for now I think both books are necessary for a complete picture.<br /><br />Also be advised, THE RIGHT STUFF is not written in the conventional style of historical narration. Wolfe's style is light and often witty. He uses jargon, colorful figures of speech, and hyperbole. With amazon's \\"Look Inside\\" feature, I read the first pages of THIS NEW OCEAN. Its prose is conventional nonfiction, like something found on the front page of a newspaper. Wolfe's prose is like something found in editorial pages or in a breezy novel.<br /><br />There are no footnotes and no index. In his \\"Author's Note\\" at the end, Wolfe provides a brief bibliography.<br /><br />Many of Wolfe's paragraphs are too long, but this is the only thing I condemn unequivocally as a flaw. For history I do prefer straightforward factual narration, not flippancy, and if I were writing this only to myself, I would consider that flippancy a flaw. Nevertheless, the acclaim this book has received indicates that most other readers are not bothered by Wolfe's style. So you will probably not consider it a flaw.<br /><br />Though some of Wolfe's details are inaccurate, details are soon forgotten anyway, and for this book I think they are not worth harping about. I give him five stars because of his revealing portrayals of characters. They are accurate enough, I think, and they will be remembered.<br /><br />P.S. July 30, 2012:<br />I tried reading THIS NEW OCEAN: A HISTORY OF THE MERCURY PROJECT, which is NASA's official history of the Mercury Project. It was tedious, made more so by its lack of a list of abbreviations and an index. Though John Catchpole's PROJECT MERCURY was written with the same matter-of-fact, term-paper prose, it had a list of abbreviations and an index and was more readable. Though I had to work to get it and though I had to pay a steep price for his book, Catchpole at least gave me the information that Tom Wolfe left out.rtheless, the acclaim this book has received indicates that most other readers are not bothered by Wolfe's style. So you will probably not consider it a flaw.<br /><br />Though some of Wolfe's details are inaccurate, details are soon forgotten anyway, and for this book I think they are not worth harping about. I give him five stars because of his revealing portrayals of characters. They are accurate enough, I think, and they will be remembered.<br /><br />P.S.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This review is for the Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray.  Most of the negative reviews here are from fans who feel cheated and are trying to get back at George Lucas (my hat is off to you).  However you have not purchased this product and therefore have no business reviewing the BD's.  The original trilogy look very good and sound awesome on blu ray.  This is the best picture and sound you will experience these movies!  While I am not a fan of the prequels I have to say that ROTS is almost Avatar standard on blu ray.  The first two films of the prequel I won't waist my time on commenting as I won't watch them again.  Overall the changes made to the original trilogy is not awful ( I actually enjoy most of the updated cgi ) as it makes these films more current.  I do agree ROTJ is a mixed bag and the added bar scene with Jabba the Hut is ridiculous! I find it sad that people won't watch the update Star Wars episodes 4 through 6 simply because the director / creator made some changes to the original movies!  Sit and pout but don't count on the original theatrical releases to be on blu ray anytime soon.  That will only happen if GL is broke and I don't see that happening anytime soon!
B004V98UKS|1.0|the creator must have forgot he was making this for touch screen devices, cause the controls completely break the game. Could have been more fun with some swipes instead of on screen controls.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|In my review of [[ASIN:B0018CWWFK Watershed]] three years ago, I predicted that the follow-up to this album would present a better picture as to where Mikael Akerfeldt wanted to be musically, and Heritage has proven this prediction to have been correct.<br /><br />No aspect of this album can be called metal, and I doubt any band member would present it as such. Heritage is radically different from its predecessors in shape, sound, and direction. The death vocals and heavy riffing have completely vanished, which will definitely please or disappoint a lot of fans depending on their preferences. In their place, the band builds complex songs that are rhythmically evolved with exquisite drumming. Martin Axenrot takes on a jazzy feel throughout the whole album, accenting the most critical beats during the songs. What many thought was gone for good after the departure of former drummer Martin Lopez is re-established with Axenrot's special attention to groove and detail.<br /><br />Like all of Opeth's albums, Heritage proves to be an extremely rewarding listen as its internal complexities unfold. The amount of detail to be found in the songs is amazing. Due to Steven Wilson's ingenious mix, the compositions are rife with nuance. I discovered Per Wiberg's creepy keyboards repeating Akerfeldt's vocal melody on \\"I Feel the Dark\\" and the very distant vocal hooks during the instrumental part of \\"Nepenthe\\" after giving the album many spins. This being Wiberg's swan song with Opeth, I particularly enjoyed his use of a wider palette of sounds, adding textures and atmospheres to the songs like never before. He is the reason why Heritage has become one of Opeth's darkest and most atmospheric statements.<br /><br />There are no individual riffs or themes that need to be highlighted; everything works to the perfection of the songs. There is a different level of cohesion between the instruments here. Apart from Axenrot's already mentioned drumming, the bass is central in the sound of this album. In the past, when Mendez put down his lines, they didn't always survive in the mix, partly due to the extreme density of the arrangements. On Heritage, his sound is larger and more focused. He covers a broad spectrum of sound colours, enhancing the guitar solos as well as laying down his own leads. \\"The Lines in My Hand\\" wraps a twisted bass solo into the tension-filled composition, thanks to the Mellotron swells in the mix. On the extremely haunting \\"Nepenthe,\\" complete with deep background voices and excellent percussion, Mendez underscores the charging guitar solo, which suggests suppressed emotions breaking free due to the tense silence that precedes it.<br /><br />Though all songs are great, \\"Folklore\\" is one of the standouts. Some fans have complained about the lack of distinct melodies on the album. \\"Folklore\\" should please them from start to finish. It harbours indelible melodic contructs with the album's best instrumental break embedded within. Again the bass sound simply coheres better than on any prior release, and Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals at the end are achingly beautiful, not to mention the super-tight drumming. Actually, on this album, Akerfeldt's performance is uniformly stunning. The guitar solo at the end of \\"Haxprocess\\" is his most restrained yet emotionally charged solo ever (possibly a single take, too, given it'd sound forced and unnatural otherwise). The shift from Mellotron sounds to the pronounced acoustic passage on this song suggests it was culled from the same material on [[ASIN:B00008OLYN Damnation]] due to the way the vocals are applied (think the clean vocals on Blackwater Park) and the whole song is built to its climax.<br /><br />This may not be a metal album per se, but some of the songs do groove relentlessly. By now, pretty much any fan must have heard \\"The Devil's Orchard,\\" which uses Nietzche's \\"God is dead!\\" line in the lyrics as its chorus to underscore the King Crimson-like instrumental moments. But there is more: \\"Slither\\" is a song in memory of Ronnie James Dio and it features a tightly locked groove over which the band lays down coiling guitar melodies. To achieve compositional diversity, the band uses discreet flute sounds, ethnic percussion, and gorgeous pianos on \\"Famine,\\" one of their most complex tunes seething with emotional breadth. The contribution of Peruvian Afro-Cuban jazz percussionist Alex Acuna is immense, and the transition from the atmospheric parts to hard-hitting passages eclipses just about any song they have written in this style. The only problem with this song is that it ends.<br /><br />The two instrumental songs, \\"Heritage\\" and \\"Marrow of the Earth,\\" open and close the album respectively. While \\"Heritage\\" is comprised by a wonderful Grand piano theme (played by guest musician Joakim Svalberg), \\"Marrow of the Earth\\" is more comprehensive as it brings forth acoustic guitars, light-as-air drums, and Mellotron sounds. The band applies small variations to the central themes, and the resulting melody sticks with you for days on end.<br /><br />Steven Wilson's stereo mixing is top drawer and puts the album in the league of the best in terms of sonic clarity. Travis Smith's artwork is very fitting for the songs on this album, and the black-and-white pictures in the booklet are awesome. You definitely need the whole package.<br /><br />Anyone expecting this to be a metal album is likely to be disappointed. The album might fall short for those who love Opeth for their relentlessly heavy side with gut-wrenching death growls, but those willing to explore the group's more experimental side and give it the chance it deserves will definitely be rewarded.<br /><br />Heritage is a slow-burning masterpiece. Its vision and its power are timeless.ames Dio and it features a tightly locked groove over which the band lays down coiling guitar melodies.

0811879542|5.0|I just received this book in the mail today and read it to my daughter (age 3) for bedtime, she loved it!  She liked pressing the dots and laughed whenever something new appeared.  The book is long enough to be time well spent, but not long enough for my daughter to lose interest.  Very clever book, great purchase!!
0307594777|4.0|This is a very attractive set, complete with it's own case to keep the trilogy in. The order was with amazon, but sent by another company.  They were reliable but slow in delivery.  The books themselves were good reading.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I am not a Lovatic, well, maybe now I am.  I was looking for something to hold me over until Kelly Clarkson's album comes out and I had read something somewhere about Ryan Tedder saying Demi had vocals up there with Kelly, so I thought I'd give it a try. Plus, I love Skyscaper.  OMG, she has a Great voice! It's clear, powerful, and she sings with emotion.   Do I love every song...no, but I love most of them.   I also think she is adorable, which I know is irrelevant.  Anyway, I love the album.  If you love pop singers that can really sing, like Kelly and Adele, give this one a try.

0307454541|5.0|My colleague had been pestering me to read this book for a long time. My wife finally ordered it and I got to read it first. What a thrilling story and refreshingly different style of writing! The book, at least this first part, was mostly about Blomkvist's quest for the truth in a grand estate. Salander has a relatively smaller, but important role. I've heard she is the focus for the sequel, waiting to get to read that too. This book itself is full of suspense and it certainly is a page-turner. Must read!!
0142418218|5.0|This ia my 3rd favorite story by Roald Dahl.  1st is Matilda.  2nd is The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me.    Three stories are quite different.  A heroine of Matilda is a girl  Hero of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a boy.  Heroines and heroes of The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me are animals including human being.    The main thema of Dahl should be  love of family or love of living creatures.  The stories are very light and right.  The characters are strange and funny.  They have good mind and behavior.    I like Dahl very much.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I'm a little concerned that what I've been shipped is a counterfeit. Not only does it not hold a charge like the one that came with our ps3, but it won't function correctly all the time either. Trouble connecting, staying connected, bad lag and unresponsiveness. I only paid ~$35 for something that costs up to $55 elsewhere... The sticker on the back (which included a slightly different model # from the PS3's controller) was crooked - I've been told this is a red flag for counterfeit goods. It probably is a luck of the draw as far as where the one you buy comes from, but buyer beware, even if it's legit, the one I got was not as good as my original. I'm sending it back, and b/c of the fact that they're now shipping on behalf of a different seller, I'm getting a refund instead of a return.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|As a fan of the classic era of Star Wars (1977-1996), I can't support a release dedicated to the Cartoon Editions of the Original Trilogy that were released in 1997 and must be updated every few years because Lucasfilm's animation dates immediately. When the real Original Trilogy is finally released in high-definition on Blu-Ray, I'll be there in a flash.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|*Spoilers ahead*    I am not a purist and don't think Star Wars is the best thing ever, not even close.     But I do think the original trilogy is a fantastic series and some of the best films ever made.     Lucas has been tinkering with Star Wars for decades, and while there are some questionable changes and additions that weaken the series, they were all essentially MINOR, until now. Even Han not shooting first anymore is not THAT big a deal, though still dumb. So while I had sympathy with Star Wars Fans I was never outraged. There are even mess ups like Vader's light saber turning pink on some editions, but again not a huge deal.     Lucas did the prequel trilogy which was utter tripe and destroyed the characters of Vader and made his story not tragic but teen angst rubbish. Even the legendary Obi-Won V Vader Volcano fight was abysmal and Lucas finished it off with a cheesy and ridiculous NOOOOOOOOO at the end when Vader first realises what he has become. However at least if you just treated this crap as non canon like I do, it does not impact on the original trilogy. The Vader in this rubbish is not the same as the original trilogy, it's just a star wars novel brought to screen, it never happened in the official Star Wars story line. That's what I told myself and it worked. It works for the Rocky sequels, Terminator 3 and 4, Robocop 3, Matrix 2 and 3 etc. It's a thing we all do for sequels and prequels that suck, and thats fine as we still have the originals we love.     However now comes the final straw, the stick that broke the camels back, the final nail in the coffin, the final insult. That horrid NOOOOOOOOOOOOO has followed Vader onto Return of the Jedi. During the final ultimate scene where Vader finally turns away from the Dark Side and saves his son by killing the emperor , thus losing his own life, he now screams NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO in the same horrid cheesy way from the prequel trilogy end, as if to mirror it like it's good or something.     This is a change too far, it rips the heart out of the series and ruins the most important scene in the final film. Anyone who claims to like Star Wars needs to STAY AWAY from this release. If people don't buy it Lucas will be forced to re release it on Blu Ray and REMOVE the change!! Vote with your feet/wallet people, don't buy it!!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am an avid reader. With 3 children I still manage to read a book a day. Out of all the books I have read and reviewed, I can honetly say this one is the best. There is a total of only 2 books I would consider rereading out of the hundreds I have read and this is one of them. I'm floored by Travis and in awe the entire book. I usually shy away from characters so young (19) but this one was worth the read. Really Really good. Many other reviews have gone through the plot and in great detail so I will just say READ IT! Wow. I love the angst and Travis as a character with his issues and alphaness.
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|So, I'm a simple fan of Demi's- not a hardcore one; I enjoy her music simply because she gave off really good energy in her previous two albums. Because she caught my attention with her past two CDs, I was really excited to hear this one. But when I heard all the negative comments about Demi's \\"change in sound\\", I felt like I shouldn't buy it- since I was, to be honest, just wanting to hear more of that sound that caught my attention in the first place. I decided to buy it anyway, and I have to say, it's not as bad as I was expecting. It's actually pretty good. Yeah, her sound is different, but it's not a bad thing. Maybe it's because I grew up on this 90's-feeling R&B Demi's trying out with \\"Unbroken\\", but her third album is quite a fun listen.     The tracks where she collaborates with other singers are the ones that are a bit \\"mehhh\\" to me, but again, they're not bad. The songs where she's singing by herself are no doubt the best in my opinion, while the \\"duets\\" seem to just be there to give the album more variety in sound. Her slow songs are just FANTASTIC; very smooth and soulful. I believe it's a good buy. But if you're new to Demi Lovato's music, try her previous albums first. Don't judge Demi's skills based on this album- she said that \\"Unbroken\\" is her experimenting with R&B. If you don't like this album 'cause of this new sound, but still want to listen to her, check out her past two CDs, which showcase her usual sound and what she seems to be comfortable with the most so far.      So yes, buy it. If you're still debating whether or not to buy it, buy it now in the store while it's still $10, 'cause after opening week ends, it'll be priced like a regular CD (around $13-15).

DO NOT BE AFRAID TO DO THE INSTALL ON YOUR OWN!!!!!!!!!!!!! this was the first after market cooler i have ever installed and i did it on my own took about 20 mins because i was super nervous about it but it was a breeze the instructions were alittle lacking on how to install but it gives you the basics. it comes with the screws needed plus thermal paste. I would highly recommend this to others it has the direct heatpipe touching which usually isint seen on a $30 cooler its usually on the $50+ coolers.

B005KAH7QU|5.0|This is my first exposure to the main actress cast in this movie. She was simply superb in a flawless performance. As usual, everything Eric Bana stars in he excells proving again that despite him not getting the fawning attention or perhaps he makes an effort to avoid the fawning attention of the Hollywood Press, he is most assuredly one of the finest actors currently working.<br />The story line, the finale, everything about the movie was simply great. Kate Blanchette excells in her role as a truly evil shady pseudo governmental agent head.......I just simply loved everything about this movie.<br />The future will be bringing a LOT of roles for the young lady that portrayed the title character....she is quite talented.

0739384198|5.0|Stieg Larsson wrote a wonderful trilogy; I've just finished enjoying all three audio books.  He had a wonderful grasp of the complexity of women, and wrote with an incredible sensitivity to and obvious respect for women. I'm so sorry he didn't live to write more books.  This was an amazing story with more twists and turns than anyone could either expect or even imagine.  If you like conspiracy plots and capable, intelligent, interesting characters with an occasional LOL you will love this series.

0811847365|4.0|In the Star Wars movies we saw relatively few nonsapient creatures, but obviously \\"a galaxy far, far away\\" must have quadrillions upon quadrillions of them.  This book is a look at some of the possibilities.  Visiting such planets as Tatooine, Hoth, Dagobah, Naboo, Bespin, Endor, Yavin IV, and Coruscant, the authors introduce us to a wild and fascinating array of animals both benign and predacious, beautiful and homely, domesticated and wild, all illustrated with full-color pen-and-ink sketches.  Here we learn about the bantha and its relationship with the Sandpeople, the wampa and tauntaun, the sarlacc, the krayt dragon, and even some of the lost lifeforms of Alderaan.  (Intriguingly, we also find that \\"the species equus [i.e., horse] is found on several planets,\\" including a pony used by the Ewoks and \\"a large, black breed ridden by the Dathomir witches.\\")  One two-page spread near the back of the book depicts a group of Senators with their pets, including a Wookiee whose companions make me wish the authors would compile a second volume, this one to include animals of Kazhyyyk and Han Solo's Corell.  Fans of the movies should definitely add this book to their collections.

B004RSCWZ2|4.0|I'm a big fan of calling it like I see it.  If this disc had Bonnie Raitt's name on it, it would be much more warmly received.  There is a certain amount of expectation given Derek's previous releases being much more slide guitar/world music amalgams.  Those expectations have led to proportional disappointment.  However, this is still very good.  Midnight in Harlem is a great tune.  Derek, even on his previous releases, was always unselfish, to his own detriment.  The difference here is that his wife has taken on much of the focus and being an artist in her own right, taken on a certain amount of creative control.  I really feel for Mike Mattison.  I always thought, his voice, to be one of the soon to be appreciated aspects of the DTB.  Here, he's relegated to back up and one duo with Susan.  Let's hope that the DTB, proper, and Mike Mattison's voice, specifically, are the logical next step.
B004H83IG4|5.0|\\"All good things\\" is a brilliant absorbing and ultimately provocative drama thriller with a good direction and amazing performances by the three leading actors.It reminded in a way \\"Revolutionary Road\\" because we have the portrait of the desire of a perfect existence and the subsequent broken dreams of a couple. But in \\"All good things\\" not every reasons are explained because the director is telling a real story(the names of the characters in the movie were changed)that is still a mystery and the leading actor of this drama is an enigma. David Marks(Ryan Gosling)son of a powerful real estate man(Frank Langella)tries to establish a perfect and peaceful life with his wife Kathie(Kirsten Dunst)by avoiding his duties in the family business(legal and illegal).But it won't be easy for him to resist at the pressure by his strong father and he will be forced to take part of the ominous projects of his persuasive father.Besides,his increasing psychological problems will destroy his life with his wife.The second part of the movie is a shocking and bizarre look at the last years of the disturbed man and the homicides of his two friends.And the movie becomes a sort of \\"Psycho\\". What we see is the results of murder investigations. I liked the mixture of themes such love,corruption,madness,mystery and murder and Andrew Jarecki did very well in showing the growth and reasons of the characters,although David remains an enigma in many of his actions.I really liked the details he offered and I was drawn from the beginning to the end.The movie is predictable in some parts but in the last one is a real unexpected turn.Ryan Gosling was great in playing a troubled man and I was moved by the portrayal of this poor soul that had no chance to live in peace with himself.Also he shows some sinister sign of madness that are really overwhelming. Kirsten Dunst was simply terrific in portraying a victim of the husband and his powerful family but also an ambitious woman who tried to get advantagesby the the whole situation in terms of the prospect of a wealthy life.For her amazing acting she should have been nominated for an Oscar.Frank Langella was really good in the role of the cold and manipulative father.The three characters are really complex and not easily categorized.\\"All good things\\"is probably one of the most appealing and interesting movie of the year.It has real great and original moments and although it doesn't provide an easy solution to the case it is not a distracting thing in my opinion(since it's still an open case).

B003ZTQN1I|1.0|...that's the sound of Sony stealing greenbacks right out of your pocket. I guess they just aren't happy making an honest buck off of an actual soundtrack. So they put a couple of songs from the movie on this disc, and the rest on the second. I don't normally buy soundtracks, and I don't normally buy country music, but the songs in the movie are beautifully crafted songs which are performed phenomenally by the ACTORS IN THE MOVIE. I don't want Faith Hill, or Trace Adkins; nothin' against them, you understand, but they DIDN'T PERFORM IN THIS MOVIE. So ... Sony, hear that silence? it's the sound of me NOT buying these so-called soundtracks. And while I'm at it, I'm going to be sure NOT TO BUY anything else made by you for a long, long time, 'cause I don't appreciate being ripped off.

But then . . . he'll go eight notes higher - where he hadn't been before. And you realize: `Oh! He's the most tasteful singer in the WORLD'.\\"<br /><br />At the end of their terrific duet [on one of Sinatra's signature tunes, ONE FOR MY BABY (AND ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD)] the two men trade quips. Bennett says:  \\"Let's have another drink! Bartender - fill it up again, will ya? [and then] Sleep tight!\\" Mayer (as if pinching himself to see if he's really just sung with `The Master'  quips to the recording engineer (or to producer Phil Ramone): \\"Can I get a copy of this?\\"<br /><br />The producer himself states a simple truth about these `intuitively' terrific collaborations. Says Mr. Ramone:  \\"Tony is an incredibly good partner for a duet. He has the (right) technique: just relaxed, there is no tension. `We can do as many takes as you want.' Which doesn't turn out to be a lot!\\"<br /><br />That `putting-you-at- ease' (one of Mr. Bennett's life-long distinguishing features) is summed up perfectly by Carrie Underwood who was delighted to transcend her country roots in her lovely collaboration on, IT HAD TO BE YOU (the song Johnny Mercer felt was \\"the best popular song ever written\\"). Ms Underwood summed up concisely her new musical hero's approach to duets, allowing them to unfold in a natural way:<br /><br />\\"[Just] being around Tony is inspiration! It's not like he has to sit you down and say, `You have to do this, this -- this and this.' He doesn't do that.  He [like you] wants everything to be very `organic.' He wants people to do duets as themselves - and have them bring their `thing' [just] as he brings HIS thing.\\"<br /><br />Again, according to the Master:<br /><br />\\"Making a Duet album . . . there is a `game' to it - that makes it work. The whole thing is - both singers have to be different: When you hear Ella sing with Louis Armstrong - she sings sweet; he sings `raspy,' like a trumpet solo, rather than a vocal. The success of a `duets' album is the DIFFERENCE between each [singer] the CONTRAST --  between [for instance] a CALM singer, and one that's `going all over,' is what makes it happen.\\"<br /><br />My personal favorites here? Tony's chemistry with the great Ladies of Song - especially Faith Hill's contribution to THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT (the first \\"Best Song\\" Oscar-winner for Dorothy Fields in long ago 1936). Also dear to my heart (thanks to lush and lovely arrangements by Jorge Calandrelli) is Queen Latifah's sensitive reading of WHO CAN I TURN TO (WHEN NOBODY NEEDS ME). And, since I'm forever partial to \\"Nat's little girl\\" I especially delight in Natalie Cole's WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. I think (like me) Ms Cole may consider that great song (an overlooked gem from 40 years ago) to be one of Tony's finest recordings.  So. Something here for everyone?

Accidentally came across this when browsing and it was an impulse buy. Played the CD and was immediately reminded of the 80's - different times! Must have for any Dire Straits fan!

I purchased some of her books when Borders was going out of business, Im going to skim those (you really don' thave to read them) and then I'm through. I don't plan to pick up another one of these books until I read a review saying that the character has grown.
B000MKXEME|5.0|Ready for something weird and wild that will make you laugh and nearly lose your lunch in the process? Look no further; you have found \\"Re-Animator.\\"<br /><br />Directed by Stuart Gordon and drawn from an H.P. Lovecraft story, \\"Re-Animator\\" tells the story of two college kids who find their lives turned upside down when they discover a special serum that can rejuvenate dead tissue, effectively bringing the dead back to life. Unfortunately the re-animation process has its downfalls as its subjects come back as manic and maniacal undead meat-bags. The pair also finds themselves at odds with an authority figure that takes a liking to a lady-friend and threatens to squash their discovery. Shenanigans ensue in an all-out frenzied finale that will leave you wondering what you just saw.<br /><br />The anchor of the film, Jeffrey Combs, plays college student by day/mad scientist by night Herbert West with such a creepy and convincing delivery that you forget he's playing a character. By his side are his hapless roommate played by Bruce Abbot and the chronically undressed Barbara Crampton as the plot-device that comes between the pair and their foe, the unrelentingly bitter professor played with exquisite expertise and a seemingly endless amount of glee by David Gale. Pile on a heavy dosage of severed heads, rotting corpses and oozing red stuff, and you have a meal that won't disappoint. All of this is of course delivered with an underlying sense of humor that is typical of `80s gross-out flicks like \\"Evil Dead II\\" and \\"Return of the Living Dead,\\" making \\"Re-Animator\\" a bizarre yet intoxicating cocktail that never fails to entertain time and time again.
B000BOGB30|5.0|Purchased this for an event by POLLYANNA OF LITTLETON, INC, which was promoting POLLYANNA DAY in June when I couldn't find my copy. Very pleased with it and the seller's efficiency in getting it to me.
B001AOKA3W|4.0|After reading all of the reviews, I wasn't sure if this \\"Blair Witch\\" film-style movie was going to be aggravating because from poor video and a jumpy camera, or if it was going to fulfill my desire to see monsters tearing things up and the military blasting the ever-living crap out of the thing.  I pretty much got my wish.  I also liked the yuppie romance as well, as that also would fulfill any hopeless romantic's wish.  There was some pretty extreme destruction, a decent amount of good military hardware, lots of tense moments, and reasonably intelligent characters who weren't making too many really dumb decisions...except for the romantically-driven ones (depending on how you look at it)!    All in all it was much better than I expected.  I sure hope one of these monsters never shows up, however! In spite of the shellacking the military was giving it, it didn't want to die!
B000XUDHOI|5.0|An interesting story about love and sexual discovery, told from the woman's perspective. Louisa's experiences with Dr. Gordon are unusual and 'improper' but it touches something deep inside of her and she is captivated by him. She tells herself she does not like him but continues to see him and to meet all his demands. His analysis of her past and dreams torment her, but also intrigues her, yet she does not fully grasp the extent of her relationship with Gordon until the very end.<br /><br />Templeton's idea's around the conflict many woman experience between a 'sense of duty' or doing what internally feels right, is relevant even today; she knows what Gordon is doing is considered wrong but she wants it. It gives her something she needs and elevates her sense of who she is. Her message is clear, \\"If you keep yourself from doing what you want to do, you'll wander like a tired guest on this dim earth.\\" Louisa and Dr. Crombie's discussions at the end gave meaning to the whole story, it wasn't until I reached this point that I fully understood her message. Most of us choose out of a sense of duty, or what is expected of us but she warns us against that. The question I am left with is, How realistic is it that anyone will find their perfect union?
B003MWHVLY|5.0|I first came across Sia when my husband told me about her song \\"Buttons.\\" He really liked that song and wanted to pick up her previous album. It turns out I ended up becoming a fan of hers more than my husvand after hearing \\"Some People Have Real Problems.\\" I picked up her album \\"We Are Born\\" and was not disappointed in the least. She has many catchy songs like \\"Clap Your Hands,\\" \\"You've Changed,\\" and and \\"Be Good To Me.\\" The songs stick with you and energetic to follow along with when taking a road trip. Her cover of Madonna's \\"Oh Father,\\" from \\"Like A Prayer,\\" is another gem on this album. I highly recommend this album if you are looking for something different in a good way. Seeing her live will make you love the album more. Sia has a friendly, outgoing presence on stage and you can tell she loves what she does.

B0052GACNM|5.0|This is an amazing album, from top to bottom. I had no idea how versatile some of the singers could be such as Carrie Underwood, Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, etc.  I really enjoyed every single performance.<br /><br />My favorites would have to be Carrie Underwood and Amy Winehouse, hands down. Both ladies capture a retro sound beautifully in their performances, and they compliment Tony very nicely.<br /><br />It is a very nice mix of yesterday meets today's artists, without cheapening it or destroying the original song.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Bennett. I see Grammys in your future (again!). :)
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I bought this the first time around from a 3rd party seller only to get the wrong DVD.  Hey, this is a great deal and Amazon does you right.
0545259088|2.0|This is probably the hardest review I've ever had to write. [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]] tears my heart in two every single time I read it. I felt [[ASIN:0545123291 Linger]] had its problems, mostly in the diluted narrative with the addition of two more POVs, but it was still extremely moving and I wanted to see what happened next. How strange it is, then, to read Forever and experience nothing even close to the emotions the first two books inspired.     The Wolves of Mercy Falls series is love story told almost like a fairy tale. Aside from the bittersweet urgency of the romance, one of the most poignant elements in the books to me has been the wolves' desperate struggle to hang onto their human selves. The knowledge that they will lose every shard of awareness of who they are moves me unbearably, and Sam and Grace together are unlike any other couple I've ever read.     I am far less interested in Isabel and Cole. I like them just fine, even though they are both just typical YA characters that can be found in 100 other novels. If they had an entirely different book to themselves I probably would like them better--but they don't. They're stuck right in the middle of Sam and Grace's story, and the intrusiveness of losing momentum in every other chapter as the story switched to their first person POVs became an increasingly frustrating experience. This is the end. There are no more books. I don't care a bit about Isabel's ongoing daddy issues or Cole's woe-is-me rock star problems, all of which are rehashes from the previous book, I care about what happens to Sam and Grace. The story is even further fragmented by the addition of yet another POV, which was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story.     There are too many starts and stops that interrupt the flow of the action, there is a scene of shocking ugliness that I thought was completely out of place, and the actual resolution to the problem seemed to be dragged out far too long. I also didn't find a single quote that I wanted to pull. I normally am rapturous over the author's prose as well, but even the language in Forever didn't move me as much. Sam and Grace also seemed like shadows of their former selves, and I found myself becoming impatient with the way their narratives dawdled over insignificant details.     The only scene that really moved me--yes, the only scene--comes very early in the book (spoiler alert!) when Sam is racing to pick up Grace after she's turned human again for the first time and the awful feelings he experiences at that moment. There are a few good scenes later in the novel that involve some sacrifices, but I read them with a fairly detached attitude. I'm not sure if I'd just become so numb by that time that I wasn't able to fully immerse myself again, or whether they really just didn't hold the same urgency and depth that I've come to expect from this series.     What I found most disappointing, however, is that so many scenes did not ring emotionally true. If you've been separated from the love of your life for months, the first thing you would do when you become human again is to findhimfindhimfindhim and hang on tight before you lose yourself again. It's not to wander out to have a random meaningless conversation with someone else. (And he would probably not have let you out of his sight to begin with.) The reunion scene was incredibly distant and anticlimactic, and the actual ending was even more of an emotional dodge. Everything honestly felt as though it was done for sake of a writing technique rather than something that was really true to the characters--or true to human nature.     Readers who are invested in Isabel and Cole's story will probably like this one much better than I did. But for me, this story has always been about the boy who became a wolf in winter and the girl who loved him. I am unbearably saddened that their beautiful story has become so diluted and so...mundane. It's possible a future re-reading may make me look upon this book with a different perspective, but frankly that's pretty hard to believe at this point. I bleeding heart love Shiver and will always be grateful for the beauty and wisdom and romance it brought into my life. But I will probably be much happier if I forever look upon it as a standalone novel that is perfect in and of itself.
B004V98UKS|2.0|As others have mentioned, the control design/layout just feels lacking.  Seems like it might be a nice puzzle game, except for the fact that the screen resolution is off on my phone.

0316098329|1.0|I've read about a lot of different crimes, in far more detail than I'd care to remember. In all the tragedies that I've read about, manmade or otherwise, no act of violence has ever made my heart wrench more than the prolonged imprisonment of a human being for sexual purposes. It's also the crime I have the most difficulty in comprehending, as I cannot imagine the amount of inhumanity it would take to capture someone and look her in the eye, day after day for years, without mercy and without pity. I still get very upset when I read about these things, even years after the events which no doubt inspired this book.     To say that I was very interested in reading this book is therefore an understatement. The subject matter and the editorial accolades made this sound like a novel that was not to be missed, and the author's other work is very well-reviewed. And in the beginning of the book, I was content enough with the developments of the story, as the reader gets to know Jack and his Ma and the Room in which they've lived for so many years.     About halfway through, however, I started to become impatient with the constraints of the format the author had chosen. Having a 5-year-old narrator became an extremely frustrating exercise, both in terms of his (understandable) unwillingness to comprehend or listen to certain things and in terms of getting a truly emotional take on the experience. I don't fault the decision to write this from a child's point of view, but I do think it would have been a deeper, more rewarding story had it been narrated from an older child's perspective--perhaps from a 10-year-old's POV. I'm not certain that the voice was entirely convincing in and of itself, either; after awhile, the tendency to name every object as if it were a proper pronoun became a little tiresome, and there are interjections of thoughts and passages that are far too mature for Jack's thought processes. \\"In the world I notice persons are nearly always stressed and have no time,\\" for example, shows up towards the end. (I also refuse to believe that any 5-year-old could go to a Natural History Museum and not be enthralled by the dinosaurs.) Filtering this story through someone so young also meant that the reader gains far less insight into his mother's pain and his captor's background than you might hope.     The author does include convincing details of Jack's attachment to Room itself, nice moments of closeness with his Ma, and attempts to provide adult insight and terminology through overhead conversations or snippets on tv. Overall, however, this novel was a big disappointment to me. I expected to feel something for these characters--and if it could not be something profoundly deep and empathetic, I'd at least hoped for something more than simple intellectual interest and pity. In the end, there are two things I wanted from this book: to have some degree of deeper insight into the suffering that these characters endured and to be moved by their plight. For me, this book offered neither.

1451629184|4.0|This is a monumental book in many ways. It's one of the few times that a victim of prolonged sexual imprisonment has come forth to tell her story, and the importance of having a record of this first-hand account cannot be discounted. Jaycee Dugard was kidnapped at the age of 11 and held captive for 18 years while a man repeatedly raped her and had her bear two of his children. She was miraculously freed at the age of 29 and, two years later, seems to be overall pretty well-adjusted and happy.     I've read a fair amount on this subject, but it's still very painful to read about Jaycee's story. One of the awful things about her situation is that her captor was \\"nice\\" to her when he wasn't assaulting her, sobbing and apologizing profusely, and telling her she was \\"helping him\\" with his problem. The confusion of dealing with that must do untold amounts of damage, since if someone is always monstrous, it's much easier to look upon him as the enemy. While it's natural to wonder about these things, it has always troubled me when I hear strongly worded questions about why victims in these situations don't try harder to escape. I think it's very difficult to imagine the amount of physical and psychological fear and confusion that these women undergo, as well as the coping mechanisms that they must use in order to simply survive. Through Jaycee's words, it's possible to come closer to understanding how someone in a devastating situation is relentlessly conditioned into doing a dominant person's bidding--and how her reality changed so much that she began to look upon being separated from her captor with crippling fear of the unknown.     While I am glad that readers have a chance to read Jaycee's story, it does worry me that it comes so soon after her release in 2009. Elizabeth Smart has similarly just signed on to be a commentator for ABC News, and it makes you wonder if Elisabeth Fritzl can be too far behind. I cannot even begin to imagine the kind of damage this kind of violence and depravity does to someone, let alone a child whose character hadn't even been fully formed at the time of her kidnapping. It troubles me to think that in our insistent need for information and our need for heroic stories in this modern age, we may unintentionally be harming these poor women with the pressure to present a pulled-together, picture-perfect image for our benefit.     But perhaps I don't give enough credit to their strength. While there is a great deal of pain in reading Jaycee's story as you relive her suffering, it is also impossible not to be moved by the resiliency of the human spirit. The joy she took in the pets that came and went over the years; her attempts to stay positive, chronicled through journal entries; her pleasure in the birth of her \\"beautiful baby girls.\\" One of the things that touched me the most was the notion that a child of 17--with a fifth grade education--was determined to provide some sort of education and future for her two children by downloading daily lesson plans and teaching them herself. It speaks to an extraordinary spirit, as well as to the extraordinary capacity of the human heart.     The fact that these kinds of violent acts happen in the world are incredibly shameful and tragic. In sharing her story, however, Jaycee Dugard has helped many readers to see that human beings can and do survive impossible situations...and that it's important to appreciate the many precious freedoms that we so often take for granted.     A note about the book: This is an incredible piece of testimony to a shocking perpetuation of violence against a human being. I am glad that the publishers chose to keep Jaycee's young voice, which sounds unspoiled and unguarded in a surprising and touching way. There were some editorial missteps, however, that I felt detracted from the book quite a bit, including leaving in inconsistent tenses, confusing timelines, and switching back and forth perhaps a little too often between past and presentfor a fairly short book. Addressing these issues would have streamlined the book immensely, and it's puzzling that more efforts weren't made to provide a better framework for the story.

0545123275|5.0|Lovely, lyrical, and achingly sad. Shiver is more introspective than most YA books and is sometimes criticized for being too slow or wordy, but I found it to be beautifully written, tragic, and a gorgeous take on werewolf lore. Sam's desperate struggle to hold onto his humanity is incredibly poignant, and his heartrending relationship with Grace is deeply emotional and sweet. It's a book that makes me cry every time I read it.     *****************************************************  Excerpt:    Sam cupped my face in his hands and looked me in the eyes. His eyes were yellow, sad, wolf, mine.     \\"These stay the same. Remember that when you look at me. Remember it's me. Please.\\"     *****************************************************    PS--this book is NOTHING like Twilight, despite the inevitable comparisons because of the subject matter. It's in a class all its own.

1401310400|1.0|I read this book eagerly, as I am a huge fan of the show and particularly love the character of Rick Castle.  There was some of the wit which is present in the show, but it felt like the show's excellent script-writing had been uncomfortably mashed into book form.  The characterisations were poor.  I didn't expect them to be such cheap copies of the show's characters, and I was very aware of the expectation that the reader would recognise these characters.  Rick Castle in the show comes across as very intelligent and capable.  Writing is his craft; the poor quality of the book really undermined his supposed skills.  I agree with the reviewer who said this read like fanfiction - the plot was ok but nothing special and the characterisation was heavily reliant on the characterisations set up by the show.      Rick Castle could do better. (If, you know, he weren't also fictional!)

Is it bad I want to go to France and meet an &Eacute;tienne? =D I've always wanted to travel to Europe but France was not on my list of countries to visit, now it is. Stephanie Perkins changed my mind. Throughout the book I wished I could be in Anna's place visiting all the places she went. Stephenie wrote in a way that I could feel Anna's fear of being in a foreign country but also her excitement for knowing more about it.<br /><br />I'm so happy with how things turned out for her and &Eacute;tienne. (Aw &Eacute;tienne, why aren't you real?) I swear I could feel their chemistry through the pages and couldn't stop thinking \\"They need to be together!\\" \\"Be together already!\\" \\"Come on, you're in love with each other, admit it once and for all!\\" So yes, I loved the ending.<br /><br />Just stop reading my review and read the book! I totally recommend it.<br /><br />Update for Amazon:<br />Anna and the French Kiss now belongs to my favorite books list (and my list isn't of 10 books yet so this says a lot).<br />I can't wait to read Stephanie's next book. I can't wait to have Lola and the Boy Next Door in my hands!

There is not a bad song on the CD. I'm glad I got the deluxe version because the 2 bonus songs are great!<br /><br />Original Review<br />I have listened to this a couple of times through and I'd have to say I'm very impressed. This newest recording is old school progressive rock at its best! Almost, Wishbone Ash or Uriah heep-like but with an opeth edge. Most fans have embraced Damnation [[ASIN:B00008OLYN Damnation]] which was also a massive departure from the doom sound and it sounds UNBELIEVABLE in concert! It gives your head a chance to catch up from all the thrashing you endure with the rest of the set list. it's simply great music By great musicians. In the end I still have blackwater and morningrise for some 15 minute thrash sessions. My favorite songs from this CD are: Nepenthe, Pyre,The Lines in my hand, and especially Famine. The entire CD is unbelievable through headphones but Famine is mind-blowing through the phones. I can't wait to hear these in concert! The DVD has the songs remixed for 5 to 1 which I am unfortunately unable to use yet. It also contains 2 bonus songs: Pyre and Snow in your face which your supposed to be able to download from roadrunners website. For me the making of Heritage was an interesting look into their thoughts. definitely worth watching at least once. It gave me a better appreciation for the album knowing what they were trying to accomplish and how they did it.<br />I love the new direction and I am excited to see whats next!ed to see whats next!
1615243496|5.0|When I came across this book I had to buy it.  If you're a fan of classic horror, you'll love the story that inspired the movies.  But if you're looking for a couple hundred pages of grunts, growls, and \\"fire bad...arrrrggghhh!\\" don't buy this book.  It's a more intelligent read than that.  I won't go into the story itself, most everyone around the world is familiar with the basic premise of the Frankenstein tale.<br /><br />The book itself is beautiful.

You stick your nose close to the binding and sniff.  If it smells like a brand new pair of Buster Browns it's leather.  Along with the leather binding it has quality end pages, the page edges are gilded giving them a nice sheen when the book is closed, and like a good quality bound book it has a sewn in ribbon book mark.<br /><br />It's been printed in fairly large print on heavy stock paper and is easy to read, but as this work of fiction was penned almost 200 years ago the reading may be a little slow until you get used to the vernacular of the early 1800's.  However, there are footnotes throughout the book that define and explain certain words and references that might confuse the modern reader.<br /><br />This is a true literary classic, no library should be considered complete without this title in the collection.  This particular edition would be a beautiful addition to anyone's book collection.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Superbe HD quality, if you are a Star Wars fan, you have to see them in High Definition and own them in HD... I have a 720p only projector but it looks already sooooo gooood!!!  And when I will get a 1080p projector... I will get even more out of those jewels over many years... ;)    I was a little disapointed by the Blu-ray box itself... and the last edits done on the original pictures but it does not bother me that much!    Watching Empire Strike Back now and the pictures look just AWESOME! I can't believe this is from 1980!!    Enjoy and May the Force be with you.... always!!    Cheers!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Best series release ever. Amazing detail and quality went into the packaging and the movies look absolutely great.    Really rekindles the experience. Highly recommend this box set over any others!!!
B00015BIOQ|5.0|State of the art album, finally got one!   Few years ago, as one of audiophiles, I was on B&W show in Croatia and heard one goooood song, \\"No sanctuary here\\". After that song, I wasn't interested on speakers anymore :) sorry B&W.   I was only interested in buying that CD.   This album is quality recorded, real audiophile release. Mix of country and blues with perfect voice and guitar of Chris Jones.  Highly recommended!
0887307280|5.0|Before I wrote this review, I checked out the 1-star negative reviews.  The majority of them focused on one of three negative issues: Michael Gerber is a blowhard, they don't agree with his stance on franchises, and the book is full of fluff and isn't packed with valuable information.    The third complaint is the easiest to deal with:  this book costs ten bucks.  Do you really think that you're going to achieve a Stanford education in a small book?  Yes, this book is a very condensed, nearly simplistic approach to a MASSIVE undertaking.  It is merely a start to any business owner's education, but that does not diminish the importance of that start.  Mr. Gerber makes clear and supported statements regarding the importance and the implementation of essential business systems.  Once you've learned the importance of these systems from this book, it's up to you to go out and educate yourself further as you grow your business.  But this book is GREAT at helping you know exactly where to focus your efforts, which makes learning MUCH easier.    As for many of the erroneous claims that \\"Gerber says that you should buy into a franchise\\" and such, this is simply untrue.  I've read this book a dozen times, and I've never put it down thinking that I should go out and buy a franchise.  The only things regarding franchises that I learned from this book is that franchises generally EXIST as franchises because they have developed a system that has made them effective to duplicate and have proven some level of success, and that we should design our OWN businesses as if we INTEND on franchising them ourselves.  By doing this, it forces us to design quantifiable systems for our business that we can reference for growth.  It's a fantastic concept and E-Myth does a great job explaining why it's a good idea.    Finally, is Gerber a blowhard?  I can see where some people might not like his style of writing.  But is he a fool to use a $10 book to promote his primary business of consulting?Hahahaha not at all!!!  In fact, if the people who complained about this had spent less time finding flaws in Gerber's writing, and more time implementing his teachings, they'd realize that it's just good business to use this book as an entry-level introduction to his methodology's, while still providing solid value in basic business ideas.      That's how ALL businesses become successful!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The price is pretty good for the item, but there are some very apparent problems. I use a samsung galaxy s phone.     1. if you put the phone in portrait mode by tilting the head to the side, the whole thing will TILT OVER.     2. it tilts over mainly because the legs don't spread as wide as it is shown in the pictures. very narrow adjustment range.     the legs are also super plasticky
B003VANOFY|4.0|This wireless gaming headset comes with a USB adapter that pairs with the headset itself to provide wireless communication.  The headset, like most headsets, is not comfortable to wear, especially for an extended period of time.  For someone like me who sweats like a pig in the heat of gaming, it's really uncomfortable, actually.  But the sound quality totally surprised me -- for the first time playing games on my PC, I felt I *was* there.  Also, there was little lag, which is an important feature when battling in games. I have to admit I'm more of a cnosole gamer, and the discomfort of wearing this does make me stay away from it, but for the times when I play PC games, this is an invaluable accessory.
B004LWZW4C|2.0|X-Men: First Class was a good movie trailer. The company that cobbled the trailer scenes together to make it appear as one coherent whole did outstanding work and should be commended. And maybe they should have been responsible for the movie itself, because the trailer is so much better than the movie.    The trailer made this new X-Men appear as though it'd be taking a page from The Dark Knight playbook - a deeper, more thoughtful superhero movie set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Heavy, real world politics with a smattering of spandex. The movie is just heavy on the spandex. Figurative spandex.    The movie (I will not refer to this thing as a film, ever... it's just a movie) begins in a strange manner - recreating the scene with a young Magneto from the first X-Men film wherein he pulls down a metallic Nazi gate. Ok, so this movie is not a reboot, as it's opening with an almost exact recreation of a previously shot scene. Only, unless I am mistaken, it was a similar scene, but not exact. It was either reshot or reedited and much of the raw emotion that was present the first time around has vanished. This scene just wasn't as potent as it had been. So this movie starts off with a sloppy, uncreative beginning. And it's not a reboot.    Hey, here comes Professor X. He's young and has hair. He is also Austin Powers. I never knew that was how Professor X got his start, but there he is on-screen asking a bevy of beauties if they'd like to \\"shag now or shag later\\". Oh, BE-HAVE, Xavier!    A young Dr. Moira lady. Where did her British accent go? I mean, she has one when she is older, but now she is clearly American. Huh..? It's a reboot? Oh... then what was up with that first scene? Huh?    Oh yeah, I forgot that Xavier and Mystique were BFFs growing up. That's really important because it's stupid. Was that in the comics? If so, then I don't apologize because it's still stupid. And here's how it happened:    This movie has too many mutants. You might think to yourself, \\"That is just not possible! Too many? Harumph! You can never have too many mutants,\\" but you can. You really can. In trying to shoehorn so many mutants into this thing, they either come off as ill-placed or are not really explored enough to make their presence worthwhile. Style over substance abounds here.    Speaking of the mutants... remember in X2 when Hank McCoy, who will later become Beast, is still a man? Not so, says this movie. You didn't see it because Hank changed into Beast long before that. So this is a reboot, then? But then why are Magneto and Xavier trying to pick up Hugh Jackman in a bar? Ugh. This movie is bad.    Magneto becomes Irish at several points. Get that accent in check, buddy! And the screenplay is pathetic. Really quite drecky. Quite a bad bit of dialogue. Maybe not Lucas bad, but right up there.    I love when a good mutant goes bad! Did I say \\"love\\"? What I meant to say was \\"used to\\". I'm \\"used to\\" a good mutant going bad. Pyro, Jean Grey and now that mutant what can fly and spit fire? What's her name? Yeah, her. But she was a stripper so... you know... we saw it coming.    Overall, I'd say this movie does a good job... of making X-Men 3 look like art in comparison. Avoid this drivel.
B005COO1X6|5.0|As usual, King keeps you riveted to your seat (no pun intended).  A great story even though it was reminiscent of Christine, but with a horrifying twist.  Again, King has this strange was of making you want more, then he stops.  Kind of like someone taking away your favorite ice cream cone when you're in the middle of eating it, but then you realize the memory of the ice cream and that's ok.  Yes, that was kind of weird, but King is a great author who keeps putting out fantastic stories.  Just read this, it's quick and it's King!!!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I bought this set last week and am very happy for the most part. The OT has never looked better and Episodes II and III looked so good on DVD that it was hard to compare. However, the audio on all movies was astounding except on Episodes II and especially IV the audio would cut out for something like a tenth of a second. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I returned the set for a new one and the same thing happened in the same parts of the movie so I know that it is not my equipment.
B001IF252M|5.0|It's small, well built, rugged, and it works. I have a mid 2010 15 inch MacBook Pro. The adapter plugged in perfectly, a VGA male cable for my projector fit perfectly (a little snug the way I like it), and my Mac and projector talked to each other to set the best screen resolution for the projector. The image was exactly what I expected, sharp and accurate.<br /><br />This is the genuine article, Apple packaging and Apple branded. Yes it is way over priced for what the cable does. But it will last a lifetime and it works every time. Saving a few dollars just didn't seem worth it to take a risk on the cable not working.
6305907145|3.0|The makers ought to have just wrote their own script if this is what they planned on doing, but marketing will win over, I suppose. There is little resemblence between this and Jane Austen's novel.<br /><br />On its own, it's a good enough film. The villains are very bad and the heroine is likable enough, even if she does seem almost bi-polar at times. It is no surprise that she is oddly written, what with the spunk put into a character that is not supposed to have any. Of course, the basic plot points don't work with this new-found backbone and so they go back to shy Fanny Price when needed. The Bertram household versus the Price household was well enough done to make us believe that Fanny might marry a man that she doesn't love, but the added slavery subplot is strange and unnecessary. The ending was not romantic enough to be satisfactory after all of the melodrama.<br /><br />On a more vapid note, Johnny Lee Miller's lipstick really bothered me.
0679746323|5.0|If the USA government has a deep understanding of how KMT lost China to Mao between 1945 and 1949 and why the USA government cut the military supply to Jiang's army in 1947 while sitting and watching Stalin supplied weapons and transferred the Japanese weapons to Mao, then the USA would have a better strategy in dealing with the CCP.  Today, their strategy and tactic haven't changed a bit than the period between 1945 and 1949. The two timing are also similar: while Jiang's KMT army was busy in fighting with the Japanese in WWII, the CCP secretly raised army in deep mountains of China and expanded territory where KMT could not have man power to control; while today's USA busy in fighting with ISIS and other terrorists threatening the value of democracy, the CCP assembled AIIB and used other nation's money to collect its own power in his deep backdoor where the USA can not reach.  Between 1948 and 1949, the currency of KMT devalues and becomes worthless. I don't think the same fate would happen to the US Dollar in the near future, however, if AIIB could succeed, the value of US Dollar would devalue, that's for sure.  When the CCP meets a formidable competitor, they retreat, collect more force and pretend to shake hands with you by lowering your guard. Eventually the &#34;1949&#34; of the South China Sea will come if the USA can not see through the CCP's delicated designed strategy.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|People who think that all costume dramas are staid and boring should watch this. The plot is entertaining all on its own, even if it does not benefit from the satire in Jane Austen's writing. The actors are perfect in their parts and the costume are darling. Catherine's fantasies are laugh out loud funny, too. I love the one where she imagines the carriage being attacked. I was pleasantly surprised by this adaptation, as I was expecting something less light-hearted and more gothic. The kiss at the end was perfect too. They played it like they had no idea what they were doing, which is great because these types characters in the classics would not have and that is a point that filmmakers so often overlook.
B001DSNG36|4.0|I saw GB 30 years ago and loved his performance.  I have collected most of his albums but lacked a DVD.  I ordered this and one other.  This was fair but the video and recording quality and the audience blocking view of the stage made it a little less than perfect.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|If you're bored at the begining of this, I promise you won't be after the first hundred pages. It's a slow starter, but once it gets going, it is one of the most intriguing books you'll ever read.<br /><br />Rarely does a novel pull off the first person perspective as well as Rebecca does. It is often just a plot device for cute asides, but here it is a true window into a fascinating subject. Were this novel from Maxim's POV, for example, it would not work. All of the descriptions and all of the imagining tell us only what the heroine sees. What is really happening at any given point is anyone's guess until all is explaining in the shocking climax. What makes this book different from, say, Jane Eyre or The Mistress of Mellyn, is that it makes use of the reader's own security. It taps into that part of our brains that is always thinking, \\"Am I good enough? How do I compare? Am I loved?\\"<br /><br />Maxim, love him or hate him, is one of the least cliche characters I have ever read. Everytime you think you know what he is going to say, he says something completely different. Not even Mr. Darcy's horrid proposal could compare to Maxim's. He is, truly a unique character.<br /><br />Read it. When you're through, watch Hitchcock's film version. While movies so often can't compare to novels, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000053GTF|4.0|We are big Celine fans so we accept what is offered.  Having said that watching videos is not as fun as her best live performances.  This has a few good moments.
006206598X|5.0|This book may be pure fantasy, but it is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Who doesn't enjoy the idea of love lasting, even after betrayal, for so long. Anne made a mistake, but all is not lost. Captain Wentworth is every girl's dream and the scene at the concert is probably my favorite in any novel ever.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I saw this on VHS years ago but just now bought the DVD.  Incredible musicians and it is fun to see Sting younger.  A major talent with great band.
0767020308|4.0|If Mark Strong's Mr. Knightley had not been quite so fatherly, this would have been perfect. Beckinsale plays up Emma's snobbish side more than the other actresses who have tackled the part and she does it well. Mr. Elton is excellent in his role, as is Harriet.<br /><br />I simply can't imagine this Emma and this Knightley as a married couple, though. It does not seem as though these personalities could be happy together in matrimony.
B002TO1Z8Q|3.0|I wanted to experience mainly the man and his music but for some reason there are constant and distracting laser lighting effects which detract.  Too bad.  The audience liked it though
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Persuasion is my all time favorite novel, so I may be biased, but I feel like this movie hit a few good notes, but far more sour ones. Sally Hawkins plays the part she is given fairly well, although Anne's \\"rebloom\\" is not written into the script and I have no idea who directed her to look into the camera so many times. Rupert Penry Jones is dreamy enough that it is no wonder why every girl in the county falls for him, and he has a great acting moment when he watches Anne play Beethovan. Mary, the hypochondriac is pretty funny.<br /><br />However, the last ten minutes and the proposal were botched wretchedly. I'm not cannon-obsessed like some fans, but what were they thinking by having Anne run all over Bath trying to catch Cpt. Wentworth who is so fast that he can apparently fly? The proposal too, was meant to be written while Anne is saying that women love longest. It doesn't make as much sense out of context. Oh, and the kiss... that was bad. I have never seen a less romantic kiss. Her saliva is all over the place and he looks like he really, really does not want to finish the scene.<br /><br />This had so much potential, if only they hadn't rushed it. Oh well, I guess this just leaves us in anticipation of the version that really gets it right.
B00092ZL80|4.0|We saw this concert tour  when it came around and found it disappointing.  too much you try our songs and we'll try yours or all hands on the stage.  But the DVD has gotten good reviews and there are some very good moments on it and some forgettable.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|... except for Mr. Knightley, of course.<br /><br />This is, imo, the best version of Emma. Mr. Knightley is clearly in love with Emma, almost from the begining, unlike in the other versions, and I think that adds to film. Romola Garai's Emma is snobbish sometimes, yes, but she always means well, and just as in the novel, you can't help but forgive her. The length really helps too. I love all of the subplots and nuances, but those take time and they get their first film outting here. The costumes are beautiful, as is the whole design of the shoot.<br /><br />What sets this version apart from the others is the chemistry between Garai and Miller. They bicker and get on each other's nerves, but they could never not be friends. While he does council and scold her, in this version he does not act like her dad when he does it, and that makes a huge difference. Everybody wants a best friend like this.<br /><br />It's funny, romantic, and pretty, everything a Jane Austen adaptation should be.
1600242197|5.0|This book was amazing. Of all the books I have read on the Iraq/Afghanistan war and those that survived the worst of it, this is one of the most compelling books I've read. How this lone survivor made it through all of this is beyond me. It just goes to show how strong, courageous, bull-headed, proud and amazing our SEALS are. I usually have to skim through the boring pages of a book or I lose interest, but I was riveted on every word, on every action, on every description in this book. LOVED it!
B004SIP7AS|4.0|This version of Emma is much more chick-lit style than the others. Basically, it takes all of the funny parts out of the novels and leaves out the parts that are pedantic and soul-searching. It's entertaining, nothing more. Jeremey Northam is handsome and likeable. Gweneth Paltrow is less annoying than usual and Toni Collette is very amusing.<br /><br />This was my favorite version of the movie before the Romola Garai one came out.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For all the haters, I love Star Wars and it might not be the greatest cuts but we all know what happens. The picture and sound is unbelievable, I just watched all 6 movies in 1 day and it was a great time. Life is to short to complain about little things. ENJOY
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Film is good. However, the \\"HD\\" version isn't at all HD. and yes, my setup has played HD video from amazon instant video in the past (breaking bad, etc).
B0050SYS5A|1.0|After spending a couple hours testing this and trying to find a good setup, I gave up.    My original setup has the Kinect mounted over the TV, but I also tried to place it under. Tracking was wacky at best in both situations - limbs were all over the place. Once I removed the zoom, tracking was accurate again. Also tried with different lighting setups to no avail. I knew that once I got the \\"can't see the floor\\" error over and over, no matter where I placed the Kinect, it wouldn't perform well. During Dance Central gameplay test, tracking would stop working altogether at times, pausing the game during songs, which is quite annoying.    I'll bring the Zoom to a friend's house next week. If results are better, I'll probably change my review. Nonetheless, it didn't work for me. Most importantly, it didn't work as advertised.

Very dissapointed!!  Waitin for the next Kreator....Real metal!!
B003JSSPSY|2.0|There are 5 CDs in it and all 5 have the same tracking problem. We have to push pause or stop and play every 8-10 minutes. First, I thought my machine was broken, but after I tried the third VCR, the problem obviously came from the CDs.

0684824906|5.0|A well woven historical tapestry of the luminous `threads' making the magnificence of Abraham Lincoln's loves, life and gift to not only our United States - but to our world.  His life is an emissary of the finest character known in what is often referred to with America as `the great experiment'. Details of Lincoln's leadership set this country apart from all in world's history. Even with deep flaws of human nature - light shines in the darkness, particularly during our horrific death toll of the civil war. Lincoln's light saved this Union. Self educated attorney - the `rail splitter' of a simple modest rural heritage would glow with magnanimous mercy. Taking and making his political rivals/enemies as his cabinet illuminates `love your enemy' like no one I can think of in history. Lincoln also recognized his rivals where the best brains in the nation - and gave his rivals the opportunities to serve in a critical time. Lincoln's results were many of his political rivals converted to his beloved. His rivals effectively served in the most devastating time in our country. Deep, rich culture that grew intense friendships of this time in history stays with me. Massive consistent hospitality - intimacy that was `normal' the intense love these people grew for each other. Massive details delineate historical characters. Goodness of his Secretary of State, William Seward who had ambitions early to be president, how this man grew to be his close ally and dearest friend His secretary of war Edwin Stanton - strong contrast - a man who Lincoln defended, Stanton wept profusely learning of the assassination. Salmon Chase, Treasury Secretary, who'd also wanted Lincoln's job skillfully raised needed capital financing the desperate war needs.  . Could you imagine today's opposing candidates working together . . . raising money? Lincoln's wisdom with people is his genius. I wondered if he ever slept when in office. One modest detail I liked, on a personal note - he kept his desk in similar disarray as my own desk is in . . . but still delivered results.  He's life also taught a lot of the methods, the processes used in his leadership skills, his understanding of people.<br />For me as a Christian I was modestly sensitive to the diminution of Lincoln's faith in the book's early set up. Repetitively Abraham had some activity done upon his return from church. Facts of his actions, then on line research on Lincoln and the Bible - this quote \\"In regard to this Great book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Savior gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|With factory defaults I was getting dangerous temperature while running Prime95 Blend test. Cores would get to 85 celcius, 90 sometimes even! This fan dropped the temperatures drastically to 60C TOPS. Very satisfied.  The only bad thing is that you gotta remove your motherboard to install the back plate. Other than that it's pretty easy and it's a very sturdy fan piece too!   Definitely recommend it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|One of the most beautiful, heart-warming, and moving stories that I have ever seen!  This made me cry so hard that I have a headache!! The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more touching!  It's very sad and heart-breaking and it's almost guaranteed that anyone not made of stone will cry in this movie.  There are some animal movies that are sad and make you leave upset and thinking what the point of sitting through that was.  However, this is not the case in this movie.  Although it is tragic, it touches your heart and it really shows you the power of love and loyalty.  It's a story of transcending love that will move your soul.  Also, it will make you want an Akita dog!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Such a great movie. It was done well and cast very well. They couldn't have picked a better person to play Thor. It's also the perfect super hero movie for kids. Even though there's violence (which honestly you can see in a G movie), there are no inappropriate scenes in the movie. It's a good wholesome film and has a great premise. I have a new respect for Thor.

The actors &  setting in Thailand was great but not enough to pull it off. Very disappointing  because I was so looking forward to a great laugh again. Whoever hasn't seen it, my advice is  leave it & keep watching #1. (Note I do not see the Blue Ray copy)
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I watched this film, and on my way home from the movie theatre I stopped at the CD store to order this disk.    It's a very strange mix of songs, most of which I love, some of which I utterly loath (Woo Hoo), but the presence of the awesome songs makes this one of my favourite CDs.    It also has a bunch of short sound effect clips on the end, if you're into that kind of thing!

B003H6KRIE|4.0|I will not delve into the story lines for these movies.  Look them up in IMdB if you like.  I will however dwell on the blu-rays in this package.  The picture quality in these 3 movies is irregular.  Maybe that was intentional on the part of the film makers but the levels of detail and the color palettes for indoor vs outdoor shots is quite different.  The choices seem to be changing here and there within a movie, and also from one movie to the other. The audio on the other hand is quite punchy in all three disks.  The one drawback in this collection (thus only 4 stars) is that the \\"extras\\" (deleted scenes, alternate beginnings and endings, etc) are presented in standard definition and they are pretty poor.  That sort of quality might be ok for a DVD set, but I do not consider it acceptable for a blu-ray set.
B0055S348W|4.0|Got this app free as the \\"free app of the day\\" on Amazon. Downloaded on my Android tablet, My Ipod Touch and my Laptop. Connected Canon Pixma M250 to laptop and added it via printershare website. Tried printing from Android first..Had my fingers crossed that it would work..Android connected to printed remotely with no probem. Printed contacts in about one minute. Next printed a picture from my Ipod touch. Took less than a minute. Wow! What a deal! I did take one star for the quality of the prints. Could be better.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Can't really add anything new here, except another 1 star rating for Lucas's disrespectful brand of insanity. Hey Lucas, just because you are nuts doesn't mean you have to be a jerk too.    C'mon people, let's click 'not helpful' on all those 5 star reviews, and 'helpful on all the 1 stars, that's what I just did. Send a message.    Love my DVD originals, Lucas must have let those slip out by accident - oh wait, he still didn't release them in high quality........ Jerk.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|At first I was skeptical of what J.J. Abrams might do to the franchise, but I think what he and his writers did was terrific (I won't give away and spoilers here). Great film making.    The video quality is outstanding, very little grain and sets, costumes and FX are very detailed and colorful. The BD will take full advantage of your HDTV.     The sound is unmatched. I have a samsung 7.1 surround sound system and, the battle are load, crisp and futuristic combat like.  Accompanied by a rousing score your speakers are sure to get a workout(Remember, this movie won an oscar for sound).    The blu ray comes loaded with special features which I was generally surprised, since most studios these days just push some crap out for consumers to watch.    Great summer flick the whole family can watch, I've read that the Star Trek 2 has the same actors and production staff, if so I can't wait for it!
B003Y8YXGM|2.0|I'm a big Lennon fan including his work with The Beatles (of course) and solo work such as \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" \\"Imagine,\\" and \\"Double Fantasy\\".  Those are, of course, the bookends to his solo career coming in 1970-71 and 1980 and are also the more critically acclaimed Lennon solo albums, but I wanted to dig deeper into the middle period of his solo career, so began looking to this release, \\"Mind Games\\" and \\"Sometime in New York City\\".  Of those mid-70's releases from Lennon, the best reviews from critics and fans alike seem to be for this album, \\"Walls and Bridges\\", though all in all, many critics panned it.  And I hate to say it, but... those critics may have been right.  I tend to judge an album I purchase from many years ago on two things:  first, how many well-known songs that I already know and like does it have?  If an album has 3-4 songs I've already heard and know I like, chances are pretty good I will enjoy that album.  And second, how good are the rest of the songs that I've not yet heard?  As for the known songs, there is of course the hit \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night,\\" which is Lennon's first #1 solo single, but far from his best in my opinion.  Not a bad song, but one Lennon himself describes as a bit of silly fun and nothing more, and I tend to agree.  Not that there's anything wrong with a bit of fun, but that's generally not what I turn to Lennon for, so that song is just not much of an anchor for a great album to me.  Then there is \\"#9 Dream\\" which also seems to be a fan favorite, but not so much for me.  Again, not a bad song, but on the list of Lennon's greatest solo achievements, this one is well down there for me because the sound of it is very echoey and over-produced, with Lennon's voice buried in the production.  I had hoped that was just a feature of this particular song, where the subject matter (a dream Lennon had) might at least half-way justify the rather blurry and unclear mix of sound (was Lennon trying to project the hazinessof the dream he was writing about, perhaps?).  Sadly though, the bulk of the rest of the album is bogged down by the same production techniques and misplaced horns that only serve to bury the song Lennon has written.  Maybe this is a result of Lennon being less confident with the material and/or his singing at this \\"lost weekend\\" point of his career, but it just doesn't help the songs.  In the liner notes, this album is described as John's \\"starkest\\" work after only \\"Plastic Ono Band\\", and lyrically, that may be true as he was clearly adrift, but the lyrics are unfortunately lost in the production of this album which is anything BUT \\"stark\\".  As for the songs themselves, the one I was most looking forward to was \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\" because I had heard the `demo' version of this song from the \\"Wonsaponatime\\" cd (which is a sampler of the Lennon Anthology box set) and absolutely loved it.  It would fit right on \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" or \\"Imagine\\" which are generally considered to be Lennon's 2 best solo releases, so I fully expected the finished version here to  be an instant favorite of mine, but... not so.  Instead the song is buried in the same production as much of the rest of the album with a horn section and echoey vocals literally ruining this great song.  Hearing how great this song sounds on \\"Wonsaponatime\\" compared to the dismal finished product here makes me wish I'd saved my money and bought the \\"Anthology\\" box set instead.  \\"What You Got\\" is a decent piece of Lennon getting a little funky with a syncopated rhythm accented by horns, but despite a very powerful and impassioned delivery, I find the lyrics a bit trite and simplistic for someone of Lennon's stature (\\"You don't know what ya got, until you lose it\\".  Really? Is this already-known universal truth worth making into a song?).  \\"Steel and Glass\\" has already been mentioned in many reviews as a highlight.  Lennon himself has called it \\"son of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\"\\", and therein liesthe problem:  it's a virtual knockoff and I dare say if another artist had done \\"Steel and Glass,\\" Lennon would have a case for plagiarism.  As it stands, this passes as a highlight on \\"Walls and Bridges\\", but I can't listen to it without hearing the superior \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", so... this just doesn't do it for me either.  But, it's not all bad news:  semi-bright spots include \\"Going Down On Love\\" and the bluesy \\"Old Dirt Road\\"; \\"Bless You\\" and \\"Scared\\" are two of the better songs as well, but even those don't quite call out for an immediate repeat listen the way well over half the cuts did on \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\".  In summary, much as I love John Lennon, I would give this album a very tepid 2.5 stars which I'm rounding down to 2 stars to offset some of the other reviews here that I think are just too generous.  If you're after Lennon's \\"hits\\" from this album, I would recommend the \\"Legend\\" compilation first because it contains both \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" and \\"#9 Dream\\" plus non-album singles like \\"Instant Karma!\\", \\"Cold Turkey,\\" \\"Give Peace A Chance\\" and the Christmas favorite \\"Happy XMAS (War Is Over)\\" plus other outstanding cuts from Lennon's solo years that make that CD a much better listen than \\"Walls and Bridges\\".  If you have the Lennon \\"hits\\" but want more, be sure you have \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Double Fantasy\\" before this one as those are all superior albums compared to this one.  This album isn't horrible, but it's darn close to being designated \\"For completists only\\".

B001E45XT4|4.0|The product arrived early than the delivery date which is an okay.  The comfort of the headset is actually tight against the head but I guess its for sound quality of the headset.  The ear muffs are cotton fabric same with the headband, perfect for people who have issues with fake leather or polyester. Like I said before about it being tight against the head, but over time the headset itself will stretch out.  The headset itself I can't wear for no longer than 30 minutes because of the pressure of the headset squeezing my head...lol  Other than that its pretty well made.....
0887307280|3.0|Gerber presents an easy to digest presentation directed toward all the \\"Technicians\\" who want to stop working for others and start their own businesses.  Because all the points are introduced in the context of a flailing new business owner trying to save her business before it's too late, a structure for relating to them is created.  Unfortunately, the simplicity of the presentation does not permit any depth for point development.  Nonetheless, the idea of putting everything a new business needs to consider into a turn-key, franchise-like approach is a very useful way to see ways to make a small business successful.
B0053F042G|4.0|This movie is a blast! Groundhog's Day? Avatar? Hey, everything comes from somewhere! Bottom line: This movie hooks you in and never lets go. Great fun, whether or not it's a great film. Gyllenhaal is right on the money. As the blurb reads: Source Code, a smart, fast-paced action thriller that challenges our assumptions about time and space. I couldn't have said it better!

B0051GOB26|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The version I had was on DVD and it looked like crap on my Samsung LED TV.

The downloaded version looks great on my iPad.

B0055S348W|3.0|If you really need to be able to print directly from your android device this may be worthwhile, but $12.95 is pretty steep. After all, is it really that difficult to transfer or email a file to a computer for printing?    It also has some shortcomings. While it can print Microsoft Office documents, it doesn't know how to handle smart-quotes and other \\"smart\\" non-standard characters.  That to me is a major shortcoming for an app this expensive.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I mean seriously, guys.  There are some extremely minor changes to the original films, which suffered significantly from a lack of modern technology but resulted in a great deal of charm.  It's still wholly Star Wars, presented in the finest quality available on home entertainment systems.    The prequels aren't great, but they're really not as terrible as I remembered them after seeing Revenge of the Sith years ago.  The real problem is the poor writing.  They sound as though someone started in a foreign language, pasted that into Google Translate, and turned that in as a shooting script.  The story is still great, and the often-underrated actors do what they can with bad material.    It all looks and sounds fantastic, and is a wonderful way to waste a weekend.    I mean seriously.  It's Star Wars.  On Blu Ray.  What is there to complain about?

B005LZSOFW|3.0|These remixes, of quite possibly my favorite Lady Gaga song off her newest album, are only so-so.  I'm a huge fan of remixed versions of my favorite songs/artists, but these remixes of Lady Gaga's \\"You and I\\" don't quite do the original song any justice.  I'm certainly glad to have them, but to be honest, the best parts of these remixes can be heard in Amazon's 15 second mp3 samples.  For the diehard Gaga fan, this compilation will obviously be a must have, but for the casual listener, stick with the original version of \\"You and I\\" off Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\" album.  The original is a true masterpiece.  I truly wish that I could rate this remixed singles release much higher then 3-stars, but I just can't.  Sometimes, perfection just can't be perfected upon any further.  I'm afraid that's the case with this newest release from Ms. Gaga.
0061122416|1.0|My review goes against the grain,but here it is...DO NOT BUY this book. If you went by all the hyperbole about this story changing lives,then that's humbug. No such thing happened to me. It's in fact an insipid fairy tale written in terrible prose,that is simply really bad literature. That would have been forgivable if the story had had some substance,but it doesn't. Sure,many people you know would recommend this book,so go ahead and read it by all means,but don't waste your money by buying it. Read it from somewhere else before you buy. This book isn't even suitable for children as a bed-time story. How it became an international bestseller is beyond me.
B000002UTY|5.0|Perhaps I've reviewed this album already. If so, it was quite some time ago. I thought it great \\"then\\", and its always interesting to see how you feel about something entirely subjective (i.e., \\"art\\") as the years pass.    If anything, this album, esp. the live version of \\"Who Do You Love\\", sounds better with age. I know that John C. supposedly had a \\"weak\\" left hand (\\"relatively weak\\" is probably more accurate!), and I also know he was burnt by the late 1970's. For example, I heard the stories about his work with a Welsh band that revered him (\\"Man\\"?) having to be re-cut. I also had a professor in a 1980 college seminar who was a fan & saw him while on vacation to S.F. in 1978 or 1979. Thus, I know the rumors were true. Too much in the way of drugs, alcohol, even tobacco, took too a big toll.     But, you know, we'll always have this album. There were so many reasons QMS never made it into the Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, etc., cosmos. Signed maybe a year too late, in 1968 rather than 1967, they had an automatic head start on a decline (as can be easily perceived on vinyl). Dino Valenti was only half as talented as he thought, the inevitable instability, etc., etc. If only the QMS that received 10-12 seconds in the Monterey movie had a record out at that time! I remember when Mama Cass lauds (justifiably!) Mike Bloomfield's playing. Bloomfield was an amazing guitarist, better than Cipp. But in addition to Mike B's heroin addiction, he was plagued by the same problem as QMS: lack of decent material. But at least QMS during their first 3 to 5 albums produced enough for 1/2 of ONE good album. Ever try listening to an Electric Flag album or CD? Yikes! Bloomfield never even had half an album's worth of material. But, I digress.    QMS will always be a band music fans \\"discover\\", and thank G-d for that. The live work & Cipp's guitar as preserved on \\"Happy Trails\\" still sounds better than ANY, ANY, ANY (incl. the Grateful Dead) tracks preserved from the 1967-1968 S.F. era. I have played \\"Who Do You Love\\" for innumerable persons of all musical tastes in the past 24 years, and there has never been a time people did not comment on the superlative nature of John's playing. And that extends from a roommate I had during my Sr. year in college who thought no one could ever play better than Lindsay Buckingham (good guitarist, but the roommate, like most fans during Mac's 2nd brush with fame, had never heard of Peter Green. Or Jeremy Spencer), through Robert Fripp worshipers, Ritchie Blackmore mavens, Folk-Rock fans smart enough to favor Richard Thompson, fans of Slash or the guys with Metallica & Megadeth, Yngwie M., Kurt Cobain, Frusciante, etc., etc., coming full circle with my teenage son's love of Syd Barrett. Does not matter if Beck, Clapton & Page were the names which fell off \\"my\\" captured listeners' lips, every single person I have ever been around who listens to John C. on the live stuff from \\"Happy Trails\\", even the folks who disliked me, commented, \\"Hey. This guy can play! He's great\\". Well, yes he was, once upon a time. And thanks to this album people will always know that in 1967-1968 Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen, and even Carlos Santana were to Cipp. what, e.g., Steve Stills was to ... Jimi Hendrix.    If I'm still around in 5 to 7 years, I'll have to take a stab at another \\"re-assessment\\".

You want only the pretty endings and the fancy story lines that make them seem so fake.

District 1, go back to the books with the pretty happy HEAs, & leave District 12 alone to appreciate a well written realistic characterised book!

1416550534|5.0|I really did like this book. To me it was not a fast read.  The relationships in the book were a bit convoluted due to the the style of writing going from the present to the past and gradually telling the story.  This took some attention with keeping the characters and situations straight.  Eventually the story did unfold.  Towards the end you could tell in which direction the story was going but there was still a surprise at the very end.  The only thing I would have like more of is more explanation of what happened with Grace between 1924 and the present.  You know she had an unsuccessful marriage and daughter and grandson as well as a getting into archaeology.  I would have like to know just a little more, however, the mystery of the the house at Riverton was good and kept my attention.  I look forward to reading the other books by Kate Morton.

B0058S0OMS|4.0|Let me start off by stating that I'm going to discuss the movie itself, this new Blu-ray release and the recent Universal controversy.<br /><br />This isn't the best movie made, not even the best sequel but by far the best Halloween sequel next to H20. The story picks up right where the original left off. We're introduced to the very understaffed Haddonfield Memorial Hospital as Laurie makes her stay to be stitched up and to recuperate from her wounds that night. Meanwhile Michael stalks the streets of Haddonfield, his childhood hometown, on his search for Laurie. The always faithful Dr. Loomis is on the prowl for Michael once more trying to stop his patient from hell and facing the subsequent guilt of \\"letting him out\\" again to wreak more havoc. That's all I can say as to not give the movie away and to spoil it for you newcomers (but really, it's been out 30 years, maybe you shouldn't be reading the reviews if you haven't seen it yet).<br /><br />The movie ups the ante on gore and nudity to compete with the other early 80s grand-daddy era of slasher films. But this movie does it with a bit more class. There's only one scene in particular that's necessarily disturbing. I'll just say it's \\"scalding\\". The characters are more or less fleshed out, or as fleshed out as they can be in the slasher genre and that's due in large part to John Carpenter and Debra Hill writing the film. I wouldn't say it's the best character development but it could be much worse. Hindsight is 20/20 afterall.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is great. It's an upgrade from DVD by far. A lot of people seem to take issue with the white specks but I think it's not over-bearing and it's not that noticable in my opinion. I'm glad that DNR wasn't involved. I've come to appreciate film grain. The original Halloween looks fantastic on Blu-ray and this film doesn't look bad at all. To be honest I wasn't expecting Universal to put any care into it at all especially since it's a catalog title. The extras are nice, sure the deleted scenes and alternate ending is in full screen and they're not in HD but they look as close to HD as you're going to get. They didn't include all of the deleted scenes from the tv cut but I think they included the best scenes in my opinion. Terror In The Aisles, that alone sold me. I knew I had to pick this Blu-ray up. It could've just included this and no deleted scenes at all and I'd be happy. It looks great as well. And yes it's the full theatrical movie hosted by Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen. My only gripe about the release is the cover. I prefer the original art. But that's a very meager and minor complaint on my end.<br /><br />Now to the Universal controversy...I don't know what to say. Was it wrong of Universal to take Moustapha Akkad's credit away? Yeah, I'm sure they have their reasons (albeit probably moronic or lame) but I don't think an exchange with the corrected \\"Moustapha Akkad Presents\\" instead of \\"Universal Presents\\" title card is going to prompt many fans to exchange their copies for the corrected one. Unless Universal includes more deleted scenes or adds a documentary or commentary (doubtful) I don't think many fans are going to care that much with the exception of the hardcore fans that are anal about it. It's not enough to make my blood boil but I understand the frustration. We all want credit where it's due. And it's nice to see that Universal has acknowledged their mistake (as if they didn't know). Either Universal is very smart or very stupid. Because they know a good number of fans would just buy the corrected version and keep the \\"mistake\\" too for completist reasons and make even more money or they just don't care which would make them stupid.<br /><br />All in all I'm happy. I've waited all year for this release and with my luck as usual it didn't go off without a hitch but I'm grateful for what I've got. This release exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Edit, as of today June 4th 2012 I've since sent my disc in for thereplacement Blu-ray back in February.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|In this second installment of her \\"50 Shades\\" trilogy, James has managed to not only entertain, but to make the reader so emotionally invested in her characters that we are left desperately longing to know \\"what happens next?\\" Her characters have such depth that it is at times difficult to remember that they are, in fact, characters, and not old friends to be guarded and cherished.  Very nice work, but not for the faint of heart.  It IS, after all, erotica!

B0050SYS5A|4.0|I have to say, at first, I was totally pissed/bummed with this at first, but after fiddling with it, it does work pretty damn well. Curious to hear what other DC players had to say about it.<br /><br />Some points I must mention about it:<br />-We always had our kinect up on the wall with the wall mount because we live in a ridiculously tiny apartment. And even with it way high up on the wall to give us more space clearance, to properly be able to play DC without banging your heels off the back of the couch, we had to move out couch into the other (TINY) room (KITCHEN XD). When we first snapped the zoom on the kinect and left the kinect on it's wall mount, it did not work well. It was picking up the ceiling, and the cursor would jump around. Cue me being really angry with the what I thought was, a $25 piece of useless plastic.<br />- We removed the kinect from the wall and placed it UNDER the TV on our entertainment center with the kinect zoom attached. It worked much better. * My husband is able to place games like The Gunslinger without moving the couch, and the game still plays well. Me, on the other hand, with DC, still have to move the couch. HOWEVER. It picks up the moves much better than when it was on the wall. Which, by the way, we would never in our dreams be able to put the kinect below the TV and have it pick anything up before the kinect zoom. Ridiculously small apartment.<br />-The 3rd and final test, I heard that the zoom worked best on top of the TV. Not on a wall mount, but attached the the top of your TV. I carefully (and probably stupidly) balanced the kinect on top of our television (don't worry it was steady XD), and played DC. Still had to move the couch, but the game played FLAWLESSLY. So it didn't exactly stop us from having to move the couch to play DC, but I can't say I mind all that much. It picks up the movements better, allows me to score more flawless moves, I'm pretty happy with it.  So if you want to put it on top of the TV where it works best, get a TV mount.<br /><br />It has REEEEEALLY mixed reviews on here. It's odd 50% absolutely are in love with it and the other 50% are saying it's garbage.  The people having problems, I suggest you rethink your sensor placement.<br /><br />In conclusion: For me, it worked pretty awesome with below the TV placement and even more with on top of the TV placement. Wall mount placement absolute GARBAGE.<br /><br />(*Keep in mind I had to re-tune the kinect with each moving of it.)<br /><br />Just thought I'd share this info with my fellow DC players. ;)mount.

B005CM9DX6|3.0|The accusations will come flying in a moment so let me just say this: Yes, I am a fan of the trademark dark/light Opeth dynamic. But, no, that did not tamper at all with my ability to appreciate \\"something different.\\" In fact, when I heard Opeth were going to change gears with this new record I was ecstatic.  Then, I heard it. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. After listening to it a lot more, I am beginning to enjoy it. But it still could be a much better record than it is.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Heritage\\" is not it being \\"different\\". Different is fine. Aimless, however, is not. This album, unfortunately, sees the band switching things up at the expense of good songwriting. After giving the album three spins, I still don't know what its trying to accomplish and, perhaps most importantly, what kind of emotional reaction it's trying to draw out of me. Instead, the whole thing is just really weird and experimental and dense kinda like Steven Wilson's Insurgents, only on that album the songs managed to weird you out while still drawing some kind of emotive response out of you. This album, sadly, is just weird and completely lacking in any life and humanness.<br /><br />Sorry, but this album is a bit of a \\"miss\\" for Opeth. There are cool moments here and there, but overall there's a lot of meandering around toward no recognizable end. The album is less than an hour long but boy does it feel longer. Exploring new ground shouldn't have to come at the expense of writing good songs, but unfortunately that's what happened here. This album could have used two or three \\"standard\\" Opeth songs sprinked throughout it. It would have been much stronger. Instead, Opeth fails to really play to their strengths with this one, even if some of it is very good.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Star Wars : The Complete Saga, should be the name of a documentary leading up to now, not another box set of woe.  Or is it, \\"Woh!WTF?\\" Since that is the reaction many of us fans or just people who grew up with the films around are saying at this release.  Star Wars was one of the best films of it's time and created a legacy that is legendary in film. It's biggest enemy has been it's own creator, George Lucas. He has gone out of his way time and time again, \\"improving\\" as he calls it, what was already perfect exactly the way it was. As with any artist who keeps working on a finished work, he has only managed to tarnish and eventually sour the fantastic universe and heroes within it, with his \\"Improvements.\\"  Hey George, when you altered return of the Jedi, you really should have thought about it a little more. You added dialogue for Darth Vader, but it was the fans who screamed \\"No, NOOOOOOO!\\"

B005HG4C4C|5.0|I listen this band more than 15 years now. I think this album will hit the bell like Images and Words and Scenes from a Memory did. I don't know why the band was trying to sound harder harder after metropolis part 2 album. After Mike Portnoy's decision this album sounds much mature. Petrucci sounds warmer and much more relieved. I really appreciate the effort of Mike Mangini. But I can't fell his creativity in drumming, he is more like \\"feeling the space or completing the incomplete\\". But overall I think they become a better team now and sound better. And thank yo for all DT members to come up with this amazing album.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Is it any surprise that Tony Bennett presides over this collection of songs like a loving parent, nurturing each of them to ensure beauty results? No, of course not.<br /><br />Indelibly present and in fine, oaken voice, his turn of phrase is expressive as ever. In fact, Bennett's warmth and charisma are still so strong they sometimes obscure the presence of his duet partners who simply do not have hearts as big as his to offer listeners.<br /><br />\\"Duets II\\" is much like the initial 2006 duets collection in that it is a glossy, sugary-sweet excursion into smoothed-over pop vocal performances with Mr. Bennett's skills guiding the way, singing life into all the nooks and crannies whether or not he and his given duet partner are a suitable pairing. His personality and status as America's foremost singer of songs must guide the way.<br /><br />Of note is his work with the late Amy Winehouse on \\"Body and Soul,\\" a heartbreaking, apt tune for the chanteuse's final recording. Both are in their element, and the result is fraught with unrequited longing and slow-burning desperation. It is a fortunate teaming of two great talents bathed in instant pathos in its reminder of how fleeting art, like life, can be. Winehouse's voice was a fine instrument indeed, and \\"Body and Soul\\" showcases it.<br /><br />Duet partners who earn their keep on this collection include k.d. lang, Willie Nelson, Norah Jones, Natalie Cole, Andrea Bocelli, Faith Hill, Lady Gaga, Queen Latifah, Josh Groban and Alejandro Sanz, whose passion fills the timeless \\"Yesterday I Heard the Rain.\\"<br /><br />Hill, in particular, sounds so enchanting alongside Bennett on \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" that a full album collaboration between the pair would be a welcome prospect. \\"Speak Low\\" with Ms. Jones is absolute perfection - a simmering, wistful track that remains a Bennett concert staple and is ideally suited to Ms. Jones' brand of hush-hush, late-night intimacy.<br /><br />lang and Bennett duet on the evergreen, lovely \\"Blue Velvet\\" with exactness and care - apt considering their longstanding friendship - while Lady Gaga oozes energy and pep on the sprightly \\"The Lady is a Tramp,\\" a three-minute slice of giddy fun which underscores her theatrical personality as well as her bold, caffeinated vocal ability. Bennett is clearly delighted to be recording with her, and their chemistry is refreshing. Clever, praiseworthy choices of material help Groban and Latifah sound just as welcome with Bennett at their side.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\\" with Aretha Franklin is a squandered opportunity. Sung with profoundly moving emotional transparency by Bennett, both on record and in concert, it is not suited for Franklin's melismatic turn of phrase in which the lyrics often take a back seat to drama and flourish.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sheryl Crow is unengaging on \\"The Girl I Love,\\" just as she was singing Cole Porter in \\"De-Lovely\\" back in 2004 - her voice is much more suited to her own contemporary material. John Mayer has little presence next to Bennett on their selection, and Michael Buble sings on \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" with his trademark bland, self-interested swagger that runs a very thin emotional gamut. The upside is that it underscores the value of Bennett's versatility and self-effacing nature.<br /><br />Charles DeForest's \\"When Do the Bells Ring for Me,\\" one of Bennett's finest recordings, is presented here as a spellbinding duet with Mariah Carey that ends the disc strongly. The pair should have recorded long ago. Although the song itself is not in Carey's key, both vocalists accommodate one another graciously, and magic results.<br /><br />\\"Duets II\\" certainly has the feeling of \\"product\\" - after all, Sony has invested great time and money into it, with only the highest promotional blitz and many of today's biggest, sparkliest stars alongside Bennett. Despite this it still has the warmth and feel of a genuine Bennett album due to hislove, obviously still in the highest abundance, for the best songs ever written.<br /><br />Certain retailers carry exclusive versions with bonus tracks, so do your homework.en.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|If you enjoyed Drama but thought the band betrayed Jon and Rick, then here's your chance to feel that hostility all over again.  While the music is decent and even a bit catchy after a few times listening, I had a tough time supporting one of my favorite bands after this dastardly release. On the plus side, if you're a bit tired of hearing Jon sing about angels, heaven, love and hearts, then you can take some solace in the lyrical improvement.  Benoit David's a great Jon impersonator, but while Jon's voice isn't what it used to be, I can only hope that the rest of the band will come to their senses and bring him back.  Perhaps they could take the novel approach of having two lead singers; Benoit would make a great accompaniment if Jon's ego could take the hit.
0143039431|5.0|Some politicians and economists tell us the 'recession' is over, but it sure doesn't look like it to most Americans.  In fact, when you see friends and others out of work or losing their homes it looks a LOT more like a 'Depression'.  A recent article in the LA Times pointed out that what we *don't* yet see coming out of the hard times this time around is great art - it seems the movie makers and musicians are too far removed from the plight of normal Americans to see what's going on.  I guess we can always revisit some of the art to come out of that *other* Depression back in the 1930s, like Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />The book centers around the Joad family from Oklahoma.  Having lost their farm to the bank they decide to move to California after seeing fliers advertising high pay for farm workers, and hit the road in an old truck converted to haul all their worldly belongings.  On the road, however, they notice a lot of others in similar circumstances are also heading to California with similarly high hopes.  And when they arrive they find a vast oversupply of labor has driven down wages to levels making it impossible to support a family.  Even worse, however, they arrive to find that nearly all the land is owned by huge corporate farmers who are colluding to exploit workers and keep wages low, and using law enforcement officials to prevent unions from forming.<br /><br />In spite of the optimism the Joad family has for making a better life in California, this is not a happy story and was not meant to be such.  Steinbeck famously wrote \\"I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this,\\" and there's a lot of that same sentiment today.  While the migrant worker aspect of the story might remind readers more of the Mexican workers of today along with its attendant racism (\\"Okies\\" were as reviled as \\"illegal immigrants\\" are now), the fear of losing one's home and not being able to provide for a family will resonate with most everyone.  And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families.  The Joads find themselves disintegrating even while on the road, and they learn that they must rely on their larger community more and more.  Assistance by the federal government is an oasis from the persecution by the harassment of the California deputies, but isn't enough for them to become self-reliant again.<br /><br />The style of the writing is fairly raw in its portrayal of the poor.  The Joads are people of the land and their language is coarse and talk of sex is frequent.  Nonetheless, they come across as honest and deserving of respect and sympathy.  Interspersed throughout the narrative are chapters that leave the Joads to show the larger view of the situation.  And while I found some of these diversions annoying, the overall story is so powerful it makes the reader angry at the situation.  Also, it took me about 150 pages before I really got into the story.  It's not what you'd call a \\"pleasurable\\" read, but it's compelling for the gravity of the story and you can't help but feel hopeful for the family to get a break.  And it's probably a story that should be read again in these difficult economic times.And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families.

B00068NVI4|5.0|I've been a Yes fan for over 20 years, and have often lamented the fact that I rarely got to see them in their prime (except for the Masterworks tour).  However, thanks to the Yes gods for answering the call of us latecomers and creating/releasing a truly amazing show.  The material is great, the talent shines, and there are some of those moments that just bring tears to your eyes.  The interview with Roger Dean is a nice foray into the thought behind the iconic images that we associate with the band, and it's great fun to see Jon and the rest rockin' out and having a fantastic time.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I've had this watch for about 1 year .This watch is simple, stylish, and durable.     I wear it on the weekdays while in the office and on the weekends just hanging out in shorts/t-shirt. I wear it regularly on my bicycle rides which top 100 miles in a week.    This watch is extremely comfortable with it's breathable nylon strap. The strap is durable and I haven't seen any wear in the strap. I    The watch itself looks small but it does not feel cheap. It's quite heavy for its size and it's heft feels good on the wrist.    My only complaint about this watch, is the minute numbering on the outside of the dial and hour numbering on the inside ring of the dial. It looks pretty sharp, looks like a chronograph watch, but it's difficult to read since I think most people are used to having the hour numbering on the outside of the dial.

1933952806|5.0|I recently purchased my Nikon D7000 from Amazon (a significant step up from my D40)and I was bewildered.  I subsequently purchased several D7000 \\"how-to\\" books and they helped - somewhat.  The operation of the auto-focus system was very confusing and I had problems with the many buttons/menus.  What do I do with all that capability?  Then along came Darrell Young's book.  Bingo!  While I will continue to learn - Darrell's book has uniquely helped me put it all together and I am now determined to master the D7000.  I now realize that I purchased a capable, state-of-the-art camera - and, when coupled with Darrell's book - well a beginner to DSLR photography need not be frightened.  I could go into several details - but others here have covered many of them very well.  I might add:  I was so impressed with Darrell's book - I just joined Nikonians!  Way to go Darrell...........
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I must note that I'm not an avid musical/broadway fan, but this film has changed my mind on the genre for the better. It definitely does help that it stars Tim Curry, who I admire for his extensive repertoire with acting and voice acting (in videogames no less!!). Anyways, for the movie itself, I believe that a MAJOR factor into liking a musical is if the music is in your taste and the actors can actually sing, and Rocky Horror delivers. And this being he Blu-Ray rendition, it only improves on the audio quality, the intro song just sounded awesome as is the rest of the film.     The extras are definitely worth checking into, including bloopers and other bits that help immerse one into the cult that is rocky horror.     IN SHORT: if you've owned other copies of this film, it's worth dipping in again for Blu. For those who have never liked musicals, I still say give this a shot, if you can rent it or ask a friend to borrow their copy, do it. OVERALL GREAT PURCHASE!
B005HG4C4C|3.0|I was expecting something different with DT's newest release. I've found that for about the last five releases or so that while the playing is just as technically mind-blowing as always, the song-writing more or less has descended into a more free-form and unfocused territory. I found very little on the album that stuck with me. \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" is probably the only memorable track. The rest was almost prog-metal background music. I'm very disappointed in this one.

0545123291|5.0|Because of the way Maggie left Sam and Grace at the end of Shiver, I wasn't in a rush to read Linger. Their story could have ended there and I would have been happy. I would have gotten to it eventually, I was just taking my time. Then I lent Shiver to my oldest daughter. She called me as soon as she was finished and asked if I had Linger. That was the end of my procrastination. Both Linger and Forever were ordered and here we are.<br /><br />Linger brings everything front and center as far as the characters go. We learn a lot more about each individual character including the new pack members, namely Cole. Maggie's in depth descriptions help you get lost in not only the surroundings but in the emotions that each character is feeling. One of my favorite aspects of Maggie's writing in this series is that she gives each character a voice. She shares the point of view of all the key players individually and it really adds to the character depth. She has a way of making you feel the emotions of each person, both happy and sad. Granted, there isn't a lot of happy in this book, but when it is there, you feel it.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about this book it is I wish there was at least one parent that had their act together and at least acted like they cared about their kids. There were a couple of adults that had some redeeming qualities and acted like they actually cared, but they weren't the parents of these teens. I'm not finding fault in the story, I just wished that Sam, Grace, Isabelle and Cole didn't feel like they had no one to turn to but themselves. It wouldn't have made for as dramatic a story, but it also wouldn't have made me feel like I needed to shake some sense into some of these adults. Grace's parents irritated me in Shiver, but they infuriated me in Linger. It wasn't the fact that they punished their daughter, that is a parental right and responsibility. What bothered me, and Grace, was that they acted like parents only when they really wanted to. The rest of the time Grace was on her own. One of my favorite lines in the book came from Cole and is directed to Grace's dad near the end of the book. I don't want to give anything away, but you'll know what I'm talking about as soon as you see it, trust me. If it was a scene in a movie, it would have been followed by cheering.<br /><br />Ok, enough with the soap box. As happy as I was to leave Grace and Sam at the end of Shiver, there is no possible way that I can now wait to start Forever. I'm going to have to trust Maggie to help these kids overcome all the hardship that they went through and make me as happy with their outcome as I was at the end of Shiver.he time Grace was on her own.

B002N1AERI|5.0|Epica has remained one of my favorite bands for the past seven years. Over time some bands lose crucial members, some bands lose their crucial sound. But Epica has always kept their incredible symphonic metal genius while continuing to grow. Design Your Universe shows that they haven't grown stale or too commercial. I never thought I would love a symphonic metal album about quantum physics this much!    If you haven't already heard this group, Epica is worth a listen because of their unique music. I really believe Simone Simons has one of the best voices in metal. It only gets better with time. But they are more than just Simone's voice. The incredible music, the majestic choir and the haunting lyrics make this band unforgettable.     The bombastic prelude and the eerie choir is the perfect way to start off the album. And then the amazing Resign To Surrender blasts out, showing what Epica is all about. The grunts, the choir and Simone's angelic voice blend together perfectly. This is the sort of song Epica does best but it is by no means the best of the album. It's followed by Unleashed, the first single. The lyrics were written by Simone herself. The song starts off with the choir and then is followed by Simone's clear voice. Martyr of the Free World and Our Destiny are both great songs. But this has been all leading up to the big song. Kingdom of Heaven is over thirteen minutes long. It's divided into five parts, each part vital to making the song an epic masterpiece. This is why I listen to Epica. Simone never sounds better than in this song. Even though I consider this the highlight of the album, it's only halfway through and the rest of the album is amazing. After Burn To A Cinder comes Tides of Time, a breath of fresh air. A breathtakingly beautiful ballad, like nothing else on the album. This highlights Simone's voice. White Waters is a duet between Simone and Tony Kakko. The last song, Design Your Universe starts calm and then really gets going, ending the album the epic way this band does so well.                      I honestly think Design Your Universe is the best album by Epica. Obviously the band's always been good, but the quality has increased  tenfold since their first album. When I listen to Design Your Universe, I am reminded that music can still be truly amazing.

1594488843|5.0|Sensing lack of motivation? Possible that your current job doesn't offer the autonomy, mastery and alignment to your bigger purpose. A highly recommended read for those who doesn't settle for short term fixes and are committed to find the deeper and more sustainable solution.<br /><br />In many high-tech companies, I see that all three are provided from top, but when it comes to the team level, they somehow disappear:(. My take is each individual needs to think about it, and find the closest match for themselves. End of the day You own your own career and life. Its so ingrained in American culture that sometimes hard to get when coming from another background (where autonomy is less prevalent). This book will help managers and employees to get more clarity on what they do, why they do and what else they can do to make things better.<br /><br />It is the intrinsic motivation that brought the human kind this far. While most of the people are blind folding themselves with the over used idea of \\"more money\\", Daniel Pink points and brings the elephant(why more money doesn't bring more motivation) in front of your eyes. It is such an eye opener, I will highly recommend to all my high achiever clients!

0517548232|5.0|Oftentimes, in the modern economics classroom, we see many many models. These models are so complex that oftentimes we have difficultly applying them or even understanding why they work or do not work. This results in lots and lots of people thinking that something is \\"sound economics\\" when it is really just a bunch of hot air! Just read Krugman sometime and you'll see what I mean...    That is where this book comes in. Hazlett reminds us of the basics of what economics really is; he helps you to understand the important lessons that it teaches us with respect to public policy and our personal lives.     Great book! A suggested read for anyone. I would love to see an abridged version of this that could be handed out for $1 each!
B00000269G|5.0|If I was to introduce someone to jazz, this would be the recording of choice.   I would choose the same album to someone who had never heard music before.  This is music that makes me smile more than any other.  Garner's playing and personality was infectious: happy, playful, whimsical, always melodic, rhythmically complex, never boring, upbeat at any tempo, and he essentially incorporated everything he heard (including classical themes/harmonies) into his playing.  Out of this arose a style that has been greatly emulated and admired for decades; but more important is the fact that he was someone who expressed himself in a truly authentic and original way (he played what he felt), a feat that cannot be easily duplicated, and this is what comes through in his recordings not the least of which is this unique album.

Free, very stable and highly recommended by me.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|this in my oponion was one of the best if not the best books i have ever had the pleasre to read.  and to think that it was my mom who had pressured me iinto it and i am already knee deep into the third book.not going to reveal spoilers but readers prepare yourself for a better book than even the hharry potter series. with so much action it is no suprise that they even have two video games based off the series.if you are to rea any book in your lifetime let it be this one. and dont critisize me on grammer because i am not an adult lie most others who take the time to write reviews. if i could i would give this book the largest thumbs up ever times 222222222222222222222.31154 to just begin my rant on how great this book is.

B003Y8YXGC|3.0|Aside from the title track, I love three songs on this album: Out of the Blue, I Know and You are Here.  The music, singing and melodies on those songs are beautiful and distinctly Lennon-esque.  I am happy to have any album that has four first-rate Lennon songs.  But overall, this CD is a frustrating listen.  Lennon typically wrote interesting lyrics.  Not here.  Even on the good songs, he seems to be apologizing to or worshipping his most important lady friend.  She's even on the dour cover art - her face is ominously emerging out of the ground.  In his past songs, Lennon's candid singing about his insecurities or failings was actually quite brave and seemed to reveal a certain strength and confidence by being so open and direct, even when the literal lyrical content suggested otherwise.  Here, its a bit exhausting.  I can't make it all through Aisumasen without thinking \\"come on, snap out of it man!\\"  That song, while not bad, harms the flow of the album by bringing any energy to a halt on the third song.  The other songs are ok.  Tight A$ is a lesser version of Crippled Inside - pretty good, but its too repetitive to be great - some spark is missing from the song. Speaking of repetitive, Bring the Lucie has a great hook, but it should only be 2 minutes instead of 4 as the music seems to be on a loop the whole time.  Meat City rocks - wish there'd seem a few more like that on this album - instead of just one true rocker stranded on the end.  Some of the others, like One Day (At a Time), are better in their more stripped down versions elsewhere.  I find it supremely ironic that after writing lyrics that make fun of Paul McCartney's solo music (\\"the sound you make is muzak to my ears\\"), Lennon proceeded to spend much of his too-short solo career defanging his songs' emotional impact with over-production.  That unfortunate trend appears to have started on this album.
159420229X|5.0|This is such an interesting book!    Joshua Foer is a science reporter who went to the 2005 US Memory Championship in order to write about it.  He met several memory champs who assured him that anyone could do what they do and he set off to train to compete in the memory championship himself.  This book tells about his year of memory training and the interesting people who he met as part of his research including the man who inspired the movie \\"Rainman\\" and a man who could not remember anything for longer than a minute or two.  Joshua presents his research in an easy to read and interesting way.  I learned a lot from this book. I had never before heard of chicken sexing and would not have imagined that it had any connection with being a chess master, but now I know these things. You can too if you read this book.  I was also fascinated with the way that writing and reading has evolved over the years. Joshua shares some memorization techniques that he used and that can be helpful to students who need to memorize material for school.  Unfortunately, these techniques won't help us to remember daily things like where we left the car keys or why we opened the refrigerator.    I have to return this book to the library, but I am so impressed with it that I may buy myself a copy of it to re-read and refer to and I plan to read more about memory and how it works.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This television series has forever skewed my view of TV these days. Suddenly, my other favorite shows don't seem as engaging.  The plots seem tired and the dialogue cliched.  This is what happens when you've watched Breaking Bad.  I recently did a two week marathon of the first three seasons and my only regret afterwards was that I had to endure the long agonizing wait of a new episode each week.<br /><br />Season 4 lives up to the standards of excellence set by the previous seasons. What I love is how the writers have no fear of painting themselves in a corner.  You wonder if they even know how to get their characters out of jam or are they guessing like the rest of us?  There are many \\"Holy crap!\\" moments this season and it's a joy to see how Walter and Jesse manage to keep their heads above water as the mayhem slowly pulls them under.<br /><br />Hold on...  Why are you even reading this?  Go watch the show for crying out loud.
1416955070|4.0|This is one of those situations where I'm upset that I read reviews for this book before reading it myself... Being one of the last people on the planet to actually pick up this series didn't help! Unfortunately, The City of Bones just didn't live up to the hype for me! Was it a great book? Yes, most definitely. It just moved very slow for me, whether it was the pacing of the story or my own issues, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Clare created an innovative, dangerous, and beautiful world in The City of Bones. It's a world where so much happens behind the scenes: Where demons, shadowhunters, and downworlders exist without the notice of mundanes. She must have put enormous thought into developing this expansive world! And that, I can definitely appreciate.<br /><br />I found the story and characters engaging and the ending satisfying. I do, however, hope that the relationship twist at the end is falsified in [[ASIN:1416972242 City of Ashes (Mortal Instruments)]]! Overall this was a great read and I would recommend this to any YA paranormal fans!
0385534639|5.0|I read this on my Kindle in two days because much like the characters, I found it very hard to leave the circus.  I was prepared for a slow start after reading some of the other reviews but this was not the case for me.  I loved every bit of it. I hear that the movie rights have already been picked up for this novel.  I only hope that the movie will live up to the wonderful descriptions in the book!

B000002GYR|5.0|I didn't know there was another Tom Traubert in him but lately being in a Tom Waits stuck state which at times I have to turn off at times then I heard Martha. I never heard such a beautiful sad song that made me cry and cry. I knew about ol 55 since the vh1 unplugged show and I really liked that whole show actually. His voice lately has been just either shot or it's intentional. I like to see him sing Martha like he does here. His voice after this album became to me a show like a vagrant bar piano comedian performer but still great song writer. It's not of this record he changed everything over the course of one record how can top Closing Time. Most of the album tears just flow from eyes from having a 40 year lonely heart. Im stuck being....lonely
B000UBMWG4|5.0|My earliest memories of Blade Runner go back to the Fall of 81. As a kid, I was a subscriber to Starlog Magazine. It was a popular sci-fi movie mag of the time. It featured an article on Harrison Ford's next film \\"Blade Runner\\". The article showed a few production shots of the Spinner and some of the overall aesthetic. Here I was, 12 years old, and my favorite actor was about to delve into yet another sci-fi/fantasy flick. I was thrilled!! I figured..here's Han/Indy playing a futuristic cop hunting killer androids in an environment of flying cars and neon. What more could a kid ask for???    Fast forward to June 1982...My best friend and I sneak into our first \\"R\\" rated movie together. Nearly thirteen years old...I watched the opening sequence with delight and wonder. It was an incredibly realized world. However...as the film progressed...I simply didn't get it. It felt too dark, depressing, and wrought with DIALOGUE instead of ACTION. In other words...it wasn't FUN. However, something struck a chord with me. I never could pinpoint what it was as a thirteen-year-old. It still befuddled me the following year when it made it's HBO debut, but I watched it religiously each time it aired.     Here we are now, some twenty-nine years after it's debut, and I am STILL finding new ways to view this film.     This is why Blade Runner remains, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most important films in cinematic history. The film CHALLENGES you on so many levels. On one side, it's a sci-fi thriller...on another, a deep and thought provoking look into the metaphysical dimensions of humanity. It questions what it means to be \\"human\\" and, by extension, what it means to BE. These philosophical questions are further challenged by the revelation that Rick Deckard may very well have been a Replicant as well. Granted, Ridley Scott has already stated (once and for all) that YES HE IS. However, I prefer the ambiguity and like being challenged with that notion with each viewing.     Lets face it...this is one of those rarest of films that provokes either a great LOVE for it...or a great HATRED for it. I have never known anyone that was a casual Blade Runner fan. No one says \\"Oh yeah...that was pretty good\\". I like being one of the devout fans out there.     It is, in my mind, as close to a perfect film as one could make. From the visuals, to the script, the performances, lighting...etc, it's a challenge to find any fault with it. It is paced well and doesn't dwell on excessive exposition. Not everything needs to be spelled out to the viewer and Scott does a fantastic job of letting the viewer think for themself. This is why the opening sequence is such a marvel, because it is literally carrying the viewer into that world.    As far as the Blu Ray set goes...it is worth every penny and MORE. As gorgeous as this film is...the transfer makes it nearly ethereal. I enjoy the fact that I can watch any one of five cuts of the film and will likely get something different each time. The bonus features are extensive and none of the usual \\"filler\\" features are present. It would seem that this is the DEFINITIVE release of Blade Runner. I can't imagine Warner Bros. adding anything else in future releases.
B001IF252M|5.0|if you have a mac, surely you will need this, you should keep it in your case for presentations, and if you ask me it is better than VGA port in your mac because we need this very rare.    in the other hand I am keeping additional one at meeting rooms, so anyone has a mac can use it.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I admit freely that I have always been more of a \\"DC\\" guy than a \\"Marvel\\" guy. However, I have enjoyed most of Marvel's films and the first two X films rank among the best (although Wolverine was miscast and portrayed too much as a whiner and cry baby...especially at the end of X2). This film was \\"okay\\"...but Michael Fassbender seems BORN to play Magneto. His performance alone makes this film really worth watching. He carries an almost regal quality to the character. I'm glad that most of the film seemed more focused on him as opposed to Xavier. The second Xavier used the word \\"groovy\\"...I lost interest in him.

0439813786|1.0|I bought this book because of the great reviews and the uniqueness of how it was composed.  This book is grossly overrated.  It just never took off, in my opinion.  I kept waiting for some magical moment to appear.  It didn't.  The story was very, very, weak.  For the life of me, I can't see why this book has gotten so many good reviews.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Some may have already heard the pre-released song from the album, The Devil's Orchard, and so you got a taste of what this album is like. But I wouldn't say any one song on Heritage is able to represent the whole album. And if you're expecting something like Damnation (2003), you're way off. So prepare to be surprised!     There is a logical progression from the previous album, Watershed (2008), to Heritage, but the leap is quite far. There are no death vocals on this one, only clean singing, and it suits the album perfectly. The metal sound is rarely on the heavy side (for one used to Opeth's previous albums), and there certainly isn't the kind of powerful blazing guitars and drums we're used to. Instead there's more of an exploration of sounds and melodies, which are allowed to reverberate through the whole album. The music can leap from evil, psychedelic flute sounds to spanish guitars, with an interlude from an off-tempo piano diddle. The opening of track 9: Folklore, for instance, sounds just like an old Swedish folk song, except it's played by an electric guitar. This is possibly my favourite track, but at least partly because of the beautiful way it makes the album come to a strong climax before the final instrumental song. It all works out in a magical way.     I read a pro review that claimed something like Heritage being a trial on the potency of metal, and I couldn't agree more. The album is thoroughly progressive and experimental, utilising a lot of old 60-70's hard rock influennces mixed with Opeth's classic sound and song building. No song on the album ever takes the easy way out, but progresses in unexpected ways that may at first be hard to understand. Naturally, this makes Heritage one of those albums you got to listen to several times in order to come to grips with it. The reward comes when you do.     I'd call this Opeth's strongest release since Blackwater park in 2001. And here's to 20 more years... cheers.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I love the video quality, especially EP.III...almost reference quality. Audio is awesome. This set is an excellent value @ just under $80 for six movies and three bonus discs. Sure, the OG releases are not included and the additional scenes are not necessary...HAN shot first!!! and the CGI elements in the OG trilogy look out of place with the older footage but I love Star Wars and George Lucas is still a creative genius. I would have given this FIVE stars but is it just me or does all the new bonus material discs seem to hard to navigate. With all the animated menus, it takes a long time to access each section. And where are ALL the previous DVD extras??? Where is \\"Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy\\"??? Where is that excellent documentary \\"The Beginning: Making Episode I,\\"??? I can't help but feel a bit cheated that not every documentary is included. I'm thinking that George might be \\"milking it\\" for a future Anthology release...
1400069181|5.0|I got this as a gift from my mentor and I absolutely fell in love with Blake and his story. Not only is he honest and open about his mistakes, the lessons he shares are invaluable. There is also stories of how other successful businesses start. It's a great book that I recommend to friends for inspiration on making a difference in the world!
B00284BMBM|5.0|I know, I'm behind the times, but I just ordered this disc and received it a few days ago.  I have listened to nothing else since.  I loved their first album, but this one is even better.  Great music to sing along to in the car with the windows rolled down :)
B0014WSX2K|4.0|This set was uncommonly affordable and features some of my favorite works by Coltrane. As others have mentioned the most severe drawback is the lack of session information, however the price cannot be beat and the sound quality is superb. Get this one while it lasts and then copy the first reviewers information. You'll be glad you did. He deserves a round of applause for his work. I am so pleased with this set, its an incredible testament to a great player.
B004SEUJAA|5.0|I really enjoed it - the sound effects are terrific.  You really feell like you are on the ship.  It is a great look at how much courage people had to have to go in such fragile ships accross the world.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|I will admit that I wrote this movie off when it first came to theaters thinking it was just a weird looking movie.  Many years and a whole lot of crow later, Ratatouille has turned into one of my favorite Pixar films!  Simply put it is a wonderful underdog story.  Definitely underRATed!
1588167461|4.0|I've bought several similar books lately and I must say that this book stands head and shoulders above any of them. Pleasantly written, this book offers background information and style tips that are useful to everyone, from the guy who's about to buy his first suit to the man who regularly has a bespoke suit made. Contrary to what would be expected from a fashion magazine, this concise guide gives advise about style rather than fashion. It also provides useful tips on the finer points of maintenance (an all to often overlooked topic) and storage. In short this is a book to keep right next to your wardrobe and consult whenever in doubt or in need of a few words of sartorial advise.
1567184855|2.0|I thought I would read a book about some evidence based information/incidents but it's far from that. The basis of hypnosis is imagination and the hypnotist can guide the subject and gives him direction. During the hypnosis is the mind full of imagination and can create almost everything.  This book is not about spirit world but the powerful human mind and IMAGINATION. Nothing more!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|So simply put, people are overreacting to something that isn't even their call. Star Wars is George Lucas' baby and he can do whatever he pleases with it. He can replace each persons face with Jar Jar Binks if he should wish so.      The graphics in the prequels are amazing, modern day quality.  The graphics in the original three are good but they don't stand out like the three prequels. The changes here and there are well done, whether they be big or small, they don't break the story.  The least favorite, of course, is the NOO of the Return of the Jedi but it doesn't really bother me that much, as opposed to some people here.     Overall, I enjoyed all six films again and I'm glad I bought the Blu Ray Collection!
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I love this DVD.  Justin Timberlake gives a great show.  The music, the stage, everything about it is awesome.  IWhen I saw it on cable a few years ago, I knew I had to have it.  I would have loved to have been there.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|Solid, solid disc. Definitely worth the wait. I caught Primus at All Good this summer and heard a handful of these tunes worked out live and I must say, I was very impressed. The unstoppable beats of \\"Eyes of the Squirell\\" are enough alone to orgasmify your ears, let alone the flawless \\"Last Salmon Man\\" and \\"Jilly's on Smack\\". Primus has been on this planet for over 20 years, so I expected no less from Les \\"Mastermind\\" Claypool. I am about to see them this Saturday at the new Fillmore in Silver Spring, MD and can't wait to hear some of the rest of the tunes off the album. Buy it, love it, want it...Now!

B005910E06|4.0|Pires plays with grace and style.  She is clearly comfortable with her interpretations of these sonatas. I believe that this is her first set of Mozart sonatas.  I believe that she was approximately 40 years of age.  She certainly would be in a position to give us a mature interpretation.    The sound recordings were done by Denon of Japan.  The piano is very nice.  The recording has no significant resonance.  The recording is well worth having--particularly at the very reasonable price.    Having said all the above, I cannot say that the interpretation is revelatory.  It is not so unique that you might remember it above some of the other wonderful interpretations like Kraus and Arrau.
B003HYNB34|5.0|I am trying to play catch up in regards to the \\"new Doctor\\" episodes This is the first episode I have seen starring Matt Smith. I must say I am very impressed, This Doctor has a lot of swagger. So far my favorite Doctors have been Tom Baker, David Tennant and now Matt Smith.

B0001LYH98|4.0|I have not listened to this album that much because I just got it last week, but already I love it.  The standard for Bowie music is really high, so I give this 4 instead of 5 stars.  I like the variation in the style of songs, even though it all comes together as a whole.  I found it a very emotional album.  It is engrossing.

B004VMX5TQ|5.0|This cd is a great recording; except it does what a lot of recordings do; when released on cd, it gets something omitted, or shortened.  Specifically, Let It Rock gets cut down, to make room, on the rerelease for a bonus track; which could have been for another recording, or make it two discs and release the track in full, plus the extra track.  It sucks when companies do this, or make listeners buy imports, e.g., Bursting Out by Jethro Tull.  The original cd omitted three songs.  Result? Buying an import 2 disc; which should have been in the original release to begin with.  Otherwise, has many great songs: Against The Wind; Betty Lou's Getting Out Tonight, and many more.  If people are willing to pay (and to wait [though it might be forever]) a re-rerelease that actually includes both the extra track and the full length Let It Rock, how 'bout it-eh?
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|i love this movie......the sets are fantastic & i love the fantasy feel it had.........for the type of movie it was i enjoyed the love story with a bit of suspense & horror.........and the first time i saw this movie the person who was the wolf was a surprise...i liked that.........this was my 2nd time seeing the movie & still enjoyed it :):)  i will add this movie to my collection for sure  !!!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is one heck of a blu-ray.  I have watched all six movies and feel this is by far one of the best blu-rays out there.  I read many reviews on here and I can understand many people frustration about the changes George has done to these movies.  But the way I feel is this!!  Let's take a moment and realize what is going on in the world and be very thankful that we have six wonderful movies that allow us to forget the bad in the world for a time.  These changes in my mind is what makes Star Wars so great it is like seeing a new movie each time I watch them.  I too grew up in the age of the original Star Wars and have fond memories of my father taking me to see Star Wars, Empire and Return of the Jedi but after seeing the new trilogy I was a little concerned how the original would fit in to these new upgraded versions.  That is why I feel these changes make the movies all flow very well together.  But as I said before I understand people's concerns and that's what makes Star Wars fans the best around.  But I truly recommend this collection believe me you won't be sorry.  For those fans that like the original untouched versions as I am sure you know those are available on DVD but purchase this blu-ray to add to the collection the special features alone are worth the price of 79.99 which by the way is a GREAT PRICE! Also the picture and sound might change your mind.  At the end of the day no matter what we all know Star Wars is a great movie and it will always stand the test of time.
B004OWPWEO|5.0|I haven't heard that this was ever officially released.  I purchased an Italian bootleg copy of this years ago and it is my favorite Springsteen bootleg.  If you want to own just one Bruce bootleg live CD, this is the one you should get!   Bruce should release this one!
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This movie is the equivalent to the Digimon Movie; just with a bit less action and more of a focus on story & drama/emotions. I still have an attachment to Digmon the Movie, but this has just as much re-watch value; never getting tired of the awesome dialogue & art style! I'd recommend this to anyone; especially younger children.

0142419400|5.0|Excuse me while a gush a little, okay while I gush a LOT, about this book!  J'ai absolument ador&eacute; ce livre! Now I wasn't an A+ student in French class (but I can put Google to work, and I found myself a translator) and that means: I absolutely adored this book! Everything about it from the plot, to the setting, even the characters; It was purement magnifique (purely magnificent).<br /><br />The main character, Anna, has her senior year all laid out. Job at the movie theater with her almost-boyfriend (crush that she hopes will turn into more), Toph, hanging out with her best friend Bridge, and just trying to make it through that last year of school before college. However, her dad, in his attempt to impress his many adoring fans (of his books; he's an author) ships Anna off to the City of Love for her final two semesters. Anna gets it set in her mind that she will hate every last moment of living in Paris even after she acquires a new group of quirky friends.<br /><br />Mer, the girl across the hall, is a super sweet tom boy. Rashmi nearly the opposite of Mer, has a very tough edge to her but when push comes to shove, she stands up for her friends. Josh is the artistic, funny, cute boyfriend of Rashmi and best friend of Etienne St. Claire. Etienne, the dashing, charismatic, totally swoon-worthy boy happens to be the one that has stolen Anna's heart without her even realizing it. The only issue: he has a girlfriend.<br /><br />Okay so now that you have an idea of what the book is about, let me tell you exactly why you should read Anna and the French Kiss:<br /><br />Because I said so! As intimidating as that may sound, that probably isn't enough to sway you to read it so listen up. This wonderfully written book is just prefect.<br /><br />The setting; Paris, the City of Love, is basically the best place to have a Y.A. romance take place. Paris, a place I have never been to, became a near reality through Stephanie's writing. I felt like I was right there along with Anna as she took in magnificent sites such as the Eifel Tower, Pointe Zero, and the Notre-Dame.<br /><br />The characters, Anna and St. Claire, along with all their friends were wonderful. Anna is a perfect little mix of every teenage girl out there. She has cute little quirks like collecting bananas, she is funny, sometimes shy, lacks confidence in certain things, has great determination to achieve her dream job, and even makes a few mistakes along the way. Honestly, you could find at least one similarity between yourself and Anna. Etienne St. Claire is a boy that I want to appear in real life, right now! He sounds adorable, he is so dang sweet, and I am pretty sure that accent of his would make my heart beat a little faster. Mer, Rashmi, and Josh are all great supporting characters that add something unique to the table. A+ to Stephanie's realistic, quirky, well-written characters.<br /><br />Oh la la, the romance! The chemistry between Anna and St. Claire was tangible from the first moment they met. Etienne has his girlfriend and Anna has her almost-boyfriend but the two can't seem to stay away from each other. When you have friendship with that much romantic tension, something is bound to happen. My favorite part about their relationship was that it was perfectly, imperfect. They fought, they got too close, they became too distant, they had their normal ups and downs, but no matter what, they were always there for each other.

0545140323|5.0|The Lonely Hearts Club. I absolutely love everything about this book. There truly is not one negative comment I can make about it. It is sweet, funny, cute, adorable, awesome, really the list goes on and on. I have seen this book floating around the book store for quite some time now but for some reason never picked it up. During our last shopping trip, my best friend Kati actually picked it up. Just a few days later, she was blowing up my phone and twitter with messages about how she just adored this book. She said, and I quote, \\"I seriously can't get enough of this book girl! You'll love it; the main girl is just like you, and her best friend is my twin. Pretty much, these girls are so frigging funny.\\" After that, I quickly borrowed the book from Kati and blasted through it. We then came to the (highly unlikely) conclusion that Miss Elizabeth Eulberg stalked us for a good part of our lives. The main character Penny and her best friend Tracy are just like Kati and I. Well if Kati and I actually had dumb boys to break our hearts in the first place and then started a completely awesome club of girls who are giving up boys, then Penny and Tracy would seriously be our twins. (Ok, if this has been enough nonsense for you, I will now start with my review part of the book!)<br /><br />The main character of this book, Penny, is sick of boys breaking hearts. Not just her heart, but the hearts of all her friends. She is so sick of it she decides to form The Lonely Hearts Club. At first, this is just a one-woman show, but quickly more and more girls start opting for the single life. Penny struggles to control her ever-growing group but she soon realizes she has created a great support system for the girls at her school. This whole giving-up-boys thing would be a lot easier if one in particular would stop acting so nice, funny, cute, and perfect all the time...<br /><br />So here is what I loved about this book, aside from the fact that it was written about me & Kati:<br /><br />1)  Beatles. Beatles. Beatles. So if you didn't catch the obviousness, I loved the references to the musical phenomenon known as The Beatles. First the cover, Love it. I know authors very rarely have any control over it, but whoever designed it did a great job with making it very Beatles-ish. Second, the main character's name. Penny Lane, after a Beatles song. So unique, quirky, and cute! Third, The name of the club. The Lonely Hearts Club, named after Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album of The Beatles. Fourth, breaks in the book. They were marked off with song titles and a line of lyrics from that particular song. Last but not least, the random mentions of The Beatles throughout the whole book. If you are going to incorporate something as spectacular as The Beatles in a book, you have to go big or go home. Elizabeth did a great job of including Beatle-ish things throughout the whole book.<br /><br />2)  Girl Power! That is right, these girls may just be mere mortals but they are super heroes in my eyes. I wish I could have had the guts to do what Penny and her friends did in high school. Regardless of complaints of the male population and threats from the principal, Penny and fellow members of The Lonely Hearts Club march ahead without hesitation. They all believe 100% in what they are doing and they aren't letting anyone tell them differently.<br /><br />3)  For the love of all that is holy. I love romance just as much as the next teen girl, but you very rarely see the main character having a romance with herself. Now before you take that the wrong way and get all embarrassed, let me explain. Whatever happened to loving yourself before loving others? Elizabeth did teen girls a huge favor by writing this novel! Sure Penny starts the club after a huge heartbreak, but she just wants to take the time to make herself happy. I love that Penny fell in love with herself FIRST then went and found romance with a boy AFTER.<br /><br />4)  Friends are forever.The friendships in this novel are so believable! (Well of course they would be, Elizabeth stalked Kati and I, remember?) In all honesty, the friendship between Penny and Tracy was superb. They fight, get irritated, push certain buttons, and are so loyal to one another. After the club becomes hugely popular, the relationship between all its members is fantastic. At first Tracy can't stand a super popular cheerleader named Diane. After finding some common ground (common ground being they are both Penny's friend and boys are dumb) they eventually have a great friendship. To add to the \\"friends are forever\\" part, I loved that this was the perfect novel for me to read with my best friend. Even if our personalities were complete opposite of Penny and Tracy, I have a feeling we would still love to read this book together!<br /><br />If you are looking for a book full of GIRL POWER then The Lonely Hearts Club is for you. It is a super cute and sweet novel of a group of girls sick of heartache. This book will have you laughing and crying tears of joy the whole way through! I strongly recommend it to anyone.e so believable! (Well of course they would be, Elizabeth stalked Kati and I, remember?) In all honesty, the friendship between Penny and Tracy was superb.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|Paramount has soared to new heights of \\"vulture-ness,\\" patiently sitting on a branch for the last sap to buy this on Blu-ray before conveniently swooping in on said saps with the 3-D release.  (Can't remember if Thor hit theaters as a 3-D movie, but I think it did, and Paramount is using the same release strategy there.)  Please resist this strategy fellow would-be saps.  The movie is a solid 3 (couple of weak plot lines)...the release strategy gets it rated a weak 1!!

B003XT603Q|4.0|Great ending. This sure was the saddest book I've ever read. Seems very dark and depressing, but the light comes out at the very end and you can see the sunshine through the clouds. I've never read a book like this and to be honest, I'm not sure I ever want to read another one. It just takes a piece of you and leaves you feeling a little empty. I don't even know how to explain it. It's like traveling up a mountainside on a dark gray day. Yes, the beauty is still there, but you have to look for it. You don't even notice the beauty before you because of the overcast skies. The higher up you go, the more drained you feel. At the very end, as you reach the top, you're bone weary and exhausted, both mentally and physically, but suddenly you can see above the clouds and it's so bright that your eyes hurt and the whole mountain suddenly looks different...you suddenly feel renewed...the world you thought was gloomy and gray is suddenly bright and new....and beautiful.....
1401323952|4.0|I like this cookbook for the most part but I find it a little bewildering. Who is the intended audience for this book? At times, it is extremely basic---arguably too much so----but then Nigella will throw in recipes that are quite involved and/or require ingredients that are not easily found. Compared to some of her earlier books (Feast, in particular), the complexity, sophistication and originality of the recipes are so different that it almost seems like a different author wrote it. Maybe Nigella is getting tired! The recipes in Nigella Kitchen certainly seem to put a premium on convenience, speed and ease---perhaps at the expense of quality at times.    I found the chapter on what she cooks for her children (What's for Supper?) particularly unimpressive. Many of the recipes were nothing more than blander versions of American staples, like chili, sloppy joes and pizza. What she calls a \\"crustless pizza\\"--which I would assume to be all filling and no crust, like a crustless quiche---is pretty much the opposite---a crust made of a popover/pancake type batter, with nothing but cheese and perhaps a little pepperoni on top---no sauce. I know the English separate the world of kids from the world of adults more than we do, but her \\"children\\" are now in their late teens and long out of the nursery---aren't they old enough to eat adult food? Many of the recipes over-rely on canned and convenience foods, and I would never serve some of the dishes to company that she does (at least, according to the TV series based on the book). \\"Mexican Lasagna\\" (which she admits is basically tortilla pie) looks like a good bet for a family dinner, but with canned tomatoes, canned corn and canned black beans, it's more assembling than cooking and I would never serve it for a dinner party. Her seasoning recommendations are also wildly inconsistent, from underseasoning (no salt in the Turkey Meatballs in Tomato Sauce) to what seems like radical oversalting (3 teaspoons for the Lemony Salmon with Cherry Tomato Couscous and Indian Rubbed Lamb Chops, 2 Tablespoons for the Dragon Chicken---granted it's kosher salt, but yikes!) And she never says to drain fat from bacon or ground meat after browning.     But, on the plus side, I've made some great stuff from this book. The Lemon Polenta Cake is delicious and surprisingly easy, the Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding is wonderful (though it needed considerably more baking time that what is given), the Beer-braised Beef Casserole is one of my husband's new favorites (I had to add more salt, however). I'm giving the Tarragon Chicken a go tonight, and making the Chicken Fajitas later this week. And it's such a huge tome that even if many of the recipes don't speak to me, lots of them do---and I think any cook would feel the same way.    In summary, a book that is a bit puzzling and internally inconsistent, and maybe somewhat over-simplified compared to her earlier works, but still worthwhile and full of interesting and delicious recipes. And I can't forget Nigella's trademark excellent writing abilities, which make the book fun to read as well as to cook from.

B002N4DZ08|5.0|Georges Bizet's \\"Carmen\\" actually puts the heroine on stage much less than other operas with a strong lead female.  In Verdi's \\"La Traviata\\" and, even more, Richard Strauss' \\"Salome\\", the heroines spend all or a majority of the opera on stage, dominating the action and the music.  An opera like Bellini's \\"Norma\\" also puts the lead singer front and center for large spans of time.  In contrast, Carmen is on stage sporadically, and has surprisingly few arias or duets in what is a fairly short opera.<br /><br />This has an impact on how I reacted to the two very different Carmen interpretations by these two famed divas.  The St. Louis-born Grace Bumbry is excellent technically, has a beautiful voice, but does not project much personality.  Maria Callas of course concentrates on Carmen's dramatic potential, with a strong-as-metal personality and will.  As someone with a natural taste for the pure singing Bumbry engages in, I will say that I liked Callas' interpretation on a musical level very much, which may be something of an out-of-consensus opinion.  Callas pays a lot of mind to the vocal color she applies to certain notes and passages, producing some very musical effects and also colorful phrasing, and also is very rhythmically inventive.  In short, I think her display of musicianship in this famed recording of Carmen is absolutely excellent.  But to come back to my original point, I didn't find the interpretation of the central role a make-or-break deal.  To me, it was important but not vital.  \\"Carmen\\" is an ensemble opera and different members of the performance team can \\"take over\\" and dominate the interpretation.<br /><br />The dominant performer to my ears in the Bumbry version was in fact the conductor, Rafael de Burgos, who leads a well-executed and -paced choral and orchestral performance.  Bumbry's relative lack of characterization isn't such a problem in such a context.  Her \\"non-dramatic\\" take on Carmen is complemented by a very good Jon Vickers, as Don Jose, who approaches the role as a musician more than as an actor.  I found Mirella Freni, a singer I usually like very much, uninspired as Micaela and thought she had some problems with her big 3rd act aria \\"Je dis\\".  One other negative is that the recording features the original spoken dialogue bizarelly not read by the opera singers performing the role, a money-saving idea that I think mars the dramatic continuity of the opera.  The recording dates from 1970 and it is generally superb.  Notwithstanding a bit of harshness in the treble, this is a beautiful sounding record.<br /><br />The 1964 Callas \\"Carmen\\" may be the world's most famous opera recording.  In a performance that has entered the realm of myth, Callas is well-paired with a very dramatic Nicolai Gedda, who offers an interpretation of Don Jose close artistically to Callas'.  Additionally, I found the Micaela in this set, sung by the Parisian soprano Andrea Guiot, very good.  The conducting of Georges Pretre is pretty good but I think the pacing in the best part of the opera, Act 1, bothers me - there's something sluggish about it.  Sound is good for its time period and holds up well.  One surprising thing about both sets being reviewed is that neither version of the opera's most famous single number, Act I's \\"Love is rebel bird\\", really hits it for me.  Both are paced a little sluggishly and don't have the ideal rhythmic pizzazz.<br /><br />These are two five-star interpretations of the famous and very entertaining \\"Carmen\\" with greatness in them.

1427211760|5.0|I was asked to review The Art of Possibility and provide some feedback to a focus group on my thoghts. I was skeptitcal at first thinking oh here is another self help book. After getting through the first chapter I found it so insiring I had to share it with upper management in our company. One of the principals made it through chapter one and had started chapter two asked that I order him twelve paperback and one audio book to share with more people at work. This book has had such an impact on my life since reading it. Rule number six can be very entertaining when more people have read the book. I actually use rule number six to break the ice with co-workers, friends and family to introduce them to this way of thinking. I have purchased more than fifty copies of the book, at least twelve copies of the audio book and I went so far as to buy the DVD video discs to use in our presentations at work. This book really has transformed my spiritual, professional and personal life. I have personally found this book so inspiring I keep copies with me at all time to share with others even if I have just met them for the first time at a coffee shop. The value gained from reading Rosamund and Ben's book far exceeds the price of the book. Read it, Enjoy it, Live it, share it with your friends and learn how to create more possibilities than you ever thought possible.

0670022411|1.0|I also heard the NPR story about this book and was excited to read it. What a mistake! NPR, you should be ashamed!    This book is a mess. Characters who might be interesting disappear early on, characters who aren't even remotely interesting turn up at the perfect moment to conveniently solve plot problems, unspecified danger lurks but is never developed... And as other reviewers have pointed out, there is so much eating and sleeping and sighing and drinking -- and so much detailed description of each -- that I thought I was reading a lifestyle magazine, not a novel.     This is an idealized, sanitized \\"romance\\" for bookish, middle-aged women who fantasize themselves serious athletes and brilliant academics, gorgeous beyond their own reckoning, who in reality have only the vaguest notion of what an adult relationship must be like because they've never actually been in one. (Or \\"Twilight\\" fans.) For the rest of us, it's a gigantic waste of time. Run away, and don't look back.    Oh, and here's a note for mainstream book reviewers: Stop promising that every novel on the market that has even a hint of the supernatural in it is \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups.\\" I've read a lot of books making that claim to fame lately, and not one of them hits the mark. Rowling's prose may be turgid, but at least her characters are engaging and active. They go out and DO things. (Things other than eating, sleeping, sighing and drinking, that is.) A \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups\\" would have action and drama, engaging characters, real danger, adult relationships, far-reaching themes... In other words, it wouldn't be this book. (Or \\"The Magicians,\\" for that matter, which was way closer to \\"The Secret History\\" than \\"Harry Potter.\\") The true \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups\\" hasn't been written yet. When it is, we'll all know, because it'll be HUGE.

B000002GBK|4.0|I can remember when I was in my teens (it was like 1983-84) when I first heard the song \\"Merlin the Magician\\" it was being playing on a collage radio station at the time, & I was playing around with my tape deck & I had recorded the last minute & 15 sec. of the song. I ended up really liking the piece that I had recorded. & for 30 YEARS & I MEAN 30 YEARS I had wanted to know the name of the song & who does that song! I resent got myself an I-phone & I installed an app called \\"Shazam\\" (it listens to a song that is being played & it gives you the artist & song title)  & when it showed me the title \\"Merlin the Magician\\" by Rick Wakeman, I said to my wife, \\"I hope this is correct\\" cause I been looking for such a very long time for the song title!!!& now I'm so glad that I have this CD now!!

0736083863|5.0|I have taken many Pilates certification courses.  Most have required anatomy studies & suggested reading materials.  Pilates Anatomy, by Rael Isacowitz, is an excellent resource for anyone who wants a clearer understanding of the muscle groups that are worked in each of the Pilates exercises.  I highly recommend it.
0143113100|5.0|Let's do reasons NOT to read this book:  a) You hate science b) You have your own pet theories of psychosis and neurosis that you don't want to give up c)  you just want a nice story with romance, murder or terrorists getting blown up.....OK, well, go somewhere else...try James Patterson or Danielle Steele<br /><br />BUT, if you want to truly LEARN something (about yourself), and do it in a relatively painless way,  read this book.<br /><br />It's hard to think of an area of life or thought that wasn't addressed by this book either directly or by extension.  You name it: Addictions, learning, aging, societal and cultural issues, I think its all here.<br /><br />I greatly appreciated (as an engineer) Doidge's ability to state the common theory of operation, and then painstakingly (nearly mathematically) point out through published data and experiments what the actual result/truth/underlying fact must be.  I'm confident (and convinced in my mind) that Doidge has proved his hypothesis that the brain is plastic and remains malleable through out our entire life.  He leads the reader through a number of assertions, proving them step by step such that the reader goes  \\"That's obvious, I know this, I've felt it my self, let alone using brain imaging or micro surgery to prove it....how could scientists have missed this and perpetuated falsehoods for so long....\\"<br /><br />Lest you think this to be an entirely dry science book, its not.  Doidge reveals all of this by relating the stories of specific researchers and the lives of their subjects.  Indeed, the book is really a collection of the life stories of prominent researchers and their relationship with their test subjects.  However, Doidge elegantly knits the stories together to make the entire book seem relatively seamless, and each section flows into the next relatively effortlessly.<br /><br />I think there is a vast amount of change (for the good) that could be brought about in the world for people who read this book and say \\"Oh, that's why I'm like I am...but wait, I don't have to exist that way, I can change it...\\"<br /><br />For shear potential of life impact, I have a hard time thinking of another book that could affect you more.but wait, I don't have to exist that way, I can change it...\\"    For shear potential of life impact, I have a hard time thinking of another book that could affect you more.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This series is great if you love zombie movies and games.  I can't wait for Season 2 to start in October.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I wish we had Michelangelo here to paint superhero costumes on the Sistine Chapel. George Lucas is not fooling anyone.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I pre-ordered the boxset back in January as soon as it was announced.  I'm a Star Wars fan and have been since I saw the original in the theater in 1977, and I've owned several different editions both on VHS and DVD over the years.     The set is packaged in a very sturdy slipcase.  Inside the movies are in a book format, with thick pages for each movie.  I was originally concerned about scratches, but the slots that each disc slide into seem to have a coating on them that keep them from slipping around and they actually fit pretty well. I've read that this is similar to the Alien set, but since I don't have that one I can't say for certain.    The films have never looked better on home video.  There may be a few issues here and there, but as opposed to freeze-framing through each spot where a change took place, I sat down and watched them, and had a blast doing it.     I have to admit I wasn't crazy about some of the changes I had heard about in the weeks up to the release. But they aren't as big of a deal to me when watching them in the context of the films.  For example, the new Krayt Dragon call that Obi-Wan makes in Episode IV sounded awful to me when I heard the clip online.  However, when I finally heard it in the context of the movie in DTS-HD sound, I really didn't mind it.     The sound is amazing.  When I first started watching, I felt that I wasn't hearing as much from my surrounds. Ambient sounds were there, but I finally realized it was the fact that everything was more precise, and I was only hearing the \\"punch\\" of the surrounds when I was truly supposed to.    There are a ton of extras and I haven't gotten through them all yet, but what I've seen is great.  Tons of things we haven't seen before, and some of the deleted scenes and animatics are things I actually would have liked to have seen added to the films.       Obviously there are those that changes matter a great deal to and I'm sure we all would have loved a branching option to select your owncustom cut (Crawl/No Crawl,Han does/doesn't shoot first,SE footage/no SE footage, etc.) but unfortunately that's not here.      I would encourage you to consider the set as a whole and not fault the whole over a couple of changes here and there, but if those mean that much to you, this review won't sway you anyway. But these are the best these films have ever looked and sounded and I would recommend them for any Star Wars fan.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is fun and challenging :) I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good puzzle!!!!!! Happy gaming :)
B004V98UKS|5.0|I am enjoying this fun little game. Some have had issues with the controls, I don't have a problem with them. This one will make you stop and think!!
B005974CNA|5.0|I'm not sure why others feel it necessary to be so verbose.  Quite simply put, this is a perfect example of what progressive rock has evolved into in our current day and age.  And it is good.<br /><br />I have listened to so much music, good bad and in between.  This definitely belongs to the former.  Please at least buy Outcry as a track or more purposefully, the entire album if you own any Rush, Yes, Kansas or King Crimson.  This is a great album and I'm so thankful the band took the time to get it right among all the drummer hub-ub.<br /><br />Well done gents!  Thanks for the great album and staying true to your prog roots.
1565114205|4.0|I thought this was a good book. I have a sales job that requires me to make multiple calls on a customer before they buy. This book does a great job of breaking down the sales process into achievable steps. I recommend this book for salespersons engaged in complex sales.
0060930349|4.0|This book is a great source of knowledge on the founding of the USA. Book came badly packaged though and several pages were bent on themselves which was not very good. The front cover also now has a large crease on a corner.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Two of the big names associated with this miniseries are Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks. That was the reason why I bought its box-set. Its only after having watched the 6 discs, non-stop, did I re-realised why these two are revered by movie watching audiences globally.<br />This miniseries sucks the viewer into it so completely that one can feel the hopes and the hopelessness which its characters go through. It is a war movie which does not preach nor does it lecture. It is not a larger than life \\"usual\\" Hollywood take on the Marines killing tha bad guys. In fact, one is forced to introspect throughout the goings on and even after it about the necessity and futility of war. How the soldier who wins it for his country does not win anything in the end and how the one's who are fortunate to stay alive are hardly alive. The war scenes are mercilessly honest the misery very real. The way many characters go a full circle, where they hate, respect and feel compassion for their enemy is so natural and human. One can imagine what moral conflicts and trauma soldiers go through when they are exposed to brutal battles for years. It is not about jingoistic patriotism nor is it a commentary on wars being bad. It is about the people who fought at the front and is based on the accounts they gave and wrote about. Not opinionated either way. Haunting yet consoling. Brilliant indeed. How I wish Indian movie makers made such movies.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I bought the Blu-Ray versions of the original trilogy even though I own the original VHS copies,special edition VHS,Special edition DVD and the DVD box set with the special editions with the originals on the bonus DVD. Now when I bought this I knew it was going to be the special editions we've all come to know and love as every fan would say, but Lucas has gone out of his mind with new revisions of a revision of a revision to the crazy Obi-Wan dragon call to the god awful Darth Vader going NOOOOOOOOO in Return of the Jedi. It's really just uncalled for and most of all just unwanted. But there is a plus to every wrong the movies look fantastic in 1080p and the sound is just fantastic and I still think every fan should see the Blu-Ray copies just for that. But in the end this is another disappointing re-release that I will watch again but it's never the version I would show a new Star Wars fan. It should only be seen by Star Wars veterans who know how the movies were originally shot.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|As many before me have reviewed, I've found this saga a sad deviation from what once made it great.  On the plus side, I'm happy to see Star Wars fans speak out in such a unified front.  Don't pre-order this saga.  Don't buy it.  Don't even think about thinking of buying it.  After watching this, I poured myself a glass of water, took a deep breath, and started watching the Lord of the Rings on blu-ray instead.  Heck, something had to wash this failure out of my eyes.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's challenging but not frustrating. The music and graphics are lovely. Works well on my Acer tablet. Recommend it for chilling out after a tough day.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|This is an excellent book series and I am currently on the second book. I would like to point out however that it actually costs slightly less to buy each book separately
B005HG4C4C|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. I am a HUGE Portnoy fan. I've been playing drums since I was in grade school and I still remember the first time I heard the first DT album. Been hooked ever since and have always idolized Portnoy. I was shocked and upset when Portnoy left, tried to come back and wasn't accepted back. I had low expectations for this album. WOW, was I wrong!!! This is the best album DT has put out in years! It's like they went back to the stuff that made me such a diehard fan. The last several albums really failed to grab my attention. To be honest, I probably listened to the last couple albums a few times each and put them away. This album is in HEAVY rotation. I just love this album. And that Mike Mangini guy? Turns out he's not so bad :) Is he Portnoy? No. Is he better or worse? Does it matter if the music is this good? Mangini is insane on behind the kit. So was Portnoy. They just traded in their Ferrari for a Lamborghini. They're both AWESOME. DT IS BACK!!!
B0052WSX32|5.0|Doris Day's new album is everything a fan would want: A great singer singing great songs.  Doris is in great voice, she sounds as good as she ever has.  Apparently time has forgotten her.     The choice in material is perfect for Doris.  Timeless songs for a timeless star.  'Daydream' is my favorite with 'Loving You' and 'Hurry It's Lovely Up Here\\" right behind.    The arrangements are fresh and the sound quality is excellent.      There is something comforting knowing in this unpredictable world that you can rely upon Doris Day to shine on.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say that has not been said already? Adele is unique; a voice for the ages. No one compares or is remotely near her range of voice and depth of emotion.
0385341008|4.0|I was initially drawn to this book due to its intriguing title. I love reading anything about the WWII era, and in that, this book did not disappoint. I must admit to having originally put the book down after my first reading session because I found the letter format distracting and off-putting. But after reading the cover blurbs again, decided to give it another try. I really had to force myself to stick with it through the first quarter of the book, because it was written as so many books of another era: with lots of background exposition that slowed the pace of the story (I can't really say \\"action,\\" because there's very little of that).<br /><br />However, once I got past all that, I was richly rewarded with a story of a group of people of diverse interests and intellects, all thrown together by the trying circumstances of a protracted, ugly war. The character through whose eyes we see the story unfold, Juliet, is charming, self-effacing and possessed of a wonderful sense of humor, about the world and about herself. The people she introduces us to became, for the short while it took me to finish the book, friends I looked forward to spending time with. I have to say I was truly sad to see the book come to an end.<br /><br />No, it was not a world-shaking story, but it was a beautifully drawn one full of people I missed immediately when it was over. I will think of them for a long time to come. And I was so sad to learn that the original author didn't live to see her work published successfully. Kudos to her niece for loving her aunt and the story enough to finish it so it could be shared with us. What a gift, and a beautiful legacy to leave.
1594202842|1.0|After finishing this book what amazes me is why the author, a well-respected professor of law, would publish this book?  She comes across more like the mother of \\"Sybil\\" than the typical mother of a US president.  She should be embarrassed by how she treated her children.  The book contains no useful information on child rearing, except for \\"don't do this!\\"
B005LY4B0A|1.0|This game uses quarter to half the screen for game play. The screen cannot be rotated or stretched. Making a mistake is too easy and there is no &ldquo;undo&rdquo;. If you get stuck at a level, the hint is difficult to follow and then locks you out for 24 hours before you can get another hint. I prefer to be entertained and challenged on my terms.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen almost all adaptations of Jane Eyre and I will in short say that this is the version you want to watch.   It is the most accurate and it respects the novel every bit of the way. It is also the most heartfelt and moving adaptation of any novel I have ever seen.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I had no idea that this was a self-published book until I kept running across typos (it's Patron, not Petron) and poor grammer and I suspect the writer (or her friends?) are behind all of the rave reviews.  Otherwise, I don't get it.  It had potential but just fell flat, in my opinion.  I won't be fooled again...
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|It WOULD have been a beautiful movie if it would not have been cut so brutally. My husband who has never read the book or seen other Jane Eyre adaptations where confused by explanatory \\"details\\" that were missing. So at the end he felt confused and I was just left with the feeling of complete dissapointment. I had to patch up the missing information for my husband.   I love Michael Fassbender and was excited to read he was to be Mr. Rochester. I was however disappointed. He did well but the whole movie does not move me as the Masterpiece Theater version did.   I need to watch the Masterpiece Version again, but it seemed to be that they reused the \\"same\\" Thornfield?  The scenes that were deleted, I think, are absolutely essential. It is just a shame and very unfortunate they were cut from the final movie.  Such a shame!!! Such a dissappointment.  However I do give the movie 3 stars but only in hope they would make an extended version with the deleted scenes.   Also the music is very beautiful and reflects and extends the feelings of the characters. The music suceeded where the acting did not. The score reminds me a bit of \\"The Piano\\". It will not surprise me I will buy the soundtrack.
1250004349|5.0|I just started the book yesterday. It is a great read and I  ike the way the chapters move back and forth. I can't wait to pick it up again and see what comes next.
0894803123|2.0|If one likes comic books, then the graphics and sub plot will be of interest.  However, if one is interested in making ice cream, then this is NOT the book for you.    Sure, it will provide an idea of the type of ingredients used in a variety of home made ice creams.  However, all of the recipes appear to use whole eggs in place of other books that put emphasis on only using the yolk.  The other scary part is that the mixes with raw eggs are not cooked.  With no cooking, the possibility of Salmonella could occur.  A much better book is \\"The Perfect Scoop\\" at 256 pages vs the 128 for Ben & Jerry's.  Plus the cost of the \\"The Perfect Scoop\\" is about a dollar more making for a best buy rating.  i.e. prices may vary  If a person is even more serious about making home made ice cream, then take a look at \\"Ice Creams, Sorbets & Gelati - The Definitive Guide\\" by Robin Weir.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a job where I travel a lot, so I don't have regular access to a gym.  This DVD has been perfect for my situation - I can do it in a small space, in just 20 minutes.  Best of all, after three weeks of doing it every morning, it still kicks my butt!  I love that Jillian is really no-nonsense, but always encouraging.    I can't wait until 30 days is up, to see my results!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I decided to try this book because it was recommended on the Kindle website, and it left me completely dazzled.  I loved the writing, the characters, and the way this book operated on many levels.  This is a morally complex book, which raises more issues than it answers.  Reading this book was much like being in a really engaging dream.  I have not liked a book this much since Chabon's The Yiddish Policemen's union.  This author has incredible talent.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Fun game and pretty challenging from the start without being overbearingly difficult. You actually feel pretty bad when you know you messed up and the spider reaches a fly.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|While trying to play wow, this thing will work for hours at times, then not work for more than 20 minutes at a time.  It just stops working.  The only solution has been to unplug & plug the device back in.  Not really something a gamer wants to do.  I thought at one point my usb port or my computer was the culprit.  However, I tried it on 3 different computers, including a brand spanking new gaming system right out of the box and it does the same thing.  Tried googling for a solution and apparently this is a common problem; google \\"g13 stops working\\" and the results are overwhelming.  Nonetheless, I tried all the different \\"fixes\\" found on forums and support pages, but nothing works.  ~$70 down the drain.

B003ASLJMW|4.0|I have seen this movie on television early in 2010. I have been looking for a DVD of this movie at Walmart and finally found it on Amazon.com.  This movie has areas of violence in regard to secret service so I would not recommend it to children.  This movie is full of ingenuity and suspense and real life situations.  A real keeper for Clint Easwood fans.

0385534639|5.0|alright so, i pride myself on my review abilities as an avid yelper, ebayer, and etsy-er but somehow, i just never review any of the 25203948 books a month i order off of amazon because... of sheer volume i guess? laziness? i guess i just figure someone else will review them. which they always do. and i always read.  however, this book will stand out as my first review of an amazon book purchase since i believe the fourth or fifth harry potter circa 2005 (maybe 2004... depends on how honest you want me to be). it will be short and sweet, i promise, because as much as i appreciate and devour long, detailed and textured reviews, all you really come here to read is whether or not i liked it, and why, and then you inevitably scroll down or up or click out and away completely. so here you go:  this book is, in a word, sparkling. another word: magical. this, coming from a child of the harry potter generation, one who avidly reads books of all genres but really just wonders why i have to give up the majesty and wonder of fantasy books as soon as i hit \\"adult\\" reading age. who made this rule? were they sad, with a meaningless life devoid of good food, sex and laughter? probably. i choose to disobey this societal and cultural expectation and read my fantasy books at age 22 and enjoy them. immensely.  this book is dreamy. it often references the existential quandary of knowing the difference between dreaming and reality, and as the reader you are kneedeep in this blurred boundary as well. the language is precise and ripe and colorful and completely unique in its use of the present tense. a good book in the present tense is hard to find, harder to enjoy. this reads like a play being acted out in front of you.  okay, i think i've reached my \\"short and sweet\\" limits. i'll say one more thing: the night circus is beautifully circuitous and circular and labyrinthine in its plot and scope. i find nothing more satisfying or awe-inspiring than a book that has you finish the last pageonly to go searching like a pirate for treasure back through from the beginning for all of the clues and hooks and little tendrils of connection that you may have missed as you hungrily tractored through each chapter.  read it. its heart and stark delicacy will enchant you.
0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl is my new hero.  Reading this book has truly changed the way I view the world and the people in it, including myself.  I bought several copies to give as Christmas presents this year.     The first part of the book is Frankl's account of his three years in concentration camps and how he was able to find meaning in his suffering and support for his existential theory for treating individuals' mental health issues.  If you read only this part, your life will be changed.  But for mental health practitioners and those interested in understanding what makes themselves and others tick, his explanation of Logotherapy is like the meaning of life and existence neatly summed up in a few pages.  This book has changed me to the very core of my being and will certainly influence the way in which I treat my clients.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This Blu-ray is an excellent package, and video quality is fantastic (including film grain take note).  However no one seemed to know if the digital copy still worked (ridiculously the code expired in 2010). Nevertheless, it still works as of Sept. 2011, at least in iTunes.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I went into the theater to see this as a fan of all the other movies.  I LOVED where they went with this film.  This film was much more modern than the others.  It had all the elements of a great film.  Something I really loved about this film was just the youth in it.  I felt like the older films, which I loved, were slower and not as emotional.  This film had so much emotion in its characters, especially Eric (Magneto) and Raven (Mystique).  Out of everyone in the film, I felt most drawn to Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique.  She is as good as an actress as she is beautiful.  Raven's character throughout the film was just amazing and gave Mystique so much more depth.  This film brought in a lot of new characters and humor and I cannot stress enough how much I liked this film.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|Great game! The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible. Cute graphics and sounds.  Good time waster.  The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes it's difficult to cut the thread you want to cut on my phone screen - this probably wouldn't be an issue on a bigger screen like on a tablet.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|My son and I love this game. After playing through this Android version I bought the apple version for his ipod, and I was surprised at all the fun extras! Other versions have additional mini-games, and the zen garden - the cost for the Android version is equivalent, so why doesn't the Android version have these? When you finish the Android version, you're done. There's nothing else except to go through it again.<br /><br />The game itself would be a five star if it wasn't for this. Serious lumps to PopCap for this completely unfair cripple. The lack of multi-tasking is a bit annoying, but I haven't had the problem with it not remembering my progress, and we have at least three different users on it on my phone.
B001HHKISY|5.0|Everything written on the album is in another language but the music is beautifully universal.    This is an album to listen to many times.
B0055S348W|5.0|Works flawlessly with Samsung Infuse and Galaxy Tab 10.1 on Brother HL-2170W! Small download[no extra cost] required after PrinterShare found my printer.
B002BWP49C|5.0|When I first heard about the teenage vampire movie \\"Twilight, I wasn't at all interested.  Then, one day I stumbled upon it while searching through tv channels.  ZAP!!  To my surprise, I was completely absorbed and didn't want it to end.  I can't say for sure how many times I watched the first three Twlight movies.  I know I saw \\"Twilight\\" and \\"New Moon\\" at least ten times each, and \\"Eclipse\\" was probably five or six.  I found them all wonderfully romantic, exciting and captivating.  I didn't, and still don't, understand how or why I was so intensely drawn into these movies.  I feel very close to the characters, as though they're my own family and friends.  The most puzzling aspect of this fantasy relationship is the fact that I'm fifty-nine years old.  My only source of justification being that Edward is over a hundred.  I also bought all three Twilight Saga CD Soundtracks.  The music may have had something to do with my attraction to the fantasy, as I'm highly driven by music.  Or maybe I enjoy listening to the music because it connects me to the fantasy.  I'm looking forward to experiencing \\"The Twilight Sage: Breaking Dawn\\".  Based upon it's predecessors, I'm already giving it a five-star rating.  Indigo Butterfly
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The word suggestion is incredible.  I can type with real words and not abbreviations because SwiftKey completes them with a few keystrokes. It's really the best.
B004TPXVKS|5.0|Caravan are one of those great English art school bands of the 70's along with Barclay James Harvest, Gentle Giant, Soft Machine early Genesis etc this disc is a triple delight disc one is the original recording, disc two out takes unreleased material and live versions, and disc three (my favourite) the 5.1 version with two video songs from 1971 at the end. Arguably the best album they made along with Blind dog and St Dunstans this three disc set is great value for money.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|This is a fun little game. Starts out slow to get the hang of the puzzle then it gets intense. One of the best game appear I have gotten so far.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I bought the boxed set and absolutely love it, for all of the reasons other reviewers mention. With no intention of being sacrilegious, \\"There is no (musical) god but Mozart, and Uchida is his prophet.\\"    I have, however, begun collecting the individual CDs of the same recordings.  One big reason for this is that some of the individual CDs include recordings of other pieces as well: the recording of concertos Nos. 5 & 6 also includes the Rondo K. 382, and No. 17 includes the piano quintet. (Likewise, the individual CDs of Uchida playing Mozart's piano sonatas include pieces that are not in the boxed set.)  Also, I find it easier to digest the concertos a couple at a time rather than all at once.  Regardless, Uchida's recordings are wonderful, whether purchased one-at-a-time or as a boxed set.  I admit, I'm also having fun finding low-priced used copies of the individual CDs.    Once I am done collecting the individual CDs, I will pass the boxed set on to a friend, hopefully making another convert in the process.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It runs well and is simple to follow. It seems well thought out with a little story, and makes for a bit of a challenge.<br /><br />Tip: zoom in and out to make sure you cut the right string. Also hold down a string first to see if you have selected the correct one as it will turn red. (this helps on the harder levels when things get more compacted.)
B0053VKP8S|3.0|This is an amazing DAC for the price. And for sure will suit 99.9% of the people out there.<br /><br />However, the 192/24 mode seems broken. Whenever I switch to 192/24 the output becomes static and/or some ticking noise that just makes it hard to listen to.<br /><br />All other formats play perfectly!<br /><br />As I read around there are similar cases so be warned that this unit may not work with 192/24 even though they advertised it.
B0034JYC7G|1.0|I bought these to go with my Thinkpad Tablet and the carry bag and 2 to 1 prong adapter are nice. However, after only 1 week of use, the wires are already poking out of the plastic casing!  I've had my iphone and samsung earbuds for years and neither have their wiring exposed yet -- these are not worth buying!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|i thought the movie was played out very thoroughly, and the cast was absolutely great. read the book first and you'll get the most out of the movie. GO SEE IT
1401230423|5.0|In \\"Sandman: Season of the Mists\\" Neil Gaiman does what he does best, creating a mythology that runs parallel to reality as we live it, but here, he outdoes himself by not just telling an interesting story, but by revealing a truth inherent about our dominant myth system.  That bit above is the best way anyone can sum up the sense in Sandman: Season of the Mists without removing any reason you could have for actually reading it but it doesn't matter because the book is simply fantastic.   In this work, Gaiman weaves together love, hate, obligation and elements of literary Christian theology (i.e., a very Miltonian hell) and places them in a wrapper of storytelling using a mythology that encompasses theological and mythological concepts, some of which, like faerie, law and chaos, exist purely within the realm of fantasy literature and when he is done setting the stage using these ideas and populating it with characters who run true to imaginable form, he tells a story the ending of which is an unflinching examination of a single mind-bending question: \\"what would happen if Satan grew tired of ruling hell?\\"   The answer to this question is a kaleidoscopic shock.  Gaiman is a master storyteller on many levels and unlike nearly all other writers of fantasy, his best work can be read both for the raw pleasure of a good story, on the level of storytelling technique and even on the level of philosophy and the command of all aspects of the story which Gaiman displays on every page of this book is a cause for awe. Gaiman seems powerfully inspired in writing this story. This is true right down to the incidental levels of the sound-effects, and dialog: listen to how Mazikeen speaks then, figure out how Gaiman wrote her dialog and you will instantly know what I am talking about.  Look through other works of his, even one or two that have been (re-) made in other media like the novel Neverwhere, and you will see that Gaiman can simply \\"tell a story\\" using a set of techniques andthemes and call it a day, but Sandman: Season of the Mists shows him melding technique with inspiration, so that instead of its being just a set of well-handled themes or tropes, there is a powerful and organic coming together of Ideas, technique and feeling in the story that make it like nothing else in the history of graphic novels.   After a youth spent reading comics, only to see them evolve into \\"graphic novels\\" and think that those were the limit of the innovation possible in mass-market graphic storytelling, Gaiman's writing in Sandman: Season of the Mists, coupled with artwork that is direct and surreal at the same time, has been a strong, charming indicator that the well of creativity in the field not only has not run dry but that it cannot.   It is impossible to recommend it enough.
1606863622|5.0|This was my first Nicholas Sparks novel and I think it was a great first book!!  I am so glad I read the book before I saw the movie.  The book includes so much more depth and detail than the movie does, which is typical.  This book kept me engaged from the very beginning and always wanting to read more.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|All I can say is that I want Paper Camera for my PC, and I even have Photoshop! This app is loads of fun and has plenty of artistic filters to give your pix a unique rendering. My only complaint is that I can't filter pictures already on my camera. It could just be my falt or my phone, but it's not enough of an issue to keep me from giving this app 5 stars.

0142414999|5.0|I loved this book. I have read it a few times now and I will continue to read it in the future. The story lines were great and the content kept me turning the pages until I was done. I read it in 4 hours...If you like young adult romance, you will love this book!!!
0634049011|5.0|This book is phenomenal. It's hard for me to believe how blind I was before I started working on it. If you're serious about your music but the fretboard is still a mystery to you, do yourself and your audience a favor and grab a copy! You won't regret it.
B000F3T7RE|5.0|I was inspired to listen to these 15 quartets after reading - Music for Silenced Voices by Wendy Lesser.  The book is a fascinating story and leads the reader through the personal, political, and professional events that shaped Shostakovich's life.  The book considers each of the quartets in chronological order and in this way details the circumstances under which they were written. I wanted to hear the quartets as I knew little about Shostakovich's life and music.  The music is, at times, heart-rending and you can hear both sorrow and joy in them.  They are marvellous.
0525457585|5.0|If you like story telling, fantasies, wisdom, secrets, magic, dreams, thriller, heros then after reading this book you will learn that there are lot more than that which you have not felt yet!but you will love it.
B005974CNA|5.0|Dream Theater have returned with their first album since the departure of drummer and key member Mike Portnoy and replacement with Mike Mangini. Much as Portnoy is a fantastic drummer, I think his departure may have been a blessing in disguise; they appear to have escaped from the rut they were starting to get into and come out with what I think is their best album in at least a decade.    Dream Theater have always had both their \\"metal\\" side and \\"progressive\\" side; on this album they go back more towards the progressive end with a sound that is much less heavy than their last couple of albums (closer in a lot of respects to Images and Words). There's also a lot more focus on songs and melody instead of riffs and shredding. That doesn't mean the album doesn't have its metal moments or that there isn't any of the instrumental virtuosity you expect from Dream Theater - just that these elements take more of a back seat and the songs feel more cohesive. I particularly like a lot of John Petrucci's guitar solos on this album; he actually makes musical statements and retains melody in the solos instead of just throwing out notes as fast as he can. The keyboards are also a lot more out front, and keyboards and bass both have their own roles instead of just doubling the guitar parts. Mangini shows that he is quite capable of handling the complex drum parts; I think his style is a bit less aggressive than Portnoy's but maybe a bit more melodic. Vocalist James Labrie is also at the top of his game.    It's hard to pick just one song as the best; there aren't really any weak tracks (though some of their fans may not appreciate the acoustic ballad \\"Beneath the Surface\\" as much). Breaking All Illusions is probably my favourite overall though - it has amazing variety while still holding together as a strong song.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Thank you so much fo making this Movie, The Most Amazing Movie I Have Ever Saw If every movie I ever saw was this good I would love my life a lot more.
1400052181|5.0|I added this to my wish list but hesitated for months buying this novel dues to its seemingly boring subject but finally gave in and made the purchase.  To my surprise it was an enjoyable and well written balance of human tragedy and scientific endeavor. Henrietta is a poor African-American woman who dies of cervical cancer but lives on through the reproduction of her cells, creating the endless possibilities of miracles of modern medicine to evolve. The author makes Henrietta someone to respect for her attempts to make the best of a poor situation and humanizes the medical community who could be accused of using her for their own selfish gain. The science behind the story of cell research is interspersed with that of Henrietta's family in a way that makes the whole thing sadly human. Definitely worth the read.
0375758992|4.0|\\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight:  An African Childhood\\"  is one of the best written biograhies that I have read.  The language is raw, but innocent and realistic.  It's a tragic home life, but with the humor and childhood acceptance of reality it doesn't leave one feeling depressed.  There is no real resentment from the writer towards her alcoholic, emotional and selfish Mum, only love and sometimes compassion with an admiration that only she can express in the best way.  She idolizes her dad, even with his descripancies of drinking liquer too often and driving recklessly a lot.  We get an idea of the way of life for a British family living in Zimbabwe, Africa during war times at their beginning and a good insight to what is to come. I'm glad that I read the book and feel that I can better understand the way of life for most transplanted Africans.  I am looking forward to reading her next book to learn more about her Mum.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|First of all, Community took a while to win my heart. I watched the first couple of episodes and was not impressed. This show began to grow on me though. I can now say truthfully that this show is one of the brightest on television now. If you are not watching it every week, you are missing out! I do not ever buy DVDs. I am not someone who has every new DVD of every show on their shelf. I have what I consider the best! It is a small list of VIPs. I now have Community seasons one and two to add to my small list.<br />The DVD set comes with a copy of Troy's comic \\"Kickpuncher.\\"<br /><br />Disc One<br />Pilot  extended cut)<br />Spanish 101<br />Introduction to Film<br />Social Psychology<br />Advanced Criminal Law<br />Football, Feminism, and You<br />Introduction to Statistics<br />Special features: commentary on every episode, outtakes, creative compromises, season one cast evaluations, & Advanced Criminal Law  Alternate Scenes<br /><br />Disc Two<br />Home Economics<br />Debate 109<br />Environmental Science<br />The Politics of Human Sexuality<br />Comparative Religion<br />Investigative Journalism<br />Special features: commentary on every episode, outtakes, season one highlight reel, 3 mini episodes<br /><br />Disc Three<br />Interpretive Dance<br />Romantic Expressionism<br />Communication Studies<br />Physical Education<br />Basic Genealogy<br />Beginner Pottery<br />Special features: commentary on every episode, outtakes, communication studies extended producers cut<br /><br />Disc Four<br />The Science of Illusion<br />Contemporary American Poultry<br />The Art of Discourse<br />Modern Warfare<br />English as a Second Language<br />Pascal's Triangle Revisited<br />Special features: commentary of every episode, outtakes<br /><br />I recommend it, and I'm glad that I bought it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|George Lucas has not 'raped' anyone's childhood (seriously, guys - do you realize how utterly absurd that sounds???). George Lucas owns the negatives for his films, therefore, he can alter them in any way he sees fit. George Lucas is an artist; as such, he feels the need to tweak his master works.   The films look absolutely gorgeous, the sound is dynamically immersive and the specials features are second to none.   Now, for all you bitter, supposed adults who somehow feel cheated, move out of your parent's basements and MOVE ON (you could also opt out of purchasing)!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great addictive puzzler that keeps you engaged.  Simple premise but executed nicely with clean graphics and simple intuitive controls.  Well worth the price.

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I love the CD but the jacket is in 2 pieces.  It plays good now but I do not know how long that will last. I purchased this CD when it came out, and approximately 3 weeks ago I played it and one of the songs was all messed up so I purchased a new one.  Both were purchased from Amazon.
0547791097|4.0|I became intrigued about James Sallis' \\"Drive\\" after learning of Ryan Gosling's participation in Nicolas Winding Refn's adaptation of the book.  Gosling's against-the-grain picks have been very impressive to me.  He could have gone all-out Hollywood after [[ASIN:B000683VI4 The Notebook]].  Instead, he went the other direction:  [[ASIN:B000KX0IOK Half Nelson]]; [[ASIN:B000E6ESL2 Stay]]; [[ASIN:B0014D5RBE Lars and the Real Girl]] among other deft selections.  He has my total respect for those choices.  My understanding is that he listened to Winding Refn's vision of the book, bought in, committed.  As my prep to see the movie, I committed to read the book.<br /><br />It's not much of a commitment: you can devour this 150+ pp novella in a single sitting.  Sallis' writing is sparse and hard-boiled.  Protagonist \\"Driver\\" (Gosling's character) is (as I've seen described elsewhere) \\"ultra laconic.\\"  Indeed, he's a man of few words.  He spreads them around like they cost money.  One entire dialogue after an epic driving duel with a fellow driving stuntman goes like this:<br /><br />\\"Righteous driving.\\"<br />\\"Yourself.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, you need to re-read a dialog once or twice to work out who said what.  I've needed to do the same for Cormac McCarthy.  Good company.<br /><br />By day, Driver does driving stunts.  By night, he moonlights as a getaway driver in scores, jobs...whatever you want to call them.  'cept Driver doesn't participate in the crime itself or the planning.  He just drives.  That's the deal.<br /><br />Then, a deal goes south.  Driver is left holding the cash.  The mob gets involved.  The violence gets heavy.  The ultimate scene - a restaurant meeting in which Driver attempts to turn over the cash - is a thing of writing beauty.  Is it rapprochement...or does something sinister lurk behind his dining companion's bonhomie?  Read to find out.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Very infrequently do you see a movie that blends its satired source with comedy as well as Tucker & Dale vs. Evil has.  When you find yourself laughing out loud as teenagers hurl themselves into wood chippers, impale themselves on tree branches or set one another ablaze you realize that the horror element is vastly outweighed by the ironic humor that the entire piece is littered with.<br /><br />If you're comfortable with a little blood and a little cursing then this movie will be a surefire winner.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Buy this. Pay $50.  One of the best albums of all time. Ok - I speak as someone who went to college in the 70's. But listen to this album, $5 Really? is that 1974 $? Ouch - are Carole King (and I) really that old? (Her, maybe but she looks better than me.)
B005CM9DX6|3.0|Great to listen to as background music, but the songs never seem to peak.  Opeth is all about dynamics... mellow and tranquil to brutal, but the album never picks up.  It can be great song writing, but layers of boring is still boring.
0810988232|1.0|I just got my package in the mail. It looks like someone beat it up. The outside was unglued and the inside (where the cards go) was completely ripped and squashed. I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or the manufacturers? Based on the other reviews, it seems to be a very poorly manufactured item. There is no excuse for it being ripped up and squashed. I'm very disappointed. I would not recommend this deck (maybe go check it out in person, don't buy from Amazon). The Faeries' Oracle is 100X better.
B0019NG73G|2.0|This is a great epic.  However, the extreme graininess of the blu ray makes it no different   that the DVD.  My system indicates general bitrates of about 15 mbps...compare that to 33 for the recent star wars.  So for blu ray...not worth it if you already own the DVD.

B004O86JZ4|5.0|My new favorite Foo album yet is made better by the awesome decision of The Foo to release it on a well-mastered vinyl that has decent dynamic range (huge dynamic range by today's standards). THe MP3 download code that comes with the vinyl was a great treat too since a record player isn't always the easiest thing to get hold of these days; and the MP3s are actually ripped directly from the vinyl so they have the same dynamic range of the vinyl itself (no loudness wars here). I'm enjoying every song on this album and look forward to enjoying it for years to come.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|It was better than I could have ever imagined.  It has been more than a month since I first saw it and I am still mulling it over in my mind.  It was beautiful beyond words and the meanings of each frame and syllable resonate with every infinitesimal part of what I believe is our existence.  It is life, it is death, it is the joy you feel, and the sorrow you regret.  This movie has deeply moved me.  It has pushed me to forgive those who I have not been able to forgive, and love more than I thought I could ever grasp.  I feel it moving inside me still.  If you are looking for a film to carry you to a higher realm this is the one.  For any naysayer, you are thinking of it in a very shallow way, you need to let go of all the ideas that a movie is supposed to be and let this wash over you like a tide and take it as it is.   (Hint: Listen to the words during the Dinosaur scenes, they reflect our crying out and questioning of \\"God\\" when we are alone and hurt. with the voice over addressing god again, saying \\"where are you\\". this scene exemplifies the scenario which ALL beings face when confronted with pain and suffering: \\"why is this happening to me? where is god? don't i mean something in the scheme of life? arent i important enough to save? why doesn't god seem to care about my suffering?\\" )  My birthday Is october 12th, experiencing this again is going to be the greatest gift.
B000P0J0AG|2.0|Heat, 1995 film<br /><br />The story begins by a railroad. A man walks through a hospital and gets an ambulance van. Elsewhere a girl has lost her barrettes at home. Two men are in a big truck. They communicate with others by radio. The gang attacks an armored car! An explosive charge blows open the doors. After they get their loot a man shoots the guards, and use the ambulance to escape. A fire bomb destroys evidence. This loot is $1.6 million in bearer bonds owned by a wealthy criminal. The police analyze the victims, the MO may identify the criminals. The gang's talk attracts attention in a restaurant. They don't seem to care! One robber is able to get away. One of the gang has an anger management problem. They use a security leak to plan for a bank robbery. A man applies for a job in a restaurant (no union here).<br /><br />A police detective gets a vague tip from an informer. They will place this gang under 24x7 surveillance. There is a problem with the payoff; a double-cross fails. [There is padding to fill out time.] The police find another body, part of a series. Two of the gang break into a store, then walk away (sharp senses). Will the gang split or do the bank job? Will a man in Las Vegas work with the police? Will the gang photograph the police watching them? Surveillance continues at night. There is a meeting between the cop and the crook. [It seems wordy and pointless.] Then the gang dumps its surveillance at the same time. Can they get a driver? They rob a bank to grab bushels of money. The police plan to stop them. The shootout is like a war movie. \\"I'll see you at Nate's.\\" The leader learns of the treachery and gets his revenge. \\"Neil is still here.\\" Neil talks to Edie. Neil makes his plans to leave. Will Chris fall into a trap? Not with good papers.<br /><br />There are a number of faults to this story. It runs on too long with too much padding. The story seems contradictory: a smart crook creates a bank robbery that goes awry, then makes more mistakes. The violent action seems overdone. [Even if it has a historical precedent.] You can watch \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\" as an example of a nearly perfect picture. When a group of experienced criminals are gathered for a big robbery there can be a problem when it comes to divide up the loot. You can't expect honesty from robbers who have no other connections. If a group of criminals have prior connections from working together they can trust each other (as with the James gang). But these connections will identify the gang members to the police. And in time they will have to add new replacements, which can lead to the problem of trust. The problem with this armored car robbery is they knew about the bearer bond shipment so there was inside information that creates a limited list of subjects.
0316098329|2.0|I wanted so badly for this to be an exciting read, but it just fell flat for me.  I think Jack's character was not believable.  There is no way a 5 year old would be able to determine the many things Jack determined during his narration of the story.  I also think that Ma would have had much larger mental problems during the time in the Room.  Just didn't do it for me.
B000IHSKUM|5.0|this is my second pair of Keene sandals: the first lasted for years and was extremely comfortable even as i wore them out... these seem equally comfortable and feel great, even after a long day on my feet. the fit is about the same, once the sandals were broken in for a couple of days.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|People seem to be complaining that it's just a port. Well of course it is. It was originaly developed for PC. So how do you get it on other devices without redoing the game from the ground up? You port it. Thats how you get it on the Xbox, PSP, and smart phones. The difference is that instead of paying 19.99, you are only paying $3(at most. always on sale). Thats less than an esspresso for a game with lots of content.<br /><br />The game itself is loads of fun. Plenty of different stages, with bonus stages mixed in to change things up a bit. There is a new game+ mode afted the campaign where it gets a little harder, and you have 3 plants chosen for you that you have to use<br /><br />Lots of zombie types, and different plants to use. The graphics arn't quite as good as on the PC, but that probably has something to do with playing on a phone. And at 3 bucks, it is certianly acceptable.<br /><br />If you like defense games, and quirky humor, you should like this game. Well worth the money.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|Blu Ray is  great.  Great movie with great picture quality.  One of the funniest movies ever.  John Belushi gives an excellent performance.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm not going to get into the content of these movies.  This is a product review.  This is a decently constructed box set, with the discs stored in what looks like a small book the size of the outside box.  The book 'pages' are heavy, 1/4 inch thick cardboard with slots for each blu-ray.  I don't think the discs would be scratched inside this packaging because of the thickness of the cardboard - the individual discs are thinner than the cardboard, so I am leaving my discs in this packaging once I am done watching each movie.    The movie quality is excellent, and it is wonderful to see the movies without any cropping and good sound.  Despite how you may feel about the changes, if you want to see Star Wars in 1080P, just buy this.  At $80, it's as cheap as its going to get, brand new, and its not like Lucas is going to have a change of heart and release the theatrical originals on blu-ray next year.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|First of all, if I could have rated this ZERO stars, I would have. Thank God I got to see this release without actually buying it!  You know those people who feel unhappy with something about their body and decide to go in for a little nip and/or tuck? Then, before you know it, they notice something else that they don't like and go back for more, only now they start to look like someone who had plastic surgery. Then they go back in to fix the weird look they got and they come out looking even worse. After a while, they become psychologically addicted to plastic surgery and start going in every 6 months, each time coming out of the doctor's office looking more deformed and hideous than the last time.  Well, this is what the STAR WARS films have become. They used to be this natural, beautiful thing...a perfect example of how to make a great epic film series with a limited budget and equally limited effects technology. If you don't believe me, hunt down an increasingly rare copy of the untouched original films and marvel at the imagination and ingenuity put forth on the screen without the help of one second of CGI.   While you're at it, marvel at the character of Han Solo, a self centered and morally misguided rogue who goes through a wonderful character arc from that to well respected, self sacrificing hero and leader of men.  All of the newly butchered...I mean, SPECIAL...editions are shadows of the original films. Gone is the magic. Gone is the organic look of the film. And especially gone is the character arc of Han Solo, the best character in any STAR WARS film.  Rest in Peace, STAR WARS. I will always have my copies of the beautiful creature you used to be.
0545259088|3.0|I loved Shiver, it had such atmosphere to it. I purchased Linger when it came out, but didn't connect with it. To be honest, I can't even remember what happened during that book! It was forgettable. I saw Forever was out and felt I should probably finish off the trilogy, maybe it would improve and redeem itself for the 2nd one. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. While Shiver felt unique and addictive, Forever bored me. It took me weeks to read this instead of the normal few days. I had to press through, hoping it would get more interesting. Even the ending felt like it was just rolled out for the sake of an ending, not to be a GOOD, memorable ending. The entire thing has left me feeling blah. Like I watched a bad action teen romance movie with little to no thought put into it.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|I'll make this short and sweet. This CD is definitely not comparable to [[ASIN:B0001IN11Q Vivaldi's Cello]] by Yo-Yo Ma, but it's a good album to expose the younger generation to the classical/Baroque world of music. For that reason, and the fact that I generally enjoyed the arrangements, I give this 4-stars. I would have gone 5-stars if the cellists were more personal with their playing style and less robotic.

B00596WEVI|4.0|I rented this last week and I must say I really enjoyed it.  I put it on the same scale as other recent JCVD films such as Until Death and Universal Soldier Regenerated.  The co-star aspect I thinked worked very well and the story was pretty solid.  Its much better than Assassains with Stallone and Bandaras back in the 90's.  I liked the fact that JCVD has no name in the movie and that he gives no reason why he does what he does.  He's a hitman, period.  Good action movie.
0553801473|1.0|I just wanted to add my one star review because this book doesn't deserve its three star rating. My wife was disgusted by the torture porn, and I was as well, not because I'm a prude but because it was too graphic and totally unnecessary. It didn't add to the story at all.<br />GRRM has taken a page out of Robert Jordan's craft and is now turning his fans against him with endless discussion of food, finery, unnecessary descriptions of things that don't matter and pissing off the end of things.<br />I quit the book after 200 pages, my wife quit after 150. Like others, we loved the first three books and the last two have been painful.<br />How GRRM can repeat the mistake Robert Jordan made is beyond me.

B00138CUD8|5.0|Jeff Lynne is a musical genius. I first heard this 'album' in 1976. It was my first boyfriend's album. I instantly loved it. It is like a work of one of the great classic composers. I have bought this 'album' in vinyl,8 track, cassette and CD through the years! I have gifted it. Just perfection down to every note, beat, transition...just perfect. I always wonder if Lynne would be hard to work for! LOL  Favorite: Waterfall, I think!

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|This Movie should have been a made for T.V. movie. It Wasn't really Motion Picure Quality. I have seen much Better programing made by HBO.  It was an ok film.  I would Never have payed to see this in the movie theatre. I was more taken back by the \\"Ghost\\" movie made yrs. ago with Patrick Swayze..
0930289234|2.0|Not as good as everybody said, kinda boring...although it was much better than the movie by far.  The movie was not good at all.
0345495004|4.0|I am admittedly a literature snob who almost exclusively reads classic literature.  While visiting Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House, this book was suggested to me.  I love historical fiction, but was skeptical and slightly embarrassed to start reading what might have been a seedy romance novel.  I was pleasantly surprised by how beautifully written this book is, and how layered and thoughtful it is, weaving history with fiction.  There were many emotional moments in this book and I was so moved reading it.  I learned a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright and was fascinated by the details of the women's movement.  I'd highly recommend this book to any person - whether a casual reader or literary snob.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|If I must say one of the greatest movies. It'll probably begin to fade these days with all the special effect these days in movies. But you can't go wrong if you like science fiction and a little comedy, further enhanced by Blu-Ray. Buy it.
0307887898|5.0|I got this for my husband who has started a web-based business with two partners. They are still in the start-up phase, so I thought this book would be an interesting read for him and his partners as well as a help. He's loved it--I can tell because when we are reading at night he constantly interrupts me to share a fascinating idea from the book or a theory from the book that he wants to implement.    Here is what he said about the book: \\"This is an excellent book. I'm very familiar with the lean manufacturing philosophy and kanban. I'm surprised nobody else has applied lean principles to the entrepreneurship and startups - it makes perfect sense. Startups can't measure themselves using the same stick as a mature company. This book and the principles discussed are straightforward and simple, and I can apply those principles to my own startup today.\\"

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is so fun. With all the expansions you can add to it etc. It hasn't gotten old yet. All of our friends love this game. Lately its the only thing we play when we get together. So fun!! We got this as a gift and were overwhelmed by the instructions at first, but we finally decided to read them and play and we're so glad we did.
0375758992|5.0|I read \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" a few years back. It's an incredible, haunting book about Alexandra Fuller growing up in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe during a time of great turmoil. This book is a keeper. In looking through other books on Amazon/Kindle this morning I came across this one and realized I'd never written a review on it. So I had to do it. This is so good that it should be made into a movie.
030788743X|5.0|Honestly, I cannot remember when a book pulled me in like this one did.  It's easy to read from page 1 and gets you addicted after the first chapter.  Finished it faster than most books - and even put off watching some new fall TV shows to read this (unheard of for me!).  Sure, I was sucked into the hype because I was a child of the 80s, but I am also middle-aged non-gamer chick who happened to dig all the gaming aspects of the book. I am a sci-fi and YA dystopian lit lover, but I wouldn't really consider this to be either.  It's an adventure story, pure and simple.  The concept is slightly derivative, but there's nothing derivative about the content.  The level of detail the author goes into when he's describing some of the more technical aspects of the book gives away that this dude knows his stuff.  And somehow, he manages to write the technical parts of the book so that the layperson could easily pick it up and get on board.  His writing style is easy to read and truly impressive for a first time novelist!  My only criticism of the book is that Wade is like Techno-man and 007 all rolled into one - super-human technological abilities and super-human spy-like capabilities.  Can any one human REALLY know all this stuff?  I could see if he was a robot/computer himself, but good God, this boy knew so much about technology and was self-taught!  But...we all want the heroes in our stories to be the 'best' and impress us, so I am easily swayed to love him and believe that his character could be real!  I hear this is going to be made into a movie - and I can't wait to see what they do with the OASIS!  I get goose-pimpley just thinking about it!!!
1932100660|5.0|This book has been an eye opener for me. I was languishing all over the bookstores and libraries for the last 10 yrs of my life reading about all kinds of diets and unable to choose one because of so much contradiction and misinformation that is out there. I did not know if the problem was with me for being so confused or if all of them were right or only some of them were right or partially right etc. And then I finally came upon this book and it clarified and transformed my way of thinking about food. This book, along with Dr. Esselstyn's book, \\"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\\", have really helped put me on a path I have never dared to venture before on, but now feel very confident in my direction.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love the design of this little game, very old-fashioned home with great little puzzles. Music is very relaxing :) Definitely recommend
B005OCFHHK|1.0|This appears to be a repackaging of existing versions, aka money grab.  Look at the back packaging audio specs.  They are a mess.  DTS-MA for 7 1/2, True HD for 6, PCM for 1-5.  Will wait for a proper collectors box set.  I don't expect to see anything proper that coincides with this release.<br /><br />Geraldo V.
B002NZK5RI|4.0|Back when this movie first came out it was one of my favorites. I was 13 when it came out so I thought it was just my age. Turns out I still like it.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|I was unable to finish this book. I read the first 4 chapters.It was horribly graphic. I am so sad for the nightmare that this child had to live. I was happy to buy her book, but I had no idea...I don't know what to say. If there were some other way. I don't judge Jaycee for telling her story, but I must question the motives of the publisher. Jaycee may wish later on that she had not been so explicit. Phillip Garrido is truly evil and his wife an instrument of evil. jaycee's story may make us all more aware of what child sex abuse actually is, and hopefully abusers will be more aggressively sought and sufficiently punished. These kind of monsters are not human.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Boy, this was a really great adaptation! What I most loved about the book were the crazy imaginings -- but illustrated on screen with fully acted sequences (like the heroine being dragged in her nightgown, hair loose, by a bad guy, to a dungeon with lightening and everything - or tied to a tree in a rainstorm...) were really fun. It was a really entertaining and well produced film - even my sweetie liked it (he's becoming a fan of these Jane Austen adaptations, but don't tell him).
B0036S4CTS|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't.  Most of the time Dex is completely obnoxious and unlikeable.  Why would Emma want to even be friends with him, much less be in a romantic relationship?  I just wanted to shake him throughout the entire book.  Stop screwing up everything!  I don't know what kind of statement the author was trying to make with the ending.  Everyone knows life doesn't always have a happy ending, but it would have been nice for this book to have a happy ending.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|Angelina Jolie is brilliant in this film - it depicts the meteoric rise and fall of a fashion model, as well as the way she was seen by people in different parts of her life. I really enjoyed this a lot for what it was - a biographical morality tale of too much success and too little judgment. And, Angelina Jolie is freakin' hot!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I kept putting off buying this book because of the horrible things people were saying. I finally read it, I loved it.  Bella is not self centered or selfish, Jacob is not a pedophile, Edward is not a wimp.  If you like the twilight books and movies BUY IT.
0783230079|4.0|Cute, fun, silly -- a very easy-to-relate-to type of movie. Great for one of those evenings when you want something light -- this provides some laughs, some thoughtful moments and is downright cute. And fun. And Silly.

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|OH, you've got to be KIDDING ME! This was one of the silliest things I have ever watched - historical (in)accuracy aside - I just died laughing and lost interest halfway through and my friend fast forwarded through a lot to the end. What a dog!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|I hadn't heard of this movie when it was released and stumbled upon it on Netflix. As a die-hard fan of romantic comedies, upon reading the synopsis, I wasn't too hopeful that it would fit neatly into the rom-com genre. Still, it sounded interesting enought to warrant watching. Now a few days later, the gravity of the movie still weighs heavily on my mind. It is rated 'R' for its nudity and sex scenes; it really should be rated 'M' for 'Mature' -- mature audience who have experienced life, that is. If one can look beyond the graphic scenes (not easy with Gyllenhaal's glorious physique flashing before our eyes every few minutes) as well as reserve moral judgement, one can see that the movie encompasses many of the issues that mankind is afraid of confronting, which, not coincidentally, are also the same ones that we find difficult to talk about with our children. For Hollywood to even be able to address such deep issues in one film is a laudable endeavour:<br />- Fraility of the human condition, at any age<br />- The aftermath of casual sex (what comes next, how to deal with it, etc.)<br />- Human insecurities and self-doubt; everyone's latent desire to be loved 'as is'<br />- The wild roller coaster of life that can lift one to the heights of euphoria one moment and plunge one into abject shadows the next<br />- The ability to love 'in spite of', aka unconditional love<br />- The depth (or shallowness) of human interactions that range from the comfortable, non-competitive brotherly love between Jamie and Josh to the aggressive, self-serving relationships forged by the pharmaceutical salespeople<br /><br />Our experience with, and views on, some of those issues are harboured deep within our souls, never to be revealed; others, we are quite boldly vocal about. But all have seeded at least some thought in us, at one point or another.<br /><br />Both Jamie and Maggie wallow in self-pity -- she from the obvious and he from his ADHD. Both use their disability as shields against deeper feelings and forging more meaningful relationships -- she with men, he with his family. I could go on but no one wants to read a review that lengthy and heavy. Only the ending is predictable and uninspiring, as if the script writers have already expended too much thought and emotions and couldn't wait to end the story. This is not a first-date movie, or one where you just want levity. It is, however, a movie to watch with one you trust and who might welcome a discussion about the movie, should it affect you as much as it did me.ingful relationships -- she with men, he with his family.

B001AK3S4Y|4.0|Hey - I really liked this movie! It was fun, cheeky and a great ride. I like the costumes, it was action packed without having to take it all too seriously. I also quite enjoyed Hellboy 2 (which I saw first) - I'm a fan. I hope they keep up the quality of these as a serial because I look forward to another rollicking, funny, action packed Hellboy 3!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Great app. fully functional reader with a ton of options. I plan on using this program for a long time - its well worth the price.
0792833279|2.0|I can't believe I watched this movie. Seriously. I hoped it would be funny but it was a lotta \\"dumb\\" and some \\"painful.\\" If I was \\"in the movies\\" or even lived in LA and had the slightest interest in the politics and inside jokes, this might be funnier. Why bring in Pablo Escobar as a character - kinda lame. The funniest scene was where the \\"fake\\" West Coast gangster postures with his gun in front of the East Coast mobster and challenges his choice of weapon as a \\"Wop Nine\\" and says something about \\"don't they always jam up\\" - then gets shot to death.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After watching these movies through, I must say they look and sound great! Sure the DVD set was fine but the Blu-ray is clean. Which version of the films is in the set seems unimportant to me as I had a great time watching them. Highly recommended!
B004U7MR3C|2.0|I really enjoyed the Japanese original and expected this would at least be fun but... Richard Gere doesn't strike anyone as an anonymous cube dwelling workaholic (ok - PLEASE - enough of the product placements in their big expensive McMansion, right?). And... that was Jennifer Lopez? I don't know what I expected, honestly. Perhaps the part wasn't really well written. Stanley Tucci put in the best performance in the entire movie. Even the dance bits weren't that exciting or inspiring... blah. Stick to the original!
0316098329|1.0|The first 2/3 of this book was based on what a mother and child could do in a small room. Granted the author was creative but there was no plot and no real insights. The last part of the book was more interesting but a let down. My book club read this book and no one in the group liked it so I am really surprised at the lack of low ratings. Some said the concept/book was too scary or depressing and didn't not finish it.[[ASIN:0316098329 Room: A Novel]]
B000YIGNKE|2.0|If you're looking for a well acted, true-to-story interpretation of Persuasion - this is not it. See the 1995 Ciaran Hinds version, instead.   In this one - the haircuts are contemporary, the acting is moderately good but not memorable. Missing in this interpretation is the sense of stifling lack of privacy, the tension and the constant monitoring by family and others that keeps the pair from really communicating clearly.   It's not as good a story as the book nor as good as the previous versions of the film. One of my favorite parts of the story is where Captain Wentworth writes out the letter while overhearing a conversation and unable to actually talk with Anne - and with a subtle motion, calls her attention to the note he has hidden - and her reaction. She did not go running all over town - that's just crazy. Oy. Get the 1995 version.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Bought these (5) for my High School Journalism & Broadcasting Class. As long as you stay on top of battery management (i.e. turn them off) they work quite well. And they are inexpensive enough that when a student rips the mic off the cable by walking away and forgetting to unclip it you don't have to sell donuts at the corner to replace it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a fantastic series, each one can stand on its own as a great story. I couldn't put any of them down. Loved! Loved! Loved!
1400069181|5.0|I am not any kind of entrepreneur, but I downloaded \\"Start Something that Matters\\" after hearing Blake Mycoskie talking about it on the radio, and I was immediately in love. This book is encouraging, educational and inspirational -- not only for people looking to start up a business, but for people looking to live life to the fullest. I can't recommend it highly enough!
B004WR125O|2.0|My wireless router is about 50 feet from the Onkyo receiver.  I also have a Roku box that is next to the Onkyo receiver that I use to connect my TV to the internet.  The Roku works flawlessly using the wireless interface.  However, the Onkyo wireless adapter continuously droped the wireless signal.  My conclusion is that the Onkyo adapter is much less sensitive than the Roku in its ability to capture the moderate strength wireless signal.  So unless your Onkyo receiver can get a strong signal from your wireless router I would not recommend buying the Onkyo adapter.  By the way, the wireless signal strength using the Onkyo adapter was about 35. I finally decided to lay a Ethernet cable (a dirty job that involved laying cable through two walls and a visit to the crawlspace under our house) from the router directly to the Onkyo receiver.  The Onkyo NET feature now works very well with the direct Ethernet connection.
B0000256VK|5.0|I'm not going to say anything more about the music on this album other than to say it is wonderful. But you probably already know that.<br /><br />The subject of this review is the stellar remaster of this material. I bought the original vinyl when it was released in the 80's, then bought the CD years later. Both sounded good but this remastered version is absolutely wonderful. Definitely takes the listening pleasure to a new level.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is amazing, I couldn't rate it any less than five stars. Great graphics, gameplay, learning curve, and music.   The only thing that needs to be fixed is the loading time. It takes way to long to start playing the game. I literally left the game loading, made myself a sandwich, came back, and it was still loading. Please fix it!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|i prefer playing this on my PC, but being able to play on the go is great. I haven't come across any problems, other than that i am faster with a mouse.  for 2$  you owe it to yourself to have this game.  now...if we could just get Aquaria on Android :P
B005LAZIRY|3.0|Honestly, following up the masterpiece that is \\"Watershed\\" with this is like someone touching you in the morning and then just walking away:  I enjoy it but wish there could be more.<br /><br />I'm trying to fall in love with it, but after 4 spins I'm not thinking that is going to happen.  Perhaps it is my metal \\"heritage\\" making me painfully aware that there is no metal present here (although,  I love Damnation, so who knows).<br /><br />Anyway, worth buying, but if you like Opeth due to their metal offerings, you'll likely be at least slightly disappointed as well.
B00009R6J7|4.0|I must admit I was kind of surprised at how small this thing is at first glance, but like they say... size doesn't matter right?  I bought this level because bubble level on my tripod dried out for some reason... and so I needed a way to ensure that my horizons were perfectly levelled. There is nothing more annoying than a slanted horizon on a landscape shot or a panoramic shot!  This little item easily solves that problem for you in a snap... I have to admit that when you consider how small it is and that it is made out of plastic, then I agree with reviewers when they say that it is expensive... but is worth taking shots with slanted horizons? No!  I like the fact that the item can fit both horizontally and vertically into the camera's hot shoe making for easier use under different circumstances.  A nice to have little gadget in your photographic bag of tricks!

B000LTAY1U|5.0|Just got mine a week ago and I love it. A lot of people say the band looks cheap but I think it's in comparison to the watch. The band looks like it would be on a 80 dollar watch and the watch looks like a 200$ watch. The band is a little too glossy but all the hardware on the band looks great. I have a thin wrist cause I'm 6'4 and lanky and I think the watch is a perfect size. New watches are huge but that's trendy. If I still have this watch in 20 years it will still look great what about those giant things. It looses 4 seconds a day and once every couple weeks I don't wear it long enough and it dies so I reset it to the atomic clock and all is groovy. I  like doing that it makes it almost like a pet I have to care for and gives me a more of a sense of contact with it than one would have with perfect items that never give you any trouble. It's like an old Volkswagen you feel more connected cause you have to adjust the valves not just change the oil. It really feels like a quality item and has a decent heft to it but not too much, just enough to know it's built well. I also wear a Wenger Swiss army but I like the look and feel of this better. It's a work watch and cheap enough that if I break it in a year I will just buy another one. I may buy another one just to throw a better band on it for a dress casual watch. I work as a bellhop and it's common for me to have 50 pounds of crap hanging of my hand and wrist and it holds up to it. I'm constantly banging it into things and its fine. I decided to wear a cheap timex digital for a while to save my good watches but the band broke within a month and I decided I'm an adult and vain so I needed an analog that looks good. I hope it will last at least a couple years and think it will. People constantly compliment me on it. I've bought 50 things online and have liked half of them a lot loved about 5 of them and this is the first one I had to review.
1416585710|1.0|I found it very hard to get through, laborious in fact, but I kept going because it's King, and I love his books! Unfortunately it didn't get better for me. I prefer King's faster-paced and larger-world stories.
0553801473|2.0|I am done.  Sad to say, this book has finished the ASOIAF journey for me.  Nothing happens except around 500 pages of filler. The storyline has grown way too unweildy and uninteresting.  Even a Feast for Crows wasn't this bad.  A thousand pages of Tyrion getting captured again and again with little of his usual quick wit to keep amusement sustained.  Throw in Dany's struggle in Mereen which has tons of descriptive detail that is really not necessary and adds nothing to the story. No action whatsoever. Even the chapters with Jon Snow didn't have the spark they did in the first three books.  I'm actually two hundred pages from finishing the book and I don't think I'm going to make it.  I had to stop and read other books out of pure boredom.  I hate that this has happened to this series.  The first three books were the best fantasy that had come out in years.  I did give this book two stars for the Bran and Theon storyline which was at least semi-interesting.<br /><br />I also think this series which has been drawn out supposedly into 7 books now has stopped my propensity from buying series that haven't been finished.  It is happening too often for my taste in this genre and I refuse to keep spending money on the premise of a series that will either take my lifetime to finish or never come out.  I am also sick and tired of funding the watching of Jets games, movie deals, monthly vacations, etc for an author who really can't take criticism and doesn't seem to have any respect for the fans who don't agree with his every thought. Enough!
1439170916|4.0|Dr. M deserves a great deal of credit for putting this book together and for making it extraordinarily readable for every reader.  It's not heavy-handed, nor overly academic and is well-leavened with patient stories (whether or not they have happy endings).  It's only fair to say, however, that it is quite a long book and requires a steady commitment from the reader.    Recommended but you need to be willing to have the patience to stay with it.

1609611543|4.0|Wheat Belly, which is written by a physician, is essentially advocating a grain free diet along the lines of the Paleo diet, the Primal diet, etc. However, the information is presented in an easy to follow manner, with a more gradual method for implementing the food changes than some other grain free type diets I am familiar with.<br /><br />Essentially, most folks who are following a grain free diet, paleo or primal diet, Body ecology diet, GAPS diet, and to some extent a Weston A Price or SCD diet, will all be familar with the concepts and ideas in this book. The huge benefit to the book is that it has updated information with good references, has been written by a physician in a very easy to read, approachable manner (so it has the credibility of the physician, yet is written for the regular person who may not have a high level understanding of physiology), and it offers a graduated manner to apply the concepts.<br /><br />Essentially, he first encourages folks to get off all processed foods, eat organic whenever possible, avoid all products with Wheat and refined sugar. For some this alone is a daunting task and they may only accomplish one or two of the items, however, he gives positive reinforcement by saying ANY change will be for the better, and little steps are fine! He most strongly emphasizes the processed and wheat products/foods at this step. He then continues onward with the further benefits of going completely grain free, not eating ANY artificial stuff (artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, thickeners, binders, etc.) and essentially eating the type of diet that is most natural for our bodies - Meat, Veggies, fruit.<br /><br />He provides a lot of great physiological information - written in 'normal language' so that most anyone could follow it and understand. Additionally, his writing style is engaging, so such a subject that might be dull to many folks, instead seems interesting so people are likely to read, learn and understand the science behind the ideas.<br /><br />Where I feel the title is misleading is that the book is NOT just about eliminating Wheat and you will suddenly have fabulous health (which to me, the cover implies...). Rather, the elimination of wheat is only one factor in the overall plan.<br /><br />I do recommend this book. I think it is great for those just beginning their explorations into a healthier diet. I also think it is a valuable resource for folks who are already doing one of the diets I've mentioned in the first two paragraphs. Primarily because it presents updated, not as well published, information on the \\"why this works\\" and \\"why this is better for you\\" than many of the other books.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the title makes it sound as if omitting wheat from your diet is the only thing you need to do, when in reality, he advocates many other changes as well (no processed foods, more veggies, avoiding artificial ingredients (colors, sweeteners, flavorings, etc.). While overall I fully advocate his advice, I worry that many will pick up the book thinking all they need to do is eliminate wheat and they'll be healthy and set to go. In reality, it is a complete lifestyle overhaul way of eating. Because of this I think the title is misleading. Many folks have complained that I say this, but hey - it's my opinion - others may see it a completely different way.the ideas.<br /><br />Where I feel the title is misleading is that the book is NOT just about eliminating Wheat and you will suddenly have fabulous health (which to me, the cover implies...).

0062068423|2.0|This is one of those books that lives up (or down) to the cover. On my edition, the publisher tells you that if you liked \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" you'll want to read this. Frankly I wasn't that impressed with Dragon Tattoo, and this book frankly isn't even as good as that. The author does a decent job with the leaden prose that made Dragon Tattoo so dreary and evoked (more or less) the Scandinavian countryside, but here the plot isn't even very good, and the premise is silly at its best parts, and just preposterous at other times. The author knows little about firearms (I'm not an expert, but any idiot knows that a revolver doesn't have a magazine) and has the typical (for Scandinavians anyway) fetish for Nazi villains, who are always drawn in the most obvious This-is-the-BAD-GUY shades, so that there's really no suspense at all.  So to the plot. Protagonist Harry Hole (mention is never made of the crude double entendre of his name, in spite of the fact he speaks English) is doing security during President Clinton's visit to Oslo for the accords of that name, which hopefully will lead to peace in the Middle East. While the President's motorcade approaches Harry sees a suspicious character, then sees the guy's armed with an automatic weapon, and shoots him--only to find out later he's a wayward Secret Service Agent. This clumsy plot device leads to Harry being promoted and transferred to a political division of the Norwegian police, which deals with things like arms smuggling. Harry immediately begins to investigate an incident that perhaps reveals that someone in Norway has bought an extremely powerful rifle (which doesn't exist in r/l) called a Marklin, which comes in 16mm. and fires incredibly expensive bullets. Only assassins use this gun (why would you buy one then?) so of course Harry's suspicious, and when he discovers that a white supremacist (who slipped out of a conviction on a violent crime on a technicality) is involved in the sale, he naturallyhas to investigate. His partner gets killed (under particularly silly circumstances) and that just spurs him to investigate further.  The whole plot is preposterous. The book is held down by lengthy flashbacks to the World War II era, where a group of Norwegians serve on the Eastern Front near Leningrad. Somehow one of them survives and becomes obsessed with various things, and of course he's the one who wants the rifle, so he can shoot unspecified people. The soldiers in the World War II section are hard to distinguish from one another, and the events there are hard to discern. Once you (sort of) figure out what's going on, you don't really care (or at least I didn't). One of the characters is wounded, and improbably winds up in a hospital in Vienna, stereotypically falling in love with the nurse, though of course there are consequences and complications. By the time the author was tying up the loose ends in the last hundred pages, and trying to resolve the current mystery also, I had mostly lost interest.
B002P6TA94|2.0|The CD has some great tracks, \\"Sundial\\" is an amazing song. BUT the packaging is the worst digipack ice ever seen. It's made out of PAPER!!!! I feel ripped off.
0785134352|5.0|Mark Millar's \\"Kick-Ass\\" series is truly one for the ages and this book (a compilation of the first 8 issues) crackles with intensity, wit, savagery and eye-popping visuals thanks to John Romita Jr's fantastic penciling.  If you've already seen the movie, you will still enjoy this book immensely and find appreciation to the film adaptation for hewing so closely to the original plotting and sense of mayhem.  The last dozen pages of this book presents alternate covers, profiles of the creative team and an amusing 'greatest hits' section with highlight panels that demonstrate the extreme violence.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I am so glad I bought this. The Adobe Reader app was driving me crazy. The reflow text worked only sporadically on my phone and there was no way to bookmark or have it remember the last page I was on. I tried desperately to find another free pdf app that worked better for me. But out of the free one's Adobe's seems to be the best...it's just not for me. So I decided to shell out a buck for this one, and so far I am loving it. The reflow text works all the time for me. Being able to highlight what I read is a bonus (although I have difficulty doing so sometimes, but I have the same problem with my Kindle app...I think I need a stylus instead of my finger for best results) and I'm sure I'll like adding annotations too (haven't tried that yet). There are a ton of options in the settings (among other things I just found out that I can change the \\"page scrolling sensitivity\\" or the speed of the page flipping). I'm really surprised out how many features are here.  Sometimes it is a bit confusing to know what icons do what (It did take me a bit to find the text reflow option. Hint: look for the icon that looks like three dots \\"...\\") and you may want to play around with it a lot since there aren't instructions (that I know of) to find out all the things it does...sometimes it makes me confused, but overall I couldn't be happier. I'm glad it was on sale when I bought it, but knowing what it's like now that I have it I would pay the full price for it too.
B0058A119G|5.0|OMG    This disc is one of the most amazing Barbra Streisand ever recorded!    She sounds incredible.  Her upper register still has a silky fluidity that will give you goosebumps.       Do not listen to all the negative reviews here.  This is a compilation of beautiful music.   How wonderful it is that Barbra is sharing these songs for everyone to enjoy.       Thank you again, Mrs. Brolin, for everything!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|They have such perfect harmonies I want to see them live just to see how they really do it. It sounds so remote and yet so present at the same time. Very folk-y, very heartfelt.
B002U6CJCO|1.0|More than ten years after the original, we are bombarded with this piece of nuclear waste.  Van Damme and Lundgren look old beyond their years.  The \\"star\\", Andrei \\"The Pitbull\\" Arlovski acts on one level--dead.  There is so much killing, mayhem, explosions, etc. ad nausem, that one could not find a plot if there ever was one.  Well, at least I can use the plastic case for some other DVD.

B000K15VSA|3.0|The Blade Runner Ultimate Collector's Edition  gives you what is advertised and nothing more.  For the price, only collectors should buy this.  The little origami figure of the unicorn included  in the package was actually a plastic model and   not real origami which was disappointing.  I would have liked the BlueRay version to be  included with this set but I had to buy that  version seperately.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is a replacement for the first one that I thought my wife had worn out. (Watched it over 100 time), but it was the player that had gotten a glitch. But having two is better than one. It is, by far, the best movie production ever, and this package gives you a lot of behind the scenes stuff, plus and extra 16 minutes that are, in my opinion, crucial to the story. I don't know why they were cut from the theatrical version in the first place.

B005LLXB9K|5.0|The Cameron Crow documentary captures the intensity of Pearl Jam in the early years, along with the explosion of the Seattle scene.  Crows creation is fluid and the editing is creative and visually stunning.  The film clearly depicts Pearl Jam's relationship and contribution to other bands from the early '90s.  The viewer gets to know all of the original members of the band, their personalities and artistic contributions.  The film does an excellent job of explaining how and why Pearl Jam survived for 20 years.  As a life long Pearl Jam fan, I have to admit there were a few events in the film that I did not know about.  The film is full of different emotions and I laughed more then I thought I would.  Overall, a must see for anyone who grew up listening to Pearl Jam.
B004BSAEQC|1.0|This rap album is the worse by far. Nicki minaj makes music for a certain type of person. Dont get me wrong, some songs are catchy but with the retarded meatphores and her annoying voice, i can only liosten to half a song. Through out her whole album she takes shot at Lil Kim, Honestly she should leave lil kim alone being that is who she wants to be and is trying to steal her spot. I would recommend a lil kim album any day before this garbage.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the app I use the most. It is easier to get to a passage quicker in here than picking up my study bible. I love that it has a lot of different translations. It makes it easy to see what the author is saying in a couple of different translations. I also love that you can listen to it. I turn it on in the car in the morning and listen to the bible on the way to work and it helps me get my mind right for the day.

B000007MVD|5.0|I never thought I would enjoy these CDs as much as I do. It's true, American fans were short-changed in that we never got to hear the Beatles live. Ringo's drumming is much more of a feature here in these recordings than on the albums. He was great! I had also forgotten what a good bass player Paul was. They were so charming and enthusiastic. If you're a life-long Beatles' fan, you will be thrilled with these CDs. It's a treat to be able to hear them talk as well as play good old rock and roll. Just remember, that they were not recorded in modern day studios. They are live radio performances from the '60s - don't buy them and then gripe that the recordings and/or re-mastering is bad. They are a piece of history and they sound fabulous to me! So glad I found them!
B004G25V9S|4.0|4 stars ONLY because of its complexity and attempt to experiment; 3 stars as to me liking it, it will need some time and getting used to. here's the breakdown...    I get what they are trying to do, and they did a great job experimenting with it, they brought back a great decade of music and showed modern artists it can still be done! The time signatures and tempos, as well as jazzy compositions make this a very alive album. But something about Heritage is missing, it's not very catchy and I feel it lacks emotion.      I listen to opeth because of the cinematic feel they put out in there songs; I am able to throw on an opeth album and get absorbed into the music creating a movie in my mind that goes with the tune until the song is over & I snap out of it and realize ive been staring at the wall completely possessed by the music. opeth traditionally is so moving. I've listened to Heritage a few times, and i cant get a mood from it; its almost too straight-faced; It has yet to make me feel feel happy, sad, pumped up, or moved- its just music to listen to, like a good record I would throw on while doing laundry or having a smoke. This record is not in any way \\"bad\\", it is very complex and easy on the ears. BUT- i think its got a kind of an improv feel to it that makes it almost sound like just a jam session being recorded. The music just kind of goes, but without going anywhere, i cant find a build up. Its hard to find a hook or catch-riff in a lot of the songs, and very hard to follow mikael's vocals (seems very improvised, and all over the place).           Although he is probably my favorite singer, that's probably what dissapointed me most was the vocals, despite others' praise of it for this album. I love his singing voice, and i dont miss the growls , but this album seems to be him just yelling without a catchy tune to the music, as successfully heard in Burden. Heritage does not make a good sing-along album. Mikael's vibrato, like always, is impeccable though. As for the instruments- the drums and bass are EXCELLENT. The guitar work is cool, again, very complex. As a guitarist myself, I havent found a riff where i'm inspired to say \\"I want to learn that!!\\" My favorite songs on the album are Marrow of the Earth, face in the Snow, and Famine.        For now this album will have to grow more on me. I give much praise to the band for successfully accomplishing something new though. This is definitely an Opeth album, just not my favorite one. In terms of experimental, I think Ghost Reveries was their most successful for that. My favorite overall is still life.
1594744769|5.0|Maybe I'm the only person in the universe, but I had never heard of this book until I saw it appear on the Children's Chapter Books NYT Bestseller list (yes, I check the list).<br /><br />MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN by Ransom Riggs (Quirk Books, June 7, 2011)<br /><br />I guess the title caught my eye and I googled it (since I had never heard of it). And the unique photography was the true selling point. It just looked so...peculiar.<br /><br />So what is this book? It's a unique tale about a boy trying to learn the truth about his grandfather's strange past. From page one, the story caught me with its voice, and the compelling nature had me reading to find out what would happen next. I could not imagine what the big secret was! And why there were all these freaky pictures? And what kind of story could the author weave with these pictures?<br /><br />MISS PEREGRINE'S is like a four-leaf clover. It's a wonderful find amid a sea of books so similar in nature. And though the book is marketed for young adults, this is absolutely a book adults will enjoy equally. If you are looking for something different with great character development and a strong plot, then MISS PEREGRINE'S should not be missed. Highly recommended! I loved it!<br /><br />Source of Book: Purchased<br /><br />And I have to mention that this book trailer is one of the most compelling I have seen yet.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'll be honest, the first time I watched this movie, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen, while my friend (who recommended we watch it together) was laughing his head off.  I realized that it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just wasn't getting it.  I was expecting some really silly slapstick power comedy.  I really thought to myself I never ever want to see this movie again.  Fast forward a few months later, and I end up forced to sit through it again.  I think during that time I had seen a couple more movies with Jon Heder which I really enjoyed, like \\"School for Scoundrels\\" and \\"The Benchwarmers.\\"  So I guess I had become accustomed to his acting.  I couldn't believe that I was finding this movie entertaining the second time around.  I guess I was a little bit looser and more open-minded than I was the first time.  It's not one of those comedies that make you laugh until your side hurts, and your face muscles are fatigued from smiling.  But Jon Heder's dorkiness does grow on you after a while.  I think if you go into this movie without expecting too much as far as comedy or story line, because there basically isn't any, and you have an open mind, you'll probably be ok.  Otherwise you may be feeling the same way I felt the first time.  This is a pretty decent flick if you don't really have anything better to do, or if you want to be watching TV, but there's nothing on... except maybe this movie on FX or USA.  Because once you start watching it, it's kinda hard to pull away from it, because of the \\"I can't believe I'm actually watching this crap\\" phenomenon.  This is supposed to be entertainment, not meant to be a seemingly \\"true to life\\" story or characters.  Because it is anything but that.  No one is this dorky you would think, but you know, somewhere out there in the world, there probably is and you just don't know them.  It is meant to push the boundarys of dorkiness, dweebiness, and stupidity.  Take it for what it's worth, and don't expect anything deep, or real, or yes you will indeed be disappointed.  As much as this movie has grown on me, I didn't have the heart to give it 5 stars, but I do \\"like\\" the movie.
159514188X|5.0|Hannah Baker leaves a series of tapes explaining why she committed suicide. The tapes are passed around, per her directions, to people who had a part in her decision. Clay Jensen narrates the story, and guides the reader through her narrative as he listens to the tapes (she and Clay shared a brief moment of intimacy before she died). This is a moving story about the effects that our actions can have on others, no matter how seemingly minor the actions are to us. This book challenged the way I treat others.
0811875040|2.0|I like the book and all, but I'm disappointed that there was a card just stuck in the book with corrections on recipes that should have been edited properly in the first place. It makes me question what else might be wrong throughout the book. I guess I should have paid attention to other reviews, because I wouldn't have bought it.  Other than that major flaw, the book is OK. Only OK. If you're a new baker, look for easier, less fussy recipes.
014241493X|5.0|Quentin Jacobsen has idolized and secretly loved Margo Roth Spiegelman ever since they discovered a dead body together when they were nine years old. They disconnect after this event, even though they are neighbors, and \\"Q\\" spends his teenage years admiring Margo and her exploits from afar. One night, shortly before their high school graduation, she shows up at his window. They go on an all-night adventure, pulling pranks and breaking into Sea World. When Margo goes missing the next day, Quentin and his friends find a series of clues, left by Margo. He begins his obssesive search to find her, culminating in a road trip to New York with his friends Radar, Ben, and Lacey. Through this quest, he learns that his idealized notions about Margo aren't necessarily true, and he obtains a better understanding of himself through the prism of Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\". Eventually he finds her, and realizes that sometimes its better to leave alone what we want the most, because we cannot completely understand what lies within the heart of another. Outstanding book!
B0041KKYGU|4.0|I just saw it in a theater today ($1 on Tuesdays for these second run films).    I'd read the mixed reviews here on Amazon before I went and wasn't sure what to expect.  Turns out I enjoyed it.  Perfectly good way to pass 90 minutes of time.  Certainly far more enjoyable than many other films I've had the misfortune of seeing.    No, it's not going to be critically acclaimed nor go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time remembered by future generations.  But I sure don't care.  I just wanted an enjoyable comedy and this certainly gave me what I wanted.    In addition to being funny, it was actually rather sweet how Diaz's character comes to finds that love is more important than money, falling in love with a low-paid teacher who will never give her the vast pile of cash she previously thought so vital.    I can see why snobbish critics would dislike it.  It's not dark, depressing, and so dull you'd like to shoot yourself just to get it over with.

When we get so see Audrey in My Fair Lady on Blu-ray  (which is coming out soon) I hope it looks this nice.

B005MF1O5S|2.0|Is it me or are the shows starting to lack imagination and intrigue? I love sci fi and have been a fan of Dr Who for many decades but this show I found totally forgettable and this season a step down from previous ones. I'm hoping I'm wrong or that the season picks up soon, but I'm worried.   I think the current Doctor is excellent and Amy a babe, but the whole Rory-Amy relationship just slaps me in the face every week as unbelievable. And when they drone on about their undying love for each other (when we all know that if he was the last male in the universe she would still have a hard time even going out with him) it just ruins it for me.   The great thing about the Doctor and Rose was that their love was unspoken but unmistakable. That is not the case between these two. I think they need get rid of Rory and get their imaginations back in gear.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I wasn't sure how I would react to a movie about surfing.I wasn't sure how I would react to a movie about a surfing shark attack! But I discovered that surfing is not the real story of this wonderful surfing-loving family.  The whole family surfs and lives in the waves of Hawaii. When I purchased \\"SOUL SURFER\\" I knew there would be a shark attack scene and I was not sure I would appreciate such a horrendous scene. Yet when it happened in the movie the scene was so well shot and expertly directed that I was not grossed out! The beautiful star AnnaSophia Robb playing the lead role was utterly convincing as Bethany Hamilton.  The entire cast of AnnaSophia Robb, Helen Hunt, Carrie Underwood, and Dennis Quaid perform actual surfing scenes in a God-caring family life. This true story should be shown in churches and Sunday schools throughout the land. Get this movie for your family.

When you watch this movie you are in disbelief of whats going on, its a acid trip of todays popular culture, its like watching an arcade game brought to life in a movie. Its imaginary and different I must say, a harmless movie even if its an odd one.
0553807919|4.0|Overall I liked the book.  At times I found my thoughts drifting off while reading it.  Parts of it were stuffy and a little boring.  I did learn from it, though.  I learned a lot about how the brain functions, sometimes more than I really wanted.  There was a considerable amount of information to take in for such a small book.  I probably would have given it a lower rating if it wasn't for the back of the book.  I loved the charts in the back!  That is where I found the book to be the most helpful.  It spelled out situations and how to handle them for each age category.  I tried engaging the emotional side of a three-year old in the middle of a tantrum.  Nope!  Didn't work!  I'm sure this will take some time to implement.  So, don't expect instant changes.  Like anything else, these things take time.  I really found the illustrations to be annoying.  They look like they were drawn by a young child.  I just skipped them entirely.  I would have liked them better if they had hired a professional illustrator and made the writing easier to read.  Stick to the writing and let someone skilled in art do the illustrations.  I may have missed a lot by not being able to tolerate the illustrations.    I did come away from this book with a better understanding of how the brain works overall.  I can see using this information in all my relationships, not just with children.  So, I'd say it's worth buying.
0618918248|1.0|I'm a Christian who read this book largely out of curiosity and I thoroughly enjoyed.  Upon completing it I also read Christopher Hitchens \\"The Portable Atheist\\" and and had the same reaction: great writers, but thoroughly unconvincing.  Upon reading these works, one can't but help to get the feeling that their atheism, and their pure hatred of God and Christians in general, informs their science much more than their science informs their atheism.  Take this straw man that Dawkins sets up in his book:  \\"However statistically improbable the entity you seek to explain by invoking a designer, the designer himself has got to be at least as improbable.\\"    In other words, since creationists think that life is too complex to have arisen randomly (as the Darwinian materialists claim), any creator would necessarily be at least as, if not more, complex than the life you seek to explain.  According to Dawkins, any creator must contain at least as much information as what it creates (e.g. the universe, life, etc...) and information is inversely correlated to probability.  So, any God that could create everything would be too complex to be probable.  No wonder Dawkins is an atheist.  His \\"god\\" is too small to believe in.    Can we not infer that any eternal, omnipotent, omniscient being with the ability to create life might in fact be infinitely complex and that the low probability that Dawkins posits says nothing more than that this being is unique (there is but one God), thereby accepting both the creator's infinite complexity and Dawkins' almost null probability?  Dawkins never considers that possibility, again he begins with his atheism and works back from there.        Or, perhaps the reality is just the opposite.  Maybe Dawkins' assumption of complexity breeding complexity is fallacious.  Thomas Aquinas believed that God was simple, with no composition.  Perhaps part of the beauty of God is His simplicity; a spirit, after all, has no parts.  What better illustration of Occam's razor could exist?
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sometimes it hard to pick a good book from a list, but this time it worked and I was not disappointed. This was a very touching story where you really can relate to the characters and really have a better understanding of the tragedy of WWII. Just when you think the story is going to end (and when it probably would with any other author!) the author gives you more so you're not left still wondering where the characters lives take them! I will def recommend this book to others, a great read!

0316056863|5.0|Oh my gosh, this was one of the funniest books that I have read all year. I'm a big Tina Fey fan. I loved her on Saturday Night Live and every time Mean Girls or Baby Mama come on TV, I have to sit down and watch. I don't watch 30 Rock but after reading this I might have to give it a go. Tina Fey is probably the most funniest woman there is. And this book showcases her talents to a tee.<br /><br />I knew that I was going to love this book almost immediately. In the first few pages, Fey references that the reader might know her from Mean Girls, which can probably be found on TBS at that very moment. This was drink spitting hilarious because I swear every time on the TV this is so true!!! It was all uphill from there for me. Page after page, Fey writes essays about her childhood, her teenage years, college, early jobs, marriage, getting into the entertainment business, her days at SNL, her leaving to start 30 Rock, her experience as being Sarah Palin, and what it's like to be a mom. The essays are in chronological order in terms of Fey's life. Sprinkled throughout the book are pictures of Fey throughout the years, some serious, some not but the captions are excellent as well.<br /><br />One of my favorite essays was her honeymoon trip on a cruise ship that went horribly wrong. Several of my friends had just returned from a cruise trip when I read this book so all I could think about was what if this had happened to them. Also I actually really enjoyed the Sarah Palin chapter because I had always wanted to know what Fey's reaction behind the scenes was really like during that time period.<br /><br />There are some times when Fey does get serious. She talks about her relationship with her father. There is mention of the slashing incident that caused the scar on her face (which I totally never realized until I read it) which she only brought up to not mention again. Fey also talks about the sexism and prejudice she's had to battle in the workplace. It's starting to no longer be just a man's world in the entertainment industry but it's still hard to get by if you're a woman. While she does crack a lot of jokes and is sarcastic at times, I never felt at any time that she was purposefully insulting anyone.<br /><br />Overall, I totally loved this book. Fey has shown time and time again, that she is a comic genius and I'm not ashamed to say I'm on the Tina Fey bandwagon. If you are a fan of her or just in need of a good laugh, I highly recommend picking up this book. If you can't crack even one smile, I think you need to go look for your sense of humor. This was great fun to read and I had a blast laughing myself to exhaustion.the entertainment industry but it's still hard to get by if you're a woman.

0061928356|5.0|Secret Daughter is a beautifully written novel which took me two sittings to read.  I love the character of Asha (Usha) since she seems to have more insight and open-mindedness than either of her parents have.  Asha was adopted by Somer and Krishnan Thakkar, two physicians from America, from an Indian orphanage after she was placed there at three-days-old by her Indian parents, Jasu and Kavita Merchant.  This was their second baby girl, and rather than kill this one because she wasn't a boy, as Jasu's relative had killed the first daughter, they gave up Usha for a better life for her.  Unable to have children, Somer and Krishnan go to India and adopt the baby, changing her name to Asha.  Krishnan is Indian and his family is still there.  Kavita will hold guilt for giving up this child for the rest of her life, even though she and Jasu have a son, Vijay.  Asha will eventually want to know who her biological parents are and Somer doesn't take kindly to the idea, feeling somewhat of a failure at motherhood herself. Krishnan feels the opposite, that it is only natural that Asha should want to find her biological family.  Asha wins a grant to travel to India to work with the newspaper in Mumbai, since she is a student doing extremely well in journalism in college.    I thought that Asha's time in India was the best part of the book.  I loved how she slowly assimilated herself into her father's family and became the apple of her grandparents' eye.  There were cultural differences to overcome on both sides, but each lovingly did so. There is also a lot to learn about Indian culture throughout the book.   More than anything else, this book is about family, and what people will do for each other.  I gave this one five stars because I really loved reading it and I enjoyed it so much that I think it deserves nothing less.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Good game that starts off really easy and then becomes almost impossible instantly. A little depressing since there's about a million levels left to play but you can't get early ones unlocked due to the difficulty. Definitely a thinking game and a good idea... just gets a bit too challenging a bit too fast.
0316077046|5.0|The Caster Chronicles is quickly becoming one of those series that will stick out like a sore thumb on my bookshelf with its worn covers and cracked spines from countless times of rereading. Beautiful Creatures piqued my interest from page one as we were introduced to the unusual occurrences that took place in a small town where, supposedly, nothing ever happens. I was ecstatic that I bought the first two books at the same time, and immediately moved on to Beautiful Darkness, a title that suits the contents perfectly.<br /><br />I love everything about this book from the characters to the plot down to the writing style.. The authors, Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, are incredible writers, period. The webwork of planning they have put in to these novels is astounding. Rather than just telling a story, they *show* the reader with their intricate details, vivid imaginations, strong characters, right down to their beautiful use of words.<br /><br />The  characters are the most important piece of this story as everything else revolves around them. No matter how minor a role a character plays, they are portrayed in such a way that you can't help but feel connected to them. Uncle Macon fulfills his reputation as a mysterious recluse with countless secrets (maybe not the secrets everyone originally thought, but he's always hiding something, nonetheless). Amma, one of my favorite characters, is resilient and, quite frankly, a little scary, but is always there for Ethan, despite her scolding and The Look. Link, Ethan's best friend, is so lovable that you never want him to go away, inflated ego and all. And yes, even Ridley, with her lollipop sucking evilness grows to become a character we can't wait to learn more about. You can differentiate each character by their distinct personalities (probably one of my favorite aspects - nothing irks me more than characters who are all the same but given different names), and they each grow as individuals in different ways, adding such unbelievable flavor to the main story.<br /><br />Ahh, but what about the two main characters, Lena and Ethan? There is nothing magical or supernaturally exceptional about Ethan - he's just a regular human, `all-American' guy.. His only power is his will - his determination to save Lena despite the consequences. He's a great guy, but he's not perfect and makes mistakes like the rest of us, making him a character we can believe and sympathize with. Lena is another story altogether. She's basically a big ball of confusion and wrought emotions in this novel as she tries to figure out who she is - \\"Look at me Ethan. Am I Dark or am I Light?\\". Ethan knows who and what she is, and this is another element of his power as he does everything short of giving his life for her to make her see what he sees. Lena makes sacrifices for him as well, as you will see, but they come in a different form - one Ethan refuses to accept.<br /><br />The plot is so complex that I'm not even sure what to say about it other than it just completely involves you. There is a reason for every single thing that happens - no word, sentence, or paragraph is a waste of space - everything is relevant and connected in some way.<br /><br />Because of the intricacy of the plot, there are so many emotions involved, many of which are difficult to deal with for both the characters and the readers, but that's what makes this novel so *beautiful*. As I've said, the title fits the contents perfectly.<br /><br />The writing style of this novel is almost poetic. The way the authors use words, well, there's nothing simple about it. It grabs your attention and gets your mind working - needless to say, I absolutely adore it. I'll just give you a sample, and you can see what I mean for yourself:<br /><br />\\"There was no one color that could paint Lena Duchannes. She was a red sweater and a blue sky, a gray wind and a silver sparrow, a black curl escaping from behind her ear.\\"<br /><br />You have to read the whole bookto know what a lot of that means, but once you do, you'll see the beauty I've been raving about.<br /><br />Maybe I'm a little biased, which many say shouldn't be included in a review (something I don't wholeheartedly agree with myself), but if you love a book, why not say so? **I love this book**<br /><br />Happy Reading Everyone :)een raving about.

0393064476|4.0|I too found the lone star negative review too narrowly argued, and throw my own four stars into the pot. Judging by Maureen Corrigan's recent NPR review, Greenblatt's THE SWERVE has an interest well beyond his possibly shaky claim that Lucretius sudden availability sparked the Renaissance revival of scientific humanism. More importantly, those who will now want to read Lucretius may do so in a splendid verse translation by Alicia Stalling (Penguin, 2006). Stallings was awarded a MacArthur two days ago. Her brilliance as a translator, as well her talents as a wise and scintillating poet, who knows how to bring home rhyme after rhyme, and bon mot after bon mot, out of left field is widely respected.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I've seen the rave reviews, read the raving threads and got the sample but didn't read it. That much hype over something always raises my hackles on something being up. But to my utter surprise the great reviews really ARE true.<br /><br />I'm really in shock over how much I loved this book. I read this book from about 1am until 6am pausing and squealing and laughing because it was crazy how much I was enjoying it. Yes, their relationship is eyebrow raising and co-dependent but it's SO entertaining and a good read it's easy to overlook that.<br /><br />Freshman Abby Abernathy came to college to escape her past and start fresh. Complete with a conservative look and disposition Abby feels that by being miles away and a seemingly different person her past can simply just slip away.<br /><br />That is until one night she walks into Eastern University's version of Fight Club.<br /><br />Accompanying her best friend America and her boyfriend Shepley (the names Shepley and America knowing as Mare had be rolling my eyes. Those were just stupid as sin for character names), Abby walks into a shocking underworld of illegal ring-fighting right on campus. Intrigued by the chaos, Abby moves forward and forward so she can literally get a ring side seat but instead she gets doused in blood. Reigning Eastern U fight champion Travis Maddox spots Abby immediately with he conservative white cardigan and is amused by her dress but interested in her looks. But Abby's not like the girls he's use to. She doesn't fall for his lines and is serious when she says she won't sleep with him. But oddly enough, that's fine with Travis because he immediately likes her moxie in resisting him. He immediately wants to be around her as a friend liking that he can actually be friends with a real girl.<br /><br />Helping her study, going bowling, watching TV and just talking has them developing a lasting friendship that's truly platonic but the talk of the entire school despite them both admitting over and over that's it's just friends. Travis Maddox doesn't \\"talk\\" to a girl. He screws them and that's it. But quickly Travis realizes that he's in love with Abby because she's his other half. The one who makes him sane, makes everything right with her presence and truly sees him as just Travis and not Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox the campus infamous fighter. But her friendship means too much to him to jeopardize it. But his jealously starts to show when other guys take note of Abby's looks and personality.<br /><br />Abby doesn't \\"want\\" to be with Travis because he represents everything she left for college. The drinking, smoking, gambling, the whole thing but she's drawn to his anyway.<br /><br />Regardless of his possessive tendencies, Travis was completely genuine to me. He disgusted me with his manwhore ways and having a threesome in the apartment with Abby there and his drunken benders but it's obvious he's a psychiatrist's wet dream. Travis has issues that come out when he drinks but sober he's normal just temperamental. Despite being disgueted by the threesome and him being willing to sleep with ANY thing with an opening I knew that he would drop it all for Abby.<br /><br />Abby on the other hand was extremely wishy-washy. She played Travis too much IMO. He landed all his cards on the table yet she kept dangling and yanking his strings. Everyone kept saying that Abby was too good for Travis but with her behavior I thought he was too good for her. Their consummation of whatever they were irked me because Abby KNEW Travis had literally slept with the entire school yet she has no problem having sex with him. Condom or no condom she wasn't smart to let him stick it in without a full STD screening. Despite Travis being militant on condom usage with his daily skanks. That was just irresponsible to me.<br /><br />Abby annoyed me towards the end with her bad and forth, wishy-washy personality. Travis was consistent and I loved him for that. Overall, the pacing was good. I LOVED how it ended and with the way it all turned out I could absolutely see it as a movie but movies lately tend to ruin the books. Authors just sell their stories to the fist people who offer and then the casting gets screwed up with HORRIBLE actors and an even more HORRIBLE script (the Twilight movies anyone?).<br /><br />I truly hope there won't be a sequel because it ended on the perfect note for their relationship and in a direction I wasn't expecting but LOVED. With the ups and downs, wishy washy attitude of Abby and the consistent, destructive yet well meaning personality of Travis, their impulsiveness in the end is fitting and I don't want a sequel to ruin that.<br /><br />Overall, take it from one VERY VERY picky and skeptical reader when I say you will LOVE this book. The pacing, the lack of stupid misunderstandings (any problems they have are always revealed and screamed out leaving no room for misunderstandings that ruin perfectly good books ALL the time.<br /><br />5 stars without a doubt for my overall feelings about the book. Some parts I rolled my eyes, some parts I huffed at but overall, I loved the story and Travis as the hero made up for any huffing and eye rolling I did because of Abby. I haven't felt this giddy about a book, especially a contemporary one in a LONG, LONG time.

B001HN6922|1.0|My three year old son LOVED the first movie.  About one hour into this one he was ready to leave the theater and so was I!  This movie is geared toward older children.  It's a shame because the first movie was so sweet and this one is not sweet at all....it's like a demented James Bond movie.
B000Q66JXA|1.0|Before ordering the Blu-Ray release of Excalibur, I had only ever seen parts of this film on TV, and each such glimpse left me cold. On the strength of friends' recommendations, and other sources of praise, I decided to finally watch it. I am normally quite forgiving of items in a rarefied genre, but watching this, I wanted an apology.<br /><br />The Presentation:<br />The Blu-Ray itself is well done, with images as crisp as one might expect, clear sound, and decent extras. In that regard, however, it is worth noting that the commentary is another of the sort which spends far too much time discussing the story (which you can plainly see unfolding before you) and far too little time offering insight into design and direction choices.<br /><br />The Content:<br />Dreadful.<br />Although most significant elements from popular sources of the Arthurian legend appear in one form or another, it would seem that Britain in this Arthur's time was plagued with hearing loss as virtually everyone goes about shouting their lines rather than delivering them. Costume design from the armour to the court attire - even for a movie devoted to the more fantastic/mystical elements of the Arthur legend - is mired in the ridiculous. It does not make this approach easier to swallow that Camelot is coated in silver and gold lame.<br /><br />The worst problem is that the film does not really seem to have any sense of direction. It does not really tell us the story of any particular character, any particular theme, or any particular idea. Instead, watching Excalibur, one is left with the idea that the screen writers and director had no real idea what the tale encompasses, and assumed that in filming the highlights of action and interaction in some semblance of sequence, that these greater things would be translated on their own.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My 2 month old loves this mobile. Everyday in the morning hours he loves to play with this, he feels so happy looking at the animals. He screams and shouts in happiness. Me and my husband feel so good about the mobile. Especially we love the remote and start the music when it switches off, from the bed itself. There are not many features in the remote, it just switches off or on, but literally that's all u need. Simple is sweet! The music is very soothing. I would highly recommend this product and it is definitely worth the money.

1601251505|3.0|This book is pretty cool.  The art style is consistent, but not really my thing.  I guess I prefer the more traditional character art found in older RPG core books, like the AD&D book, but I'm sure that many would love the art found in this book.  Lots of spells in this book, but not a single creature.  I guess your expected to either come up with all of the creature stats on your own are shell out another $40 to buy the bestiary.  Additionally it seems like most of the book is spent describing how to do magic items, and artifacts and find a good price for them.  Character classes and level progression has been much improved over D&D3.5 and the backwards-compatibility of Pathfinder with D&D rules is really nice.<br /><br />If you want a really good RPG with the D20 system you need to get this book.  Otherwise, if you're like me and the D20 system isn't really your thing I don't suggest this book.  There are other RPG books out there with way more bang for your buck.

068485743X|5.0|I have never written a book for publication. Well - that is not quite true. I wrote one once long ago that was immature and frankly boring, and was rightly rejected once and I never tried again! Since then I have not found time to produce a better effort.   With all that out in the open, I can say I am reviewing this book as an interested reader rather than a (currently) aspiring writer. Although had I read this book back in the day I wrote my one manuscript, I would have produced something very different.   To be clear, this book is not a manual on how to write a book. The author's advice there is really just to get on and write! But this book focuses on how to get your book noticed and thus published. For this purpose I can think of no better book.   Speaking with the experience of having been an editor and then an agent, the author brings real world experience of what it is like to work through a large pile of manuscripts, and the tricks of the trade that are used to whittle that list down to something manageable. His advice is that a book must grab the reader in the first five pages, and avoid some key and common stylistic errors in order to get noticed. (Other tricks on piquing an editor's interest are included too).   Some will consider this advice and say \\"well that just means that good stories are getting rejected without being read\\". And the answer there is presumably: \\"yes, they are. But follow this advice and yours won't be one of them\\".   For an aspiring writer this, I think, is a must read. I have, in fact, recommended it to several people who have told me they wish they could get books published, and I will keep recommending it unless and until I find something better. But I am not holding my breath.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a big knife. Not something you would want wear around everyday. It's huge. Great for camping! Sturdy, beefy and very sharp. I bought mine from a local dealer because I wanted to see and touch it before purchasing. I wanted to see how big it was and how the handle felt.  The handle does feel a little too smooth. I bought the Micarta handles from Tomar Ka-bar. The Micarta handles are really better for gripping the knife. Micarta is a man made material of pressure treated linen in epoxy. It can be sanded and shaped.
0439023521|5.0|This is good science fiction - a future dystopian American society filled with inequality and a Capitol that keeps the various districts of the nation's populace in check through, among other things, a deadly televised game in which young people compete against each other, and the last one standing wins fame, glory and honour. The young people chosen for the games are called the \\"tribute\\", and although volunteers are allowed, the nature of the games is such that most people are chosen by lot.   But when the lot falls upon the younger sister of Katniss Everdeen, she volunteers to take her sister's place. And so she is pitched headlong into the hunger games which is a cross between reality TV, gladiatorial combat, Aztec games, Mad Max's thunderdome and who knows what else.   The theme is a powerful but dark one. This is a young adult book rather than a children's book and looking at the basic concept, I was not sure I would like this. There is too much potential for a gory kind of horror story. But in fact this book is not that at all. Instead it is a powerful and moving story, which - like all the best science fiction - reflects upon us now as much as it does the future.   There are a number of connections between this future world and ancient Rome, which given the themes seems to be quite deliberate. But all in all this is an original tale and written with a powerful prose that kept me reading almost without a break until I finished the book.  One scene in particular was very moving indeed. I cam away from the story thinking it was a very human book, and one to set me thinking about what it tells us about our society today.   All in all and excellent work, and I will certainly be buying the sequel soon
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm not a snob about these films but there's a point where all the narcissistic tinkering ends up being disrespectful to the cast, crew, directors, writers, and countless people that actually worked on the films, as well as the fan base. With a wave of his digital wand, Lucas overwrites the hard work that many talented people put into these films and the creative decisions they made at the time. I plan to vote with my dollar and hold out for an unaltered original version.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have had this flash for 3.5 years now.  I originally got it as a present with my D40 and it has been fantastic and I haven't had a need for anything else until recently. I have racked up THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of triggers with this unit with zero issues. This flash is pretty powerful for such a small package!  To give you an idea I have been using it to light huge rooms in million dollar mansions in Princeton NJ! I recently switched careers from Networking to Photography and I currently do real estate photography in Princeton.  These houses have huge rooms and super high ceilings and this flash has been doing me well.  I have been using it cranked up to full power though with flash compensation on my D90 +1 and only now has its limits shown themselves.  I am investing in off camera flashes and something more powerful but this flash has gotten me here and I can't say anything bad about it.<br /><br />The flash flips up vertically,  awesome.  It only uses 2 AA batts,  awesome.  It's light, awesome.  There is no thinking involved to use this flash.  Turn the flash compensation up or down if needed, its a solid unit.  I would invest in the Stofen diffuser to get the light all around you, it is worth the few bucks and fits perfectly.<br /><br />If you want more info on it (or more preaching as it seems sometimes) check out Ken Rockwell's site, (just google it) he is a pompous arse and Nikon fan boy buy I skip over his \\"opinions\\" and use his site for getting examples, tech specs etc.<br /><br />I recommend using rechargeable NiMh batteries in this unit.  Alkalines will work good and last a decent while but the Nimh's recycle faster, have a larger capacity and don't heat up after repeated use that bad.  I have used the Engergizer Lithitums in this unit and while shooting houses walking around the batteries release their charge so fast they would get hot enough to deform the plastic casing around the outside of the battery and made the flash very hot.  I would not recommend using the lithiums for fear of damaging the unit.  The same use with NiMh's did not have the same results,  batteries were warm at best.<br /><br />For the price this is fantastic flash and if you even care remotely about the quality of your pics get it,  the pop up flashes on all cameras is basically worthless for useful lighting.  This unit is light and easy to use and I don't mind lugging around my D90 with grip loaded with 2 batteries and this flash.fear of damaging the unit.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've loved Star Wars ever since I discovered my older brother's action figures. We must have rented the movies a million times. They never got old. When Luca$ decided to release the movies to theaters, I was 11. I was excited to see them on the movie screen for the first time. There was so much that I didn't get to see on the old video tapes. On top of that, new special effects.   The difference between 11 and 26 is huge. I miss the movies of my childhood. I don't care anymore about CGI Jabba or how he added scenes. I miss the original trilogy. The new movies leave me cold. I'm old enough to appreciate how the new footage and changes destroy the original flow of the films. Lucas doesn't care about quality movies anymore. He hates the original trilogy. Instead he focuses on the Prequels and the army of yes men who basically treat him as a mastermind, instead of the shell he is.  What happened is be grew old. Like Wendy in Peter Pan, he is unable to experience the wonder he once did. The new movies are written by an old man who forgot what it is to be young. He decides to tinker with a legend, unaware he is becoming a laughing stock to the public in media. Where he was once a daring filmmaker who had a vision no one believed in, he now trades on his former glory, surrounded by yes-men while he milks the fans for all the money they can. Toys, crappy video games, awful expanded universe books. He tinkers with the movies to sanitize them for young kids. He turned his back on the people who helped make the original trilogy great.   Now we have the blu-ray set. With little Anakin proudly on the cover. He prefers this version, the one he has complete control over. He probably giggles has he adds CGI rocks and changes voices creating what in his mind is a great product. He is wrong. The sad truth is, he could have put the theatrical versions in the set and avoided any mess. No one would have cared. Instead he takes revisionist history to a near 1984 level. He truly believesthat he always planned for this to happen. He refuses to admit he made most of it up as he went along. The new generation believes him. My niece will grow up thinking Star Wars is clones, Anakin and bloody Jar Jar. That makes me want to vomit.  I will not be purchasing this set. I saw the deleted scenes from the classic movies on you tube. I will stick with the unaltered trilogy. Maybe someday he will see the light and release the movies we all remember. I don't care if it is alongside the new edits with a CGI tree or something. The only way I can stomach Star Wars anymore is by acknowledging the parts that make me feel like I'm watching classic cinema. Sadly this is not this set.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app gives a unique perspective to everything! Even the smallest details are brought out in a way that gives the picture more shape and definition. It's also a lot of fun to play with.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Give this show some Emmy love!!! This season was fallover-in-convulsions funny! Superb characters/acting. Buy it on DVD so you can watch over and over cause you're gonna miss some things in the manic fast-pace of genius.
B004FEFZU2|5.0|Being the owner of all the series plus the arrival of 3D BluRay techology to my living room, the words are small compared to the results given by this movie. Saw 3D gives us a new way to enjoy the puzzles of Jigsaw, the adrenaline goes high enough to keep you on your seat for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I' will recommend getting this movie to all Saw movie fans as this one is the last piece of the puzzle and gives us a finish line to all. With great acting plus new dilemas.<br /><br />Video quality is at his best on the BluRay on both 2D and 3D, but to really enjoy it I recommend the 3D version of it, the enclosed DVD covers the movie perfect. Audio is crystal clear and keeps you waiting for the intriging line wich gives Saw the linage it always delivers.
B005DZMODI|5.0|It is amazing how Eric Clapton always is able to reinvent himself, with style and good productivity. This album is amazing, 5 stars !
B005COO1X6|2.0|\\"Mile 81\\" by Stephen King (Scribner, 2011), is simply ridiculous. Twice I stopped reading it to read a self-published debut horror novel by an unknown author.<br /><br />It's a long short story, more of a novella really, that details the events surrounding an abandon rest stop along I-95 at mile marker eighty-one. It begins with a ten-year-old boy who finds a bottle of Vodka therein, and we are treated to his thoughts in detail as he looks at pictures of naked women. Eventually he falls asleep and the story then becomes about a human-eating alien disguised as a broken down car that drifts into the rest stop and munches on several adults who come near enough to touch it.<br /><br />Stephen King frequently gets dirty with his child characters. This is evident throughout his work even from the eighties. Why he also feels the need to have this child looking at dirty pictures and drinking vodka when it seems to have no particular purpose within the story is beyond me. But when it comes to King, a lot of what he writes is beyond me.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book unless, like me, you have been following King for a long time and just feel duty-bound to read whatever he publishes. At the back of this novella is an excerpt from his upcoming novel, \\"11/22/63,\\" and it seems the writing in that is quite good. So, I suppose come November when it's released, we may get a chance to read some of King's best work yet. But \\"Mile 81\\" is not it.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This has an excellent duet with the late Amy Winehouse. She really was an excellent singer, with original vocals, and she takes it to another level with the Tony Bennett duet ! Awesome 5 stars !
B004ULEEY8|4.0|This movie was great! Bought it for my husband but it's not one of those guy flicks I enjoyed it as well. A must see!!!!
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|Ana Popovic may not be the best blues guitarist around, but she always puts out a fine album of music and taste !
B0040JHF28|5.0|Initially and by mistake I responded to an Amazon message invitating me to review this item which I had purchased but it had not arrived within the estimated deadline.  I gave it a bad review thinking I was being asked about the service, not the product. The CD finally arrived, with much delay but in good shape.  I have listened to it and it is my pleasure to rectify my review.  The album is great.  Strauss lieder tend grow on you and they do reward repeated listening.  Just think of the four last songs.  They also require a special soprano performer: lyric and sweet but with a firm, confident vocal line.  Sentimentally dramatic without being bathetic.  Damrau fits the bill like to other singer since Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.  Don't miss it.
B003S897UK|5.0|The Gov' are heavy in influences and heavy in sounds. An awesome 5 stars to having bought this album !
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I was really looking forward to this as people had been raving about it. With such a deep and well done book as the template, how could it go wrong? Well, I wouldn't say that it \\"went wrong\\", but it's definitely not the best version out there. I think this one failed to show a budding romance, which is the key to the story. Nothing else works if there is no angst and love. They SAY they love each other, but the actors never show this. It's a good modern interpretation for someone who doesn't like long movies (the best one is much longer and more detailed), subtlety, or traditionally English movies. That, however, was NOT what I was looking for in Jane Eyre.
B0055S348W|1.0|So glad that I didn't pay for this app. I down loaded this when it was the FAOD and tried it out by having something print via google cloud and nothing, until 4 days later while I was watching tv all of a sudden my printer starts to print and it was what I had attempted to print via google cloud.  I have been printing via google cloud since and the jobs print when I send them so it leaves me to believe it is this app that is SLOW.  Don't waste your money on this.
B005E7AOHI|4.0|Over ten years ago I purchased 'Anti-Pop' and I was not happy with the product, with Tom Morello and Fred Durst(lol) contributing it truly didn't feel like a Primus album.  Now here's Green Naugahyde, and I forgive Les and friends for 'Anti-Pop'. This album hits you right from the start with that classic Primus sound, you can even say 'old school'. These songs are funky, psychedelic and the drummer and guitarist are insane next to Claypool's bass. There are a few songs on this album that reminded me of 'Mr.Bungle', with the carnival circus feel to it, the album flows expertly and no track have I skipped yet or will. Primus fans rejoice, the 11 year wait is over, get this album.  Key Tracks:  -Eternal Consumption Engine  -Tragedy's a'Comin  -Moron TV  -Last Salmon Man  -Eyes Of The Squirrel  -HOINFODAMAN  -Lee Van Cleef  -Extinction Burst  -  ENJOY!!! -

B003ZSJ212|1.0|------EDIT - I broke down and bought this. Changing review to reflect updated thoughts.<br />---Since reviews are clumped together, this is a review for the blu ray set of all 6---<br />Why did I change my mind? To own all 6 in HD. Will they be the ones I watch? Probably never, but they'll be on the shelf.<br />This review has been revised, just like the historical, original versions of the original movies, haha. See that? Easy. This isn't the review you were looking for anyway. Move along ;)<br /><br />Even \\"Episode 1\\" has been changed from its theatrical version. Lame. Don't know about EP2. Probably changed. I think EP3 is the least messed with from what I've read.<br /><br />Sad how much the original 3 have been messed with over the years. Someday, (I hope) we'll see a real HD transfer of the ORIGINAL movies, even the prequels. Just unbelievable the amount of silly little things have been tweaked. It also seems a little disrespectful to all the folks who worked so hard on the old non-digital effects.<br /><br />Still holding on to my 2006 DVDs, as they do contain the ORIGINAL movies (IV-VI anyway).<br />Not happy with any of the changes made over the years. Pointless. All of it.<br /><br />About the only positive things about this set are<br />1) Discs should work<br />2) Tons of bonus material<br />3) Blu ray discs scratch less easily<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) I don't think any of the movies are in their theatrical, original versions. No option for this. Lame.<br />2) Color manipulation is horrible in places. Maybe it looks perfect on some super-special THX test theater setup?<br />3) Sound changes / additions are pointless. Darth screaming \\"nooo\\" ...really?????<br />4) Destroys the memory of the originals, as so many details have changed.<br />5) Includes 3 rather bad movies, but tons of bonus material. What can you do.<br />6) 1997 - tons of changes made. 2004 - more random changes made. 2011 - more random changes made. That makes this the what, 5th edition orsomething? How much is enough?<br /><br />It's really simple. Not a problem to revise, add *good* changes (maybe if they did a better job on color correction, for example). Heck, do what you want. Everyone's problem is quite simple - there is not really any *good* version of the originals available anymore. The 2006 DVD were the last disc based way to get these, and they were limited edition. Non-anamorphic \\"postage stamp\\" style (letteroboxed inside a 4:3 window) DVDs are kind of a let down in this era of widescreen.<br /><br />I think that if there were one *good* last true original format of the movies, it wouldn't be as big of a deal. They could have even done a cheap upscale of the originals in DVD form as a bonus here, in proper aspect ratio, and that would probably have made most people quite happy to have even a slightly better than 2006 DVD version included here.<br /><br />Someday, I really hope a good \\"4k\\" or better scan is done of the originals, and that they're released to the public. It's a shame that this heavily manipulated blu ray is now the only available format of such a classic.
0393317552|5.0|It's been a while since I read the book but was astonished the average user rating for it was 4 stars. The book has some misnomers and speculative spots. Overall, though, the gist of the book flows throughout and he proves his point. The only thing I disagree wholeheartedly about the book is his decision to exclude religion from its title. He provides sufficient proof in the book that religion had a major effect on the development of human societies and should have included it.
B004HW7JMY|3.0|This prequel is beautifully filmed (mostly CGI), like the Spartacus-Blood/Sand sereies, lot's of eye candy.  The fight scenes are still very \\"300\\",but the acting and the plot are lame. They add softcore porn, when ever the episode starts to loose steam or try to \\"shock\\" you.  The main actor Andy whitfield was very good and one of the reason to watch, but with him gone (may he rest in peace),it seems John Hannah and \\"Zena\\" can't carry the series.  Too much  weekday noon soap opera. Hopefully if there is a third season they will have better scripts and actors.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Having just watched the film I couldn't help but say, I wish I had the talent to expand upon this universe. It is by far the best superhero movie and also one of the best movies in years. The scene in which Magneto moves the Satellite  is beautiful and the end finale to the film is spectacular. Having watched all 3 of the first attempts I can't but wish they continue with this direction in the future and possibly do complete reboot's of the originals.<br />I would tell you to save your rental dollars and just purchase the movie outright, as I will surely watch it again in the future.
B0054W4JQK|1.0|What a boring writer: no intersting words, no memorable images, no belivable characters... so dull. It gives me a depression.  After a third of the book I knew what this \\"mystery\\" supposed to be.  I was right, which is disapponting. I was skipping pages at a time without any damage to the story...  Shortly, it is waste of time. I would recommend it to read if there is nothing else to read on this planet.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|5 stars for a challenging game that keeps me interested after I lose 5 times. Fun, different, and VERY HARD. At least it becomes hard. I do see what others are saying about messing up once and it ruins the game. An undo feature would be the only thing this game needs but I won't complain it's still awesome!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This is a horrible port from iOS. Developers don't even update to catch bugs. This game is a waste of time and money for those who actually want to purchase a quality app. It is a big, epic failure of Popcap.
B003YWUTJI|1.0|So I would love to know what is one this disc but it doesn't even work! I've tried it in every player I can possibly imagine- a normal CD player, every computer on the planet, the car, the dvd player but it just doesn't work. Apparently I am just not meant to hear Norah Jones. I am sure someone can tell me if this is a good CD???!!!
B005DZMODI|2.0|I was leary of this when I saw the blurb, but where could you go wring with these 2? It was a big band show, where at lease, Clapton got lost in the crowd. I have never heard a worse rendition of Layla. If you like things closer to Jazz, this is for you. If you want more Blues, you can pass.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I enjoyed watching this from start to finish: loved the train wreck, enjoyed the ode to past masters such as \\"The Goonies\\", \\"ET\\"..it just has the feel of a Steven Spielberg but also the unpredictable edge that J.J. Abrams can bring. You aren't quite sure how far a scene may play out. My opinion was that this is great fun; sure it has a couple of unexplained issues, but perhaps they are supposed to be that way (boring if EVERYTHING is explained).  Its a sci fi adventure film on a grand scale and definitely on my \\"Must buy on Blu-Ray\\" list :)
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|My original review was that this was a great movie.  It was, but I just got a copy for christmas & I CAN'T PLAY IT UNLESS I AM HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET.  They don't tell you that ULTRA VIOLET MEANS IT WON'T PLAY ON YOUR BLUE RAY PLAYER!!!!  I am so angry about this, I can't believe that they - WARNER BROS - think they have the right to determine how I watch a movie I PAID FOR.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed to write this, but I bought this at Costco.  When it didn't work right, I thought the Ultraviolet was the problem.  After much personal discord,as you can see above, I returned it for a replacement - it worked beautifully.  I just now saw this old review and wanted to update it.
B000003TA4|5.0|one of the greatest album and people are still giving it 1 star..i guess you had to live in that decade and realize what was all about to truly understand what Nirvana was ..and still is..anyway if you are contemplating buying it, i could just say get it and listen without prejudice..and maybe,,just maybe you'll get it..if not..it's just 10 bucks..you can give it to charity and someone will buy it from there..enjoy
B0000AMRJD|5.0|My Wife got this for me as a birthday present to replace the one i lost work's great and package well like most stuff i have gotten off here. People have mix reviews on this movie but that's like any thing but this Classic is one of my all time favorites.
143352869X|4.0|I am not going to add anything more than what is written in other reviews about the construction and quality of the book (I give it 5 stars).  I want to add that the only reason I do not give this 5 stars is this edition does not have red letters.  Other than that, this is my go-to Bible now!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|By far my favorite puzzle game on the market. It starts out easy but becomes more complex. Lots of puzzles.
B0049VGSLG|5.0|Great, great album - so rare these days - wonderful energy and credibility. Thank you for the freshness and vitality. I've been listening to the CD over and over again. I discovered it from hearing a radio interview with JD McPherson and then went right to Amazon for the purchase. I know the music isn't quite like Amy Winehouse`s work, but there is a realness and observance to older music that these two artists explored and explore and that I appreciate.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I am very pleased with this Blue Ray version of Phantom of the Opera. I purchased the regular DVD some years ago and was somewhat disappointed with the sound of the voices. One of my continuing criticisms of this movie is that the quality of the voices was not nearly as good as the actual live performances. However, in this Blue Ray version, there is a vast improvement in the sound and is much more pleasant to listen to. To be sure, nothing can beat the original cast recording with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman though.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Opeth has taken the path they started with Watershed and taken it one step further.  Beautiful, haunting and complex.  It does require multiple listens to really appreciate its beauty.  I've been listening to the 5.1 mix that comes in the special edition.  The mix is done by Steven Wilson, the master of multichannel, surround music and a musical genius in his own right.  As usual, the mix is exceptional and allows to enjoy this fantastic album in a panoramic, three dimensional stage.  September 2011 has turned out to be an incredible month for high quality music lovers, first this Opeth release and then the upcoming Steven Wilson solo effort with \\"Grace for Drowning\\"  I can't wait, especially given that Steven has said that his album is a \\"cousin\\" of Opeth's Heritage!
B004HO6I4W|3.0|The Blu-ray has a terrific sound and image, but I was really disapointed because it didn't offer Portuguese language in the subtitles, despite being so related to Brazil and Rio de Janeiro. I haven't used the digital copy so far, but it seems to be handy.
B003PGE2CI|5.0|Her name is Rio and she's hungry like the wolf.  Basically because both of those songs are on this!  :)
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|Um. I really hate rating things badly or writing bad reviews, but in my opinion this is just ok. I wish there were more songs like Skyscraper or For the Love of a Daughter. A lot of the songs sound like stuff I've already heard. I don't think Demi's true talent really comes out in this album. I believe Demi is a really talented singer. I've heard her sing, she's great. And when I heard Skyscraper, I was blown away. She had come a long way from her old albums. I was honestly impressed. However, when I heard this , I was sort of disappointed. I know Demi can do so much more. These songs could be on the radio or something, but they're definitely not songs I'd be crazy about. In my opinion, the best songs on this album that have the best sound and showcase Demi's true talent are Skyscraper, For the Love of a Daughter, Give Your Heart a Break, and Unbroken. The rest of the songs aren't bad, they are fun to listen to and have a good beat, but they don't do Demi's voice justice. Would I reccommend this? Sure. There is nothing wrong with it, it is just not Demi's best. :)<br /><br />***Written by a 6th grader***
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|First off, I adore the Potter series (both books and films). This final chapter is every bit as thrilling and emotional as you'd expect. The actors, especially the younger ones, give it their all and they truly shine. It's a great adaptation of the book and retains a lot of the best elements from it. I even found the Harry vs. Voldemort duel to be better than its book counterpart. If you've enjoyed the previous films in the series then definitely check this out. You will love it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Crashes on Sprint GS2E4GT.  The game started to crash halfway through the Day chapter at least once every level.  Completely unplayable after that.
B001FB0WBK|4.0|Tommy is very good at what he does, could have used a little more vesitility in the type of songs he played and one session went a little long for my taste, but over all enjoyed his performance.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The game looks good and its had good reviews but everytime I try to load the game, it forecloses! I can't even get passed the load screen on my DROID X. Had to Uninstalled it.  Update: 12/22/2011- had to reset my phone to factory status. Once I did that I reloaded the game and viola... it worked perfectly. Great game and my kids love it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I would have never figured this would translate into the 21st century, but this thing really rocked. Great actors, very good stories, looking forward to next season.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a wonderful, quirky, witty, fast-paced show, and I am not-too-patiently awaiting the airing of Series 2, currently scheduled for May, 2012, on PBS.  Buy this set.  Watch it.  Then watch it again not just for the entertainment, but to catch the dialogue you missed the first time(the accents are beautiful, but my untrained American ears needed several viewings to finally catch everything).  Then join me, and all \\"Sherlockians\\" (which you surely will become), in petitioning BBC America to add the show to their schedule.  And watch for the movie \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\", being released in the U.S. December 9, 2011, in which Sherlock star, Benedict Cumberbatch, joins an all-star cast.
B003UESJH4|5.0|They did a most excellent job on this film.  I work with handicaped children and know how difficult that job can be for both the teacher and student.  This film not only shows that but the brothers story as well.  Well Done.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Nice, clever puzzles with good graphics. Puzzle restart after bad solution is very quick, compared to most games.   Runs perfectly on Incredible.  Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for having to wait 24 hrs for hints.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|I'm not a Nashville fan AT ALL, but my wife wanted the album so I bought it for her.  She loves it, I found about 3 songs very well done, the rest rather typical CW formual stuff.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I am someone who has no personal connection to anyone with autism, but I do think Temple Grandin's story is a valuable example for anyone who doesn't feel like they fit into mainstream society.  She pushes through the anxiety of not belonging because of her personal vision, and need, to make some things right feels so intense.  As is often the case, the true story of this person's life is far more inspiring than any fictional account.  Claire Daines envelopes the character so well that you forget it's her, the actress.  Instead, you enter the world of Temple Grandin -- a world that few people get to experience.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno is one of the true master of the next generation of both song writers and performers.  If he can keep his life on tract, he has the potential to be one of the best.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|I can accept the \\"found footage\\" style cinematography.  The plot is is also new and contrary to most current Lunar Landing conspiracy theories out there so at least it's not the same old.  \\"Capricorn One\\" did that already in 1978.  My problem with the movie comes as the very end.  Spoiler alert:  Stop reading this if you plan on watching the movie.<br /><br />The orbiter and the lander both did not make it back.  Everyone were killed.  So how did NASA get the video tapes back on Earth?  Apollo 19?  OMG!  Are they going to make a sequel?
B000055Y0X|5.0|I saw it when it first came out in the theaters and it still is about the best cold war film out there.  Sellers and Scott are at the top of their form.
1451629184|5.0|I cannot believe how this couple could get away with this right under everyone's nose in Antioch.  I read this book in 2 days and could not put it down.  Living in this town for 27 years, you think you know all that goes on but I guess in the area they lived in, it was very easy to \\"hide\\" it all.  I am so happy it all turned out well and this family can go on to a brighter future...and Thank God, her mother never gave up....
B005LY4B0A|5.0|most of these phone games are lame but this one is awesome. addicting like angry birds but without the hassle of in-game physics
B000002I99|5.0|For years I avoided this album and wanted to hate it because I refused to accept solo Alice and harbored great resentment because he parted ways with the original band. I couldn't stay mad at Alice forever though and once I gave this album a chance I found the songwriting and production are so good it makes you forget that Michael, Dennis, Glenn and Neal are no longer there. The songs are catchy and well-written and many have that horror-vibe that made songs like \\"Dwight Frye\\", \\"Dead Babies\\" and \\"I Love the Dead\\" so memorable.<br /><br />A great opener, \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" is basically setting the stage for the album just as \\"Hello, Hooray\\" had done for \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\". With Alice's vocals very much at the forefront of the mix, horns in the middle section, this is comically macabe though not as menacing as the Alice of 1971.<br /><br />\\"Devil's Food\\" has a great ripple effect on the guitar, and is harder-edged like the Alice of old. The production on this song is excellent. Who better to guest-star on an Alice Cooper album than Vincent Price, who delivers a monologue in the middle section. When two masters of the macabre collaborate, how the results be anything but amazing? Price's spoken passage leads right into \\"The Black Widow\\", whereupon Alice himself picks up the narration. With basic but infectious guitar work, the song is irressistible. In parts, it sounds like Neal Smith himself on drums.<br /><br />\\"Some Folks\\" is more Broadway-style that would have fit right in on \\"School's Out\\". It's not one of my favorites, but I never feel the need to skip over it either.<br /><br />\\"Only Women Bleed\\" was a huge hit single in 1975 (#1 in Canada) and a surprising change-of-pace for those who only thought of Alice as the King of Shock Rock. Of course its title caused somewhat of a stir for obvious reasons (with lyrics like \\"Man got his woman to take his seed\\") and was shortened to \\"Only Women\\". I love the middle section that gets bolder before softening again for the finale.<br /><br />\\"Department of Youth\\" starts off reminding me of \\"Unfinished Sweet\\" or \\"Raped n Freezin\\", and has good background vocals featuring a kids chorus as well as those terrific tribal drums.<br /><br />Alice continues his obsession with necrophilia on the rocking \\"Cold Ethyl\\", a concert staple to this day, though not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Alice sounds like he's singing from a rocking chair in the attic on the creepy, harpsichord-heavy \\"Years Ago\\", which leads into the Halloween-like piano intro of \\"Steven\\", another show-tune number.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" quiets things down before \\"Escape\\" starts things rocking again. The bells are unique and I'd rarely use the term \\"charming\\" to describe an Alice song, but this one is despite the fact it doesn't really fit in with the whole \\"nightmare\\" concept, unless it's meant to signify his waking.<br /><br />Make sure you get the remastered version with the three bonus tracks:<br /><br />The alternate extended version of \\"Devil's Food\\" has more echo on it but seems clearer and is better because the album version was mostly Vincent Price's monologue. This one doesn't feature Price but has an extended creepy instrumental section like \\"Dwight Frye\\". Probably my favorite song of the album.<br /><br />The alternate version of \\"Cold Ethyl\\" is also clearer than the album version.<br /><br />The alternate version of \\"The Awakening\\" is most interesting, creepier with Alice's whispers and a demented music box, plus the reappearance of Vincent Price. Also much better than the album version.<br /><br />Alice's debut solo album is still his best work post-ACG and remains a great listen 35+ years later and the 2011 follow-up \\"Welcome 2 My Nightmare\\" doesn't even come close.n for the finale.<br /><br />\\"Department of Youth\\" starts off reminding me of \\"Unfinished Sweet\\" or \\"Raped n Freezin\\", and has good background vocals featuring a kids chorus as well as those terrific tribal drums.<br /><br />Alice continues his obsession with necrophilia on the rocking \\"Cold Ethyl\\", a concert staple to this day, though not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Alice sounds like he's singing from a rocking chair in the attic on the creepy, harpsichord-heavy \\"Years Ago\\", which leads into the Halloween-like piano intro of \\"Steven\\", another show-tune number.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" quiets things down before \\"Escape\\" starts things rocking again.

With Alice's vocals very much at the forefront of the mix, horns in the middle section, this is comically macabe though not as menacing as the Alice of 1971.<br /><br />\\"Devil's Food\\" has a great ripple effect on the guitar, and is harder-edged like the Alice of old. The production on this song is excellent. Who better to guest-star on an Alice Cooper album than Vincent Price, who delivers a monologue in the middle section. When two masters of the macabre collaborate, how the results be anything but amazing? Price's spoken passage leads right into \\"The Black Widow\\", whereupon Alice himself picks up the narration. With basic but infectious guitar work, the song is irressistible. In parts, it sounds like Neal Smith himself on drums.<br /><br />\\"Some Folks\\" is more Broadway-style that would have fit right in on \\"School's Out\\". It's not one of my favorites, but I never feel the need to skip over it either.<br /><br />\\"Only Women Bleed\\" was a huge hit single in 1975 (#1 in Canada) and a surprising change-of-pace for those who only thought of Alice as the King of Shock Rock. Of course its title caused somewhat of a stir for obvious reasons (with lyrics like \\"Man got his woman to take his seed\\") and was shortened to \\"Only Women\\". I love the middle section that gets bolder before softening again for the finale.<br /><br />\\"Department of Youth\\" starts off reminding me of \\"Unfinished Sweet\\" or \\"Raped n Freezin\\", and has good background vocals featuring a kids chorus as well as those terrific tribal drums.<br /><br />Alice continues his obsession with necrophilia on the rocking \\"Cold Ethyl\\", a concert staple to this day, though not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Alice sounds like he's singing from a rocking chair in the attic on the creepy, harpsichord-heavy \\"Years Ago\\", which leads into the Halloween-like piano intro of \\"Steven\\", another show-tune number.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" quiets things down before \\"Escape\\" starts things rocking again. The bells are unique and I'd rarely use the term \\"charming\\" to describe an Alice song, but this one is despite the fact it doesn't really fit in with the whole \\"nightmare\\" concept, unless it's meant to signify his waking.<br /><br />Make sure you get the remastered version with the three bonus tracks:<br /><br />The alternate extended version of \\"Devil's Food\\" has more echo on it but seems clearer and is better because the album version was mostly Vincent Price's monologue. This one doesn't feature Price but has an extended creepy instrumental section like \\"Dwight Frye\\". Probably my favorite song of the album.<br /><br />The alternate version of \\"Cold Ethyl\\" is also clearer than the album version.<br /><br />The alternate version of \\"The Awakening\\" is most interesting, creepier with Alice's whispers and a demented music box, plus the reappearance of Vincent Price. Also much better than the album version.<br /><br />Alice's debut solo album is still his best work post-AGC and remains a great listen 35+ years later and the 2011 follow-up \\"Welcome 2 My Nightmare\\" doesn't even come close.n for the finale.<br /><br />\\"Department of Youth\\" starts off reminding me of \\"Unfinished Sweet\\" or \\"Raped n Freezin\\", and has good background vocals featuring a kids chorus as well as those terrific tribal drums.<br /><br />Alice continues his obsession with necrophilia on the rocking \\"Cold Ethyl\\", a concert staple to this day, though not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Alice sounds like he's singing from a rocking chair in the attic on the creepy, harpsichord-heavy \\"Years Ago\\", which leads into the Halloween-like piano intro of \\"Steven\\", another show-tune number.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" quiets things down before \\"Escape\\" starts things rocking again.

B00008L3U1|5.0|The DVD arrived timely. I have enjoyed watching the movie with my family. The quality of the DVD was great. My 9yr old son really loves this movie.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|I have to admit, all I really knew of Hanson was MmmBop and a few others from that time.  Liked it, but never really pay more attention after that.  I figured that if they come out with new stuff, it would be played on the radio.  Just last year, I got a new ipod and somehow MmmBop came to mind.  So I go to download this song and find four other albums that I never knew about.  I bought Shout It Out and was hooked.  It is a wonderful album of music, harmony, and words.  I am now a die hard Hanson fan.  They are one of the most understated bands.  100% pure talent.  This album show that they can stand the test of time.  They are up there with the best of them.  I wish they would get the credit they deserve of being great musicians.  If you want some pure great rock music.  This is the one to get.  I can smile about music again.  There are bands that actually have talent and this is one of them.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Is this the ultimate movie? Nope. But the 3D is great, and for a comic book movie, it may just be the best one done so far. Kenneth Branaugh does a great job with an awesome cast. And, it looks really good on my Panasonic 60 inch 3d screen.
B000F8O35U|5.0|True, they did just put a different pictue on the front, but they left the movie the same. I am glad they did because the original is better. I wish they had left the original picture though. Other than that the movie is AWESOME!!!!!! I definetely recomend this movie to ANY age!
030788743X|5.0|Love this story!  Love this book!  Love all of the 80's stuff that brings me back to my childhood.  Buy it, read it, you won't be sorry!
0307946711|3.0|I rather enjoyed the book and am going to be interested in seeing how the movie compares.  It was a quick read.
0061122416|5.0|A must read for teenagers trying to find their way through life.  It read it in my thirties and was moved by the simplicity of the message.  It is easy to get caught up in the distractions of life.  This simple but thoughtful book helps to put things into perspective and look beyond your own tunnel vision.  I gave a copy to each of my nieces and nephews.  Great meaning in the story and the words.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Ok with prequels you know what your getting im glad they fixed that ugly yoda in episode 1 now to the core trilogy they really needed to clean up the prints better at least in empire where luke is fighting vader you can see were the live action stops and the painting begins. The kryat dragon now sounds like a cheap effect  and they could have left jedi alone it sucked all on its own but not cause the messed with it...EWOKS...<br /><br />What they should have done is at least put original releases on the disk as the disk is a dual layer blu-ray disk 50 gigs of storage so im sure it could have fit.<br /><br />as for the docs why couldnt they have added all of them on another disk I missed from star wars to jedi the making of a saga that was classic.<br /><br />Well played Mr.Lucas you finally got me to buy your dam prequels ...im sure there will be a 3d box set but since I dont have a 3d tv i wont be getting it...so in 6 years will we get a set that has everything for the 40th anniversary of star wars next time you release a box set(I cant believe Im saying this) talk to your buddy Spielberg on the right way to do so. and stop toying with us and give us what we want
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is a perfectly delicious British drama-comedy-buddy-romance film flawlessly delivered, and my newest favorite movie.  The title is a play on words, for while the film certainly is about a boy it at the core is about a man coming to realize that it isn't always about him, but is \\"about a boy.\\" The film is cleverly double narrated by both characters, and some of the best lines are the discrepancies between what is spoken and what is thought.<br /><br />Markus is a bright, candid and colorful youth with three strikes against him, a doting mother, unfashionable clothes/home haircut, and a mildly quirky mannerism  - the perfect storm for school bullying. Even the nerds won't be seen with him due to the negative attention he draws. Markus meets self absorbed Will (Hugh Grant), who lives off royalties from his deceased father, after Will tries to pick up Markus' mom's best friend at a SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) meeting. The isolated Markus latches on to Will who reluctantly and in spite of himself begins to care about the boy.<br /><br />One thing I love about this movie is that it doesn't provide easy fixes to the big problems Markus faces like being bullied and living with a severely depressed parent, but portrays in a realistic way his struggles to cope and find happiness just the same.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|this is the best star wars has looked. colors are awesome, the changes didn't really notice them. the bonus discs are great too a lot of good stuff on them.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Just loved it.  Fifty Shades is amazing.  You will run the whole gambit of emotions.  love the journey these two are on.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|We never tire of watching this charming, funny movie with our kids. It stands the test of time. Highly recommend!
0553801473|2.0|An attempt at a quick review, which is going to end up as a rant.  There are going to be plenty of *SPOILERS*<br /><br />While I was reading the book, I felt that it was on level with A Feast for Crows, which I actually enjoyed.  Having finished the book a few weeks ago, with some reflection, this book was the worst in the series.<br /><br />1. Arya's character has completely been lost in the \\"overall\\" arch of the story.  Sure, she is training, and she was probably the best character in the first 3 books, but what the H*** is she doing now?  I don't see how she fits in with the ultimate battle with the Others.<br /><br />2. While I am in the minority on liking Sansa, where is her character?  What is she doing?<br /><br />3. We finally learn Bran's power, only to stop reading about him.  WHAT THE H***?<br /><br />4. Davos, go find Rickon... and then we won't mention you for the last 500 pages... WHAT THE H***?<br /><br />5. In my opinion, Jon Snow is the main character of the books and there is no way that he dies at the end of the book.  Why did GRRM leave us with that cliffhanger, so that we have to wait 6 years for his next book, only to have one of the first 4-5 chapters be either Melisandre or Jon showing that he in fact did not die.<br /><br />6. Tyrion went from a strong character in the books to very weak.  We had several characters point of views, all traveling to visit Dany.  I'm not sure why that was neccesary.  Personally, I thought he was going to look for his lost love, Tysha, which would have been much more interesting than NOT finding Dany.<br /><br />7. GRRM added several character point of views who were all very similar.  Did we really need Otah (was that his name?), the guard for the Dorne Prince?<br /><br />8.  To finish, all the characters we fell in love with in the first few books are now lost in the shuffle of the ever adding of pointless characters.  In my opinion, GRRM will not finish this series in 2 more books unless he \\"splits\\" both of them again.  At that point, why not just split another to make the series an even 10 books, which will ultimately be just a money grab, but oh well.  I didn't purchase this book, but borrowed it from a friend.  I won't be purchasing these books until they are out on paperback to match the rest of my books, and might borrow the next few from friends to keep up.  Ultimately, I will do what I am doing with Wheel of Time...eventually, I'll forget characters from book to book, and just give up and wait for all the series to be published and then go on a reading frenzy of the whole series.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|First of all, I'm aware of the lack of many Special Features on this set. But for this, it doesn't concern me since it is going to be a Christmas present for my Mom who doesn't even watch any of the Special Features that regularly come with movies. People are going to give this set Two to One Star merely for the sake that it lakes Special Features but if you're like my Mom and don't really watch them, then go for this! Really I mean, what's the harm? I mean isn't this set the one everyone's more-or-less been waiting for? Isn't this why we've avoided the \\"Years 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7: Part 1 Gift Sets?\\" It really is simple guys, you just need to read the fine print. If you want the whole set with minimal Special Features, then go for this. If you DO like Special Features, then just, I don't know, buy the Ultimate Editions individually or something. Me personally, I'd prefer a lot of Special Features but this is a gift for my Mom so it doesn't matter. Know what you're buying folks.
B002SRQ214|5.0|We build computers so we are constantly looking at the best value of hardware for our builds.  This AMD Phenom II QUAD 965 is really sweet.  We were not sure about this choice.  We had a previous phenom ii, the 940 that was underwhelming.  But after looking at the various dual core options in AMD we gave it a go.  This was a good decision.  We like the Xigmatek S-1283 cooler.  It is tall, but very quiet and at around $30 it is a super cooler.  The cpu has moderate power requirements for reasonable operating temperatures.  It is rated 125 watts.  You have to make sure your motherboard takes those 125 and 140 watt cpu's.  AMD finally solved the Phenom ii speed problem, and this cpu at 3.4ghz ROCKS.  We use ASUS whenever we can for mainboards.  So we married this cpu to a ASUS AM3 socket M4A88T-M motherboard that has great features and easy setup.  We think the architecture of the cache on this processor makes it a better gaming choice over the competition.  You can pay a little less for a 955 AMD quad, but stretch to the 965.  You'll be glad you did!  Our latest build with that Phenom II 965 and Asus M488t-M was completed with a Radeon 5770 video card and Kingson Blue DDR3 memory.  We like the XM-5U front mount card readers and all SATA Western Digital and Liteon DVD-R for storage.  It is plenty fast for the latest high graphic intense games.  Very Nice and we did it ourselves saving a bunch,
B005CM9DX6|2.0|wow what to say? im very dissapointed. I waited a while for this new album to come out and bought concert tickets (as I do every time they come by my way) now thinking i will put them on stubhub bc this album is so NOT Opeth. Im a musician aswell and couldnt quite get the album still. Opeth normally has a point in songs even the weereder ones that is so beautyful and in this album beside the intro piano there wansnt much. I needed this meatal album! fyi if ur looking to supplement some OLD Opeth try the new Dream Theater album!!! Good hard rock!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love all six films. I got this on the first day it came out and I was amazed how good Star Wars looks in hi-def. The deleted scenes for the Originals were just awesome, even though that most of them were not finished and had no sound to them, but that is understandable. I was a little disappointed that they didn't include the deleted scenes from the DVD versions of Prequels and that they didn't include the original Jabba the Hutt scene, but still the ones they had were pretty cool to watch.  I previewed the collection a little bit and I have to say that all the props, costumes and models that I have seen are pretty cool. I have yet to look at the rest or seen the concept art gallery and interviews, but I can't wait to seem them. If you have the DVD versions, keep them when you get this product. I say that because the bonus discs don't have the plethora of behind the scenes and special features material as the previous versions.  For all of you that complain about the minor changes, just stop talking and watch the movies. They are still great films regardless of changes.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|\\"Paul\\" is a hilarious and quirky science fiction film about two comic book fanatics (Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings) that have an unexpected alien encounter that changes their life.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play characters that have come all the way from England to attend a Comic-Con event that is held in California.  Naturally, they also want to explore other parts of America as well.  During their road trip they accidently run into an alien that calls himself Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen).  The movie starts out with some good humour, but the chances to laugh really increase once Paul persuasively convinces Graeme and Clive to take him to where he needs to go.  Jason Bateman plays a scandalous but crafty government agent who is also determined to capture Paul for his own personal ulterior motives.  \\"Paul\\" is a great movie to watch for those who enjoy films that contain elements of comedy and/or science fiction.
6301885732|4.0|A delightful movie! Great use of colour, and very amusing presentation of the various figures as caracatures. The portrayal of some of the crims, (eg mumbles, pruneface, etc) of other characters such as Breathless Mahony (Madonna), the Kid, and Tess Trueheart is priceless.    An above-average movie and great entertainment.
B00005OLY5|5.0|I realy enjoyed this movie and I strongly recomend anyone who enjoys a good Fantasy film to watch this. This movie is dated now but when it was released it was awesome.  the special effects, The story, The acting was all done rather well.  Some parts are rather cheesy but it all fits in and it will have you enjoying this film....I hate those Dogs...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enjoy this game. Children are glued to device while playing this game. Though slow to load at start. Good experience.
B005869U6G|1.0|Bands get older, mature, evolve, try out new things.........but bands shouldnt completely ditch their sound. This is the biggest sign that they have lost their edge and really need Dirk back as Brandon is turning the group into a band that now your mum would like!!. All the songs on this album pretty much sound the same, and to think i was excited when i heard Adolescents which could of easily been cut off A Crow Left.......Avoid this album at all costs, think its time to hang up the guitars guys!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Star Wars will always be one of my childhood's most cherished memories.  I was nine years old when it was released and it shaped my little universe more than any other piece of popular culture had or ever has since.  And then George Lucas decided my memories needed some tweaking to satisfy his ego and fill his bank account.  One star for the current version of these films.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This thing puts me on the floor. And it's so beautifully animated.  Will Ferrell is like a monkey loose in the hardware store.  Finally -- FINALLY -- Hollywood has gotten around to realizing the horrible truth that we all think we're the good guy -- whether we think we're the bad guy or not.  Megamind has such fun with his mad campaign to beat the Good Guy; you will too.  Get popcorn.  No, wait, not a good idea -- when Tina Fey ad libs in exasperation: \\"Girls! Girls!  You're BOTH pretty!\\" you'll probably choke on the kernels.  This is funny. And it's a rewatcher. You'll want to see it again, so you might as well buy it now.
6304711905|5.0|This movie has alot of good music alot of 90's action alot of big named stars whom IMO play their parts rather well.  I do think this story focuses more on the legend of the O.K. Corral and the events around it then it dose with actual facts in history.  However the story is well told and the action and special effects are done very well.  If you want a good 90's Action western then do pick this one up
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Now, if your a hardcore super mega star wars fan, there is some things that you will not like about this. Like some altered sences and things like that, but if you simply want the amazing Star Wars experiance in Blu-ray Hi-Def., with the exception of a few altered scenes, then you have it! All six episodes in glorious 1080p and 6.1 suround. My only words were, holy hi-def star wars.

We have played and played this and it doesn't get old.  The almost 2 year old belly laughs watching us play!
B000RH0C8G|5.0|The last thing this sports-business classic needs is another review.  With a Brad Pitt movie version on the calendar now, however, I decided MONEYBALL does need an update in the form of a look at the actual results from the decisions described in this how-to tome for low-budget teams to compete by squeezing more value from acquisition of traditionally unheralded players. And, as a Houston Astros fan in 2011, I had plenty of time available on my recreational calendar.  So I donned my nerd cap and hit the record books in an effort to provide a little extra value to this review.<br /><br />First, I inspected the careers of the seven players selected by the Oakland A's in the first round of the 2002 MLB draft, an event chronicled in great detail here as an example of General Manager Billy Beane's now-vaunted moneyball system. Four of those seven made it to the majors, including their top pick Nick Swisher, now a true star for the New York Yankees. But that list also includes catcher Jeremy Brown, who reached the show in 2006 for a total of five games, batting a total of ten times. MONEYBALL depicts Brown as the perfect example of a moneyball-system selection, ignored by scouts from other teams because of appearance.<br /><br />Second, I looked elsewhere in that draft to spot the names of any other picks who had risen to prominence. That search turned up pitcher Jonathan Papelbon, taken by the A's in the 40th Round and later dealt to the Boston Red Sox, where he's become one of the sport's top closers in the last seven seasons. Notable players taken after Swisher by other teams included pitchers Cole Hamels and Matt Cain.<br /><br />Third, I reviewed the record of the A's since 2003. Although they've lost 620 games in that period while winning only 605 through last year, the team did win the American League West twice in that period (2003 and 2006) but failed both times to advance to the World Series. From 2007 through 2009, the team lost more games than it won before finishing even in 2010 at 81-81. Through September 20 of 2011, the A's had won 69 games and lost 84 to guarantee another losing season in Oakland.<br /><br />I don't offer these numbers in any attempt to discredit the important work of the Beane counters in Oakland or the contribution of Michael Lewis in changing the way baseball is managed. There's no questioning the common sense of most of Beane's methodology. But the need for an update did come to mind as I read MONEYBALL for the first time, after forgetting about it for years until I saw Brad Pitt flashing his best Billy Beane grin on a TV trailer for the movie. The book still remains required reading for any true fans of the game and many non-fans who can apply the techniques to other walks of business.<br /><br />Beyond that recommendation, however, it appears to me that the updated numbers underscore a more basic fact of life in baseball or otherwise: Even with the most precise scientific method applied, there's still an element of the crap shoot to anything you do.Through September 20 of 2011, the A's had won 69 games and lost 84 to guarantee another losing season in Oakland.

B000063UR2|3.0|This was a over all a intresting story made in the 80's it was one of those films that slid under the radar but it was stilld a Okay film worth watching.  The pro's:    Its a fantasy film    It had good special effects (For the 80's)    Story was done good    Most the Acting was done okay  The Con's    It is typical for the 80's    The acting is done to focus on one actor    It may seem rather dated    some parts may have been done rather dark.  Over all this was a okay film typical of the 80's fantasy gener.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|I had high hopes for this flick, but I was let down again! This movie in a word: sucks. With a little editing, it could easily be ready for broadcast on The Disney Channel in prime time! Story is weak and the extensive use of CG effects renders this \\"Green Lantern\\" pretty much dead on arrival. Not even hunky Ryan Reynolds can save this beast. My recommendation? Save your money and rent or buy Ryan Reynold's earlier release \\"BURIED\\", directed by Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s. \\"BURIED\\" is way better than this turkey...IMHO.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|The fact that I am reviewing a DVD that hasn't been produced yet for a series year that hasn't been completed yet should be a solid indicator that I am a big fan of this show.  Season 4 is every bit as good as the previous three seasons, and my only criticism is that Season 5 will apparently be the last for the series.  This is sad news for me -- I've been spending each week anticipating with pleasure what new bad decision the series characters will make.  They seem to have an inexhaustible repertoire, especially, of course, Walt.<br /><br />I don't want to discuss the show in too much detail, since that would lead to spoilers, so instead I will make a few bold predictions.  I have the feeling that the show is going to end badly for almost everybody, and if someone comes out alive and whole at the end, it will just be due to good luck. Walt is almost certainly a dead man, as he himself remarked in a recent episode.  Most likely, as the series ends, he will either die of cancer or finally fall victim to one of his numerous criminal enemies.  Jesse will either die of an overdose or get rubbed out (my money is on the former), and his surviving business partners, Skinny Pete and Badger will wind up in jail.  Hank will either get too close to Gus' operation and have a fatal accident, or, he might just keel over and die from a heart attack.  Marie and Skyler will most likely end up in jail, the former for renewed binges of shoplifting, the latter for accounting fraud, although Sky is crafty enough to get out of town with the cash before that happens, so maybe it won't turn out all bad for her. Meanwhile, Gus will either wind up sipping tequila on a Caribbean island, or in a hole in the desert.  I can't see him getting put in the slammer as he's too smart for that. Maybe he'll go back to Chile, as he seems to have something of a criminal past there. Mike, like any good soldier, will either follow Gus into exile or wind up in the same hole in the desert. Finally Saul will almost certainly end up behind bars, or murdered by an irate client, or perhaps both if he happens to land in the wrong prison.  Like I said, it looks bad for almost everybody, but that's what keeps me watching. As one of the few major characters not involved in some sort of criminal activity, Walter Jr. will probably go on to college and become a chemist, like his dad, in preparation for the spinoff series, Breaking Bad, Part 2. Won't that be a trip?rtainly end up behind bars, or murdered by an irate client, or perhaps both if he happens to land in the wrong prison.

Won't that be a trip?
B000L53D4O|4.0|My one year old is slow at the walking, but loves this toy.  He gets around quickly and can keep up with his brothers, all while learning to balance on his legs!  Great toy!
B001E45XT4|4.0|I like the product overalll. Both the mic and headphones produce high quality sound. When you put these things on, you can't hear hardly anything outside. The product seems to be made of durable materials. The only downside (which is a big downside to me) is that they do clamp down on your head pretty hard. No matter how I adjust these things, they are tight on the sides of your head.
0470901071|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I have a stack of books consisting of practically every bit of CCNA prep material in existence in which to compare this book to. I realized after reading Todd's book that I could have saved myself a TON of money if this book would have been my first purchase. Not only have I been preparing for the CCNA exam by self-study, I have also completed the Cisco Networking Academy at my college so I've seen my share of thousands of dollars worth of Cisco material.     I loved this book from the minute I opened it. Todd has an incredible knack for explaining subject matter that can be very dull and dry at times when transferred to the printed page. Todd Lammle transfers his wealth of knowledge into literature that actually makes sense! The language is laid back, as if a very intelligent friend was explaining routers and switches to you in person.  I spent many months before purchasing this book rereading subject matter which took him all of about one second to make clear to me. Summarization and wildcard masks are explained in a way that is surprisingly simple.     The order in which Todd explains subject matter is remarkably sensible. His chapters are in the chronological order in which you should be introduced to your material. There is no useless fluff, either. Every bit of subject matter in the book is practical and useable.     After reading this book you will be very well-versed in routing protocols, switching, ACLs, VLANs, STP, etc. His labs are a great help. Make sure you do them all and get lots of hands-on practice. You will find that the practice material in this book is an invaluable asset to you.    If you are planning on taking the one or two test route, this book is for you. You must have perfect your skills in subnetting and this book will help you prepare with subnetting explained in simple terms. One of the greatest gifts from my investment in this book was the ability to subnet very quickly in my head, which you must do in orderto pass the Cisco exams.     This is the first book review I have written. I owe it to Todd to give him his five stars even though he deserves so much more. I took the ICND1 last year and passed but waited a year to take the ICND2. I found that after reading Todd's book and receiving an email of encouragement from him personally before I took the test, that my nerves were under control and I was excited and looking forward to taking the INCD2. I walked into ICND2 with much more confidence than I had on the first test. I also walked out with a passing score on the first try and a smile on my face. Thanks, Todd Lammle, you're the man!!!
0316044938|5.0|This book made me cry so much! What an amazing story, putting into words the love that exists between a father and his daughter.  Such a touching book.  It starts out sad, and there were many times where I was absolutely sobbing, but it ends very sweetly with you feeling better about the world and what lies in the beyond as well.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I have had my sonic screwdriver for just about a year now. It is still as good as the day I got it. I don't use the pens that much, but they are still good. The batteries have a long life and it is a good replica from the show. At first I had a little trouble figuring out how to get inside the screwdriver to put the batteries in. It wasn't super complicated but I suggest to take it easy. I am always careful with my sonic screwdriver because I do worry about it breaking. Just don't be too rough with it and it will be fine. It has good quality sound and and UV light is good. It is not a practical purchase but it is fun and I am a 24 year old college student. I highly recommend this product.
0300169787|5.0|i bought this a gift for a good friend of mine. She absolutely loved it and it's a spectacular piece of art.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I first watched 'The King's Speech' at the movies and wondered if the same atmosphere could be created in the loungeroom. It can, as the storyline is factual and the acting is superb! Colin Firth is excellent as the king and very personable. Of course Geoffrey Rush is excellent as the (non qualified) speech therapist. Helen Bonham Carter is wonderful as Albert's wife. The setting, humour and reality of the film is stunning. I will keep it as one of those films you can watch over and over again. My hubby enjoyed it too.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Regret I bought it. I know Lucas will keep tweaking his movies. I should have waited.  I wish he would just get it over with and revamp all special effects from the original 3 episodes. But let buyers choose if they want the original or the new version.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|When I was a child, some 55 years ago, I knew intuitively that all Disney animations were perfect.  This one is, well, pluperfect. Simple story, perfect artwork, no aftermarket nonsense. The old Disney. Before computers. When workmen knew their artistic craft. Enough said. Keep the bluray coming, Walt.
B000002KHH|5.0|One of the greatest albums in rock history, this one comes with the clasics Paranoid, Ironman, and of course the mind bending Fairies wear boots,however, the star of the album has to be WAR PIGS, used to own this album as a tape, and play it on this old stereo, man , was like going on a time machine getting shills and all, in few words, this is a great album and i would definitely recomend it to anyone who wants to have an amazing time whit the masters of all metal, Black Sabbath.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i have been a fan of star wars my whole life! i was 2 when the first movie came out and saw every movie in the theatre since empire in 1980 including special editions in 1997! never understood the backlash of the additions and the prequels! i rather enjoyed the story of anakin skywalker and episode 3 has become one of my favorites! i also like episode 2 more than most for the mystery and the action! plus the special effects in all 3 prequels are awesome! i remember being young and wondering what the clone wars were like and what it was like with all the jedi and now we see it plus seeing anakin turn to the dark side and into darth vader is powerful theatre! for this blue ray release 4,5, and 6 look better than ever and i don't hate on lucas for making changes that he thinks pesents his vision better with technology! i say watch and enjoy after all it is entertainment!
B0058OUJA4|3.0|its OK but a total rip off of hex defense game. looks like hex defense was stripped apart and replaced with cheaper graphics.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I saw the very first movie, Star Wars, as a young teenager at the old original Hollywood Cinerama Dome theater in 1977. My father took me to see it. I saw the subsequent two episodes, V & VI, in theaters as well. I saw all three originals in all their glory as originally released on the big screen when they premiered. I was totally and instantly hooked. I started collecting Star Wars memorabilia immediately. I have a huge collection of -original vintage- Star Wars memorabilia in pristine condition (which I would love to sell if anyone's interested). And, I have been a devoted Star Wars 'nut' ever since that first experience in 1977. I've seen all six episodes on the theater big screen, including the theater re-releases of IV, V, and VI in 1997 of course, and now I've seen them all on the home big screen in all their Blu-ray surround-sound glory.<br /><br />I preordered this box set back in January and had been waiting for 9 months. During that time I never did pay too much attention to the blubbering lamentations of the Star Wars purists who have behaved like spoiled children all but claiming ownership and rights to something they have never possessed as their own, nor to the folks who had never even seen what was in store for purchasers of this box set -because it hadn't even been released- yet. However, I was recently somewhat concerned by the recent revelations of alterations to certain scenes in a couple of the episodes that were officially disclosed. It garnered my attention to a degree but came nowhere close to motivating a cancellation of my purchase. After all, Lucas had done this before and more than once over the last 34 years. Now, after having watched all six episodes again but in Blu-ray, the deleted scenes, the alternate scenes, and all of the other extras in this box set, I am greatly pleased by this box set.<br /><br />The episodes have never ever looked so good outside of the big screen theater. The surround-sound is impeccable. The changes are so small in the grand scheme of things, and in the big picture it actually improves -this- Star Wars experience. Having already owned the Laser Disc's, the VHS, and then the DVD sets for many years I am so glad I purchased this set. Mr. Lucas and crew did an outstanding job. Some of the extra's and several of the deleted/alternate scenes I had never seen before. Anyone who simply just 'likes' the Star Wars galaxy, much less someone who has seen them all in theaters as originally released in their younger days, and whom has a Hi-Def TV (it is absolutely stunning on my newer 73\\" 1080p plasma), a surround-sound setup, and a Blu-ray player would be greatly remiss in not purchasing this box set. It is truly amazing.heme of things, and in the big picture it actually improves -this- Star Wars experience.

B002SSUQFG|3.0|This is a decent watch, but I expected more from the Seiko brand and the price.    When I first took it out of the box, this watch already had a major problem. It was running about 15 seconds fast per MINUTE! After browsing the internet, I found a forum thread saying some part might have moved out of place during shipping. The thread suggested wrapping the watch in a cloth and banging the side of it against a table. Doing this fixed the problem, but it was definitely not something I wanted to do to a brand new watch.    After 9 months of owning the watch, I'm still having accuracy problems. It runs slow by about 30 seconds per day. That means I have to adjust the time at least twice a week. Another problem with this watch is the cheap strap. There is a lot of fraying on mine, mostly at the end of the strap and around the hole I use the most. The strap is smaller than usual so I haven't been able to find a good replacement.     The watch is also noisy. The noise comes from the metal weight that moves to wind up the match when you move your hand. For example, if you're sitting in your office with your hand on your desk and you move your arm to pick up something, you'd hear it. Not a big deal, though.     And I've never seen such a thick watch in my life! It's about half an inch thick. If you're looking straight at it, you won't be able to tell, but it does make it harder to button up sleeves on shirts. Furthermore, the watch is small so the thickness to diameter ratio is really off.    Overall, not a very good watch.
1250004349|5.0|Good book and was easy to get into it.  I was hooked by the first few pages.  The story is sad and tragic but all too familiar, but is told in a new way.  Enjoyed it.

159514188X|5.0|Summary: Hannah Baker committed suicide two weeks ago, so why did Clay Jenkins receive a box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah? Because he is one of 13 reasons why Hannah Baker committed suicide and she is going to tell each of them how they contributed to her death.     What I Think: When a book really means something to me, really touches my soul, I have a really hard time writing the review. This book is one of those. I didn't want to stop reading to write down notes or mark favorite parts- I just wanted to keep reading.     This is an important book. One of those books that will be around for a long time. It deals with themes that are constant- bullying, depression, suicide, love. I feel that anyone who reads this book will relate to something. To Hannah's hurt or Clay's love or one of the other characters- in good ways and bad. This book really makes you consider how your actions are truly affecting those around you. Some of Hannah's reasons were not because the person was a bad person. It was because they didn't care or made a bad choice. Little things in our own life may be very large things in other lives. As Hannah says, \\"No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people. Oftentimes we have no clue.\\" So true.     Now, I had heard that some people find Hannah whiny or nit-picking, but I think what happens to her is one of the most realistic translations of isolation in high school that exists in young adult literature. Although one of the 13 reasons may not stand alone as a devastating event (though some do), it is the snowball effect of all of the reasons combining over a short period of time. It is their sum that kills the mean. Those that do not understand are either thinking too much like an adult or had a very easy time in high school, because the experiences that Hannah has are what makes her feel obsolete so they are devastating to her.     Random thoughts-   *I felt bad for Clay. He is such a sweetheart and really didn't deserve to be on the tapes- he is one of the few that tried. But maybe he didn't try hard enought.   *I will NEVER view the phrase \\"Relax\\" in the same way after this novel. It creeps me out just thinking about it.   *I think this book would be awesome to listen to as an audio book! I hope they do the dual narratives justice.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|It completely took me by surprise how enjoyable this show is. The first three episodes were kind of dull, but if you manage to get beyond them, you're in for a treat. The Vampire Diaries is compelling, exciting and totally addictive. It is full of strong female characters (Elena, Caroline) and the plotlines never become dull -in fact, they just keep getting better (I am up to season three right now, and loving this show more than ever).  It doesn't hurt that all the characters are very attractive (I personally am super jealous of Nina Dobrev's hair).  Strongly recommended (just struggle through those first few episodes).
B002ZG976U|5.0|When the seller says the product is in 'Like New' condition they mean it which is wonderful. The DVD came wrapped as it if has never been used and had one little mark which was cleaned off. I will be ordering more 'Like New' products again.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|great game but needs more features like design your own level or something. more missions would be nice too with new level layouts.
B002ZG99IG|3.0|I didn't think that this thriller was as bad as some say. It's entertaining and Leighton Meester plays a great bad girl.. however the other girl is blah. Recommended for a rainy day watch.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|My wife and I have been enjoying this game for a couple days now. It works great on Epic 4G & Evo Shift 4G. Tons of fun. It does require a little thinking because of puzzles but it is well worth the cost.
0316010669|5.0|Isn't it good to know about the things we know but don't realize how we know them?  This book will give you insight on your reactions and some situations where we are not making good decisions.  Fast and enjoyable read.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I found this to be more entertaining then angry birds! Very challenging, and very fun! The added tools besides scissors give it an  extra dynamic. Its a good thing
B004LWZW42|5.0|As a fan of the first, X2, and The Last Stand I enjoyed this movie a lot! The special effects are very good and the plot keeps you engaged all of the way through. One of the best films of 2011 and a new superhero favorite of mine.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|I'm not going to bore you all to tears with a 5000 word dissertation on the latest Opeth offering, and a logistical breakdown of each song.  All you need to know are three things.  First, there is absolutely nothing death metal about this album.  That may shock you, or even piss you off, but you can always blast the eight other Opeth albums that feature the heavy stuff.  Second, the production and recording are much different than previous efforts.  There's much less layering and stacking of components and the production is warm and vintage sounding, very King Crimson like.  Third, there are some new elements and sonic experimentation that take Opeth off in tangents both strange and wonderful. Many of these experiments would never have worked in past albums, but here seem so welcome and fitting.  A lot of the album is very quiet, and the soft/loud dynamic seems to be the main focus.  When they get moving, they really get your attention, but when they don't, you may get lulled into a false sense of serenity.  This is an album full of songs to bed down a woman to or (and I mean this in the best possible way) to fall asleep to.  The detractors for me are the lack of experimentation vocally, and the amount of quiet material taking away from the powerful Opeth trademark riffing.  The vocals are everything you've heard from Mikael before and with all the other experimentation, he should have tried some new tricks, although his soft croon is still so pleasant.  And the quiet spaces on the album are like dead air on the radio, just needless at points.  It takes away momentum from some stand out tracks.  So buyer beware, there is no metal here, just the soothing, scary sounds of Opeth carrying you off to dreamland or an acid flashback.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|excellent game. similar idea to cut the rope. easy to play, but challenging at the same time. not just another mindless game.
159514188X|2.0|Throughout reading the book I was waiting for something huge to push her over the edge, but nothing every happened.  Only little things were messing up her life, which made the book a little boring.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|This looks like a good game has a killer story mode but once i try go and play it,  it says loading and then force closes itself.  I cannot seem to make it work. Looks good but may require a high end phone like dual core. Two stars for the video i saw.  Maybe more if they fix it.
B001AP11LQ|5.0|So sad they broke up the band.  Honestly one of my favorite albums they've done.  Good driving/in the car music.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I get why people are angry. George change something that was beloved by so many, but that's life.<br />I personally found nothing wrong with the changes, sure Vader yelling \\"NOOOO!!\\" sounded pretty bad, but that didn't ruin my experience with this box set.<br />The films themselves have never looked and sounded better! Episode III looks on par with other Blu-Rays like, Avatar and Star Trek. All the others look good, but being that they are older and not shot in Hi-Def they don't look as good as Episode III.<br />I really like the packaging (US Version). The packaging won't scratch up the discs, but it will force you to touch the bottom of the disc. The book style and the art on each page looks gorgeous! Although, I would have liked to see disc art, but that's very minor.<br />The special features are phenomenal! Over 40 hours of stuff to watch, personally, I wont watch much of the features, but if you like that stuff. It's there for you. What I really like is the bloopers and the documentaries that are included.<br /><br />\\"No, the \\"untouched\\" original trilogy is not included. Yes, there are some goofy new additions, like Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOOO\\" as he throws Emperor Palpatine over the railing. I don't think anyone really expected this release of The Complete Saga to be free of controversy. But come on. It's Star Wars. On Blu-ray. This is a once-in-a-technological-generation event, and if your hatred of George Lucas' revisionist tinkerings keeps you from enjoying some of your favorite films in high definition, you're missing out. Believe me, I share your pain. Whenever I hear that stupid funk song inside Jabba's palace, I cringe like a man being forced to bite down on tin foil or chew sand. It's almost physically painful. But I'm done being bitter. I'm playing the long game. One of these days, Lucas will wise up and realize that the original trilogy--in its original form--is a culturally and historically important piece of pop art that belongs to its fans. But until that day, I'm going to enjoy this Blu-ray box set. The films have never looked or sounded better-- Episodes III-VI are particularly impressive--and they come with a fantastic collection of special features.\\"<br /> I Highly Recommend It!ng to enjoy this Blu-ray box set.

B005KWL2IW|5.0|I always thought Anthrax was good but never realy made that impact album, Among the living and the first John Bush album. Worship Music is that modern impact album that after all these years maybe now people will know who they are. Capitlaizing on the big four tour and then to come out with a kickass speed thrash album. It does have radio appeal but it also jams enough to be underground cool. If you like 80s metal and are hesitating about Worship Music, you cant beat the price and will not be disapointed. 5 stars Anthrax!
B005CMSDKA|2.0|from watching the promos that were shown on television I expected a movie filled with action.  Most of the actio was shown on the promos.  This was really a coming of age movie about a girl whose father just happened to be in the CIA. If I had known that I would not have bought the BluRay DVD.  Wasted money.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I never minded the changes Lucas had made over the years...What I do mind is packaging that puts the product at risk. The cardboard sleeves will scratch these disks faster than a blaster. The UK packaging is nicer, better and the booklet is larger.
B005M68S4W|5.0|I was apprehensive when I saw some of the artist (lady Gaga).  I am 62 and never really listened to her, just have seen her on tv etc.  Well, never judge a book by it's cover.  She is fabulous on this album as are all of the other artists.  No need to comment on the King, Tony Bennett.  I am so surprised how he just keeps singing so well!  You will not be disappointed in this album if you are a Tony Bennett fan.

B000HL2F14|4.0|I am a die hard star trek fan ( the original series) but like most people suffered from some burn out by the time Enterprise came on the air.  After starting the Amazon instant video I decided to find out what people were saying about all of the star trek series that were now available to watch.  When I read that people enjoyed season three of Enterprise I decided to check it out.  Man, I really enjoyed this continuing one year long story.  IMO its some of the best star trek out of any of the new shows.  There is more compelling character development and sense of urgency and suspense than has ever been in any of the other cold and politically correct shows such as TNG and Voyager. They actually made the story of the impending destruction of the earth by the alien Xindi exciting and the ships search in an unknown and unstable area of space to find and stop the alien weapon very addictive viewing.  I was really surprised by the evolution of the T'pol vulcan character and her change from stoic arrogant vulcan to emotionally scarred and loyal crew member.  Her arc involving her addiction to a mineral deadly to vulcans and its permanent affect on her emotional stability was fun to watch. Plus it was fun to follow her struggling with her feelings for Trip tucker and captain archer.  Archer was forced to make some hard decisions that were a deviation from the usual preachy good guy stance of other shows.  I always find it annoying when the new shows have the crew do everything they can to accomodate the vast array of alien jerks and bend over backwards to show how peacefull humans are.  This season the stakes are the destruction of the earth so Archer chucks that PC stuff out the window and gets nasty ( a few times) in order for the mission to succeed.  I really believe that if this show had followed TNG instead of deep space nine then it would have been more popular. Not that Im a DS9 basher...I thought the last two seasons of that show were great as well.  If you watch anything of Enterprise...check out this 3rd season for the last great star trek television.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This documentary explains how large companies maintain control over food production; unethical business practices are exposed and thoroughly investigated. I was very pleased that Food Inc made sure to include a bit of hope regarding the future of food production and consumer protection by explaining what we can do to change food industries through our choices - a lot of documentaries in this category are devoid of hope or calls to action. I am familiar with Fast Food Nation, Super Size Me, and most other popular junk-food-exposes and documentaries, but I still found Food Inc to have a lot of very interesting information. I highly recommend watching this. It is available streaming on Amazon, and also on Netflix.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great home workout that keeps things simple.  Lots of variables to suit your needs as to whether or not you want lower impact or constant verbal instruction.  Just what I was looking for.
142311339X|5.0|Thrilling and action-packed. With true emotions and full of surprises. Really better than the Olympian series! Recommendations: do not read the end first, you would not understand this book if you do that.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Well my family and i watched the whole saga over the weekend . I have to say the little changes Lucas made were not that bad . In episode 1 the yoda cgi was a better addition than the original and nothing was really done to 2 or 3. The Kryat dragon call that Ben Kenobi did was diffrent but was not that bad . Do have to say \\"A New Hope\\" looked gariney through out most of the movie . But 5 and 6 were visually stunning . Picture quality was a lot better than dvd . Now for the part that everybody thought was stupid . Lucas did add the \\"no\\" scream and yes it did sound a bit wierd but its liveable . Did not take or add anything from the movie , and than you have the eyes that blink on the Ewoks , really if you don't look carefully enough you cant see it . So for all those people that canceled their preorders because of those small changes you have forgotten what a movie is . These movies are made for our entertainment and nothing more . Instead of breaking every scene down to tell us whats wrong don't watch or by it for that fact . In the end we all  need to make up our own minds about what we watch and all 6 movies were very good . And i would recomend these movies to any science fiction fan

030746363X|5.0|I have read this book over and over and recommend it to anyone trying to implement behavior changes or want effective gym.  I revisit it when ever I have a new fitness goal.  The techniques and experiments are superb and they work. The writing is simple and entertaining.  It will take a bit of high lighting and close reading to get the exact protocols for each of the experiments (Check lists for each protocol at the ends of chapters would be a great addition to future editions). But I couldn't give a higher recomendation of this work.  Great book.  Buy it. Love it. Design the body you want.
0375842209|3.0|I bought this book because I ran into good reviews over and over again.  I also am interested in the subject matter though I prefer books written by people who actually were there.  I have to admit that I had a very, very hard time getting into the book and was ready to give up on it after about 50 pages into it or so. The first thing which bothered me was the language. I speak German and I could not deal with the amount of swear words repeated over and over and over again.  I have never met a German person, who would talk that way.  And I have never heard that word \\" Saumensch\\".  There may be people who swear so much but the social milieu these people lived in did not fit the picture of constantly swearing people without provocation and reason.  I do not like to listen to rap songs for the same reason, though I know that some segments of the population actually talk that way.)  There were other things unbelievable for me:  Only the son of Hans and Rosa Hubermann seems to be a willing Nazi, the rest of the characters just follow out of fear.   The little girl playing soccer with the boys. I am pretty sure that at that time only boys played soccer and would not have allowed a girl to participate.   Also I found the story about Rudy wanting to kiss her at the tender age of nine dubious.  Nowadays kids are sexually more aware earlier, but in 1940?  The foster father Hans was a little bit too perfect for my taste. I mention these two things because it is supposed to be a book for children or teenager.  Making death the narrator was an interesting choice considering the fact that over 50 million people got killed in this war. That guy must have been busy like hell; it is a miracle that he could keep track of the life of a little girl. And I would have preferred if he would have told a little bit more about the incredible amount of people killed.  So far for the criticism.   I did finish the book and the last part was moving and sad but the book left me completely dissatisfied because it gave me no answers. Of course there are always decent people  who will try to do the right thing, even if they endanger themselves or their loved-ones.. But why are there so many who don't???Not one character in this book explains the other side - the Nazi side.  Why is there always such a support for war? Why is it so easy to rally people against one group and completely alienate them from the rest of the population?  Why are we so easily ruled by fear? And why is it possible that some maniacs can run a country???   Why do we not learn from history?  I hate living in a country which is constantly at war and still has the death penalty.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I think this is a great set and probably the best box set I own. Most of the changes made to the movies were technical, except for the now infamous change made to ROTJ. And honestly, I watched it and it wasn't that bad. Was it unnecessary? Yes. But it doesn't ruin the film.    Now I do believe they need to release a remaster of the original versions, if only for archive purposes, but this set is still a good release.

Once I figured out how to avoid the trailers that go on for like 20 minutes, and how not to encounter them again, I was very happy.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|[Motorola Atrix (CM7-beta)] The game reminds me of Angry Birds, but with the change that this game has a set pattern you need to find to get the full 3 stars, but that is why this game is frustrating. In the first few levels, there are multiple ways to finish them, but about half-way through the first zone it become increasingly difficult to the point of feeling impossible because you HAVE to start the game off right or you will always fail. If you don't get three stars when you finally figure how to solve the higher levels I would be surprised since it seems there is only one way to solve most of them.  The graphics are fantasic on my Atrix and but for a few minor touchscreen issues (which may be due to the Otterbox cover I use) the gameplay is flawless. The cute animations and the sounds are complementary and not necessary which is nice since I don't usually play the games with sound.  What would have made this game better, or maybe just easy to understand how to play, would be to explain why a spider would move a certain direction or which bug he would go after given certain situations. I often find myself having to restart a level because the spider took a different direction than I was planning just because I cut a different web, even when that web was not in relation to the path he took the last I tried to complete the level. Though I will say that even though the spider doesn't always take the path I think he should be taking, he will consistently take the same path if given the exact same movements from me which tells me there is a pattern behind the movements and not random chance putting this game in the 100% skill category.  All-in-all, if you are patient and willing to try a level multiple times with the understanding that you might fail repeatedly before understanding the path the spider(s) will take then I highly recommend downloading this game. It can be a fun time waster, but definitely NOT for the impatient perfectionist.

0425241505|2.0|I don't know what I expected but I should have realized that this was not to my taste when I heard that Thea Harrison wrote Harlequin Presents Romance Novels as Amanda Carpenter.  It's not that I think that someone who writes HPs cannot write anything else or that HPs are particularly foul, but they are just not to my taste.  It also made me cranky.<br /><br />This book started off kind of fun with the heroine dealing with the fact that her ex had set her up to steal from a dragon's hoard putting her in mortal danger from a creature who had been born with the Universe itself and endowed with great power.  However about half way through I was glumly thinking that this book should have been named \\"The Thief and the Old Bad Tempered Greek Bajillionaire\\" in keeping with Harlequin title conventions.<br /><br />The fabulous dragon was acting like a foreign captain of industry not an eldritch creature of power.  And the female main character could have been a PA that his lust had happened to light on.  He's a total jerk because I guess that's what dragons are like.  The heroine keeps ending up in unintentional situations that he would misread and cause him to lose his temper-- I guess because that's what HP heroines are like.  Dragos blows up, heroine cries, Dragos does or says something that makes her feel all squishy inside.<br /><br />I did think it kind of sniggerngly funny that his dragon form was described as about the size of a private jet.  A captain of industry who could be his own Lear jet, how handy.<br /><br />Being captured by goblins was no different from being captured by villainous thugs.  The powerful villain opposing Dragos was essentially a Russian oligarch/mobster-- Heck, he's even named Yuri.  He's into mountain top removal and other noneco-friendly practices.  And we know that the heroine is pure of heart because she's a vegetarian.  And not just any vegetarian, she's a vegan-- with a few small lapses.  This does cause some difficulties when they are on the run from some villains in the wilderness and it's time to eat.<br /><br />As for the sex scenes, I  fast forwarded through them after the first one, not because I don't enjoy a hot encounter between characters but because I was bored.  Nothing to get the old juices flowing like being manhandled (dragonhandled?) and thrown around before sex. There was also way too much time spent hanging around the Weir while Dragos shows how thought he is by making sure she has her favorite shampoo and condition and she shows how worthy she is by feeding the homeless-- not personally, of course, and with Dragos' funds.<br /><br />This was an audio book.  It ran a smidge less than 13 hours.  It was read by Sophie Eastlake, who I haven't run into before. She's competent but that's about it. That name has to be pseudonym.<br /><br />This probably isn't a bad book for people who share the fantasy, but if you aren't into 6 foot 8 dragon shifters (with EVERYTHING in proportion, if-you-know-what-I-mean-and-I-think-you-do) who are older than dirt (literally) worked into a typical Harlequin Presents plot, then look elsewhere.in the wilderness and it's time to eat.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I am a new comer to Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester. This production had a theme of portraying the strength of character which Miss Eyre displayed throughout her life, from when she was banished by her aunt to the day she confronted the dying and bankrupt aunt in her empty parlor. The countryside of England was breath taking.  I was also struck by the use of candlelight throughout the home of Mr. Rochester.  Judy Dench was wonderful such a beautiful actress in all her roles.
0316098337|5.0|This novel takes us into an eleven foot by eleven foot storage shed that Jack and his mother call home. Jack was born in this room and it is his reality. Mother has known the outside world however, and until his fifth birthday Jack never knew that once, a long seven years ago, Mother was lifted from the streets and kidnapped to be held hostage by their nightly visitor, Old Nick.<br />Told entirely from the point of view of this intelligent little boy, \\"Room\\" shows us the great love that Mother has for Jack. They have a few books, the TV, a wardrobe--where Jack sleeps so Old Nick will never see him--and whatever they can beg for as a Sundaytreat. In return for Old Nick never seeing her son, she has given up all attempts to escape and allows her body to be sexually violated whenever he needs her. Jack, awake in the closet at night, counts the number of times Old Nick makes the bed squeak.<br />After explaining to Jack how she actually got in the shed, the two make an audacious attempt at escape, and miraculously pull it off. I don't want to spoil the surprise except to say it was the fastest I have ever read, skipping paragraphs and pages to get to the finale which brought me to tears. The book, if written as a novella, could have ended at their freedom. However, Donoghue has gone on to feed us a second well-crafted story, still from Jack's point of view to show the adjustments that the child had to go through to adapt to what we all think of as our reality.<br />This is a bright uplifting story that takes us from the near depths of a hellacious existence to a new life. I loved the imaginative, original work Donoghue placed in my hands. It is one for the ages, a plausible, but dark story with the light of hope shining as a beacon for all who dare read it.

B0052GACNM|4.0|Tony Bennett has been the embodiment of the Great American Songbook for so long and has won such a dedicated following with his artistry that he really has nothing left to prove. But he keeps at it for at least three very obvious reasons: he loves what he does, he wants to pay tribute to a uniquely American art form, and he hopes to win ever more fans for the music that has been his passion and livelihood for over 60 years.<br /><br />This duets album, Tony's second, ably serves the latter purpose. By bringing aboard platinum-selling popular singers, he both expands the audience for jazz and gives people known in other genres an opportunity to try something outside of their usual routine. And there are very few recording artists in the world who dare turn down a chance to work with Bennett. It's an honor for younger performers to be asked, as their careers benefit from his guidance and gravitas, while it's a pleasure for long-established stars, since they know his superb taste will make them sound good. He's the perfect partner: relaxed, sensitive, and giving.<br /><br />Most of the singers on this 85th birthday collection are of the new generation, but Natalie Cole, Sheryl Crow, Andrea Bocelli, and k.d. lang, who recorded an entire CD with Bennett in 2002, are among the few who have been around for a long time. Only two of his guests -- Aretha Franklin and Willie Nelson -- have anything approaching his longevity. The album boasts a diverse assortment of musical royalty: country, rock, soul and R&B, classical crossover, American and Latin pop, and others.<br /><br />This release is strongest at the beginning, when several pop performers surprise the listener with understated, frequently amusing, and genuinely pleasurable standards, among them Lady Gaga, John Mayer, and Michael Bubl&eacute;. Their smooth delivery jibes agreeably with Bennett's raspy croon and lyrical punch. The late lamented Amy Winehouse brings to mind Billie Holiday in a languid rendition of \\"Body and Soul,\\" and k.d. lang is a dreamy delight on \\"Blue Velvet.\\"<br /><br />I found the duet with Aretha Franklin less than successful, partly because of a mismatch in their voices and partly as a result of an overly slow tempo, yet it still has its moments. Sheryl Crow was similarly underwhelming, but the problem for me is an emotional detachment that presents a stark contrast to Franklin's quavering histrionics. With Willie Nelson, however, the album gets back on track; the two singers really seem to enjoy one another. Queen Latifah puts her acting skills to use on \\"Who Can I Turn To\\" and Norah Jones positively purrs on \\"Speak Low.\\"<br /><br />The remaining seven tracks are a mixed bag. The men -- Josh Groban, Andrea Bocelli, and Alejandro Sanz -- are so different from Tony in their approaches to the material that it sometimes struck me as odd. The ladies, on the other hand, complement his style wonderfully: Natalie Cole on a spirited \\"Watch What Happens,\\" Faith Hill on a subtle \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" and Carrie Underwood on a lush version of \\"It Had to Be You.\\" The album closes with a Mariah Carey duet in which she shows admirable restraint.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable recording and a welcome reminder of Tony Bennett's enduring vitality.ul,\\" and k.d. lang is a dreamy delight on \\"Blue Velvet.\\"<br /><br />I found the duet with Aretha Franklin less than successful, partly because of a mismatch in their voices and partly as a result of an overly slow tempo, yet it still has its moments.

B005D0TETA|5.0|Yes have about 19 different concerts available on the market, from all different eras, with countless different line-ups and of differing quality. Yes Symphonic Live has the unique selling point of being performed live in conjunction with a Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />The sound and visuals are top notch (apart from some cheesy, but thankfully short animations) and there are no major complaints to be made about the camera work or editing. The sound is equally impressive, balancing your need to hear the band's performance with your desire to hear the Orchestra's addition well.<br /><br />The actual performance is strong too, this concert stands on its own merits and is not worthwhile only because of the Orchestra's involvement. Howe, White, Squire and Anderson are on rare form and deliver classic material like \\"And You And I\\" and \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" with passion and precision.<br /><br />The tracklisting too, is perfect for this type of event. The material concentrates on Yes's grander and more symphonic works, the band manage to play three of their longest compositions \\"Close to the Edge,\\" \\"The Gates of Delirium,\\" and \\"Ritual\\" all in the same concert three hour concert. The track listing comprises primarily of material from the band's classic Wakeman/Howe/Anderson period (from `The Yes Album,' until `Going For The One') although there are one or two songs from their post millennial, orchestral album `Magnification,' in addition to the 1980s smash hit \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart,\\" which is the sole Trevor Rabin composition in the set.<br /><br />Despite the heavy leanings on Wakeman era material, Rick himself is absent from the band during this recording and the keyboards are handled by the talented Tom Brislin, who makes a more than capable replacement.<br /><br />Many other bands release Orchestral concerts (Kansas, ELP, Ian Anderson, Deep Purple, Kiss, Metallica and Serj Tankian, to name a few) and they usually deliver something interesting, providing a new spin to the music and inspiring the original musician's to give it their all. This is no exception and could even be described as one of the best examples of this sort of collaboration. After all, their albums `Time And A Word' and `Magnification' have given Yes Orchestra experience before and their music is so frequently described ad grand or symphonic on its own merits.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this Blu Ray to a first time buyer, however if you already have the DVD it isn't really all that essential for Upgrading, sure the sound is marginally better and the picture is a higher resolution obviously, if that is enough then by all means get the Blu Ray version, otherwise don't pick it up if you are happy enough with your existing copy; Yes put in a brilliant performance, it looks and sounds good, they play The Gates Of Delirium and the Orchestra adds considerably to the experience, but all that applies to the DVD edition as well.an's to give it their all.

B005OCFGTO|4.0|I like how a lot of fans are slamming Warner Brothers for offering up a box set containing all eight films in one compact package. They accuse how WB constantly does this for the Harry Potter franchise, and to be fair, WB has been doing incomplete Potter boxed releases for years, starting with \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" onwards. But when the WB actually makes a nice package with all eight films included, they still complain because there's hardly any bonus material. WB did this for their first four Batman movies before the glorious Batman Anthology came to be, so those fans have been waiting a long time that as well.  The set will just have a repressing of the initial releases, and the first three movies include their respective trailers, while \\"Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2\\" have deleted/extended scenes, so the \\"no extras\\" claim doesn't hold as much water. They have some, as opposed to none. Not to mention the quality of the past three Ultimate Editions' bonus features have declined to the point where I just stopped buying them (bulky packaging, no commentary and no extended editions are the deal-breakers). For me, I just want the movies, and this set allows that. For that alone it gets 4 stars. It's a no-frills package but worth it if you just want the movies and save shelf space.  If you want a comprehensive box set with tons of extras for each movie, you'll have to wait. Don't buy it if you don't want to.

B0052GACNM|3.0|Back in 1993, the music world was abuzz when Capitol Records announced Frank Sinatra's return to the recording studio...Frank! At Capitol!  So later that year we got Duets...it did well...so well in fact almost a year to the day later Duets II came out. But the Sinatra camp and Capitol Records launched a massive artistic fraud on the public. Yeah, Frank recorded most of the tracks, some were splices from concerts, but never were the suet partners together. Within weeks, we were digging out the classic recordings. I haven't played Duets in about 7 years.  At least Bennett recorded these face to face, and he sounds in fine form, so there is none of the artistic fraud as with the Sinatra sessions. But what is the point of these Duets sessions? Money...it is the music business.  But, some of these do sound good. The Bennett/ Norah Jones duet is worth the price of the disc...as is the Bennett/ Buble track.  But for those who are new to Bennett, do yourself a favor and find the original recordings. Most of these are inferior remakes, and often pointless.
0385534639|5.0|I'm finding it incredibly hard to review this book. I loved this novel; it drew me in and I wanted to live in its world. But I don't seem to have the words to explain how I feel about it, and what makes it so wondrous. And description seems ordinary.<br /><br />The plot of `The Night Circus' is simple: two very old magicians- real magicians, not illusionists- are playing a game. The game is played by having their apprentices perform the actual magical contest; if their apprentice wins, it proves they are the better teacher and that their methods are superior. This is not a fast thing; the contest takes place over years. The setting for the contest is the Night Circus, the production of a man of wealth who wants a unique show for the world- but he doesn't know just how unique it is. The two apprentices, Celia and Marco (respectively the circus Illusionist and the owner's assistant), rarely meet, but they get to know each other through their magical creations. And through what they see of each other this way, they fall in love, creating parts of the circus that they think the other will like. Rather than rivals, they become collaborators. There is an important subplot, involving the magical twins born in the circus the night it opened and a farmboy in America who longs to join them, and another about the fans of the circus.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of action in the story. There are circus acts, and dinners, and teas. The beauty of the book, to me, is in the descriptive passages. There aren't regular circus acts and there is no three ring tent. There are, instead, many small tents, with passages and patios; guests wander through what amounts to a small city of wonders. There is a garden made entirely of ice that never melts, trained kittens, fortune tellers, a tent of bottles of scents that evoke deep emotion, human statues, a gravity defying carousel with wooden animals that breathe, a living Wishing Tree, a very hot desert of sand with a starry sky- in the same tent as the ice garden- and much more. All are described with loving detail, as are the dinners of incredible, unfathomable dishes, and the clothing worn - clothing that changes colors and forms. Usually I would find this dwelling on detail and description at the expense of advancing the plot aggravating; in this book, it's absorbing.<br /><br />`The Night Circus' is a book about magic, but it's also magic to read. I did not want this story to end; like the fans of the Night Circus, who create an organization complete with newsletter for those who follow the circus as it roams the continents, I wished to visit the circus and its wonders as often as possible.

0525423273|4.0|In one word about Anna and the French Kiss, I call it int&eacute;ressante (interesting). I love reading books about French culture as much as I adore good young adult fiction, so when I found out about it I immediately had to have it. Very rarely do I read books that are both funny and cute, and as a result I am speechless on how to explain it in a logical way. I can say that this book made me happy that I read it.<br /><br />Even though at the heart of the story is romance, I can say that it is almost completely different from the bulk of books with love triangles. I can't give away too many spoilers, but I found it completely refreshing that Anna didn't immediately fall in love with St. Clair in less than a week of meeting him. In that regards, the relationship felt realistic with lots of suspense.<br /><br />In another realistic manner, Paris felt very well researched and written. Yes there really are lots of shops just like the ones in the book, and the landmarks are real places. It was details like that really made the book stand out in a positive way to make me believe the story. Reading this book made me want to go visit France because it mentioned a lot of the places I wanted to go see if I had taken the chance to study abroad<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this book to almost anyone over the age of 13. It was very clean with mostly kissing, so it is an ideal choice for very young adults.
0312370849|5.0|An excellent read.  This book takes you through time about Sarah and her key.  Telling you more could ruin the book.  Hard to put down.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The final film in the magical Harry Potter franchise definitely ended on a high. With amazing production values, such as brilliant set pieces, music, cinematography, and VFX. The acting is top-notch, and the story is amazingly staged, with perfect pace.   It really was 'epic'.
0385534639|5.0|I was skeptical at first, unsure of where this book was going to go... but as soon as I allowed the fantastic language and colorful characters to guide me, I was in for a stunning adventure. Morgenstern is a GIFTED writer and her storytelling is complex and original. I strongly recommend this book.
B00004SU5J|5.0|excellent  ,smooth balance between jazz& blues will purchased their music again although this was an older  cd it still fits todays modern trend of jazz
0756686970|5.0|This is by far the best Lego Star Wars character info I have, and I thought the iPhone app was good.  If your thinking of purchasing this book, think no longer and just buy it, you wont be disappointed ~.^  It has so much info on each character, it compliments the Lego Star Wars Dictionary by DK
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Despite most of the original music from the series is missing, the replacement tracks aren't half bad and don't take away from the show. My two major complaints of this set is that it the \\"Is It College Yet?\\" movie in this set is the oxymoron DVD release version that has been edited down by at least 10 minutes, instead of an original aired version that had its music altered (seems just plain lazy to me); and the set could have used more special features. The special features that are there are very enjoyable; all in all, this is a nice trip down memory lane for old Daria fan and an excellent way for any new fans to get into the series.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Here's the short of it--some of the changes are good, some are bad, but none of them should \\"ruin\\" the series for you unless you're an OCD rose-coloured glasses weirdo.  Good:  -Video cleaned up--there is absolutely no source available with better quality  -Numerous technical glitches fixed  -Tons of extras, including multiple commentary tracks per film  Bad:  -Greedo still shoots  -The infamous Vader \\"no\\"  -Obi Wan's intro scene in Ep 4 has him making a pretty awkward krayt dragon noise  -Some Blu-Ray players have trouble because there appears to be new copy protection applied to some of the discs; this should be a temporary thing though once software/firmware updates hit.  I had trouble with Ep. 2 but within a day my software had been updated and everything was fine  I used to be completely crazy for Star Wars.  I read every single Star Wars novel that existed at the time.  My favorite PC games were X-Wing, TIE Fighter (Defender of the Empire of course), and Dark Forces. I would have trivia battles with one of my friends over such riveting topics as the name of the guy with the gas mask who snitched on the crew in Ep. 4 as they made their way off Tatooine.  I say this because I KNOW what it's like to love this series.  Coming from that sort of background, even I am not flipping out over this Blu-Ray set.  Honestly, only the Vader \\"no\\" is egregious enough to make me pause.  But if it bothers you that much, just rip the Blu-Ray, take the audio from the DVD's version of the scene and put that in.  That's what I plan on doing.  Too technical?  Well, watch an older copy of ROTJ and quit letting two dubbed-in words ruin your life.  Every other change is minor enough that they, at most, evoke a \\"Why did Lucas change that?  Oh well\\" response.  I can confidently report that I did not embark upon a murderous rampage after seeing R2 hiding behind some rocks that weren't there in the original film.  Honestly, if you're going to complain about something, complain about the prequel movies, especially Ep. 1 and 2.  Those are like the equivalent of 2 hours of Vader \\"no\\"s.  The Blu-Ray set is fine.
B004I9G486|1.0|Part did not work at all! Audi even exchanged the AMI than they checked it and with the Audi Original part and the AMI connected without problem but not with the cable I bought via Amazon.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|The product distorts the video of the Kinect and makes the motion sensor jittery and hard to control.  I tired different placements and various distances, but nothing smoothed the zoom use.  Once I took the zoom off everything returned to normal.  Could it still be used, Yes, but it would be frustrating through every step of the game(s). I'm glad some people (less than 40% of the reviewers to date) had some luck with this product.  I did all of the setup and did it twice more including full Kinect calibration and it just doesn't work like it should.
B005COO1X6|4.0|\\"Mile 81\\" is a short story that reads very much like the \\"classic\\" King of the years of 'Night Shift' or 'Skeleton Crew' - and that comes with both good points and bad.<br /><br />\\"Mile 81\\" is a reminder of King's mastery of the art of the setup. He takes an ordinary thing - say, for example, a mud-caked station wagon rolling to a stop just outside an abandoned rest area, it's driver door popping open just a bit - and turns it into something suspenseful, with that weird vibe that only King can get quite right. In \\"Mile 81\\" things progress quickly into the horrific and the supernatural, as one person after another stops to investigate the strange car.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the pitch-perfect setup and neat characterization of \\"Mile 81\\" leads up to one of King's occasional weaknesses. It's a story that feels like it's leading up to something really cool...and then disappoints in the last few pages. Good endings are hard to find sometimes, and it felt like there could have been a good, satisfying ending to this story. But there's no other way to say it, the ending King wrote for \\"Mile 81\\" was a letdown.<br /><br />The Kindle download of this story also includes an excerpt of King's forthcoming novel, '11/22/63,' about the Kennedy assassination.  I'm looking forward to the novel, which I think is prime King material, but I have to say that the segment included here was also underwhelming - I hope for better when I read the full book.<br /><br />\\"Mile 81\\" starts out well and moves fast, and for fans of the classic King of old, it will surely grab you (pun perhaps intended) as it did me. I only wish it finished as strongly as it started.
B005460302|1.0|So if you're not going to invest any time into a release, why even bother? The DVD that was previously released a few years ago actually had a decent amount of special features. This release? Not ONE. NOTHING. They couldn't even put those on this release? The only thing that the BluRay did better is spell Dedee Pfeiffer's name correctly on the front cover.<br /><br />If you want just the movie, this would be fine for you. If you want a decent release with some really cool special features, try to track down the original DVD release, or if you already have it, don't bother \\"upgrading\\"...
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I am a Lovatic through and through! I've been a fan of demi's from the beginning!

B005E8KQPM|2.0|I'll be short.  This album appears to have had one criteria during the song writing process: that it NOT be metal. They went out of their way to avoid anything that sounded even remotely metal, and the album suffers a great deal because of it.    There are various sections which do absolutely nothing at all musically, particularly in the middle sections of the album (the completely disjointed outro to the already horrible \\"Slither\\" through \\"Famine\\"). Apparently Akerfeldt has come to the conclusion that spooky atmospherics and destinationless guitar noodling are a valid substitute for musical structure and melody, when they aren't.  One can listen to each song song for just a few seconds and know exactly what band/style they're impersonating. Unfortunately all of those bands are 35+ years old, and Opeth hasn't done much to update on those sounds, IMO. \\"Slither\\" could be on any Rainbow or Dio era Deep Purple album, and no one would blink an eye. Also unfortunately, I don't care for either band (or the style in general), and certainly don't care for a band trying to emulate their sound almost 40 years later. These are not homages, but straight-up copies in many respects. A GOOD homage is Porcupine Tree's \\"Time Flies\\", and that's DESPITE using a Pink Floyd line verbatim.  There are certainly sections which make a listener say \\"that's definitely Opeth\\", but unfortunately, those moments are few and far between. Perhaps once or twice on the album one can say \\"That Rocks!\\" (and please don't confuse hard or heavy with rocking because they aren't the same and I don't mean to conflate those ideas - in short, a song needn't be hard for it to rock), and those moments are small islands surrounded by a sea of suck.  This album is by far the biggest disappointment of 2011.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I loved this short story. I was disappointed to see it end so quickly. The premise and the characters could have given Mr. King's readers so much more had he chosen to develop the story further. This could easily have become another \\"Under The Dome\\".
B0051CSI0G|3.0|An unidentified plague has wiped out civilization - its victims are transformed into vicious, carnivorous animals who feast on the living.  No, not zombies - vampires, killed with a stake through the heart.  One man, a vampire hunter/killer known only as Mister, traverses the wrecked countryside with an apprentice, a teen boy the hunter took under his wing after the boy's family was slaughtered by the creatures.  Together, they and a few other stragglers try to reach Canada - 'New Eden' - while avoiding vampires and cultists who see the plague as the work of God.  This film has one specific flaw - otherwise this is actually an excellent, albeit gory, apocalyptic genre film.  Depending on how one feels about this flaw will probably determine - if one is already predisposed to like these kinds of films - how well they enjoy 'Stakeland'.  The problem is that it just takes itself too darn serious.    Martin, the boy apprentice, narrates portions of the story, and, similar to a Terrence Malick film, this narration doesn't always match up with the onscreen action.  The boy's voice, plus musical and visual cues, elicit a great deal of melacholy, and create a heightened sense of drama.  This has a much better chance of working in a film such as [[ASIN:079215455X Days of Heaven]] because it takes place in a world that is at least recognizable, if not familiar.  In 'Stake Land', this effort at emotional heft seems ridiculously overwrought.  I'm unable to fully let go and immerse myself in the story's fantastic elements, because the film keeps trolling for my sympathy, and by that very act disrupts my suspension of disbelief.  There's a very good chance that others will not feel this way about the film.  For those who can ignore this emotional ploy, or who don't notice it, or who can buy into it, I think the rest of the film works pretty well.  There were several unsurprising moments, but then there were also some that I didn't see coming - and, given the premise, much of thecharacter's motivations and actions seem consitent.  Nick Damici, as the hunter Mister, is a bit too cool for school, but doubtless that will be more attractive rather than detrimental to a large portion of the audience for this film.    Overall, one significant flaw, which for me, seriously impinges on the film's rating.  Still worth a definite look by horror fans, especially those intrigued by the post-apocalypse genre.  A defect on the rental disc prevented me from watching the bonus materials included on the blu-ray.  Two commentaries are included; one with the director and principle actors; the other with the director and some of the technical crew.  Other features were making of documentaries and trailers.
B005LAZIRY|3.0|On Nepenthe, I remember thinking this sounds like that Dewey Cox song where he is strung out on acid and asking for 50,000 didgeridoos.  This album has its moments. From Watershed, everyone knew where Akerfeldt was headed.  Its still a good listening.But certainly at the bottom of the Opeth catalog.  I miss the old Opeth of Martin & Martin and Petr.   Can Akerfeldt and Steve Wilson just make up their own band already?
B004SGWYVA|4.0|This anime series is very good. It is an enjoyable experience. I recommend this anime for people who like ziombes and story.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Loved that a game this fun and challenging was a free app, although its good enough that I'd pay for it. That's saying alot as I'm a cheap son-of-a-gun!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Enjoyable but I got it free. Thought it was for babies at first but it gets better and harder the farther u go.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Each level is pretty fun. It's challenging, and some of the levels really make me think. It doesn't really frustrate me though, like some puzzle games do.
B005DZMODI|3.0|I wanted more.  Maybe my expectations based on the artists noted here set me up a bit.  But this audio/cd does not satisfy.  Taken apart - both Clapton and Marsalis are exemplary musicians (not that either one of them awaits my approval one way or the other), together it does not work.  First - something about the band's approach to jump blues is a bit too classical or Mr. Clapton's approach is either too fluid or timid.  Second - and I am speaking for myself here - there may have been tension between artists, despite liner notes to the contrary as there is something slightly uncomfortable in the application or at least it seems so to me.  Solos are slightly off key, the clarinet a bit sour instead of a bit blue for lack of better way to say it.  The presentation as a whole lacks...flow.<br /><br />But there are moments - I appreciate the interpretation of Layla.  The addition of jazz flavors this piece quite nicely.  Well done.  I felt that Careless Love and Joe Turner's Blues hinted strongly at the potential this pairing could have delivered.<br /><br />To be fair, the few days of rehearsal did not seem to serve the depth of talent represented here.  And finally, I wasn't there for the performance at the Lincoln Center.  What seems magical about a live performance is lost at times when presented in another medium.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|Be very careful when you buy this blu-ray, will not work in some Sony 3D blu-ray players, and some Samsung.  There are some work-arounds online, but they don't always work and who wants to do that everytime.  It's too bad Fox really dropped the ball on this blu-ray, it is a great movie.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Works great on my Ipad but will not connect using Droid X, I guess I lost $5 like the other reviewer said.  Would be nice to have some customer support.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I frequently am brought to tears. It is a terrible habit of mine. But in this case, those tears are so deserved. 21 by Adele is a wonderful mapping of the process one goes through in the course of a breakup, particularly a brutal one and Adele seemed to experience in the last few years. What's incredible is that she can write and represent the mutual experience of so many individuals no matter the age, no matter the gender, no matter the turmoil. A specific favorite of mine is most definitely the bridge \\"One and Only,\\" on the surface a declaration of love but take a closer look and you realize its in many ways a hopeful plea for a reunion. It is as if she is trying to say, \\"I'm here, in front of you, get a clue\\" but in a far more eloquent and romantic way. And who hasn't felt like that at some point, who hasn't wanted to say exactly that? And let's not forget another gorgeous song that is \\"Set Fire to the Rain.\\" Without fail, it demonstrates another facet of a relationship's demise: the fury, the loud and screaming heartache all piercing through the unbelievable force of Adele's chorus. No matter which stage one finds his/herself - the honeymoon period, the lulls, the beginning of the end, the aftermath - there is something in this record for everyone.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I really don't understand all the poor reviews. Yes some of the changes are a bit annoying, but seriously 1 star? This classic series deserves better than that! Many of these reviews were written before the actually release of the set.
B002MXA7TC|4.0|I won't admit how I first came across The Temper Trap's Conditions, mostly because it would mean acknowledging I saw an episode or two of a show I am a tiny bit embarrassed I watched (ehem Chuck; yes would you believe it? I did not discover this band through (500) Days of Summer!?!). But boy am I glad that this wonderful Australian band let the program use \\"Down River,\\" only one of several superb songs on this record. I think what makes Conditions an excellent listen first and foremost in the penetrating falsetto of Dougy Mandagi. And what's more remarkable, how you can tell when seeing him and his band mates perform, how humble the group is. AND they have no reason to be so humble. It is truly a fantastic debut, from Sweet Disposition - probably the most well-known song on the album that could not only be heard as a love song but also as a depiction of that which is fleeting when we're young - to Fools, a tremendous song about perseverance. I love every second of this first album and while it sometimes lacks the cohesion that I tend to look for in records, I think it is definitely worthwhile. I sincerely look forward to the band's next album.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|When I saw the announcement of the Kinect Zoom back in May, I was excited to say the least. Given my limited playroom using the Kinect effectively was a challenge. Low and behold the Kinect Zoom arrives at my doorstep last week. I through it on top of my Kinect and hope to actually be able  to play Kinect games with ease. I go ahead  and fire up the Kinect Tuner and the damn thing can not recognize my floor. No matter how I placed it(on top and below my TV) it just could not configure itself. I went ahead and even started to process a return/refund via Amazon, because I could not get it to work. So in this whole process, I decided to give it one more try. I placed the sensor below my TV and it was able to configure itself correctly. I then went ahead and put the sensor on top of my TV and fired up Kinect Adventures. The Zoom was working perfectly, I even had to move closer to my TV so I would not be too far away. I tried the setup on 2 different games (Child of Eden, Kinect Sports) and the Kinect Zoom did its job. I had no issues with motion tracking or anything. I  I really do not get this product. It seems to not be working for tons of people. There seems to be an issue with it when it originally tunes itself with your Xbox. It seems like if you can actually get itself to complete the calibration step then you are good to go. It was not working for me now it is.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I must say to start that I have been a fan of the 1st run of Star Wars films since I was old enough to appreciate them (which is early teen years). I'm still a fan with the completion of the prequels & a much broader understanding of the (now) last 3 films. For those people who want to nit-pick, cry, complain & , in essence, bitch about the re-mastering, tweaking &  repackaging of this epic saga is an all-around grow-up & appreciate it for what it is; storytelling on the grandest scale ever!! These are the ground-breaking films by which all other sagas that follow will be measured. That means Harry Potter, Twilight, & quite possibly Stephen King's The Dark Tower will follow in line as some of the best told stories ever put to film (although not a fan of Twilight, an example just the same!) in a series.  If George Lucas feels that the finished product isn't to his satisfaction, either from technological limitations from the past or adding previously deleted scenes to tell HIS story, then let him finish off what he intended to in the first place!! These are his stories, like it or not!! I'm not going to go off by saying what I like or what I don't like about this set. I do have my own reservations, but who cares, I still like the stories & what they bring me back to; my childhood. So a scream isn't what it should be or the lightsaber is pink!! Are you kidding me!? That last one's my favorite! Buy it or don't buy it; I don't think George Lucas has a counter. He as well as I have better things to do. Either watch or change the channel.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I dig Martin. I think he writes some amazing books. The first three Ice and Fire books are novels I will enjoy for years to come. That being said this book left a bitter taste in my mouth. There was some good Martin here but every time the story circled to Daenerys I wanted to take a nap, instead I skimmed chapters. There was a point, about 2/3rds in, where I just about jumped up because such an amazing scene happened. Then the book when back to MEH-land. The place where Martin seems to have become quite comfortable over the last few years.<br /><br />But I get it. I'm a writer myself and I know that not everyone will 'get' your work. I am glad the book is finally out but it is truly about 300 pages long. I wish he would have released the second half of Feast, as he talked about so many years ago, instead of this mishmash of two books that somehow packs an unbelievable amount of boredom into what HAD become one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time. The time flow is just disjointed and the ending was far from satisfying. Kill your darlings but for crying out loud, leave at least a few likable characters around for the next book.<br /><br />The thing is, Martin is doing what he loves and people are buying his books like crazy. So go George, man, more power to you. I just hope that:<br /><br />1. The next book is better and doesn't take 6 FRIGGING YEARS!<br />2. He doesn't go out like Jordan, leaving reams of notes for someone else to finish what he could not.<br />3. He gets to see this entire epic made on HBO. I know I hope for the same.<br /><br />If you are a Martin fan you pretty much have to read this book. There is simply no way to encompass the entire novel with someone else's notes before the next book. Unless you just give up.<br /><br />So pick up this massive tome and when it gets slow just smack yourself in the forehead with it. When you come too, you will look at the book in a whole new perspective.
0439023513|5.0|this is the book for you. If you're looking for a fairy tale, as others have mentioned, you will be disappointed. The first two books in this series feature Katniss's grow and cope with the situation she finds herself in, and this book in many ways, documents the toll that  takes on her, and there's something inherently honest about that expierience. No, this book did not end the way I expected it to, but it ended in a way that doesn't gloss over the struggle that the survivors, who fight so hard to stay alive, endure when the battle is done.
B00005JMYI|1.0|You cannot say a single thing bad about this movie.  No. Seriously. If you do, Will Ferrells minions will pester you until you remove your original review. They are relentless. And for some unfathomable reason, they think that recycled SNL skits make a good movie.  Honestly. This movie is so bad I cannot even work up the energy to defend my original bad review of it.  Fine. Go ahead. Watch it. But be aware that every time you do you are only encouraging this kind of behavior.

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|The first time I read \\"Jane Eyre\\" novel I was a young, impressionable girl who found the book deeply moving by both words and its content.  Ever since, there has not been a version of the movie or a TV show where the wonderful story was retold by a new director and the piece showcasted a new generation of talented classical actresses (mainly British).  For that reason alone, I could not wait to see this movie.<br /><br />What makes this version different is that it is told in a series of flashbacks.  We go back and forth from Jane's early chidlhood, to her day as a governess at Mr. Rochester's home.  It is easy to understand her character, determination and strength from reflecting to some of the major events in her life that shaped her personality that is beautiful beyond her physical attributes.  If it is a beauty from inside that makes a person, Jane is absolutely adorable with her patience, steadfast devotion to her vocation and her friends and her intelligent ways of expressing herself.<br /><br />Film is beautiful in a way storytelling is done.  Costumes are fine, music is enchanting and the cast absolutely fantastic.  I loved this new version of Jane Eyre story and I strongly recommend it.
1609611543|1.0|Though low carb worked for me for a little while, days really, I went back to eating carbs because I was hungry. I've learned since reading this book that meat makes us unhealthy. Just look at the writer of this book now, he's not healthy looking. Though there must be some truth to how wheat has changed and therefore may not be healthy, I'm not disputing that but I know eating meat is not the answer to the problem. Eat other starches and grains but don't stop eating them.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have noticed that many die-hard fans of this series (one of which I am) are rushing to judge this set before any of us have really had much of a chance to critique it, and I say to those who are condemning it out of the gate to BACK OFF. I am one of the biggest Star Wars fans out there amongst the many (have been since I was old enough to walk), but I think many of the die-hards are missing a few key points here:  1) This series does not belong to the die-hards, no matter how much we may pretend it does. At the end of the day, it is the masterpiece of GEORGE LUCAS, and thus it belongs TO HIM. If he wants to make changes to his unequivocal masterpiece before he dies, then he has every right to do so. Do you know how many changes the greatest of artists made to their masterpieces before their deaths? Countless. And why? Because they wanted to get as close to their individual visions as possible before they died. George Lucas is no different. He knew fans would buy this set, changes or no changes. Therefore, he obviously made the changes because he decided they belonged there. So GET OVER IT! Quit condemning his judgment before you've even had a chance to thoroughly investigate it.  2) The set is actually NICE! The way it is put together is very nice, and the extras with it are great from what I have seen so far. So what really is the problem here? Lucas adds a few rocks to a scene, and we're gonna smash up what he has give us and demand he reverse course on his own masterpiece? Please.  3) This is the first time we have ever had all the films united into one set, a day many of us have long been waiting for, notwithstanding the fact that we have long waited for these films to be released in high-definition as well for a long time. Is that not reason to at least celebrate a bit? I mean come on.  In short, I am amazed at the amount of whining (yes, whining) going on with some of the reviews I have been reading that were written before the set was even released and justa few days after its release, hardly enough time to give it a fair hearing and thoroughly critique it. I have personally viewed the films and see nothing majorly wrong with the updates Lucas has made to them. Will it be something to get used to? Of course it will. But am I going to cry and whine about it like a crime has been committed? No. I am just as big of a die-hard fan of this series as many of the whiners on here, and I may not personally agree with all the things Lucas has done to the films, but I also understand that he has the sole right to do so as the creator and that if he is making these changes, he obviously intended it to be this way. So I would suggest all of you stop rushing to judge this set to the gallows before even knowing what is in it. Quit ruining it for more moderate fans of the series who are looking to the reviews to determine whether or not they would like this set. Let them be the judges of this set, because it's clear that many die-hards are in no shape to give an accurate judgment on this set. It's a sad day when grown adults (the whiners) start behaving like spoiled children who want vanilla ice cream (the original unedited versions of the films) but instead are given chocolate (the updated blu-rays) by Dad (George Lucas), and then they decide to scream at the top of their lungs (the narrow-minded reviews), throw down the ice cream cone refusing to try it (refusing to even give the new versions a chance), and kick him because they didn't get their way (the character assaults on George Lucas).
B0029LB2V4|5.0|When I joined Amazon Prime, I started surfing through their unlimited videos and came across this gem. I had heard about the show before but never gave it a chance. Once I started this series, I found myself staying awake late into the night because I just had to know what happened next. While this show is historically based, the writers do take a certain creative license - it works. Overall, if you like stories about scandal, history, monarchy, and some type of sex in practically every episode, then you will enjoy the Tudors Season 1. I'm just started season 2 today and so far, I intend to complete the series - all the way through season 4. Not only do I enjoy the show, I feel like I get more bang for my Amazon Prime bucks - after all, it beats Netflix's new price plan. Anyhow, give the Tudors a shot and treat it like one long movie, I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a wonderful game that is relaxing and challenging at the same time!  You try to solve each puzzle in the shortest number of moves - the challenging part.  The atmosphere. music and control system make it a wonderful and relaxing experience.  This is worth much more than the 99 cent price.  Don't miss out on this one.
0316017930|5.0|This book has changed the way I think!  As a mother of two children, it has motivated me to work harder and I use stories in the book to motivate them.  I can't stop talking about this book!  It really makes me appreciate the value of hard work.
B004V98UKS|5.0|I love this game. It is a logic puzzler (?)  forces you to plan ahead several steps and avoid trapping yourself. Simple execution but intriguing and challenging. If you like Quell you will like this. I don't have issues with the controls on my evo.
1400069181|5.0|It was a lot of fun to read about the struggles and triumphs of TOMS before the company was a true success. Not only do you relate to Blake and his friends, especially if you have ever wanted to start a business, but you also get caught up in \\"their story\\" and the emotional moments they have during shoe drops. The book inspires and informs through Blake's ability to both show us how his idea came about due to a simple conversation with a stranger and how starting small while being innovative with little to no resources can be just the thing that makes you successful.

B002QBS9KE|5.0|Plantronics may have started out with a pure business focus, but their products are just as relevant in the mainstream.  They are of exceptional quality.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story is very addictive. I found myself always taking out my kindle and open this book every time I don't have anything else todo. Even spent long hours past midnight still reading. The adventure is exciting and the romance is not annoying. Most of stories out there put out the love triangle theme to the point it annoys the readers, but in this story while there are love triangle but it's not the focus of attention.<br /><br />Warning though, this is not the kind of happy joy-joy story, but this is a survival story, so embrace yourself.
B005O30Y5Y|2.0|I'm sorry to disagree with the majority of the other reviewers, but this film was to me the weakest of the eight that have been done on the Harry Potter novels. Anyone who hadn't read the book would have been completely lost from the very beginning, with too many incomprehensible plot elements thrown at him in rapid fire. Only someone with printed novel freshly in his mind as he entered the theater would have been able to keep it all straight and understand what everything meant.   In addition, several key scenes from the book are badly underdone in the film, chief among them the shoot-out between Belatrix le Strange and Molly Weasley. In the film version there is no last minute reprieve by all the families of the students charging into the battle to save the day --- Molly Weasley is just somehow there at Hogwarts for her big moment --- and then when it comes, it is just a matter of Molly delivering her key line and exchanging a few seconds worth of fire with Belatrix, and then it's over, before it's even well begun.   To make matters worse, there is absolutely no chemistry between Harry and his longtime love Ginny Weasley. She's just there, and screams once when it appears Harry is dead, and then appears strangely silent and wooden  as his wife, in the \\"19 years later\\" scene.  This movie might be improved to some extent if it were to be completely re-cut, but it remains the weakest of the Harry Potter films.

B00005T7I1|5.0|I never got into the `Dick Tracy' comic books, but my friends were pretty heavy into it.  As a young boy I remember seeing this film countless times, and while I didn't indulge in the source material, I must admit that the film holds a special place in my heart.  To this day I am still rather nostalgic about this film.  Having recently dug it out of my DVD library and dusted it off for a viewing I am even more so enthralled by what Warren Beatty was able to do.<br /><br />`Dick Tracy' is just pure joy.<br /><br />While I don't think it is as universally successful as `Who Framed Roger Rabbit' (a film that is undoubtedly a visual and tonal inspiration for this film), I can't help but adore `Dick Tracy'.  Beatty perfectly meshed two worlds (the gritty underbelly with the cartoonish exaggerated) to create a singular piece, a film that felt whole despite being slightly uneven.  While the script itself is not a strong suit, the film understands the shallowness it is saddled with and rises above by focusing on more intimate moments and relationships.  It knows that a plot this generic needs something solid to anchor it, and Beatty enlists some tremendous talents to do just that.<br /><br />Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Dick Van Dyke, Glenne Headly, William Forsythe, Charles Durning, Madonna, Paul Sorvino, Kathy Bates, Catherine O'Hara, James Caan, Estelle Parsons and Warren Beatty himself.  That's quite the cast (and that's just the more recognizable names).  Even with the big names, it's young Charlie Korsmo (yes, the kid from `Hook') that makes the biggest impression.<br /><br />The film centers on Dick Tracy, the famed detective who has a knack for busting crime lords with ugly faces.  His biggest rival is Big Boy Caprice (played by a heavily masked Al Pacino playing, well, Al Pacino).  During the film, Tracy meets a young orphan who he takes under his wing.  He also struggles with commitment to his girlfriend, especially when he meets the sultry club singer Breathless Mahoney.  Breathless is now under the tyrannical thumb of Big Boy, but Tracy is hot on his tail, seeking to end his rule of the city.<br /><br />While the story flows in predictable patterns, the film is pure visual eye candy, and the actors breathe so much charisma into every scene.  Pacino earned an Academy Award nomination for yelling a lot, which is basically the same thing he does in every performance SINCE this movie.  It's hard to say that the performance is bad, because this is quite frankly the BEST use of his lazily pigeonholed acting talents (god, he was so amazing in his prime).  Sadly, he's been reduced to a caricature since the early 90's, playing variations of the same character over and over.  Behind the makeup and ill fitted costumes, there is Al Pacino playing himself yet again.  Madonna sizzles and the slew of famous faces slumming as hideous baddies (Sorvino, Hoffman, Forsythe) are all noteworthy.<br /><br />But yes, it is Korsmo who infuses young `Kid' with so much natural wonderment and spunk!<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is not a masterpiece but maybe it is, of nostalgic proportions.  It is a landmark film that is wholly enjoyable and one that would give more than half the `family films' made today a good run for their money.honey.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|I  really enjoy it. It is simple to play and forces you to think. How does one keep the sound off?

0547258305|5.0|What a great concept with the idea of an ability that sets you apart, with the reflection of it showing in one's eyes - a feature that is so hard to disguise.  And the worldbuilding was nicely revealed through Katsa's colorful eyes and limited (and feared-by-everyone) point of view.  Katsa is a marvelous heroine -- strong, but uncertain, unyielding, but adaptable.  Though she has plenty of insecurities, she never lets that get in her way.  I loved watching her journey, and though she sometimes did things that made me groan, it was all in character and I was rooting for her all the way.  And Po...oh, Po.  What a great hero.  The secondary characters are all well written too.  I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series!
B0054N73EY|5.0|I should begin this review by explaining that I'm not the world's biggest RHCP fan. I can't stand most of their early stuff, with a few exceptions (Knock Me Down, Behind the Sun are a couple). I think One Hot Minute and By the Way are very uneven albums with a few outstanding songs (Aeroplane, Can't Stop, and Zephyr Song to name a few). I think Californication is a great album with some of the best tracks the band ever did, but nowhere near the all time classic that many fans think it is.   To make a long story short, I'm more of a fan of their later sound, although Blood Sugar Sex Magik would probably rank as my favorite Peppers album. Stadium Archadium is also a great album, although it suffers from way too much filler. For me, the Chili Peppers usually put out albums that aren't super consistent. A lot of great stuff in the beginning but they usually drag a little in the middle.   So this review is coming from a big fan, but not a \\"die hard\\" fan. Okay? Great. Glad we got that settled.   As far as this album goes... it's fantastic. While there are no crazy mega standout tracks like Under the Bridge, Otherside, or By the Way, I think it might be the most consistently good album of their career.   It's a different sound, obviously, but there's nothing wrong with a little evolution in a band that's been around for a couple decades. Do we really want the same thing over and over? Nothing wrong with growing up a little. If that's your complaint about this band's progression, maybe it's not the boys who have a problem...    As far as the individual songs go, it's one great track after another. Monarchy of Roses and Factory of Faith start this thing off strong, eviscerating any worries that the band is losing steam. Both have great choruses, and distinct sounds. Roses ,in particular, is a very unique song and a risk that I think paid off exponentially. Brendan's Death Song keeps the momentum going with a less upbeat sound that gets better as the song progressives. Easilyone of the best songs they have done in a while. Ethiopia is another strong tune with a great chorus.   Annie Wants a Baby, a song I originally didn't like, has really grown on me. It's definitely a more mellow song about a somber topic. Their slower tunes on the last couple albums sometimes blend in without any distinction. Annie manages to rise above with a more distinct sound. It's the one on the album that will grow on you, even if you don't know it. Look Around was also one I considered a letdown, because it had that generic RHCP sound that could've appeared on any previous album. I'm warming up to it more through, it's like a little slice of the best qualities of the early Peppers (a period I kinda despise overall).   Rain Dance Maggie then comes rolling in. We've known the single for a while now, and even though a lot of people were disappointed, I love it. It has a great groove and a catchy-as-all-hell chorus, even if it's not the powerhouse that Dani California was (yeah, I still like it). Did I Let You Know keeps the momentum going, which gets kicked into high gear with the kick ass Goodbye Hooray. As the album goes from rage to joy, Happiness Loves Company bounces along with some great piano accompaniment.   If one song is going to end up being considered a \\"classic\\", I could see it being Police Station. Everyone already loves this one, and I'm one more voice singing in that choir. One of the best ballad-type songs this band has ever done. The mellowness of Police Station doesn't last long, because Even You Brutus rips across your speakers. With a classic Chili Peppers rap and a killer chorus, it's a great callback to their older sound with a fresh new twist.   Meet Me at the Corner is a grower. It creeps up on you and continues to stand out with more and more listens. Dance Dance Dance could be used as the definition of a filler song, although it is a fun, easy song to sing along with.  With a few missteps aside, this is a classic Red Hot Chili Peppersalbum. It could end up being my all time favorite, maybe second after BSSM. It's one flaw is that there is no massive \\"Greatest Hit\\" type song that almost every other album has. It reminds me of Death Magnetic by Metallica. Their best album since Master of Puppets, but there was no total stand-out song. Although it's a minor flaw... because I'd rather have an album that proves the band can still put out consistently good stuff, rather than one that cranks out a single great song in a pile of garbage.    Also, while John Frusciante's presence is missed, it doesn't prevent the band from creating this new age treasure. If anything, it shows how strong the rest of these guys are. They can lose a key player and hardly miss a beat. Although, they might be just be a little lucky that they have one of the best bass players of the past 30 years to call on.   I'm With You might be a new direction for this band, but it's deeply rooted in the sounds of their past. A mix of old and new, with a result that is pure happiness. And I welcome many more years of the boy maturing and growing. Because if these are the kind of albums older and wiser Chili Peppers are gonna put out, I'll be with them for a while.   Cheers.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great, simple workout. It offers three 20 minute work outs that are fun, effective and safe. Some reviews on here have said that they experienced knee trouble or that it is not safe for knees, which made me hesitant. I have used this every day since purchase and not had a problem. She clearly states throughout the work outs what to avoid and how to prevent injury. A great purchase!!
B0000AOV85|5.0|They are just great. Know the way this team of genius, created one of the most important pieces of the music; and it is not only the music, but the concept and philosophy behind it.<br />They pushed the technology available in the 70s when there where no 5.1 sorround... but they discovered it and made it as a handcraft creation.  If you are one of those who divided the PF fans among Gilmour's Followers vs. Waters', this piece will show you that PF in an indivisible body, that will last forever in the music history, just as Bach, Bethoveen or Mozart. Enjoy!!!!

0765326353|5.0|First of all, do yourself a favor and pick up the hardback version of this book. Physically, it is a beautiful book with an imprint of a sword on the front and gorgeous full-color artwork in the front and back. Additionally the book contains frequent illustrations that are expertly drawn and do a great job of filling in little details without going so far as to completely remove your imagination's part in rendering the scenes. At over 1000 pages, this is a hefty book that seems daunting at first glance and could understandably lead a potential reader to assume that he or she would be in for a lot of filler and fluff. Let me put those fears aside for you- this is a serious page turner with almost no wasted space. I found every chapter to be either directly or indirectly relevant to the plot. Even the interludes served to fill in a little more detail about important people or places without being entirely unrelated to the rest of the book.<br /><br />The fantasy world that Sanderson has crafted is one of the best of its kind. There is magic, but at least in this first book, it mostly integrates in a logical, realistic fashion. Yes, there are a few soldiers storming about with the fantasy equivalent of power armor and lightsabers, but the author ensures that these men are not invincible and serve a logical purpose within a larger army. The greatest magic users, known as Soulcasters, are able to transmute matter from one form into another, and are naturally a vital resource of shelter and supplies for the armies represented. The \\"fuel\\" needed to perform these tasks is also, again logically, a central part of the battles. There is an incredible amount of detail beyond the magic system, including the cultures of the land and the organization of the armies, but what is perhaps most impressive is that these details are revealed naturally during the course of the story. Sanderson practices \\"show, don't tell\\" very effectively in this regard.<br /><br />The handfull of main characters are interesting with well developed backgrounds who most importantly act in a believable, human fashion. I really can't stress that last part enough. At no point was I frustrated because the characters were \\"playing dumb\\" for the sake of the story, as is often the case in fantasy novels. These characters have strong convictions, but each one changes his or her mind or compromises on points either do to natural character progression or urgency.<br /><br />Finally, I'd like to note that while this is the first book in a planned series, it stands well on its own as a complete story. I was left wanting more and excited about the next book, but I was not left feeling unfulfilled. The characters all reached important milestones near the end and the major plots reached good points to pause at. Furthermore there is no \\"all is going according to plan until the last two chapters and then everything falls apart\\" moment that marginalizes the characters' efforts and has become so cliche for books with planned sequels.<br /><br />Five stars, excellent read, can't wait for the next one.ting with well developed backgrounds who most importantly act in a believable, human fashion.

B003Y5H53S|1.0|This movie was boring and had nothing to hold you to continue watching but I did. The ending was the only part of the movie that had a point.   But this movie is NOT for kids, too many adult statements and crude remarks.   Really it was a waste of my time.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I must be a sap too, because I really enjoyed this movie.<br />I've read soooo many negative reviews, that I expected the movie to be terrible. It wasn't.<br />They're supposed to be teenagers. They acted like teenagers.<br />It's a cute movie and I'd watch it again.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Anyone who loves Chuck, will love this!  It witty, funny, well written...did I say funny?  You don't need me to tell you it's a must see.  All you need to do is buy it, and watch over and over again!  Great show!  Great cast!  Great DVD![[ASIN:B003R0MF5I Chuck: The Complete Fourth Season]]
B00095NX9G|5.0|What can I say?  I love Rachel Brice and even more so after buying this DVD!  I love the choreographies and the way she teaches makes it sooo easy to pick them up even though I would consider the moves pretty advanced.  The production was perfect as were all the views and the voice over.  It's something you can watch time and time again and not get irritated with it.    Although some dislike the music, I kind of appreciate that it's not your typical bellydance music and I for one liked it.  The yoga to me was a little excess but part of the reason I purchased this one in particular was because I wanted to know what positions will help me increase my flexibility.  I learned that with this DVD, though after going through the yoga once or twice, I picked out what I felt was a benefit and now take it at my own pace.  Little patience for full-on yoga I guess.    There is also a section for drills which is really great as well.  Overall if you love Rachel Brice (and can you not??) and want to dance more like her, you have to get this one.  You won't be disappointed.  Ok, there is one drawback...now I want to relocate to Oregon so I can take her actual classes!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Daria originally debuted when I myself was a freshman or sophmore in high-school, and I was a bit anti-social like her and had a rather annoying, oscial butterfly of a younger sister, which is probably why I loved the show as much as I did. Which is why I was so excited when I saw the complete series was available on DVD.   If you aren't familiar with this show, it's a spin-off from Beavis and Butthead that aired on MTV in the late 90s/early 00s and features the high-school adventures of a cycnical, sarcastic, witty, monotone teenager named Daria. Other characters include her vapid younger sister, Quinn, her artistic best-friend, Jane, and all of the other stereotypical teenagers she attends school with.   While other reviews have complained about the fact that 99% of the music had been changed, it has been so long since I've watched any of the episodes, I wouldn't have noticed the difference anyway. What I DO wish was included was a booklet with the episode titles and a brief synopsis. I mean, if there is one episode in particular I want to watch, I have to do some online searching to figure out when in the series it happened, versus just opening up a little booklet included with the DVD. So that's my only real complaint.
0385523912|4.0|This book is a  omnipotent  read, fast if not brief, terrifying if not depressing. I'm having diffculty grasping the obvious  brainwashing techniques used in this society and how this works in conjunction with traditional Korean culture and history. So  I have this theory/ feeling that this book's perspective  is too close to the subjects in question and the roots of this Nation are very relevant in this chaos . In conclusion, if you want to read a real time Non-fiction book that  is a shockingly surreal horror story in a far off land, this is it. One other comment, slightly off target,  the PRK has become the new absolute evil in Asia, meaning it's picking up the tab for the PRC, who we fought during  both the Korean and Vietnam wars.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This is one of those movies that could and should have been great. After all, it has a phenomenal cast, is adapted from a best selling novel, and has lush costumes and settings. The reality, however, is that those elements are not enough to carry this film as the script and storyline is severely lacking.   For those not familiar with the book this is adapted from, The Other Boleyn Girl is actually about BOTH Boleyn Girls. It starts with Mary but eventually follows her more notorious sister, Anne, as they climb up the social ladder in Tudor England. Their king and the object of both of their affections is King Henry VIII. While history remembers Henry as having six wives, at the start of the film he is still married to his first, Catherine of Aragon, and it is the Boleyn sisters who start him on a journey that will change England forever.   One of the aspects that makes this film so painful to watch is the gross historical inaccuracies, much of which is the fault of the script. The scene where Henry and Anne finally, uh, consummate their relationship is so infuriating for someone who knows the real backstory and gives people who aren't familiar with it an untrue portrayal of this famous couple.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|A story with vivid characters and interesting twists, Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire offers the reader a whole load of hot loving and tender moments. These things are the saving grace of a story filled with over-the-top backstories, numerous proofreading errors and a plot that keeps recycling the same issues without ever really solving them until the abrupt ending, which is really due to acceptance.<br /><br />Abby is a college girl trying to move on from her troubled past. Travis is a bad boy with fists of steel, a penchant for fights and the ability to get just about any girl. The two clash from day one, but as the friendship builds, so does their understanding and devotion.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster has a great looking cover. I'm not really certain what it has to do with the book, but it definitely was eye-catching and appealing to \\"New Adult\\" fiction lovers. The overall picture is a little hard to make out, but the image on the tongue appears to be the Greek gods. This may be in reference to the muscle-bound body of Travis, the leading male and a fighter.<br /><br />Once I started the story, I found myself feeling emotionally attached to the characters. Abby is straight-laced with a bit of  piss-off attitude and Travis is a handsome but carefree guy. Deeper into the story I did find Travis's overbearing and possessiveness a tad overwhelming but continued on. Don't get me wrong, I love a strong male character but Travis often comes off more like a stalker thug than distressed lover. It is a very thin line to walk.<br /><br />When I was about half way through the story, I started to feel that things were going to take a bad turn. The story line started to repeat some of the same elements already seen but with only minor changes. I kept thinking, \\"Just learn from your damn mistakes!\\" Nothing seemed to sink in, but my love of the characters spurred me to finish reading.<br /><br />The ending was the final straw for me. I'm all for clich&eacute;d finals in romance as, let's face it, that's what romance is all about, but in this instance the ending is just tacky and the actual denouement goes on too long.<br /><br />My other beef with this story is the amount of proofreading errors. I realize as an editor this is something that tends to stand out to me, but when I'm reading, the Proofreading Nazi takes a rest. This book had more than I found acceptable, especially for the price. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect there won't be enough to distract me from the story.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 Stars<br />Overall, I did like the book. The characters are great and the plot elements interesting. Some parts are just overdone and others unpolished. In the end, these flaws detract from the story. Would I recommend it? Sure, I would. The romance was epic. I just think the price might be a little inflated for what you get.<br /><br />Happy reading!<br />My indie, my tea and me.ce is all about, but in this instance the ending is just tacky and the actual denouement goes on too long.

B001EN71DG|4.0|9/21/11: Just finished viewing Episode 4 and it's almost as good as when I saw it in the theater way back when.  The picture quality was great, sound is disappointing to me, either the music & effects are too loud or dialog is too quiet.  I found myself constantly adjusting the volume.  My MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT was that this was not the item I expected.  I understood that I was ordering the Blu-Ray version of the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE and this ain't it.  This is the version Lucas \\"tweaked\\" by adding the extra bits that don't thrill me.  I'm keeping it, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  Thank heavens nobody messed with my copies of \\"Forbidden Planet\\" & \\"War of the Worlds\\" (1950's version- yeah, I know it doesn't really follow the book, but I'm talking about theatrical releases and OCD directors).  So, even if life's not perfect, it's still a good story-- but but I'm done with Star Wars editions.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|What can I say about this release.  Plenty.  I was in the second row in front of Lifeson.  I have seen Rush numerous times since 1984's Grace Under Pressure concert and this was Rush at their finest.  Not only was the band in top form but the crowd was pumped as well.  There was plenty of energy in the air at this show.  Cleveland was a great host for Rush to record their first American concert film.  Cheers to the city; Boos to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of F(Sh)ame.  Buy this concert, you WILL NOT be disappointed.  I also saw them play at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mt. View, CA earlier in the tour.  Oh, yeah I almost forgot- Moving Pictures performed in its entirety. Whoo-hoo.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|This is going to be tough to review/explain. Heritage is not sonically similar to Opeth's prior albums, so don't expect this to be an \\"anticipated follow-up\\" to Watershed. The compositions are rooted more in classic rock than metal and the performance and mixing choices follow suit. The guitar overdrive is set to 4 instead of 8 (no, not 10 because then it would sound like mud). Åkerfeldt shows off his clean vocal talents on the more aggressive parts without digressing to growls. Overall, the works rely much less on notes per minute and distortion and more on timbre and raw power.  I wouldn't call it boring and this is not another Damnation. Heritage has elements similar to their other works (\\"Atonement,\\" \\"Hessian Peel,\\" and the groovy part of \\"The Lotus Eater\\" come to mind), but don't expect a track like Ghost of Perdition or Heir Apparent. That can be good or bad. I can't really decide that for you.  What I can say is that I like it for what it is. It takes unexpected turns and seems well thought-out.  As with many great progressive rock works, the true test is whether or not I'll still be finding new thing in this album 10/25/50 listens in...
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I'll just start by saying that one of the things I've always loved about Opeth is that they never do what's expected of them.  Heritage is a departure, but in my opinion a welcome one. Their last two albums, \\"Ghost Reveries\\" and \\"Watershed\\", were flavored with the 70's prog musings that are in full swing here on \\"Heritage\\", but they've eliminated all death metal elements. The easiest points of reference would probably be the middle of \\"The Lotus Eaters\\" or the tracks \\"Hex Omega\\", or the bonus track \\"Derilict Herds\\" all from \\"Watershed\\".  This direction will of course polarize fans who are more akin to Opeths' traditional song configurations. It's also sort of surprising how different \\"Heritage\\" is from their last record with no growls, \\"Damnation\\". There's notes of jazz, with almost a free flow form to the majority of the tracks, with the exceptions being \\"Slither\\" and The Lines in My Hand\\", which are the most driving, concise tracks Opeth has written to date.  The highlight of the album in my opinion is the Steven Wilson(Porcupine Tree, etc.) mixing. Every instrument and ambient sound is in perfect harmony, and I loved listening to it on my headphones to fully appreciate the experiance. It's a little harder to listen to in the car though with the vast shifts in dynamics. The rhythm section of  Mendez and Axenrot drive the album to heights never before achieved by the band on prior recordings and the final appearance of Per Wilburg is a showcase sendoff on the keyboards. Heritage gets better with every listen and I can't recommend it more highly.
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|Im a huge eminem fan!  Been a fan since 98!  Love his music! This album right here is good for hip hop heads who still thinks lyrics is what makes a song!  Both rappers deliver very well in this album!  Fast flow type of songs all around!  It feels like you want more since every song, they both rap fast!  Only 11 songs which sucks!    Welcome to Hell, Fast Lane, The Reunion, A Kiss, Take From Me, Lighters, and Echo are the best songs of this album!  Personally, if you like the story telling eminem, then Take From Me and The Reunion will be your favorite!    The GOAT is back in the game !
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Well I've read all the one star reviews but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. They also had the sequel in the library, [[ASIN:0451231899 Freedom (TM)]], which I had to go and read as well to find out what happens to the characters. You have to know what you are letting yourself in for though - machines, computers, geeks, bodies, blood and an intriguing premise about what might be possible if someone got too much control over the internet. Stay away if you are looking for a character driven romance with lots of meaningful relationships. This is great beach fare with the added spice of enough stimulating ideas to leave you thinking about it long after you have finished. I loved it.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|\\"Heritage\\" is a great companion piece to \\"Watershed\\".  If you don't hear it, it is because your ear is trained to only hear superficial surface-level aspects of songs.  The guitar tones, the way the Mellotron is used, the occasional sinister tribal flourish, and that overall sound that reminds me of harsh light hitting a steep canyon wall - it all harkens back to the core of \\"Watershed\\".<br /><br />Granted, the rough finish has been sandblasted off, but I hear far more similarities between \\"Watershed\\" and \\"Heritage\\" than I do \\"Morningrise\\" and \\"Still Life\\".<br /><br />With the exit of Peter Lindgren back in 2006 it was clear Opeth was going to enter a new stage; a stage dominated by Akerfeldt's vision.  Earlier, \\"Damnation\\" demonstrated that the progressive album-rock of the early 70's wasn't just a passing influence on Mikael, it was a lifeforce he wanted to tap into.  He was beyond being part of any mere \\"Swedish melodic death metal\\" fad.  But \\"Damnation\\" was a great pop-album as well.  Don't think so?  How many songs on it vary from the verse/chorus/verse/chorus formula? How many great catchy hooks are on that album?  For all it's headiness, \\"Damnation\\" was pretty straight forward.  \\"Heritage\\" is Opeth in full-fledged King Crimson mode.  Just when you think you got it down, it switches on you.  You want it to pick up when it doesn't, you're getting used to a lick when it stops, something sounds old and something sounds very new at the same time.  In short, it's a lot like a non-metallic version of \\"Watershed\\".<br /><br />If you are surprised by the sound produced by Opeth Mk. III, you shouldn't be.  All evidence pointed to Akerfeldt and co. making an earthy, organ-laden, fusion-drummed-up prog-fest.  If you are disappointed with this album because it is not \\"the old Opeth\\", then I want to know what is fulfilling about having ten albums by a band on the shelf that all sound similar?  Great film directors and authors are usually applauded for their ability to create new and different worlds, why does a band have to adhere to such a rigid dictum?<br /><br />Wait a minute; ignore the review above.  Here is what I meant to say, \\"Opeth was a death metal band.  They made an album that does not have lots of heavy guitar riffs and growls.  Heritage is a prog album.  I do not like it as much as I like their death metal albums.  I only like heavy metal because I have trouble adapting to new things.  I am a moron and I fear change.  Please give me the same thing over and over again.\\", why does a band have to adhere to such a rigid dictum?  Wait a minute; ignore the review above.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|....and thats because it really is junk. Much like others on here I've already returned mine after over an hour of installing, uninstalling, calibrating, and more calibrating....it just doesn't work as advertised. Fruit Ninja Kinect was unplayable with Zoom attached. Kinect Adventures worked but not as well as without the Zoom. I stood perfectly still yet my Avatar's legs just flailed about in every direction. And I have no idea what was causing the fishbowl effect on the Kinect live feed box on the main screen. Sometimes it wouldn't even show a picture. Only black....and only resetting the console brought it back to a working state. Save your money and continue to move your furniture. That is much less aggravating than Zoom for Kinect.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|I had the feeling they were going to do this when they kept with the box sets 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7.  Come on really all but 1 movie.  So not a surprise that they would give a bare bone 1-8 to start.  I avoided dipping into the Blu Ray Harry Potters knowing I would end up double dipping for the Ultimate collection of all 8 films.  I guess next Christmas we will see the 1-8 with all the deleted scenes and with any luck extended viewing instead of just seperate features.  So Warner please stop wasting our time, just get with the picture and give us the real complete set.

B005CA4SQK|5.0|My only beef with this show is that it ended too darn fast. I got sucked into this show pretty quick. I was alittle weary regarding a tv show about zombies. I thought it would be too \\"TV Friendly\\" and not show zombies like they would on cable or the theaters, but they have done a great job. But it was a very short season. I hope the next one will be a full one. Great show. AMC is really putting out some great shows.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|If you're expecting an Opeth album then this is not for you. If you're into Rock-Jazz Fusion then this is the one you're looking for. Opeth should've done this album yes...but under a different name and back in 1975. This isn't Opeth and I would also like to note that the setlist for the tour has ZERO metal songs. Everything is clean vocals and rather boring. I won't be listening to this one often and I'm a life-long Opeth fan. Not sure what they're thinking but I have one word for this album and the setlist...WEAK!<br /><br />So I gave the album a few listens and I just can't do it. This is horrible. It's so nice that Mike doesn't care what the fans think now (his words, not mine) and that he can do what he wants...nothing like using our backs for support all those years just to throw us in the trash now that he has an ego. This album is so incredibly terrible and the music makes no sense. This is the death of Opeth. They should change their name so as not to disgrace the previous albums. I WILL NOT attend the show and if this is where they're going from here then I'll never have anything to do with them again. Avoid this album and the show if you are an original Opeth fan as this is NOT Opeth. This new direction and music is a joke. I expect to hear this music in an elevator or a dentist's office one day soon.
1433502410|4.0|This bible is a very good bible. It makes reading the bible all the more efficient and fun. Whatever you don't understand is explained in the cliff notes under the passages. The only bad thing about it is that it is a bulky book and isn't very prone to be taken everywhere you go. However this is a great buy when you are trying to find a bible you understand. Highly recommended.

B0052GACNM|5.0|I was attracted to this album because I've always liked Tony Bennett's smooth, velvety voice -- and because I like the kinds of songs he chooses to sing.  Once I learned about some particular artists who would be appearing on this album, that intensified my interest.  I heard some samples  or actual full versions of some tracks on another site and also I was alerted to the fact that one of my favorite (very) young singers would be also singing a duet with Tony, well....it was a no-brainer, then.  Rather than ordering online I went to a local store -- part of a large national chain in the US -- to purchase the album only because they offered a special \\"deluxe\\" version which included a couple of bonus tracks, including one by the amazingly gifted young  Jackie Evancho.<br /><br />This album is truly a delight -- I have been enjoying it immensely -- hearing not only Tony's smooth vocals but the wonderful ways in which each of his duet partners not only gets right into the duet but also manages to convey their own unique approaches to music and performing at the same time.  This album is a treasure for so many reasons....<br /><br />Now I've got to get the first Duets album, too!

Well if you purchased the blu-ray version you get the making of and behind the scenes stuff, but if you bought the dvd step-child format you get the commentary by the director, deleted scenes and a commercial for the 'Avengers' and that is about it. I hate this waste of money. For a price that is a bit high you get the gutted version and find out later that they have the 'deluxe version' for a few dollars more. I have many of the other Marvel movies on DVD and this is the first time they pulled this cr@p on the DVD release. To the marketing exec who did this, may you be constipated for the rest of your life.

1594484805|5.0|What is our drive to perform well?  What is it that makes us strive to be better at our work?  When do we actually find happiness in what we're doing?  What is our decision process really like?  It's these types of questions that Daniel Pink succeeds in answering throughout a fascinating and eye opening book on how we react to the things we do each and every day.  Money has always been the key motivator in doing better work, or so we thought.  The more you do, the more money you make, which will in turn make you want to work harder.  A viscous cycle.  Putting monetary incentives out there for people to chase after is what Mr. Pink calls the carrot and the stick.  Daniel lays out an argument for why money is simply not enough.  Work does require compensation, and people do deserve payment equivalent to what they are doing, but that only works up to a certain point.  From there, our drive becomes a bit more complicated.  At that point, motivation becomes more about the intangibles.  This applies not only in the work force but in all instances where money changes hands.   While much of the book's focus is on our drive and decision making process at work, Pink also delves into issues that pop up on a day to day basis.  One example being a daycare having issues with parents picking up their kids late.  Researches decided to test the monetary theory and put notices up that any parent picking up their child late will be charged a fine.  You may be able to guess what happens, but the reason for it is even more interesting.  Ever experienced a moment where time just seemed to fly by?  Your focus was so intense that before you knew it, hours had gone by?  Ever wanted to get back to that point or at least figure out what led you there?  You were in a state of flow.  Flow is the term dubbed by Dr. Csikszentmihalyi who also had an interest in motivation and drive.  Throughout the book, Pink outlines what exactly flow is and helps us determine what causes moments of flow in our own lives.    If you're about to enter the workforce and trying to decide what type of job to take (higher pay or intangible benefits), or thinking of quitting because something at work just doesn't feel write, Drive is a great resource.  If you're a manager or CEO trying to have happier AND more productive employees, this is the place to start.   For everyone else, Drive is a great page turner that provides a lot of insight and a lot of fun forcing us to take a closer look at our actions and determine what it is that drives us on a day to day basis.

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Yet again, Demi Lovato has showed her talent again. With Unbroken, it's clear she has reached her full potential and states just how versatile her voice is. I don't care so much for Who's That Boy or My Love is Like A Star, but everything else is fun, heartfelt, and comforting. Warning: This is a tear jerker.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|everyone should see this movie. I first saw it on the hallmark channel. My brother was killed by a car when he was 13. His dog stayed at the bakery that he went to every morning before the bus came for more than a month before she disapeared waiting for him to come back from school. Dogs really do morn their human partners.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I had not seen all 6 star wars movies until this release but I had seen the first three star wars movies back in the 80s and 90s several times. I probably belong to the 5 %  who are not star wars fanatics deciding to write a review here. Everyone compares this release to the original releases. Everyone seems to forget how darn expensive VHS were back in the days. A copy of a new release would cost about 80 to 100 $. Now you get all six movies on blu ray + 2 discs loaded with extras for 80 $ and you still find reasons to complain about it. The picture quality is awesome. The sound is mind blowing. Who are these people giving 2 star reviews ? Lets keep this simple. If you already own 3 different star war releases on DVD you should probably not buy this release because you are going to find something to complain about. If you do not own any star wars DVD or blu rays then buy this release. By the way no normal person cares if Darth Vaders lightsaber ? turns from red to pink for 20 seconds. The only people who care are the ones who have seen this movie one too many times. In Ben-Hur one of the actors is wearing a watch during the horse races. I wonder if they corrected this mistake on the new blu ray release. My guess, probably not ! Now i am starting to feel real sorry for George Lucas. Having to deal with fans like the ones who gave 2 star reviews.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is Angry Birds for people who don't like Angry Birds. It is polished and addicting. Sometimes frustrating in difficulty and occasionally from what might be considered imperfect design, but overall a superb time waster that will appeal to people who like things like Sudoku or Crosswords but are looking for something more video game ish.
B00559BSXO|5.0|Following the untimely passing of Elvis Presley on August 16th, 1977, RCA has been doing a spectacular job of keeping his memory alive by releasing a multitude of reissue compilation albums for each new generation to discover.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|fun game.  I highly recommend it as a great time killer while waiting at appointments.  it is not as easy as it looks.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I can't wait to see this I love the first movie and I'm happy they made a second.the first movie was a blast and was fun to sing along with.
B000E6UK32|4.0|It took me back to when i was a teenager. Great songs to sing along with. I recommend this for anyone old or young.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is the best mobile game i've played since the release of Angry Birds. Just enough challenge, just enough required attention span.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I've had this for a few weeks now and it still works fine.  I would like to find something else that will enhance the sound quality, but for the price of the E5 it's not a bad little gadget.  I like recharging on the USB as it doesn't take a lot of time before its good to go.
