B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Just a quick note - \\"Falling Slowly\\" from Once has been nominated for a Best Song Oscar. I can't wait to see it performed on stage at the Awards show...I'm sure everyone will be blown away and likely embarrassed when some sappy Alan Menken song from \\"Enchanted\\" actually wins.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|This is an excellent concert recording. As mentioned by another reviewer, the lesser known singers were up to the high standards of Netrebko and Vargas. Netrebko and Garanca were exceptional in their acting even though this was a concert. They gave the impression they were enjoying themselves as much as the audience was.
031286504X|2.0|I didn't know it was a book of short stories!<br /><br />I Am Legend was too short for me~!  Is that it??<br /><br />Half of the book was other short stories, I felt ripped off!<br /><br />I thought I am Legend was too simple, vampires,, snore!<br /><br />I will not see the movie.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|I've been a fan of Rob Zombie's for nearly eight years, since I was a child of 11-12.  And having bought \\"The Sinister Urge\\" when it first came out, as well as owning \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" and \\"American Made Music to Strip By\\", I bought \\"Educated Horses\\" when it first came out around two years ago.<br /><br />It's not that the album is horrible as it is showing that Rob is limiting his musical style, and stripping away the gaudy comic/gothic horror element of his previous three albums.  It is less of the comic/gothic horror, and more of the trashy style we've come to expect from him as of late, so that's really no surprise.<br /><br />The surprise comes from the fact that ALL of the songs on this album follow that format, rather than having some variety.  The same goes for his musical and vocal stylings.  No more does he do the throaty singing style prevelant in songs like \\"The Great American Nightmare\\", \\"Dragula\\", the chorus of \\"Superbeast\\", or the scratchy shrill-pitched ones like \\"I'm Your Boogeyman\\", the vocals of \\"Superbeast\\", etcetera.  Instead, he uses the same singing style as in songs like \\"Dead Girl Superstar\\" and \\"Feel So Numb\\".  The style isn't terrible, I just wish Rob would use more variety to his singing voice like he used to.<br /><br />Little else is very memorable to the album regarding the guitar or drums or bass.  One of the best songs on the album is \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" which feels the way it probably was meant to be, a sequel to the song (and movie) \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\", managing to be its own song while sounding related to the first.
B00013RC9I|5.0|Personally I like this album much better than Moon Safari. The type of music on this cd compared with Moon Safari is much more chill and the songs flow very smoothly from one to the next. And where on Moon Safari there were 3 really good tracks and the rest were not as strong, on this album all songs are perfect examples of ambient music. None of the songs are boring, make you want to hit the skip button, or get tiresome after a few listens. This is quite simply an amazing cd. This cd and band are levels above Zero 7 in their musical ability.    The only con of this album is its short length (45 min). But what an amazing amount of quality and pleasure that Air has fit into those 45 minutes.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Okay....to start, first let me say that when Britney first came on the scene, I was all about her. The young innocent schoolgirl, the sexy outside-the-pants-underwear-wearing vixen, and the sheer, out-of-control popularity.     But then something happened. She got married. That fact alone made 90% of the male based fan population drop their heads and walk away. Then she started popping kids out like BMs and discovering her now well publicized, but not admitted, bi-polar disaster (i mean disease).     So what does this all have to do with music? Not a lot, but many editors on this site have often referred to artists' images and how their fans portray them. So this guy must be a Britney superfan. I agree with the editor that pop music is often misrepresented by audiophiles. But really? Brilliant? There is nothing brilliant about this album or this artist any more. It even makes me rethink calling her an artist. She doesn't write the songs, she doesn't play an instrument, she doesn't produce the songs, and she doesn't arrange the songs. So what kind of artist is she?     Mr. Editor, I personally think you are dead wrong on this one. You can write that review, even praise her for her \\"courage in tough times\\", but don't include her in a list that includes the likes of Arcade Fire, The Shins, Feist and others. These are true artists that work hard to maintain their devotion to their music, their fans, and the industry as a whole. Britney's album is the antithesis of what 90% of the artists on this list believe and stand for.    I encourage to rethink your decision and your review. Please take this album off this list. Thank you.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|My son plays with his parking garage every day. I also like it because it provides open-ended play. The elevator goes up and down by twisting a knob so also helps with fine motor. The ramps aren't attached which at first was frustrating for him. However, he learned quickly how to put them back on so it was a good learning experience. Even better Play Toys has great customer service. The elevator stopped working and very soon after contacting them they replaced it!    Plan Toys rocks!
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I went to high school with the keyboardist, Rostam. I knew he was talented, but wow. A-Punk is good, but Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa is unlike anything I've heard. Buy this album, you won't be dissapointed.
1594481717|4.0|Daniel H. Pink's book \\"A Whole New Mind\\" discusses how design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning can change how we view and function in the world. As new technology and theories of thought are introduced almost daily, the previous and upcoming generation of doctors, artists, software programmers, and housewives alike must reevaluate their perspectives on how things are \\"traditionally\\" or \\"typically\\" done. Pink states that there are two types of thinking involving the left and right hemispheres of the brain that determines how we remember details, work through problems, and explains our emotions in certain situations.      \\"A Whole New Mind\\" by Daniel H. Pink tells the tale of an author trying to convey his thoughts, as well as those of renowned doctors, Nobel Prize winners, and major corporate CEO's, in a revolutionary way that is sure to bring at least a tiny shock to the system. Pink states that the two halves of the brain, the left and right, are capable of functions that are different from the other. Despite the fact that the two halves can and do work in harmony, they are complete opposites.  Like a hippie vying for the legalization of weed, and a stiff necked senator fighting for the banning of same sex marriages, the right and left hemispheres of the brain see the world in contrasting shades. Pink gives accurate descriptions of how the left-brain deals more with sequential events, speech, and understanding what is spoken, while the right brain deals with fine details and is portrayed as the more \\"liberal\\" and \\"artistic\\" side that allows us to accurately identify facial expressions. Pink states that the day is coming when right brained thinking will over rule and outdate left brain thinking because corporations are looking for people who are capable of delivering accurate statistics and data, as well as be able to display their artistic side through design and concept.     With corporations sending work that provided high paying salaries to citizens in the United States to countries like Asia and India, employees must step up their game in order to beat out their fellow brothers and sisters over seas. \\"A Whole New Mind\\" proved an easy read in language and concept. I have no complaints or criticisms about how Pink created the layout of his book, and it gave me a feel for his writing style and flair. Pink writes with a sort of quirky humor and speech that often made me pause when reading. His words are simple and easily understood. The length of the book was just perfect in my opinion about the topic he discussed. Pink neither overworked his point, nor did he leave the reader feeling lacking about the topic. Throughout the book are examples, pictures, and quotes from time and history. Pink gives his book and content a sense of validity and credibility with mentions of professors from prestigious universities such as Columbia and Carnegie Mellon. When reading \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" the reader is able to walk away with facts about design, symphony, play, meaning, empathy, and story, and how these six words can bring a new meaning to your life by leaning more towards right-brained thinking.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I bought this CD last year and love it!  I listened to it a lot during the holiday season. I have also purchased it for several gifts.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|The only flaw in this version of \\"Persuasion\\" is that there wasn't enough time to finish the story. If the producers could have allowed for even 15 minutes more to polish the script than this version would have been fantastic.     The actors were great and well-cast, and the locations and costumes were wonderful. The last 5 minutes of the story (when Anne had to race through Bath to finish her tale) were the only down side. Give this movie a chance, and go into it with an open mind - you may be pleasantly surprised!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|OK, so this movie is not appropriate for the whole family, but I love it, and consider watching it one of my favorite holiday traditions.
B000I9X7R6|5.0|Wonderfully exciting and suspenseful - keeps you on \\"the edge\\" of your seat through most of the movie. There are parts that were so suspenseful that I screamed out loud.  Anthony Hopkins is truly the greatest actor of our day and is always delightfully brilliant in whatever roll he plays. Alec Baldwin plays a perfect villian.  Add a huge man-eating grizzly to the mix that stalks the primary characters and you're set for a thrilling adventure drama. The photography is breathtaking of the beautiful wilderness location. I recommend this highly.
192076920X|1.0|The story line is ridiculous - somewhat of a melange of Rambo and Nora Roberts.  This banality is exacerbated by endless pages of navel gazing where the uninspiring and pathetic characters espouse various anarchistic and borderline sociopathic philosophies. The discussion of cosmology by the mafia boss is preposterous on so many levels that it was the funniest part of the book.      It is difficult to invest any emotional capital in the primary characters because they have so few (if any) redeeming qualities (I certainly wouldn't want any of them living anywhere near my family).       This story should, however, make a profitable movie.  It has all of the characteristics Hollywood likes.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|I had the wonderful experience of seeing this in an IMAX theater in 3D. That was spectacular! The movie itself was quite entertaining and had lots of eye candy that will look great via HD DVD or Blu-Ray.     I have a Blu-Ray player and it just kills me that this is only on HD DVD for now... I was thinking to myself about halfway through the movie that I'd want to get it as soon as it became available.    I now find myself torn as to whether I should buy the standard DVD version, or if I should wait, and hope, that it gets released in the Blu-ray format. I'll probably wait at least several months...    Anyway, this movie is a far above average fantasy - but should probably not be shown to kids under 13.
0767817710|2.0|There are a lot of things wrong with this western.  It has a great premise with lots of promise; a great cast that could and should deliver strong performances and yet it comes across overly campy and boring and ultimately forgettable.  I was initially excited to see this film since I adore everything Russell Crowe (how many times have I uttered those words this past week) but when I saw this film a few years back I cringed at the thought that he starred in this drivel.  I shrugged it off as a minor misstep in an impressive career and moved on.  A few weeks back though my wife happened to rent this thinking I'd be excited to watch it.  Having just watched the Crowe masterpiece `3:10 to Yuma' and salivating over every frame I decided that maybe I'd enjoy this movie now.  Well, my opinion hasn't changed.<br /><br />`The Quick and the Dead' drops us in the dusty town of Redemption (such a clich&eacute; western name) and introduces us to its rowdy inhabitance.  The town is ruled with an iron fist by tyrant John Herod who seems to thrive on the spilled blood of others.  He has butted heads with reformed Cort, a man of God who has left his criminal ways of the past behind him.  Herod refuses to let him forget the man he once was and tries to pressure him into signing up for his `Quick Draw' contest.  Cort refuses and thus makes himself Herod's prisoner.  Then in walks Ellen, a young woman apparently scorned who has a vendetta against the evil Herod.  She enters his contest in order to have her revenge by taking his life.<br /><br />Like I said, the premise has promise, but it all falls terribly flat.  The biggest problem I have is the atrocity that is Sharon Stone.  I'll never understand this woman's draw on the public.  Her acting chops is the farthest thing from decent; in fact she's so horrid that the mere fact I `LOVE' her performance in `Casino' almost repulses me.  She doesn't understand Ellen in the slightest and plays her so sullen and so dull that I wish they had cast someone slightly talented for the role.  The only good thing I can say about Stone is that she hand picked Crowe for his role here; so at least she notices real talent despite her lack of it.  DiCaprio is another drawback.  I love what this kid became but this performance is too hammy for me to appreciate.  Russell Crowe and Gene Hackman are the only redeeming factors to this film when it comes to acting.  Crowe's performance, while not his finest, is strong and polished and Hackman is always top-notch when playing the villain.  Sadly, they alone can't save this mess.<br /><br />I like the point I heard one reviewer make in regards to this film; that it's a Sam Raimi film and so it must be a cartoon.  He then proceeded to make that a good thing but I can't do that.  It is a cartoon but I don't think that was purposeful and that what makes it so horrific.  When Stone tries to act hard, hurt or suffering she looks tired, bored and confused.  Raimi tries to make something dramatic and meaningful and fails miserably.  The ending was so corny and contrived that I couldn't stop rolling my eyes, even after they started aching and begging for mercy.  In the end I went with two stars over the more appropriate on for the fact that both Crowe and Hackman at least deserve a star a piece for trying desperately to salvage this burning heap of trash.talented for the role.

0786281316|5.0|*****<br />This book, A New Earth, was chosen today as Oprah's Book Club Selection and the foundation of her new class. I can't imagine a better book selection for both groups. I have read many great personal development and spiritual books, but none have impacted me as much as this one. I finished it tonight and feel as though I've been to a powerful and intense spiritual retreat. I have read \\"The Power of Now\\", an earlier book by Eckhart Tolle as well, and I have to say that I enjoyed this one even more; perhaps it was because I'd already read \\"The Power of Now\\" and was familiar with the concepts of Presence, the present moment, breathing, the ego---all concepts furthered in this book. \\"A New Earth\\" seems to me like an applied and enhanced version of the concepts from \\"The Power of Now\\".<br /><br />If you haven't read Eckhart Tolle's earlier book, don't worry; it would be very helpful but not necessary at all. Both books are best read slowly, and read multiple times too. Each time through you'll get something more from the reading. Also, it takes several reads if you really want to learn to apply and integrate the seemingly simple concepts of being aware of the breath, focusing on this moment and not the past or the future, disassociating from the ego, and much more. Practicing these concepts takes time and effort because they are not the way most people live in our culture; it is a far better way to live, though.<br /><br />The basic concepts of this book are hard to summarize into a short review. Still, I'll try. Reading this book will teach you how to exist in a new way in the world. Instead of running around feeling anxious, worried, striving, struggling, bored, angry, impatient, rushing, etc. you will learn how to live consciously in a very different way---accepting what is going on in the moment, enjoying what you are doing, and being enthusiastic about your life purpose. Really. If you practice the principles the author puts forth, this cannot help but happen to you over time.<br /><br />You have to be open to new ideas and ready to apply the concepts here to see real change in your life. Oprah's upcoming class should be helpful in doing this. Although this book is intensely spiritual, it is not based upon any religion. I would call it \\"religion-free\\" and able to be applied by people of all faiths or no faith. The author includes quotes from Jesus, the Buddha, A Course in Miracles, poets, writers, scientists and more. It is about a way of being in the world that will transform your life and the lives of those around you. The more individuals that begin living in this more conscious and aware way, the better our world will be.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.<br />*****You have to be open to new ideas and ready to apply the concepts here to see real change in your life.

0375703764|5.0|This hugely ambitious debut is the kind of book destined to polarize opinions among readers.  While I can relate to pretty much every criticism stated here and in other forums, the many robust strengths to be savored in House of Leaves make the effort required to consume it more than worthwhile.  With at least a handful of passages that rank among the most frightening pieces of prose I've ever read, peppered with some startlingly vivid doses of eroticism, what really makes this book a masterpiece in my estimation is the unexpectedly moving love story at its core.  I'm pretty sure I located the key that unlocks the whole book in the last line of page 517, though there's certainly more than one valid interpretation for such a deliberately ambiguous story.  Not for everyone, but fans of literary horror with a taste for meta-fictional indulgences will love it.  I'd also strongly recommend a new novel by Austin Williams called Crimson Orgy.  While totally different in style, this book shares some similarities with H.O.L. in the way it deconstructs a \\"legendary\\" horror film that might not even exist.  It's a thrilling treat for genre fans.
0143038419|5.0|This is not only the best travel narrative that I have ever read, it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is more than a travel narrative, it is the true story of one woman's quest for self-discovery and happiness. Gilbert is an engaging narrator who takes us along with her to Italy, Bali and India as she attempts to find out how to be happy achieve self-fulfillment and find balance. Reading Eat, Pray, Love made me want to embark on my own spiritual journey, and this is coming from a lapsed Catholic who hasn't had the inclination to step foot into a house of worship for years! This is one of those books that you never want to end. I read this book a year or two ago and I still find myself wondering how Elizabeth Gilbert is today and what she is doing.
B000K7VHLY|5.0|William Shakespeare's classic `Romeo + Juliet' is probably one of the most influential pieces of literature ever recorded.  You can feel its presence and influence breathing life into just about everything we read, watch or listen to these days.  With a tale this classic, this important to modern cinema it becomes something a bit wary to tackle it at its core and `remake' it from scratch.  One may be a tad hesitant to embrace its new shape and form and rightfully so.  When you look at the track record for remakes it becomes apparent that in general what was once golden should be left well enough alone.  In Romeo + Juliet's case though this is a reimagining so magical it surpasses the original and becomes a momentous piece in the history books of cinema.  Yes, Baz Luhrmann single handedly breathes a whole new life into this adaptation, handing to his audience a masterful and experimental film that never lets us out of its grasp.<br /><br />The first thing that Luhrmann did right was stick to the original text.  A lot of people initially balked at the fact that the dialog was not updated along with the setting but I felt that artistically it was a much grander feat to have the original dialog kept intact.  The fact that each and every actor slips into this way of speaking fluently and without issue is an ode to some great talent indeed.  No one seems out of place of phoning it.  Each and every actor handles the difficult wording marvelously.  The next thing Luhrmann did right was trashing his setting.  What I mean by this is that he didn't go the easy route and make this posh and beautiful but rather he played everything down, creating an almost gritty and dirty feeling to the surroundings.  This is the future and the future is bleak.<br /><br />The best thing that Luhrmann did though was casting Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles.  At the time DiCaprio was slowly becoming a credible actor and Danes was just becoming known.  Neither of them were quote-unquote household names or completely bankable yet but they both had proven they could act.  Here though we get to see how well.  To this day I still firmly believe that this is Leonardo's finest performance.  Both he and Danes masterfully command their characters.  Never has Romeo or Juliet felt so alive, so real and so relatable.  Their tragic love affair is so enthralling, so captivating and so breathtaking.  There are moments between them of pure beauty and strength that I'm appalled their performances didn't garner more awards attention.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally as impressive, especially the likes of Harold Perrineau (of `Lost' fame) who plays Romeo's best friend Mercutio.  His performance is outlandish and flamboyant and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the film.  John Leguizamo is memorable as Tybolt, Juliet's cousin, and Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful as Father Laurence.  Paul Sorvino stands out for me as Juliet's father Fulgencio Capulet.  His performance is brutal and intense and sends chills down my spine in scenes.<br /><br />`William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet' has never looked as good as it does here, telling the story of forbidden love and tragic circumstance that brings two families to their knees and teaches us a valuable lesson about forgiveness and tolerance.  Baz Luhrmaan outdoes himself here, delivering a modern twist on a genuine classic complete with a beautiful color palate and an impressive soundtrack that adds layers of emotion, whether soft and touching or crisp and exciting (one reason this `Music Edition' is so worth the upgrade).  It's not very often that the remake stands above its source material but Luhrmann's masterpiece is just that film.old names or completely bankable yet but they both had proven they could act.

B00000DR5D|5.0|Ricochet, released at the end of 1975 was Tangerine Dream's first ever live album and it's not like other live albums you might own where a group concentrates on the hits and fan favorites and maybe throw in a surprise or two. This was brand new material. Fresh on the heels of Rubycon (one of the highlights of electronic music, as far as I'm concerned), the band delivers yet another album certain not to disappoint. The music still concentrates on sequencers, relying heavily on rhythm, and it proves these guys were able to pull it off live. The album is basically one piece divided by part one and two (thanks to the album being originally released on vinyl). The Mellotron has been cut back a bit on this recording, but it's used some. The album is less atmospheric than Phaedra or Rubycon, but that shouldn't matter with the top quality material the band was presenting us. Listening to this album, I really can't help but think this had a huge impact on Radio Massacre International, a British trio that's released a ton of CDs in the past nearly 15 years (1995's Frozen North being their debut CD). Go listen to something like Emissaries (2005) and you'll hear a lot of Ricochet rubbing off on those guys (RMI are also big time Mellotron users and seems Edgar Froese in general rubbed off on them in regards to tron use, and I understand they actually bought Tangerine Dream's tron tape frame for their use).    Really, Ricochet is totally essential to your electronic collection, proving to everyone that the lineup of Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, and Peter Baumann is not only the finest lineups of TD, but probably electronic music's finest, period.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Beautiful job from the Miriam Collection, excellent picture and sound quality. There is no other film like this one. Very unique, bold and spectacular.
1400031567|3.0|Unless I'm missing something major, I knew everything that was going to happen in this book by maybe 1/4 of the way through. There are no cliffhangers, no hair's-breadth escapes, no Sudden Realizations That The World Is A Far Blacker Place Than Anyone Previously Fathomed.<br /><br />It starts so promisingly. Inspector Kurt Wallander is called to a farmer's field where a girl has been standing all day. The farmer has tried to get her off his field all day, and finally he's called the cops. Wallander chases her around the field until, unexpectedly, she douses herself with a can of gasoline and lights herself on fire.<br /><br />The next day Wallander happens upon a murder victim whose head has been split in two and who's been scalped.<br /><br />How could these two ghastly events be connected?<br /><br />Isn't that a promising beginning? Yet without cliffhangers or much in the way of actual drama (the initial killing, and subsequent ones, are deployed with a minimum of fuss), what sustains the story? Mankell has left himself few choices: it can't rest on anything but Wallander's thought processes. We watch him try to reach the same conclusions that we had reached long ago. Perhaps Mankell hopes that'll be enough -- that we'll grow tense as Wallander comes closer to the truth. If so, Mankell hasn't set up enough architecture to make it so. There's a moment of tension toward the end, and Mankell executes that moment quite competently. But then it's over. Almost as soon as that climax happens, it's as though Mankell has grown bored of his own book.<br /><br />Let's not even speak of the dialogue, which is dreary and flat. Characters say near-clich&eacute;s like \\"...Unless he strikes again\\" as though reading them directly from a bus schedule.<br /><br />Just a flat book. Enough energy to sustain you for 400 pages, but just barely. Having put it down, it's unlikely I'll remember anything from it a month from now. And I'm not tempted to read any more Mankell.
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is an urgent, fascinating, terrifying book that exposes the rotten truth behind the fantasy of \\"the free market\\" and \\"global economy.\\" With this stunning expose Klein looks at almost 50 years of history to show how corporations, corrupt governments and the leading ideaology of greed have ravaged nations, destroyed societies and continue to threaten our own times. It is fitting that \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is being published just as the United States appears to embark on its own economic roller-coaster ride, because here we see the very policies that break nations. The book is both a historical detective journey and economic study, Klein makes brilliant connections between historical events and how they are connected to disastrous economic policies that reach beyond their borders. So what exactly is the \\"Shock Doctrine\\" itself? According to Klein, this event occurs when a country goes through a traumatizing event such as a coup, natural disaster or terrorist attack like September 11, it is then when people are numbed by the events that government and corporations begin massive privatizaion, repression of unions and start selling off natural resources. The concept was the brainchild of famed economist Milton Friedman, who believed all forms of government aid smelled of Marxist-socialist tendencies, Milton believed everything, literally everything, should be privatized, governments should only worry about guarding the borders and keeping the population docile. The original textbook case Klein presents is Chile, where the U.S. in 1973 overthrew the elected socialist government of Salvador Allende, replacing him with the fascist Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. Milton and his pupils descended on Chile, became friends with Pinochet and encouraged the General to impose economic policies that turned Chile into a party-house for capitalists and radical corporate interests, creating a hailed \\"miracle\\" that eventually collapsed. The same was donein Argentina, where another junta ruled, and as with Chile, kept the population numbed and shocked through death squad terror operations, mass concentration camps and brutal repression of any leftist thinkers. The pattern repeats itself in China, where students are massacred in 1989 for protesting their government's desire to open the nation for masssive privatization and corporate looting. Poland, Russia and Indonesia also fall in line, all with repression and trading democracy for dollars that go to an elite minority. Klein's two prime example of disastrous shock therapy (a term taken from CIA torture manuals where prisoners, like societies, are broken-down through terror and violence) in our time are Argentina and Iraq. Argentina, after democracy was restored, practiced extreme capitalism where all was for sale and everything became a brand, resulting in a horrendous depression that resulted in the nation electing a Left-leaning president. In powerful detail Klein describes how the U.S. has destroyed Iraq in it's efforts to turn it into a capitalist paradise, where oil and government were supposed to have affordable price tags, instead it has become a hotbead of resistance and violence, where U.S.-funded mercenaries operate and a population is left to decay as their country is looted. And the U.S. is not immune, Klein reports on New Orleans seeing it's housing projects disappear and school system almost entirely privatized after Katrina. \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is our secret history from the past 30 years, Klein exposes a culture of greed and power that only worships the dollar and threatens to leave society itself alone, handing everything over to elites and companies. Chalmers Johnson is correct in describing Klein's book as a look at how we are returning to feudilism. Klein also writes the book in a clear, accessible style where the reader is never confused and always aware of the connections between events and policies. One of the most important achievements ofthis book is how we realize that the world is not a bunch of isolated nations, but peoples connected and threatened by the same events, policies and issues. There is little difference between Polish workers demanding their rights and Bolivian farmers fighting against the privatization of their water. Naomi Klein has done us a great service with this vastly important book, a hard dose of information and history much needed in the current climate.
B000060OFT|5.0|William Shakespeare's classic `Romeo + Juliet' is probably one of the most influential pieces of literature ever recorded.  You can feel its presence and influence breathing life into just about everything we read, watch or listen to these days.  With a tale this classic, this important to modern cinema it becomes something a bit wary to tackle it at its core and `remake' it from scratch.  One may be a tad hesitant to embrace its new shape and form and rightfully so.  When you look at the track record for remakes it becomes apparent that in general what was once golden should be left well enough alone.  In Romeo + Juliet's case though this is a reimagining so magical it surpasses the original and becomes a momentous piece in the history books of cinema.  Yes, Baz Luhrmann single handedly breathes a whole new life into this adaptation, handing to his audience a masterful and experimental film that never lets us out of its grasp.<br /><br />The first thing that Luhrmann did right was stick to the original text.  A lot of people initially balked at the fact that the dialog was not updated along with the setting but I felt that artistically it was a much grander feat to have the original dialog kept intact.  The fact that each and every actor slips into this way of speaking fluently and without issue is an ode to some great talent indeed.  No one seems out of place of phoning it.  Each and every actor handles the difficult wording marvelously.  The next thing Luhrmann did right was trashing his setting.  What I mean by this is that he didn't go the easy route and make this posh and beautiful but rather he played everything down, creating an almost gritty and dirty feeling to the surroundings.  This is the future and the future is bleak.<br /><br />The best thing that Luhrmann did though was casting Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles.  At the time DiCaprio was slowly becoming a credible actor and Danes was just becoming known.  Neither of them were quote-unquote household names or completely bankable yet but they both had proven they could act.  Here though we get to see how well.  To this day I still firmly believe that this is Leonardo's finest performance.  Both he and Danes masterfully command their characters.  Never has Romeo or Juliet felt so alive, so real and so relatable.  Their tragic love affair is so enthralling, so captivating and so breathtaking.  There are moments between them of pure beauty and strength that I'm appalled their performances didn't garner more awards attention.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally as impressive, especially the likes of Harold Perrineau (of `Lost' fame) who plays Romeo's best friend Mercutio.  His performance is outlandish and flamboyant and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the film.  John Leguizamo is memorable as Tybolt, Juliet's cousin, and Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful as Father Laurence.  Paul Sorvino stands out for me as Juliet's father Fulgencio Capulet.  His performance is brutal and intense and sends chills down my spine in scenes.<br /><br />`William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet' has never looked as good as it does here, telling the story of forbidden love and tragic circumstance that brings two families to their knees and teaches us a valuable lesson about forgiveness and tolerance.  Baz Luhrmaan outdoes himself here, delivering a modern twist on a genuine classic complete with a beautiful color palate and an impressive soundtrack that adds layers of emotion, whether soft and touching or crisp and exciting.  It's not very often that the remake stands above it's source material but Luhrmann's masterpiece is just that film.old names or completely bankable yet but they both had proven they could act.

B000002J1M|5.0|1972's Foxtrot found Genesis even more ambitious than ever before. The band was certainly prepared for this album, that's for sure. The group switched producers from John Anthony to David Hitchcock. This was also the first album to chart in the UK. Also around this time Peter Gabriel started experimenting with costumes during their live shows, which will become a Genesis staple during the Gabriel years.    What can I say? This album regularly gets in the list of \\"Top 10\\" prog rock album lists everywhere along with Yes' Fragile and Close to the Edge, Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick, ELP's Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery, and so on, and for good reason. \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" is classic Gabriel-era Genesis all the way through, with that unforgettable Mellotron intro and outro. Strangely I actually remember hearing this song as a small kid on the radio around 1980, during an era where Duke would be the album radio stations would push (and they did, of course). \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" is a song that holds true today with the ever rising cost of housing, but in this song, the greedy landlords want to replace the humans with small mutants. \\"Horizons\\" is simply a short acoustic piece that leads up to the epic \\"Supper's Ready\\", it's without a doubt the lengthiest piece Genesis had ever done. A piece like this was unheard of on Trespass or Nursery Cryme since the group wasn't quite ready. A very complex and ambitious piece going through many different themes without a bad moment. It's little wonder why this piece is considered one of the crowning achievements of prog rock. \\"Time Table\\" is a nice short piece with piano, and \\"Can-Utility and the Coastlines\\" is an often overlooked piece, especially those Mellotron passages.    If you dismissed Genesis in the past because of their later pop offerings, if Invisible Touch makes you run, you might want to try their earlier stuff, that is, if prog rock is your thing. When you hear Foxtrot, you get to understand why this is a regular prog rock \\"Top 10\\" favorite.
B0001V07ZQ|2.0|A British warship in the Pacific is taken by surprise  and pounded hard by a bigger, faster, better designed and better armed French warship during the Napoleonic wars.  Nevertheless, the British give chase and we kinda know they will prevail because they are ... blond.  This is confirmed by the few scenes where you actually get to see some Frenchmen. They are shaggy, dirty, grim, and, unfortunately for them, not blond.  So everything makes sense.  Entertaining, mostly of you are blond and not French.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|\\"In rainbows\\" is the seventh studio album from UK rockers Radiohead and much like Prince's \\"Planet earth\\", caused a storm more from the way it was released (practically free on the internet initially) than for its music. Musically, it's still their progressive distorted sound perfected on \\"Kid A\\", but where that release sounded rather robotic and aloof, this is a bit more organic and sensitive with more guitars; rather like \\"Kid A\\" with a heart.<br /><br />At just 10 tracks, it cuts right to the chase, opening with the skittery, initially sparse \\"15 step\\" progressing into a guitar driven pseudo jazz sound. The upbeat \\"Bodysnatchers\\" features fuzzy guitars, while the haunting ballad \\"Nude\\" features Thom's delicate falsetto.<br /><br />Raising the tempo again is the sunny, guitar drenched \\"Weird fishes/Arpeggi\\" (yes, the lyrics are still as vague as ever), followed by the brooding but catchy \\"All I need\\" which has what is closest to a regular song structure. \\"Faust arp\\" is a tender acoustic string filled ballad which goes back to being musically obtuse.<br /><br />My favourite is \\"Reckoner\\" with gently rolling guitars, live sounding percussion, and Thom in ghostly falsetto mode. Brilliant! \\"House of cards\\" (with ghostly effects) reminds me a bit of REM, the upbeat \\"Jigsaw falling into place\\" made the UK top 30, and closing is the piano ballad \\"Videotape\\" (gentle percussion and harmonies creep in - it does remind me somewhat of Arcade Fire's \\"Neon bible\\").<br /><br />While not topping either release, in my opinion anyway, \\"In rainbows\\" is up there with \\"Ok computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\".

B000MRAAJM|3.0|The graphics were excellent, but I had purchased this product expecting mrs.Weaver as the narrator and she was not. I returned the product and purchased another at the discovery stor with her as the narrator. Its spectacular!!! I would recomend it to everyone.
B000PTYP5C|2.0|This album is lame.  Seriously.  I'd honestly only put Falling Into Infinity below it.  I like DT quite a bit, but no matter hhow hard  I try to like it, Systematic Chaos comes off as nothing more than musical masturbation. They're ripping themselves off at this point. Listen to \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and then listen to \\"In the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2\\" and one of the key themes is almost identical.  They've been and can be much better.
0671027387|3.0|As with all of Brown's work this book contains a lot of information, it is very high paced, conspiracy theories, etc. As well as with other books from Brown this one's ending is kind of Hollywood movie style.<br />This is a good book which will keep you interested to the very end.
B000XRG9IW|4.0|After a couple of listens to this record the songs seem to grow on you.  The record has a sound like it was taken from the earlier 70's and remastered.Check out the GRACE SLICK like vocals and the Black Sabbath pulsing guitar riffs. Throw in some underlying Pink Floyd, mix a little Zepplin in, and you have a pretty good record.  All in all,this band will take you right back to the seventies, with a littke bit of today's studio tricks.  Looking forward to their next release!!!

B000ZK4466|4.0|The Mars Volta have returned to once again divide their fanbase. Many found Frances the Mute to be too progressive, weird, and or long. This in turn created a fanbase for the fan that took to their new mind warping experimental music. Then they releases Amputechture a far more solid effort where the songs ranged from manicly crazed to a soothing slow and sexually charged ballad or two seeping in between the mad genius of Cedric and Omar's ever-changing melodies. So a few fans of Frances were complacent while Deloused fans remained dissapointed.     Bedlam in Goliath is bound to turn away fans of Amputechture and have the Deloused fans return in droves. (If your a real fan you go with the flow.) They've shortened things up on a few tracks with a surprising amount of 5 minute tracks and an even more shocking two minute single. Wax Simulacra is such a perfect F-U to the record industry that demands short tracks for radio use and its almost as if the band gave them all they can suffer in a two minute time span and yet the song is brilliantly concise and loses nothing even without running the standard 8 to 9 minute running time.      The Mars Volta have created such a unique brand of music its almost as if they are just variating on their own sound. The spoiled among us would say they haven't done anything new outside of their own sound but they would fail to notice that TMV are continuing to dwell within their own bizarre unique take on progressive jazz fusion alternative metal funk rock. How can you possibly be deravitive in a genre you created? Not possible for the unbelievably talented Omar who is the mad genius behind the bands direction and sound on every record. Put aside the very press worthy \\"tale\\" behind the making of the record and what we've been given is another odyssey in the bands journey to reach the most untouched landscapes of sound.    The record opens up without the slow build that we saw on Amputechture. This time the band gets right into the thick of it from the get-go so you're given no warning when the crashing sounds burst your ear drums. They keep momentum moving rather briskly with every track providing plenty of danceable grooves, cryptic lyrics, and guitar riffs that may be potent enough to impregnate any nearby females who may be listening. The record takes a turn with Cavalettas, which isn't as instantly pleasing to the ears but thats when the band is asking you to stick it with them and enjoy the ride to this new place.  Agadez and Askepios are there to quickly ease you back into a safe haven before Ouroboros and Soothsayer test your musical palette with some tasty new sounds. Cedric delves into more voice distortions then on previous records and once again tests the range of his vocals hitting some seriously high notes on Goliath.    To give you a break from the chaotic madness of the record Conjugal Burns lets you off easy with a standard Mars Volta closer of the epic variety. Providing enough closure to make this a more satisfying complete work then Amputechture which cuts off and never truly finds it's happy ending.
B00005JPXY|3.0|Hey there!  OK, the basic premise for this film is a group of 'Dudes' in manhatten are having a whale of a time at this guys leaving do, when a huge godzila-like monster starts rampaging through the streets. The good guy(forgot his name, sorry!) had a mini fight with the girl he loves and now amongst the devistation, departs on a rescue mission with, umm this moody chick and this other chick and Hud, the guy thats filming all this, who has a severe case of the shakes at the most passive of times. Now, its a good film, it really is! If you could get through blair witch you can get through this, just. If not, i dont reccomend it. I left with a headache, but hey I knew it was going to be a bit choppy. The 4 pints of cider didnt help, but its wanna those films that you just need to go along to. If you suffer from motion sickness dont go, it as simple as that.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|To put it plain and simple, this is great. The music and lyrics are excellent, with several fun songs. Life is too short to not be able to laugh at ourselves and wonder who we might be \\"offending\\".Just when you think the CD might be slowing down he kicks it back into 5th gear. I never thought I would want to pay today's prices to see a concert, but you can bet I'm going to see this man! This is a professional who obviously loves his job and gives it his best!

1594481717|4.0|In Daniel H. Pink's, \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future\\", he gives a fresh approach to a new way of thinking. It is a witty depiction of the future in the economic world. In this book he outlines six senses that are essential to our future. They are design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. Each chapter, he goes into each sense with great detail, and even tells of ways that people can sharpen their own senses. This book is a perfect length, and stays interesting the whole way through. He has an appealing way of looking at things, and makes the reader say to themselves,\\" I never thought of it like that before.\\" He goes through each sense in a way that makes it easy for all readers to understand. Pink also explains L-Directed thinking; thinking geared more toward logic and concrete thoughts, and then moves on to R-Directed thinking; a more free form of thinking that is in touch with the senses.            The overall point of the book is explaining how currently humans are moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age, and how to be successful in making this transition. People must get in touch with their l-Directed thinking because eventually the skills that come with r-directed thinking will not be needed as badly.            Pink says there are three reasons for this shift in ages: Abundance, Asia, and Automation. Abundance focuses of the fact that in reality, nothing is really scarce and consumers have too many choices. Asia is a place where everything done in America can be outsourced by doing things faster and cheaper. Finally, automation focuses on computerization, robots, and other technological advances that humans can be easily beat at. To be successful people must ask themselves three questions about their current job; can a computer do it faster? Is what I'm offering in demand in an age of abundance? Can someone overseas do it cheaper? People who answered yes to any of these questions are the one who really need to focus more on the right side of their brain; developing creativity and thinking of unique ways to do their jobs before someone comes along and takes those jobs away. Pink stresses the need for parents and teachers to encourage creativity and individuality in students today. No longer is the desire to be an artist or a designer a frowned upon idea. Now, people are desperately in need of the unique-minded, and that's where r-directed thinking ties all together. A quick summary like this does not do the book justice. Pink gives readers a chance to have an epiphany when it comes to their careers and their futures. It is recommended to everyone to give this book a further read; no regrets will come with that decision.

The first time I didn't fully \\"get it.\\" The second time around, I felt so thankful to watch the full movie because I knew what was going to happen and the \\"set up\\" by the pagans was already known ~ I understood the film much better. The best way to stop a religious fanatic is to burn him at the stake. Seriously.

B00065MDS6|5.0|Crimson album no 3 has long been one of my personal favorites- of course, the first time I heard it, I had no idea what the hell to make of it. It was very similar to In The Court Of The Crimson King and In The Wake of Poseiden, yet very,very different and a bit more bizzare. More jazz-fusion oriented , Lizard is also much darker and brooding than the first 2 crimso albums- even the light, humorous sections (\\"indoor games\\" \\"happy family\\")have an undercurrent of menace- as if something horrible is lurking just around the next verse. In fact a lot of it sounds like Herb Alpert gone horribly insane.   Over time The album grew on me. Over time came to regard \\"Cirkus\\" as one of my favorite crimson tunes. it starts the album off one a deliciously erie note , going from quiet to loud and interjecting a beautiful instrumental middle section before whirling like a dirvish to an explosive finale. \\"indoor games\\" and \\"happy family\\" provide the album with its sence of humour- something the last 2 albums lacked. Totally of the wall, Indoor games has a bouncy rythem where all the brass is played slightly out of tune as we discover what the \\"upper crust\\" do with their free time when they think noone is watching, complete with somewhat suggestive but giggle inducing lyrics. \\"happy family\\" is a jarring piece of lunacy with a barely discernable main theme and a time signature thats barely there in spots..at least during instrumental moments. quirky but effective and intertaining.  \\"Lady of the dancing water\\" is a beautiful acoustic piece that  stands apart from the rest of the album and provides a nice interlude before the musical madness continues. the second half of the album is the title track- beginning with the breathtaking \\"prince rupert wakes\\" featuring vocals by jon anderson of yes,and heavy  orchestral mellotron, it moves into \\"the peackocks tale\\" abolaro with trumpets and claranets aplenty, going form starkly beautiful to mind numbingly creepy, peacock's tale leads into the\\"battle of glass tears- a frantic musical representation of a battle thatwill knock you out of your seat while giving you the creeps. the album ends with a boom, boom, of bass drums overlayed with some guitar by fripp in a creepy finally that suddenly gives way to cirus music as it fades in it slows and speeds up jarringly, speeding up one final time as it fades out completely, ending the album on a jarring, usettling fasion. Great stuff, but if your not into jazz fusion, this album will drive you up the damn wall. an underrated work of genius in my view.
B000PKG7I4|3.0|Its a really good cd.  I love the style of her musice.  I like her newer cd better but it was good.  This cd was more soulful and slow.
0374105235|4.0|Ishmael Beah tells of how his village was destroyed when he was just 11 years old, during Sierra Leone's civil war of the 1990s.  He and his friends wandered to escape the war for many months and then were forcibly enlisted in the military.  After two years of fighting, UNICEF rescues him and other boys, and we learn how Ishmael is rehabilitated and reintegrated into civilian society.    Beah is a skilled storyteller, and he gives a compelling account of how the war affects children like him.  The first half of the book is the wandering (which is similar to another excellent narrative of boy refugees, [[ASIN:0307385906 What Is the What]] by Dave Eggers), and the last third focuses on the rehabilitation and Beah's life beyond.  The relatively small middle portion deals with Beah's time as a child soldier; I would have appreciated more information on that time, but Beah doesn't need long to paint a clear picture.  (I was surprised at the omission of any role of sexual violence, which was apparently significant in the Sierra Leone conflict.)  I felt the eye-opening, unique contribution of this book was the story of the rehabilitation.  This was in the early days of UNICEF's and other organizations' efforts to rehabilitate boy soldiers, and the challenges they faced are striking.      In some ways, Beah's story feels like two stories.  The first three-quarters are the normal: his experience seems to be similar to the experiences of other children in the period.  The last quarter is the exceptional: Beah's story diverges from that of the other boys as he comes to the USA as a UN representative for children affected by the war.  Both are of interest, mostly due to Beah's skills in narrating his tale.     It is natural to compare this to other books about young refugees and child soldiers in Africa.  [[ASIN:B000MG1Z6A Beasts of No Nation]] and [[ASIN:1862078149 Moses, Citizen and Me]] are both novels about boy soldiers, the former focusing on the conflict and the latter onpost-conflict re-entrance into the community.  Beah's account is more compelling than either of the novels, partly because it's more likely to be fact and also simply because he's a good writer with a powerful story to tell.  Child soldiers play a small but crucial role in Adichie's wonderful [[ASIN:1400095204 Half of a Yellow Sun]].  Interestingly, Moses, Citizen, and Me revolves around the boys putting on a performance of Shakespeare's Julius Cesar, and that play also has a role in this memoir.      This book stands out from the others in its vivid and detailed description of the challenge of rehabilitating child soldiers as they withdraw from addictions to both cocaine and violence.  A heartening supplement to Beah's success story is the research of economist Chris Blattman, who finds positive outcomes for former child soldiers in terms of political participation elsewhere in Africa [1].

B000WMFZMY|5.0|This is the real thing - (forget about previous inferior DVD's) from the original elements - lovingly restored. The \\"extras\\" are equally impressive: Bio's of Bronston, Mann, Rozsa, restoration info, trailers, interveiws, and more. I've wanted to see this since 1992's too limited release when Mr. Scorsese championed it's \\"reserection\\" - this a long overdue release on DVD. With the advent of CGI, we will not see it's like again. Nor are there composers of Dr. Rozsa's caliber working in film at present - his contribution to EL CID cannot be underestimated.   If film making on a grand scale intrigues you - this superb DVD is an essential!  And now, \\"COMING SOON\\" - THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (April 29, 2008)!
B000002NJM|5.0|When my mother first bought the movie, it was good even though I wasn't all that deep into music at the time. Yet the song that the film opens up to, \\"Across 110th Street\\" by Bobby Womack is an amazing song that not only captures what was taking place back then in the ghetto/urban streets, yet it still has truth in the current condition of the under privileged. The mixture of songs from Johnny Cash to psychedelic rock, is beautiful. This is a keeper for those that really just enjoy music. Oh and Brother's Johnson \\"Strawberry Letter #22\\" is off the chain!
B000P2A256|5.0|Did Maroon 5 front man Adam Levine grow tired of belting out songs about heartbreak for the band's first album, Songs About Jane?  Apparently not!  On their second CD release, It Won't be Soon Before Long, Maroon 5 continues to focus on stories of love gone wrong.  But don't be fooled into thinking this album is simply Songs About Jane, Part 2, as there is plenty that sounds different and new here.    \\"Wake Up Call,\\" the first single, is arguably the best song on the album.  The brief but fast-paced opening riff grabs you right into the tune's gritty sound, with dark lyrics that recount a disturbing tale.  Contrast this with the next track, \\"Won't Go Home Without You,\\" a sadly soulful tune with more evocative lyrics--you'll definitely find this one running through your head.  The sweeter, softer sound continues with the following song, \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" and then again on \\"Goodnight Goodnight.\\"  Several tunes on the album have an almost jazzy feel, especially the last two, \\"Better That We Break,\\" and \\"Back at Your Door.\\"  \\"Makes Me Wonder,\\" another of the album's singles, is another favorite of mine.  Finally, the two songs I don't particularly care for are \\"Little of Your Time\\" (seemed too fast-paced, frenetic) and \\"Sweet Kiwi\\" (a non-distinctive, general pop sound).    Overall, this is another great album from what has turned out to be my favorite current band.  Although I think I would still give Songs About Jane the slight edge, It Won't Be Soon Before Long is a solid offering in its own right, and I rate it 4 1/2 stars.
B000YA82F6|5.0|I used to be the sort of person who went to the movies once or twice a week. Now, it's every six months, if that. For some reason, I felt like Juno would be worth watching, and I was NOT disappointed!! If there were more movies like this, I would start going back to theaters again. This movie is smart, funny, sad, and more importantly REALISTIC!!! The look and feel of lower middle class life (in which I grew up) was organic to the plot, and the sets/costumes captured it perfectly. The houses, school, cars-- all of it looked like real life, and isn't that infinitely more interesting than the over-the-top caricatures of life that are pumped through the theaters these days? There were no good guys or bad guys, no epic battles, no super-this or super-that-- just real-life people dealing with real-life problems. I loved Juno. I thought it had a positive message. The characters were so real, I felt like I knew them. I was impressed with the acting, the writing, all of it. Great film. If you haven't already, go see it. Reminded me a lot of the book [[ASIN:0967063167 The Greatest White Trash Love Story Ever Told]].

0345472322|3.0|At first I was impressed with the book. The premise is that you can perform at a higher level when you believe that you have no limitations. The book also emphasizes humility, which I feel goes hand in hand with lasting achievement.<br /><br />The part I disagree with is that you should not praise others, especially children. Dweck writes, \\"Remember that praising children's intelligence or talent, tempting as it is, sends a fixed-mindset message. It makes their confidence and motivation more fragile.\\"<br /><br />I can still remember the praise from my fifth grade teacher in Chugiak, Alaska. Many times over the years, his words have inspired me. He didn't think, \\"I can't praise him, but I can praise his efforts.\\"
B000YDOOU0|3.0|With the Pat Metheny group, there is color, imagination and more organic structures (i.e., The Way Up).  As a trio, the overall result is curiously dry and monochromatic.  Pat basically performs with his hollow body (as opposed to his guitar synth) and he essentially employs the traditional head-solo(s)-head format, which gets old after a few tunes.  While bass player Christian Bale's solos are jaw dropping indeed, I find Pat's soloing while fluid, is not very inspired.  I'll play it a few more times and hope it grows on me.    My two cents.

0525948023|5.0|\\"Ego is a conglomeration of recurring thought forms and conditioned mental-emotional patterns that are invested with a sense of I, a sense of self. Ego arises when your sense of Beingness, of 'I Am', which is formless consciousness, gets mixed up with form. This is the meaning of identification. This is a forgetfulness of Being, the primary error, the illusion of absolute separateness that turns reality into a nightmare.\\" -- From the book<br /><br />I have several books, decks and audios by Eckhart Tolle ([[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now]], [[ASIN:1591794064 Through the Open Door to the Vastness of Your True Being]], [[ASIN:1577314662 Stillness Speaks Inspiration Deck]], [[ASIN:1577312198 Power of Now Inspiration Cards]], and others), but A New Earth is by far the most illuminating, accessible and uplifting.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Eckhart Tolle, this man experienced a profound instantaneous inner transformation at age 29. Born in Germany and schooled in England, he integrated and deepened his experience with an intense inward journey. Tolle then began teaching small groups as a spiritual counselor. In 1995, he moved to Canada and is now considered one of the most influential spiritual thinkers of our time, largely in part to his books The Power of Now and A New Earth.<br /><br />In A New Earth: Awakening Your Life's Purpose, this gentle teacher traces human suffering to one simple, yet insidious, root: the ego. While many authors and philosophers throw around the word \\"ego\\", Tolle actually exposes what the ego IS--and why it causes us so much trouble.<br /><br />While 17th century philospher Rene Descartes may be considered the \\"father of philosophy\\", his famous dictum \\"I think, therefore I am\\" mechanized humans into \\"thinking machines\\" that can reason their way through any problem--and to \\"ultimate truth\\". Cartesian philosophy (named for Descartes) has permeated our culture for centuries and can be best summed up with \\"I think--that is my identity--and therefore, my thinking is my Being\\". According to Tolle, Descartes discovered the root of EGO, not Beingness.<br /><br />However, Tolle echoes another philosopher who came a few hundred years Descartes, Jean Paul Sartre saying: (my paraphrase) Wait a minute. If we become AWARE that we are thinking...then what is that part that is observing...that can make that assessment? If thinking equals Being, then we wouldn't realize we're \\"thinking' in the first place! We'd be like a dreamer \\"who doesn't know he is dreaming\\".<br /><br />Tolle asserts that this awareness outside of thinking is our TRUE Being, the part that is \\"I Am\\"--a dimension of consciousness that, unfortunately, is often discovered at the point of tragic loss or hitting a \\"limit-situation\\". It's an inexplicable peace that descends, a sacred sense of Presence. Could this be the \\"peace that passes all understanding\\" that St. Paul talked about in the New Testament?<br /><br />The reason it takes a \\"tragedy\\" for some to wake up is because a disidentification from form has occurred. In other words, let's say a person experiences a house fire and loses everything--but ends up experiencing a sense of peace...a feeling \\"It's OK, and it will be OK\\". Or what about those who experience illness, death of a loved one, disfigurement, or debilitation? When these ones experience an all-pervasive Presence, a \\"Being prior to all forms, all identifications\\", an individual, through direct experience (not thought), realizes 'Wait a minute...I am NOT my thoughts...(or possessions)'.<br /><br />So what does this mean to you, dear reader? Well, if you are not your thoughts--then who ARE you? Why is it that some people become bitter or resentful after tragedy...but others become wise, compassionate and loving? How many unexamined thoughts do you have bouncing through your head--thoughts that have been handed down to you through parents, religion and the media that influence every move you make? What if THOUGHTS, and their resulting emotions, are the source of your suffering?<br /><br />What if the true \\"you\\" is not your body? Not your bank account? Not your title? Not your actions, reputation or accomplishments? Then, who ARE you?<br /><br />A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose will introduce you to the \\"you\\" that's always been with you, the part connected to the peace of God, a higher Presence and joy unspeakable.

1594481717|4.0|Daniel Pink's new book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future is filled with studies taken from all areas of the world, provides factual information to support his claim that our world is changing. Pink uses stories that are vivid and details that are astonishing to keep readers constantly at their feet. His writing is smooth and careful, and never challenges the mind to do anything but think about the point that Pink is trying to make.   And this point was obvious, yet was surrounded by anecdotes that filled the mind with colorful stories about a changing world.  Although maybe not as interesting and fun as a college student would like, this book challenged the mind to think about what their future would contain.  During the 1940's laughing while at work at a Ford Motor Company plant would be considered a disciplinary action.  According to Daniel Pink's new book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future, this rule would not be acceptable in our changing world. Today, there are nearly 2,500 \\"Laughter Clubs\\" functioning across the world, operating to activate the right side of the brain by simply being playful. And according to Pink, activating the right side of the brain is necessary to keep up with the mind-boggling transformation occurring across the world. The right hemisphere of the brain controls actions and thoughts that involve synthesizing, creativity, and originality. And as Pink declares, the way people think and act is changing from an era filled with logical, analytical and clear-cut thinkers, to one where eccentric, sympathetic, and innovative thinkers lead the way.  Pink blames this change in our world on three major factors; Asia, abundance, and automation. Since the \\"left brain\\" dominated jobs, that we saw in our past can now be accomplished by computers or have moved to Asia where they can be completed at a lower price, jobs of the future will obtain qualities that cannot be found in text books.  Workers of our future will no longer be blue collared, logical men and women, but rather artistic designers and empathetic nurses.  As said by Pink, adapting to this new and different way of life can easily be done.  Daniel Pink offers six abilities, or guidelines to life, that will enable everybody to be successful in the \\"Age of Heart and Art.\\" Pink believes that by being able to relate to design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning, even the most simple-minded individuals will be successful in a world of creative minds and open hearts.
B000QBYEUK|3.0|I thought the story was powerful but the beginning of the story was kind of hard to get into because it was slow and the way it was written was not all that great. It would have also been helpful to included history on why everyone was fighting. But when he was in rehab i began to understand how powerful the story was. How someone can live through something like that and still be so kind really shows human potential. and shows that maybe some of us have notgot it as bad as we think.

B00005J6T0|1.0|True Blue is definitive Madonna 1986.  When I first heard this album, I decided that Madonna was a true musician, on her way to the top. So somewhere along the line, I lost that 1986 release to an ex-wife or ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />This remastered CD is terrible! You know those idiots who drive by your house with the thump! thump! thump! issuing from their rolled-up windows? The people that they put up Noise Ordinance signs for? Well, that same tone-deaf moron remastered a beautiful album. The vocals (and hence the lyrics) are buried beneath an over-powered 120dB bass and a hisssssing 100 dB percussion.<br /><br />After buying this remastered garbage, I couldn't wait to go an buy a used copy of the original.  My recommendation? Save your money on this remastered album, and buy the original 1986 release! js
B000Y7U98C|1.0|By far, this was the slowest moving sci-fi, drama, comedy, nonsense picutre I've seen in quite some time. If anyone thought that this was too good to be true, join in. A take off from Meteor and Armageddon, you shouldn't be surpirsed on the outcome.    Traveling into space on a larger than life space station/ship that has a payload of a nuclear bomb the size of Manhattan. Their mission is to travel to the sun and detonate the bomb to reignite the sun. Leaving a cold and dying planet earth, I tried to figure out how they built, not one, but two ships in that environment. Furthermore, how did they launch such a ship.    There is some sort of plot with being couped up on a ship, which by the way, has a full greenhouse garden area, plenty of large hallways, sleeping quarters, bridge, etc. The crew does get on each others nerves, and trys to deal with those issues.    Encountering another failed mission from years before, seven to be exact, is when things start to move a little with all the imperfections that may happen. Accidents, finding the other crew (one who managed to live, well sort of) and just trying to complete their task.    If you like good adventure sci-fi, this movie doesn't fit the bill in my opinion.
B000066NW0|4.0|I think my other Avril review got deleted because I cursed in it, but there's a curse word in the title of the CD! Oh well. I'm an adult male well outside Avril's target demographic. But I think she has a fantastic voice and great songs. I'm a big fan. It's hard to believe on this debut release the little girl in the booklet sings the powerful opening anthem of Losing My Grip. Outstanding CD all the way through. I do like her \\"The Best .... Thing\\" and her acoustic EP albums better but this one is also a must have. While her later CD is more like Linkin Park meets Hannah Montanna, Let It Go is more like Joan Jett meets Alanis Morissette. My favotite tracks include: Losing Grip, Complicated. I'm With You, Nobody's Fool.

B000MX7V5M|5.0|While known as \\"The Master of Suspense\\", director, Alfred Hitchcock stepped into a whole new arena with To Catch A Thief. This film has mystery, intrigue and romance all set in the exquisite background of the French Riviera.     Reformed jewel thief, John Robie (Cary Grant) once known as \\"The Cat\\" is suspected of a rash of jewel thefts occuring in the incredibly luxurious hotels of the French Riviera. When he meets pampered heiress, Francis Stevens (Grace Kelly) he sees an opportunity to use her mother, Jessie Steven's (Jessie Royce Landis) fabulous jewel collection to bait the real thief and prove himself innocent. When his plan backfires, Frances, who believes him guilty, proves her love by helping him escape.     The scenery is breathtaking, the costuming (by the legendary Edith Head) is spectacular and the cinematography garnered the 1955 Academy Award for Best Cinematography. It also received Oscar nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration.      The romantic chemistry between Grant and Kelly is palpable. Newly restored and better than ever (though the packaging doesn't refer to being remastered, the picture quality is much better) this is a 5 star movie all the way! The extra featurettes are also worthy of checking out and includes an interview with Mr. Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, a wonderful profile of Edith Head-The Paramount Years, and the making of To Catch a Thief.

0452289963|5.0|I read this book before hearing of Oprah's recommendation, and I cannot think of a better book to have showcased in Oprah's Book club.    The information contained within this latest book by Eckhart Tolle has the power to transform the individual, thereby transforming the world.    The old systems, consciousness and beliefs clearly are failing.  This process ultimately can clear the space for this new consciousness.  It is a consciousness of peace, depth and connection to our source and true nature.    This book is a must read for those who innately know that there is a better way to live than through the pain created by the small ego we have believed to be ourselves.
B000VR824S|5.0|While some complain that this isn't the best concert ever, I agree, and it wasn't meant to be. It is something that should have been done years ago with all of the talent involved. Not much is made of the Derek Trucks play and if you want to see the reincarnation of Duane Allman, Derek Trucks is as close as you are going to get. Being raised in Macon, Ga and getting to listen to Duane early on, Derek is playing slide about as good as anyone can. As for the other performers, I only wish they had gotten on the stage together 20 years ago. If you love watching guitarists and how they play, this is as good as it gets. The closeups are absolutely phenomenal.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|With considerable anticipation, my wife and I bought the Plant Earth series and looked forward to increasing our knowledge. We both came away a bit disappointed as we felt the coverage was extensive, but shallow on details in many parts.    We were confused about where specifically the segment being viewed was located on the planet. In several instances the location was identified with local names that only a serious student of geography would recognize.    The weakest part of the series, in our opinions, was the lack of depth in the subject matter. We were left with the feeling that we saw only enough to illustrate the skill of the videographer and the triumph of catching very rare animals on disk. While this is admirable, it only touches a specific group of animals rather than the bulk of the population in a given area.     We also bought the Blue Planet series and were much more satisfied with that publication.    We have to admit, however, that Planet Earth was well done technically with some truly spectacular images, but little depth that left us hanging at times. In all fairness, it would be difficult to cover the entire plant in a matter of hours and give it the study it truly deserves.

Whilst clearly too much to wish for, I can not help but think that if as many people read (and actually consider) this book as read their sacred texts, the world would be a much, much better place. Unfortunately, the intellectual capacity of most that hold religious beliefs does not extend to the ability to read this book with an open mind (despite what they might think). A book way ahead of its time but fortunately for the planet, we are heading the right direction... Richard, you could just be the most important man on the planet...

0375424474|5.0|Shubin barely mentions evolution -- not at all until page 160, I think -- and he spends no time on whether changes are random or somehow \\"guided\\".

The songwriting by Crosby in particular was genius. I love the Byrds, I miss Gene Clark, and I only wish this early version of the Byrds could have given us even more output before the break-ups and decline into the \\"Rodeo\\" format. Yes, the muscianship of \\"Mcguin's\\" country Byrds was truly groundbreaking but the songwriting was not even close. Get this one for a real trip.

I have this one on CD and still get it out on occasion and feel mysef \\"goin back\\" to a time and place that I wish would never have ended. I recommend this to everyone.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I too found this to be a film which disappointed a trifle at first, but which grew in richness and texture with every subsequent viewing. (and I would estimate that I have watched it perhaps thirty times, so I know whereof I speak!)<br /> What makes this film so special is the excellence of the ensemble cast, all of whom were uniformly excellent. Sophie Thompson as Mary Musgrove is a gem, as are the wonderful portrayals of Sir Walter Elliott's comically foppish self absorption, Anne Elliott's spoiled disdainfulness, and Lady Russell's well meaning but snobbish preoccupation with rank.<br /> Lesser characters are equally charming, most notable among these Mrs. Croft's radiant portrayal of a wife quietly but madly in love with her husband. Her glow at the dinner table when she describes her shipboard adventures to Anne is palpable and warmly engaging. Charles Musgrove is also portrayed flawlessly, as are both of his parents.<br /> On of the most quietly amusing scenes in the film is when Anne and Mary visit the Musgroves at their estate just after Anne's arrival in Uppercross. Each member of the family corners Anne with a politely worded complaint about her sister Mary's behavior, while Mary in turn counters each with a conflicting complaint of her own. At the end of this little set piece, we see Anne and Charles sitting side by side. Charles sighs and says wryly &quot;oh Anne!&quot; and Anne gives a small but eloquent sigh, and nods in silent empathy. Masterful.<br /> But by far the greatest credit must go to Amanda Root, for her absolutely amazing portrayal of a woman who has 'lost her bloom' to the numbness of loss, loneliness, and regret. It's perfectly true that her looks are not that of which Hollywood leading ladies are made, and this is what makes her portrayal so moving. In the beginning scenes she is downright plain, but as the film progresses, the tentative stirrings of hope within her radiate to the surface, turning her from the stoically homely woman we see in the cart to Uppercross to the quietly elegant and lovely woman who holds her own in a sophisticated conversation with Mr. Elliott in a Bath drawing room.<br /> But the most amazing scene, which I never tire of, and which I was surprised that no one else mentioned in these reviews, takes place at Uppercross cottage, the first time the Admiral and Mrs. Croft come to call. While the Admiral is busy with the Musgrove boys, Mrs. Croft sets about making small talk with Ann. &quot;It was you and not your sister, I find, who was acquainted with my brother&quot; she says, and we see Anne's eyes widen in shock at her words. When Mrs. Croft adds that her brother is married, Ann's expression seems to freeze into a kind of unspoken dismay, but she manages to stammer out her best wishes. Mrs. Croft's next words make it clear that it is her other brother, the curate, of whom she speaks, and we see Ann draw in a breath of surprise, then let it out again in a tiny rush of relief that is all the more intense for being almost imperceptible.<br /> It is an amazing one-two-three-four sequence of shifting reaction and response, all conveyed totally through Ms. Roots eyes and facial expression, without one word being spoken. I wonder if the reason no one mentioned it here, despite uniform praise for Ms. Root's acting, is that it was so subtle that no one even focused on it? If not, go back and watch this scene again. Once you realize what you are seeing, you will never overlook it again--it is a tiny little marvel hidden in a film which is full of such moments.<br /> All in all, my only complaint about this film is that there isn't enough of it. Someone mentioned in these reviews that the editing process eliminated 30-45 minutes of footage, and that is truly too bad. I could wish that some of these deleted scenes could be restored, most notably towards the end of the film. Something to clarify Mr. Elliot's motivation  in wanting to attach Anne,and also make clearer his connection to Mrs. Clay would have been helpful in tying up what seemed like a bit of a loose end.<br /> Also, I would like to have seen something a little more conclusive added to the ending of the film. The shipboard scene of Anne and her husband sailing off into the sunset was lovely in theory, but it came so abruptly that the rhythm seemed slightly off key, like a song that's waiting for one last note to end it on a decisive downbeat.<br /> But those are minor complaints--overall, this film is sheer, quiet poetry.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|This was a very disappointing adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The acting was horrible. It was over the top and ridiculous. This version lacked all of the subtilty that makes Jane Austen delightful to read...and watch if done well. Some of the camera angles were nauseating, especially when Anne is running around Bath like a lunatic. The kissing scene between Anne and Captain Wentworth made me laugh.

1567184855|5.0|After having spent a great deal of time over the past twenty+ years seeking to find a believable and provable concept of what does 'life after death' mean, I read Newton's book.  Stated as a simple concept;  \\"It makes sense.\\".  While this book solely was intended to be the conduit for his client's hypnotic thoughts about what occurs between carnated lives, it coincides with many other approaches presented by other metaphysical authors.  Energy levels, the tunnel of light, awaiting friends and relatives, studied reincarnation, the rebirth process, time as a 4th dimension, soul guides, the higher power concept, life's purpose, etc....  Each one of these topics were presented in a clear and highly understandable manner.  I certainly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind that is in search of the ultimate truth about life and its meaning.
1559409002|5.0|As a zombie connoisseur to other zombie fans, I must point out that Carnival of Souls should not be missed.  Here are some of the earliest images of the walking dead on film.  Check it out for the early makeup effects and general zombie styling, which has evolved into the look of zombies in today's films.      Also, it's worthy of watching as a traditional ghost story:  girl dies, but doesn't realize it for a while & tries to go on living.  Very cool vintage horror.  Criterion picks great films!
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Paul Greengrass, who brought us the powerful and controversial \\"United 93,\\" made a stunning film about the events that transpired on January 30, 1972 in Londonderry. Greengrass presents the film in a documentary fashion, giving the impression that you are observing the events as they take place. On that day, the Civil Rights Movement, led by MP Ivan Cooper, were determined to march in spite of an official ban on all such gatherings. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought against many abuses of power on the part of the Northern Ireland administration, but the core issue was the abolition of Operation Demetrius, or internment. Basically, British soldiers could arrest and intern those suspected of being paramilitary groups without charge or trial.     Cooper, who came from a rural Protestant background, wanted only a peaceful march. He urged IRA members not to bring weapons to the march, and advised youth who were harassed by soldiers to \\"just walk away.\\" Unfortunately, due to high-levels of IRA/British soldier clashes, the \\"Paras\\" (1st Battalion of the British Parachute Regiment) were out in force. In addition, despite Cooper's pleas to the contrary, armed \\"Provos\\" (members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army) were present. It's still not clear how it began, but shots were fired, and the Paras killed 14 unarmed marchers and wounded several others. The film clearly implies that the British shot first, though that's something that may never be determined with certainty.     Shortly after the events of Bloody Sunday, the British government convened an inquiry known as the Widgery Inquiry. It absolved all the British soldiers of responsibility. In response to political pressure, Tony Blair launched the Saville Inquiry, which as of now has yet to release a report.    In the final part of the film, with Ivan Cooper and other Civil Rights leaders speaking at a press conference after the events, Cooper says: \\"I'd like to say to the British government- you know what you've done, don't you? You've destroyed the Civil Rights Movement. Tonight, young men will be lining up to join the IRA, and you will reap a whirlwind.\\" His words proved to be prophetic. Had Bloody Sunday not happened, it's likely that the Civil Rights Movement could have achieved what the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements are now achieving.    The acting and direction in this movie are top-noptch. Even though the viewer knows what's going to happen, one feels a certain amount of suspense. The interment issue has an eerily contemporary ring to it, and this film shows the dangers of a militarized police force. The two featurettes on the DVD are quite informative as well. In sum, this movie is highly recommended, both for history fans and those who want to use the lessons of history to change the future.

B000VEA30W|5.0|I'm usually reluctant to buy a whole album as it seems that after you listen to the popular songs that initially hooked you from the radio the rest of the album is boring filler material.  BUT NOT THIS ONE, this is excellent from start to finish.  This band has such versatility you will not get bored; their style changes from song to song.  The lyrics are intelligent and well thought out.  I am greatly impressed.  This is an album for every metal heads collection.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|Great album! AC/DC became a lazy band, nothing new since 2000 (!!!!). But Airbourne seems AC/DC with Brian on vocals and Bon with the happiness of the band because there´s a high energy in all songs. My favorit song? Sorry, all songs. If you like AC/DC buy it.
1401300529|5.0|What makes this book a page turner for me, is the level of incompetence alledged at every command level from MacArthur on down.  If the facts are true, many many generals should not only have been relieved of their commands, they should have been court martialed to boot.  Before reading this wonderful book, I knew little about this war and I had pre-conceived notions about MacArthur and Truman; I hate to admit that those notions may have been wrong.  If what Halberstam says is true, and I have no reason to doubt him, thousands of fine soldiers and marines died for no reason other than to feed the egos of some very stupid men.  A must read.
B000VNMMPM|2.0|No, it would never happen in real life.  Kind of boring, but okay ifyou have nothing better to do and want to watch a movie. would have been better in colour.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This is an entertaining sci-fi adventure that, as usual, asks the reader to suspend disbelief and go with the flow (I mean, a trip to the sun???)  The graphics are gorgeous, especially for a film with a relatively low budget.  And the story line, given its genre, is sufficient to keep the viewer's attention.<br /><br />Alas, the film is seriously degraded by the psychosocial immaturity of the cast.  Presumably, these actors are capable of behaving like adults but the director never lets them.  Instead, scenes that could/should explore the depth of human responses to difficult and critical choices come across more like those reality TV shows where a gaggle of twenty-somethings try to live together in one house.<br /><br />A sci-fi fan can accept \\"Q balls,\\" and excursions into the chromosphere, and wacko schemes about reigniting the sun.  But accepting that earth would send, on the most critical voyage in human history, a bunch of hyperemotional, immature, misfits.....THAT exceeds the imaginary capacity of even the most dedicated viewer. We seem to have made relatively little progress in the portrayal of sci-fi characters since the days when the women did little more than pour coffee and scream.<br /><br />Disappointing, though it certainly offers insights into the marketing foci of the major studios.
B0000028W9|5.0|This was the first Leonard Cohen album I ever bought, and it's still my favorite of all his work, and one of my favorite albums ever.  It's really a remarkable album in that Leonard made it later in his career.  It's a rather angry album, even though Leonard never shouts his anger.  He whispers it, and we feel it more that way.  Leonard Cohen is a remarkable musician/poet/songwriter.  He's been amazingly consistent with his output, and has never really put out a bad album (except for Death of a Ladies Man, which wasn't entirely his fault).  This one is impeccably written, produced, and executed.  From the brilliant, signature title tune, to the beautiful, amazingly lovely instrumental Tacoma Trailer, there isn't a dull moment.  I can't really pick one great song, because they're all excellent.  Even the \\"throwaway\\" romantic covers, Always and Be For Real, are really well produced and are quite moving.  I would also like Rebecca de Mornay, who was dating Leonard Cohen at the time, for inspiring Leonard (the album is dedicated to her).  She was never much of an actress, but she was a good muse.  I don't want to say that she was solely responsible for the entire album, but she helped, methinks.  This is a wonderful, thought provoking album that you'll never get tired of listening to.

1576754499|5.0|Paul Polack's Out of Poverty is a straightforward and entertaining presentation of his outstanding discoveries in ending  dollar-a-day poverty throughout the developing world. Paul's work over the past twenty-five years has helped millions of farming families invest in their own futures and this book traces his journeys and the profound understandings that became clear to him along the way. His process is revolutionary yet downright practical and simple to implement, and astonishingly effective. It was fascinating to learn how charity can actually create greater need and it is delightfully reassuring to see that his perspectives are launching a new class of thinking in Design,the creation of markets and the eradication of poverty.

0517201658|4.0|Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds is one of the most popular books written in recent years, but it is not a great book, a classic novel.  The Guardian called it, \\"Australia's answer to Gone With the Wind,\\" and it certainly has the epic sweep of that book and, in Meggie Cleary, a character to rival Scarlett O'Hara in iron-willed determination and love for the land.  It is a book much like Thackery's Vanity Fair, a \\"book without a hero,\\" and while Meggie bears some resemblance to Becky Sharp, she falls far short of the scheming self-interest of the latter character.<br /><br />There are two things that keep The Thorn Birds from being a great book.  The first is that it lacks the dramatic conclusion of great drama.  The Hunchback of Norte Dame ends with Quasimodo  seeing the two great loves of his life die within moments, one by his own hand.  The place where the climax should have come to an end is at the point when Ralph, now Cardinal di Bricassart, comes to Drogheda and meets Dane. Fee and Meggie know the truth but will not tell him. McCullough teases us by saying that Anne and Luddie, the only two other people who know it, are coming to Drogheda as well.  But what happens?  Meggie and Cardinal Ralph nonchalantly go to bed together and the moment passes and the story moves on. Other scenes vie for this place in the book without much success.<br /><br />The Thorn Birds is, at bottom, a book for women.  Its central themes of love, forbidden and otherwise, and psychological self-analysis resonate with them.  McCullough draws her women--Fee, Meggie, and Justine--with a clear and sharp brush. Her best character is the villainess, Mary Carson, whose decisions shape the book and whose ghost haunts it throughout. While perhaps not on a par with Dickens' Madame Defarge, she exudes evil; even her death is grotesque.  McCullough's men, by comparison are mere representations:  The perfect priest, the Australian sheep grazier, Frank, the angry young man, the brothers, as alike as peas in a pod, Paddy, the accepting father, Luke, the rough, ambitious personification of Gordon Gekko, and Dane, the perfect embodiment of male beauty. Even Cardinal Vittorio Scarbanza di Conti-Verchese is a mere stereotype of the kind of cardinal that controlled the Catholic Church in those days. We see him throughout the book stroking his various cats, as a benign Goldfinger. And then there is Ralph, of course, the combination of perfect man and perfect priest.<br /><br />This is a book about suffering and death and religion. Rather than compare it to Gone with the Wind, a more fitting comparison would be to the bible, specifically the Old Testament. The God of Colleen McCullough is clearly God the Father, an avenging God who punishes and kills relentlessly--who tortures Job much as a small boy would pull the legs off a frog to see what happens. The fire matches the biblical flood, as does the killing of animals--sheep by the tens of thousands and rabbits by the millions. Why does McCullough have to kill the bunnies? Maybe it is a bit of realism, that in post WW II Australia the rabbit population was wiped out by myxomatosis, but is it really necessary to include this particular fact in the book?  The human death toll in the book is what grieves us the most. The deaths far exceed the births and of the five births in the Cleary family, two die, one is maimed for life, one is psychologically warped and only one (Jims) has anything like a normal life.  Of the two marriages, one is a disaster that ends in a de facto divorce and the other, at the end of the book, is McCullough's lame attempt at a happy ending. None of the Cleary boys get married--because they are shy around girls, or more likely because they have some sense of the fate that marriage would have in store for them..<br /><br />But what utterly destroys the book is the death that occurs towards the end.  It is stupid and senseless and comes upon us suddenly, like the deaths of the children in Jude the Obscure, who hang themselves, leaving behind the pathetic note, \\"We are too many.\\"  But Hardy paid for the unrelenting negativism in his novels (poor Tess!), and was so pilloried that he turned to poetry in his latter years.  When we first read it we are stunned. It can't be; there must be some mistake. We go back and read the passage again. No, there is no mistake. We cry out in horror:  WHY, COLLEEN, WHY THIS?!  WHY NOT BOB OR JIMS OR FEE WHO WOULD WELCOME DEATH. WHY MUST IT BE THIS??  And them we calm down. It's only a novel. It isn't real. It is all imaginary. And we go on to finish the book.<br /><br />The second limiting factor in the book is the meandering plot.  McCullough does not seem to know where she is going with this book. Reading it is like wandering through a maze. Down one path--nope, better find another.  For example, the book begins with the conflict between Fee, her son Frank and her husband Paddy.  The hot-tempered Frank is unlike the other Cleary boys and we soon learn why.  But where does this plot line go?  Frank leaves to become a boxer and the next thing we know McCullough has him in prison for 30 years!  When he does come back to Dongheha he is but a shell of his former self and spends his time puttering in the garden. Then the book seems to be about Fee and Paddy, but that line fizzles out too.<br /><br />The one central unifying theme is the relationship between Meggie and Father Ralph.  But instead of high tragedy, McCullough gives us a resigned Meggie and a Ralph who pines away even as he climbs the ladder of Catholic success.<br /><br />In fairness to McCullough, it is not as though she doesn't warn us. The title, is taken from a bird that impales itself on a thorn and sings until it dies. This is life for Mcullough, to paraphrase Hobbes, \\"Nasty, Long and Brutish.\\" But we have been warned and after all one does not read Shakesepeare's tragedies expecting a happy ending.<br /><br />Finally, the book ends without hope. In Gone With the Wind (the movie anyway) we find Scarlett holding the land between her fingers, looking upward and uttering the words, \\"Tomorrow is another day..\\" But McCullough gives us no such hope. In the end Drogheda will be no more and we find Meggie resigned to this fate.<br /><br />Does all of this mean that the book is not worth reading?  Of course not. It is, to use a trite expression, \\"a damn good read.\\"  Women will love it; men will at least enjoy parts of it.  It presents aspects of life--New Zealand, the Australian outback, the inner chambers of the Holy See--that none of us are likely to experience.  Read it. Enjoy it as best you can. But realize before you do that you are about to descend in something akin to Dante's Inferno--and don't compare it to War and Peace.hang themselves, leaving behind the pathetic note, \\"We are too many.\\"  But Hardy paid for the unrelenting negativism in his novels (poor Tess!), and was so pilloried that he turned to poetry in his latter years.

0525950079|5.0|I agree with those who center-in on the psychological anachronisms here (modern-minded characters in period clothing and setting is a favorite target of my scorn, too) but I think criticisms regarding language and colloquial expression are unfounded, since we can assume a twenty-first-century novel set in the fourteenth-century is going to be a \\"translation\\" of a past language anyhow, right? We may use different terms for things today, terms invented far after the era in which World Without End concerns itself, but the concepts being spoken of remain the same, do they not?<br /><br />All that aside, World Without End is still a satisfying read. I waited years for this book and was thrilled to hear Follett was revisiting the setting for The Pillars of the Earth, which ranks among my favorite novels ever. Again we are privileged to ascend the aisles and tall spire of Tom and Jack's great cathedral, roam the dense, outlaw-filled forests around Kingsbridge, recoil at the commonplace brutality of life during the late Age of Faith, and truly feel for and care for the utterly realistic characters Follett always creates, especially the strong women who populate his books. As an added bonus, if we pay attention, we also catch occasional (and alas too scant) references to characters from Pillars of the Earth. We learn for instance that Prior Phillip outlived Jack the Master Builder, which surprised me, and discover that the love story of Aliena and Jack remains known even some two-hundred years later.<br /><br />World Without End was promoted as a novel set during the time of the Black Plague, and while it takes place contemporaneously to that event, it is a nice surprise how much of the book manages not to be about that earth-changing tragedy. Instead of merely one grim death after another, as this novel could in so many lesser hands have been throughout instead of merely during one section, we get to spend a thousand pages among the planners of ambitious building projects, the guilds of the era, and in the company of kings, soldiers, nobles, and clerics, the wealthy and the poor, the cruel and the kind. We follow the threads of seemingly countless subplots that run through this complex but delightfully readable epic tale, and even see history itself re-written as a thousand-page-long mystery is finally solved.<br /><br />World Without End is not perfect, and no doubt it earns nearly every negative comment that has or could be said of it, but as for me, I feel enriched at having taken the time to read one of the most interesting books to come out in this decade, and readily give it five well-deserved stars.e era, and in the company of kings, soldiers, nobles, and clerics, the wealthy and the poor, the cruel and the kind.

6305696071|1.0|I am such a fan of the ORIGINAL Pretty Woman film.  In fact, I wore out my VHS copy, which I now wish I had held onto.  This is a completely runied version of that film.  It is like they took two totally different movies and blended them into one.  When the added scenes show up, you know it because they just don't fit and pull you right out of the story.  Not sure why they didn't just give the viewers a choice of watching the original or the new version, but they don't.  It would actually be fun to see these deleted scenes if they were simply an extra bonus feature.  I resent having garbage that was  once on the cutting room floor now shoved down my throat.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|Having seen the original release well over 100 times, I was dying to see the editing as well as the previously unreleased songs.  \\"Celebration Day\\" was one I have always wanted to see - purely because of the monster guitar solo.  It did not dissapoint.  I would have preferred to see a direct guitar shot for the whole solo, but overall, the song was filmed and synched up with the music very well.  \\"Over the Hills And Far Away\\" was stunning.  I was suprised how well it came off live.  \\"The Ocean\\" was the same version that was on \\"How The West Was Won\\" as was \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\".  The best part of the new release is definitely the re-synching of the video and audio - a much better job than the original, although still not perfect.      My fantasy for this movie is to have all the live footage released WITHOUT those stupid, drug induced, amateurish, fantasy sequences that ruin the best parts of \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"No Quarter\\", Moby Dick\\", \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\".      Ultimately a big improvement and a must have for any Zep fan.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, is the first book I've read by this author. I had been reading a lot of novels as of late, and was looking for a change, and something short! The Alchemist was the best choice that I could've made.     I would not be considered a very religious, or spiritual person, and I say that because this book can be viewed at many different levels, both from a spiritual journey, a mental journey, emotional, religious, but most important, it is a travel of the mind, and soul. The story is about a Boy, who has a dream of a great treasure. At the time in his life, he is but a Shepherd, traveling the lands of southern Spain with his flock. After meeting a Gypsy and feeling he got \\"ripped\\" off, he meets the King of Salem, where he begins to understand about your own \\"Personal Legend.\\"    From here the Boy begins his travels, his troubles, and quest, to reach his treasure. Along the way he meets people who understand what their Personal Legend is, but either are too afraid to pursue it, or doubt they can achieve it, and those people who never come to realize what their dreams are. The book speaks about doing what you can to reach your treasure, and never giving up.    And sometimes, you don't have to go very far to realize your treasure is right under your feet. From what I took from the book is we should look towards the future, but live in the present, and try to understand the past. I believe everyone will take something different from this book, but as I said, you don't need to be spiritual or religious to take some meaning away after reading.    Life is a journey, and how we choose to get there, either by our own will or something else's, helps us reach our treasure and Personal Legend.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I'm a 43-year old guy who's been trying to think outside the box musically lately. I've been burned by artists whose \\"hit\\" song is the only decent cut on their disk, but this is totally NOT the case with \\"Little Voice\\". I heard just a small cut of her \\"Love Song\\" on a Rhapsody commerical on TV, and just loved the piano and the voice. It took several times to finally catch and spell her name right, and man was it worth it!! Every song showcases her strong, sultry voice and the piano is fantastic. From \\"Love Song\\" to \\"Morningside\\" and \\"City\\", every cut is just a joy to listen to.  If a groove could be cut in a CD, mine would have one, on the whole thing.  I just love this CD and haven't felt this way about a new, modern artist since I fell in love with The Barenaked Ladies. It's great to know there is some new, fresh talent out there, it gives me hope for the music industry that wonderful artists like Sara Bareilles are plying their craft and putting out super quality music that appeals to people of all ages and musical tastes.  I hope she wins a Grammy!  Excellent, don't be afraid to buy the CD, every song is great!

B000Z27HLS|4.0|This version is far better than the old 1980's BBC version.  The cast is excellent.  The actress playing Catherine Morland was very close to how I pictured the character to be.  The actor playing Henry Tilney was actually handsome and charming, something the previous actor in the role definitely was not.  It was amusing seeing Sylvestra Le Touzel (my apologies if I spelled her name wrong), the Fanny Price from the old BBC version of Mansfield Park, as Mrs. Allen.  She was also good in the part.  I also found the little fantasy sequences from Catherine's novel reading to be very amusing.    I do have a few complaints about this version.  One is that it was too short. Some of the action felt a bit rushed and I found myself explaining a lot of things to my husband, who has not read the book.  Secondly, I would have preferred it if the writer had used a bit more of Jane Austen's dialogue from the book.  I could not believe they left out the best lines, \\"I cannot speak well enough to be unitelligible.\\" \\"Bravo!-an excellent satire on modern language.\\"    And of course, there were those several small deviations from the book that annoy die hard Jane Austen fans like myself.    Criticisms aside, for those who want a DVD version of this book, I would definitely recommend this version over the older one.
B000TP5TOI|5.0|((This review is based off the US CD album.))<br /><br />Thank you for not taking so damn long to put out another album since you last one. And thank you for a \\"return to form\\" (clich&eacute;d perhaps, but true in my estimation) albeit in a new direction. Not since The Downward Spiral have I enjoyed one of your albums so much. I have to admit that though I like With Teeth, I don't love it, and it has not gotten a lot of play in my CD player. Well baby, that has change with Year Zero. Political and Social issues aside, it is a great concept for an album and a great sound. I actually like Capital G, contrary to another reviewers take, and it is the most \\"poppy\\" of the songs on this expansive album. I really love the sound textures that are explored, and the music itself really engages me. I would rank it up there with Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine, my two favorite NIN albums, though it has a more \\"Broken\\" feel to it in places. It edges out The Fragile for my 3rd favorite, and it well ahead of With Teeth (sorry Trent).<br /><br />All in all, I like this new direction stylistically and musically.

B000KGGB2A|5.0|I don't know much about these guys.  I read they're a 'boy band'.  OK.?  I've never liked a 'boy band'.  This is great music tho.  Period.  I play music, and the first thing I had to do is figure out 'Wooden Boat' on guitar IMMEDIATELY!!! Whatta great song.  Whatta great album.  I'm from Midwestern America and haven't heard of these guys before... this is my wake up call, and I think the rest of the States could use this too.  I heard the finale song on 'Stardust' and since I'm not only hooked, but this is my current favorite.  Also, since I 'try' to write music, I'm Jealous!      Well crafted songwriting....  Great work!  This CD I would recommend to my 5yr old daughter or my parents, or anybody... it's that good.
B000OCZ7RA|5.0|((This review is based off the US CD album.))<br /><br />Thank you for not taking so damn long to put out another album since you last one. And thank you for a \\"return to form\\" (clich&eacute;d perhaps, but true in my estimation) albeit in a new direction. Not since The Downward Spiral have I enjoyed one of your albums so much. I have to admit that though I like With Teeth, I don't love it, and it has not gotten a lot of play in my CD player. Well baby, that has change with Year Zero. Political and Social issues aside, it is a great concept for an album and a great sound. I actually like Capital G, contrary to another reviewers take, and it is the most \\"poppy\\" of the songs on this expansive album. I really love the sound textures that are explored, and the music itself really engages me. I would rank it up there with Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine, my two favorite NIN albums, though it has a more \\"Broken\\" feel to it in places. It edges out The Fragile for my 3rd favorite, and it well ahead of With Teeth (sorry Trent).<br /><br />All in all, I like this new direction stylistically and musically. The lyrics are an improvement over With Teeth as well. Keep experimenting, you seem to find your muse that way. Superbly engineered, excellent audio quality. Bring on the sound collages and I look forward to hearing what follows.

B000TLTUL0|5.0|The combination of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp never fails.  One of the best movies (let alone musicals) that I've seen in a long time.  It's oddly romantic when his throat is slit and he's bleeding over his wife...
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Will Ferrell did a great job in this outstanding story of a story in progress, wherein the main character realizes he IS the main character, and with the help of Dustin Hoffman attempts to find out who the author is.    Stranger than Fiction was very memorable, and very entertaining. Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor going through his calculated motions, day in and day out, until one day while brushing his teeth he notices, and directly addresses, the voice that has been narrating his life. A voice only he can hear, which of course leads to several comical situations.    Ferrell's character is endearing once we find out what he's really like. Still, his character remains a bit shallow for the most part, but the movie does work. After ogling a girl he has been assigned to audit, Crick realizes he has feelings for her and we watch this develop as Crick also tries to find out who is writing his life, the tragedy, and whether he will survive the story.    Stranger Than Fiction lived up to it's name and I found it incredibly entertaining, comical, romantic and really quite well done. It's tough to pull of the story of a story in a story, but this is exactly what Marc Forster and the actors did, with great success. Highly recommended!
1594481717|4.0|Read the book ... even if you don't agree with the topic    Have you ever read a book and felt like the author was writing directly towards you?  If not, Daniel Pink's book \\"A Whole New Mind\\" is a perfect example. Not only does Pink write, but he predicts and acts upon what he believes readers will be thinking or doing while reading his book.     Pink uses interactive portfolios to provide as a distraction from the consumption of information.  I personally find little enjoyment in reading long winded books, but Pink made the time fly by.  His writing is informal, but yet somewhat profound at the same time.  I do not get the impression that he is trying to convince everyone to convert to his style of thinking.  Instead, he seems to only want to suggest that his ideas are plausible and could give readers an advantage if proven accurate.      Just as a heart defibrillator can restart a heart, Daniel Pink's self help book \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future\\" tries to revive the half of the brain in which we have deprived of attention.  According to Pink, we can no longer rely on the abilities of out left-brain in order to find success.  He claims the Industrial Age thrived on left-brain abilities similar to those that can be measured by the SAT.  Now that the country is transitioning into a new era, Pink declares we, as a generation, must alter our way of thinking.     He advises readers to use their \\"whole mind\\" instead of only thinking rational, analytical, and logically.  Strengthening the right-brain involves mastering what Pink considers the \\"six senses.\\"  They include design, story, symphony, empathy, and play.  Why are these \\"senses\\" important?  It is because the world is shifting into an age in which creativity thrives.  Creativity is unique to each person, and it is one of the few advantages people have over computers.      Pink exclaims we must ask ourselves three questions in preparation for this shift in ages.  Can someone overseas doit cheaper?  Can a computer do it faster?  Is what I'm offering in demand?  Pink shows statistics backing up his arguments that jobs are being moved overseas, computers are replacing workers, and that products that merely function are not being bought.      Pink also stresses the importance of right brain thinking, but continuously points out that it alone will not suffice.  He claims the right and left hemisphere of the brain work as compliments; each offering a different point of view.  In theory the \\"whole new mind\\" Pink speaks of is the same old mind, but with its potential activated.
B00005K9QP|4.0|I stumbled onto this one when reviewing a Yardbirds CD. This was the group that Eric Clapton was with (although very shortly) after leaving the Yardbirds and before forming Cream. His guitar work makes this album/CD worth listening to. Some really great stuff, very bluesy. No hit singles on this record but probably a must for Eric Clapton fans. A great classic album, a best kept secret.
1576754499|5.0|In July 2005, we met Dr. Paul Polak at the first Aspen Leadership Summit and began to understand his insights and work of twenty-five years. He described \\"The Four Revolutions Needed to End Poverty\\" in a way that inspired us as designers and problem-solvers:     \\"I believe that nothing less than revolutions in water, agriculture, markets, and design are needed. All four are doable and practical, and I'm committed to making them happen before I die.     How do we change how the world thinks and acts about dollar-a-day poverty? I want to make three things happen:    Change the way design is taught in the west.    Change the way design is taught in developing countries.    Create a platform for 10,000 of the world's best designers to address the practical problems of the other 90% of the world's customers.\\"    This delightful book is the beginning of finding ways for everyone to jump in as major players, in a way that fits with their dreams. It's an education, an insightful and inspiring process and a great opportunity for us all.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|A daunting task reviewing a disc that has already been hailed by many as the first important disc of 2008. Such is the case of the debut from Vampire Weekend, 4 Columbia students gone preppy-indie to catch the eyes and ears of David Byrne, Lou Reed and aging hipsters alike.    It was a few months ago when I first read David Bryne's glowing review of their highly circulated CD-R, so naturally I was cautiously interested to say the least. Like with many other early-praised NYC bands (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Strokes, Clap Your Hands, The National, Interpol, MGMT), Vampire Weekend meet most of the expectations head on, and give us a few surprises in the process. The first of which is a pretty obvious nod to Afro-pop stylings as well as a love for Paul Simon and (naturally) later Talking Heads recordings.    The first track is the lead single, Mansard Roof (google it). A track as studious as it sounds, with tight changes, nice lyrics, and crisp melodies, a perfect pop moment that would make fans of Belle and Sebastian squeal into their book bags. The band then up the ante with Oxford Comma, again, just as collegiate friendly, but with a little more bite to it. In it they even manage to drop a well-pronounced F-bomb and make it sound like the Queen's English. The overall result is my favorite track off the disc. The song A Punk (months already on itunes) continues the impressive string of songs at three now, A Punk carries a bit more Strokes flavor to it in its brevity and faster pacing, but its pace doesn't seem foreign at all. The Paul Simon-isms finally rear their head with the track Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa. I immediately think of You Can Call Me Al, with that overbearing saxophone and stop-start melody. Even though that maybe be purely unfounded, I'm pretty sure others will hear what I'm talking about. Maybe it's the worldly guitar line, or it could be the vocal stop-start of the verses? After it's all said and done, it's nothing the hipsters won't be able to swallow. M79 brings in a harpsichord sounding synth as its calling card and does so without becoming annoying. Campus is another Stroke styled stroke, right down to the melancholy and wishful tone of the lyrics and for me another one of the better songs. A few more tracks that don't quite impress as much, fill the gaps until the album's closer, The Kids Don't Stand a Chance. The track adds a little bit of reggae into the repertoire but again, it isn't enough to turn me completely off. It just somehow works for these guys, call them lucky or smart, or both.    If anything, the afro-pop, New England fashion sense (docksiders), and even the reggae, pump up the irony of this very collegiate group of boys and their appeal to fans of all types of music, especially indie music. It may be a stretch to say everyone will like some part of this record, but I found most of it pretty darn enjoyable and that in this day and age is getting more rare than not. So not a perfect record, but I'll agree with the masses in calling it the first important record in a very young 2008. Have fun trying to get into their upcoming tour, I have a feeling it's going to be quite popular
B00003BDXG|1.0|Natural Born Killers  DVD<br /><br />Natural Born Killers is so bad that I just had to review it.  I normally don't review things I don't like, but this is sooooo bad I just had to.  Oliver Stone must have been smoking something to make this farce.  It's sort of a Bonnie and Clyde on Acid.<br /><br />NBK is a film that has a lot of twists to it when it comes to direction and overall approach. The film itself is told in a variety of styles and ways that includes hints of indie, underground, documentary, sickish cartoons, blockbuster action, and pop culture power.<br /><br />In NBK, we are introduced to Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Molly (Juliette Lewis) who are two lovers on the run who also seem to be in the habit of shot gunning down pretty much anyone that gets in their way. Their characters are superbly told through the conviction that Woody and Juliette's efforts produce. A couple who has a lot of issues, but that also seem to have just as good an understanding of modern day civilization as the next guy. Through the various stops at diners and gas stations that continue to leave bodies in the wake, they start to become famous. Through the local media outlets to nationally televised programs and Popular Magazine Syndications, their story begins to develop into that of legend, and a popular one at that.<br /><br />Stone's film is not as black and white as many have said it is. It's not just about \\"violence\\", but also the media's glamorization of it. It also touches on aspects of tragic youth that can ultimately change a person's life forever. From dialogue similar to Charles Manson interviews to quick quips of Waco, Rodney King, and The Menendez brothers, the film never lets up its image intense onslaught of murder, mayhem, and madness.<br /><br />Not recommended for anyone.  Normally when you buy a DVD you want to watch it more than once.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to do that.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Save your money !  In 60 years of going to the movies I have only walked out on one movie.  This one!  The most boring senseless piece of dreck I have ever seen.  This is a prime example of what goes wrong when a fairly good comedian tries to become a tragedian.
1594481717|3.0|\\"A Whole New Mind\\", was very enjoyable to read. Though I may not agree with everything the author suggests, it is a very accurate prediction of where our country is headed. Pink's examples and personal anecdotes make the text easy to read but also adds a little bit of humor. Coincidently, humor is apart of one of Pink's six qualities to master to get an edge in the near future. With all of the facts presented, this book is very convincing, but if you step back and think Pink only includes facts and stories that support his theory. But why shouldn't he? It's his book and he wants it to sell. Neglected to be addressed is what is going to happen when other countries are producing just as many if not more creative, artistic workers? Competition, an endless cycle which will yield to yet another shift in the workforce. How will you get an edge? Who is more empathetic than the other? Which one is prettier? Pink gives great advice on how to become a more holistic thinker but I feel that these will only prove useful temporarily. However, A Whole New Mind, though redundant at times, made some excellent points and I think it is a good \\"heads up\\" as we enter this new phase as a country  Pink develops three reasons along with personal experiences to illustrate this shift. The abundance of products has abolished the need for utility. Pink presents current trends in outsourcing. Countries in Asia are producing more and more engineers and computer programmers that are willing to work very inexpensivelyElectronic competition is also a problem addressed by Pink. If a computer has the ability to do a certain task, then there is a good chance that a computer will eventually do that task quicker and more efficiently than a human.  In this new world of abstract thinking, there are certain traits that Pink believes are worth acquiring: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. Pink first introduces design. He believes that through design, a person is able to broaden their mind.Telling a story is more likely to have a greater impact on someone rather than stating a fact. Not only are they easier to remember, but also easier to relate to.  Pink's third skill is symphony.  Being able to relate two things and see the relationship between them enables a person to think holistically.  Play also becomes entwined in the work field. Pink has found that playing video games and adding humor exercises and sharpens the right side of your brain. Pink's surely last but not least aptitude is meaning.  The desire to be happy is creating a need for purpose. So Pink suggests why not give people something they crave; meaning
1595141715|5.0|This is the best book I've read in ages.  Even on a day pressed for time, I grabbed it up every chance I got to read just a little more.  Started reading early one morning and finished by eleven that night.<br /><br />this book was heartbreaking, emotionally stunning.  I felt like I was suffering right along with Clay, whose whole life was changed in one night.<br /><br />This was a complex, tightly woven plot, a fresh, interesting premise with a hero who broke my heart as he grasped why the girl he had such a crush on disappeared and tortured himself with what he might've done to save her.<br /><br />I have not one bad thing to say about this book.  it was pitch perfect and I wish I could stumble on new authors I enjoyed this much more frequently.
B000FGGE7C|4.0|This film was actually better then I had anticipated. I am a moderate science fiction fan and was a little worried that all the flash and techno would either bore or confuse me, I was wrong. Yes there is a lot of flash but rather then be bored I found myself slipping into this futuristic world. Probably this was achieved due to the absolutely fantastic picture and sound quality(1080p/5.1 uncompressed). Sony even included a special \\"easter egg\\" that when activated will help enhance your picture! Don't let the talk of vampires fool you, this is a straight sci-fi movie...pretty good though.
B000GRUS22|4.0|I am a DEVOUT Enigma fan and have all the albums, but...<br /><br />I loved the entire album and the direction Cretu took with it. The erie sounds of what I can only describe is someone playing a saw! That was quite an experiment, but a little overdone. The very first song was great, until is ended too soon, it just seemed like there was more to the song that didn't or wasn't developed. My favorite song would have to be Goodbye Milky Way. I fantasize about being in outerspace, and this song sings my hearts desires in an enduring way.<br />I wouldn't rate this album as one of my favorites (that would be Voyageur,) but it is definitly a great addition to my collection of Enigma albums
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Had to review this one, after just listening to it for the 300th time. Got the new one and (unintentionally) compared it to the other albums. It's about the same as this one. A few hits and a few misses. What I did was burn this CD to my computer, then burn to a blank disc (using some editing software), leaving out the boring bits. I'm left with a great album that I can listen to without skipping around. Here's a review of the entire track list, boring bits included.<br /><br />The Root of All Evil - Kind of poppy, with a bit of Zack Wilde guitar in there, but not a bad song really. Like the off-tempo beats and vocals aren't bad at all.<br /><br />The Answer Lies Within - completely forgot this song was on there (left it off my copy)! And that's not a good thing.<br /><br />These Walls - cool intro. Sounds like a radio-friendly song. Not bad, but not great.<br /><br />I Walk Beside You - forgot this was on there too! Very radio-friendly song, something you'd hear on a LiteFM station, or feel-good movie soundtrack. So un-Dream Theater.<br /><br />Panic Attack - The best song on the album! No doubt about it! Worth getting the album just for this song alone! The 7-string guitar sounds great, giving us those dark, choking riffs. I especially love Portnoy's drumming here during the second verse. Great lyrics!<br /><br />Never Enough - Classic Dream Theater here! A killer opening with a kick-a$$ drum-fill by Portnoy. The solos sort of remind me of classic Maiden.<br /><br />Sacrificed Sons - about the soldiers in Iraq (I guess), and a bit of a sleeper. Doesn't pick up till about halfway through the song. But when it does, it's that great DT instrumental stuff we've grown to really love! Love how it blends back into the main riff.<br /><br />Octavarium - as with the last song, this one starts out real, real, slow. It picks up, reminding me a bit of [[ASIN:B00005UEAR Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]. Then tears into a keyboard etude, reminding me of the [[ASIN:B000S2TLKU Disneyland Main Street Electric Parade]] (it's not bad or corny at all, honest!). Then a piece that reminds me of [[ASIN:B000002HK4 A Change of Seasons]]. Then it builds to a nice climax, as all good songs should.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad album. With some editing, could be a really GREAT album, like the one I now listen to in my car.t all, honest!). Then a piece that reminds me of [[ASIN:B000002HK4 A Change of Seasons]]. Then it builds to a nice climax, as all good songs should.    Overall, not a bad album. With some editing, could be a really GREAT album, like the one I now listen to in my car.
B000V86OKG|5.0|first, the second season does not follow the order of the books: season 2 begins where most cliffhangers end: Dexter's victims get hauled up out of the water. Dexter's sister becomes a stronger character, following the character as she appears in the book series. Given alla that, this is a crown jewel of cable TV writing: their writers are so over-the-top that they continually seem to write the next episode better than the last: no kidding; a singular reason to get Showtime.<br /><br />The incidental music of both seasons are on CD with a few tracks on itunes as exclusives: get them.<br /><br />Enter a lady who is clear from the first glance serious trouble and this is a spectacular edge-of-your-seat season worth watching again and again (and btw, that'd help just to take in the small stuff that gest missed on one viewing; particularly the Doakes/Dex showdown). And Dex will do something unthinkable: he chuckles. Wanna guess why? Here's a clue: Dex begins to become more human, despite his insistence that he's not quite human. Harry's Law gets an upheaval.<br /><br />Now for the BOOK fans, Doakes meets some cruel cutting time in Dexter's 2nd book. In the TV series, Doakes, well, gives Dex a problem: whack a great cop who refuses to back down or surrender to him: what do YOU think Dex would do?<br /><br />Kudos to a killer (sorry) cast for a job very, very well done.  While the CBS edited version is still looming in the near future, ya gotta wonder how they'll work around Doakes's profanity, profuse bloodletting and pieces of weekly corpses. If CBS can pull in new fans of a PG-rated Dexter season one, imagine their absolute shock to see unedited season two with enough meatcutting madness to even freak out die-hard horrorheads like me.
B000002UUX|5.0|Gotta get this if you don't already have it. Ranks up there with Metallica's [[ASIN:B000002H6C ...And Justice for All]] album as being one of the greatest metal albums of all time! Considering that the two records came out around the same time, they certainly complement each other.<br /><br />Dave Mustaine had the best lineup here, and carried it through the next few albums. Marty Friedman is a GOD on guitar, and a blessing to Megadeth fans everywhere!<br /><br />Every song is listenable (unlike most of the music released today; bound to be a few duds in the bunch) and every song just kicks major a$$!! From the beginning to the end, this album will keep thrashing you against the walls until you feel like you're gonna explode.<br /><br />My personal favorites are `Holy Wars ... The Punishment Due' and `Rust In Peace  ... Polaris' though any of them could really turn me on, depending on my mood.<br /><br />My only gripe is that Mustaine had to go and remaster the album a few years ago. I don't have that version, and will unlikely get it (unless my original copy gets toasted somehow). I think this is a cheap gimmick by the artist to boost profits and get people to buy all their old albums all over again. Iron Maiden did this and I haven't forgiven them yet.<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this album. I really don't know what the hell's wrong with these people giving the album anything less than 5 stars. This album is just killer!
B000EXZI1E|5.0|I just recently purchased this album and love it. All the songs have that distinctive Bee Gee touch and harmony. I believe that I now enjoy their albums from the 80's & 90's,and also the last album done in 2001,more than the earlier classic ones...which I,of course,love and enjoy tremendously today.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|If you haven't heard this album, then you are in for a treat!  I love it to death.  I really like Ken Scott too.  I found the album after hearing an interview with him on recordproducer.com.  Haven't really checked out the SACD or surround sound yet, but I'm sure they're cool.

0307383415|5.0|The way the book reads to me, you can find a beautifully framed narrative  inside of which a guidebook to empathy unfolds. If you go beyond looking and actually see, if  you go beyond hearing and actually listen. Again and again in the book, Obama tells a story, sometimes uplifting, sometimes as rough as the streets of any inner city ghetto (where that word extends to Warsaw and around the globe) and then completes it with a question: How different am I from this person, what are those differences, why do they exist and is that the only way that things can be? Time and time again, the answer that comes up is the one that you will hear if you actually listen to him speak in public or through this book.<br /><br /> There are many short stories within the book, within which Obama looks at the life of a friend, family member or total stranger and rather than judging that person, their circumstances, the content of their lives, he simply compares one or more of those elements to his own and leaves you the reader with this open ended question. How are we different, how are we similar, what does that mean? While the invitation is not direct, it is implicit. You too are invited to open your mind, to go beyond the surface adjectives and adverbs and look with the eyes of child, filled with curiosity, wonder and an infinite capacity to know more than you have ever imagined possible.<br /><br /> This is not generally, in my experience, what you are being fed in popular media or in what we far too often assume to be  a fixed culture that we live in. Most of what i see and the way that I have mostly lived my life is to look at others and immediately form a judgement. Put them in a bucket, a box, some sort of random defining container.  Labeled in BOLD FACE, block letters, red or blue,  black or white, good or bad, beautiful or ugly, like me or not like me, etc. . And there it ends. One minute we are all being told how unique and special we are as individuals. The next moment (and quite often simultaneously), you are told that you should look  like the latest runway star or act like the latest movie hero. Sooner or later, there is a box there for each of us. A container within which the world appears, filtered to suit randomly conflicting images that hardly mirror reality.<br /><br /> For many in this society and around the world, this energy consuming nightmare becomes a life long incessant stress feedback mechanism. Ultimately, it makes people angry, upset, ill, murderous in the worst cases and yes, it divides us into random groups within which we can find temporary constantly fleeting apparent solace from the dynamic, flowing, incredible diversity of the world in which we all actually exist. That beautiful world that we see in a painting or hear in a piece of music that so often appears to be so different from the world in which we believe (and believe is the operative word there) we live.<br /><br /> Barack Obama, from the way that this reads to me, chose a different path. One in which he slowly, over time chipped away at the walls of preconception (as he appears to continue to do every day) and found the commonality between himself and others and among all humans. There are many hints at what he has seen and the ( to steal a word from the top rated review here) eloquent way in which he is able to describe some scenes is, to me at least, evidence of his practiced skill at seeing rather than just looking and listening rather than just hearing.<br /><br /> For me, the book goes far beyond an abbreviated incomplete diary. For me, it reaches out to the level of intelligence that we all possess which allowed us to learn language in the absence of language.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I love off-the-wall humor. I honestly can't remember the last time a movie was literally side-splitting funny. I actually snorted at one point. It's unexpected, unpredictable, and simply a good, good time. Don't miss this one. You'll watch it again and again and again.
B00005JPUN|5.0|OK folks, give this movie a chance. It is well worth viewing and owning. This movie is interesting and exciting. It keeps you guessing and draws you into the characters lives. Nicole Kidman's acting here is actually good. And she has a very tender and believable relationship with her young son in the movie, whom she is trying to save. Perhaps the other reviewers are hung up on the fact that this is not an exact remake of the original 1950's version. Well, get over it. The last thing I wanted to see was the same material rehashed in the same way. This movie tries to be different while keeping only the bare bones of the original concept in tact. Bravo to the director and all the actors, they were great. I loved the ending. But do wish they had included some more in depth extras. Nicole's performance is reminiscent of that which she gave in the film \\"The Others\\".
B000YDOOUK|5.0|I first caught a piece of these guys on iTunes and heard a lot of people say \\"They're just the new AC/DC\\". Don't get me wrong, the AC/DC influence is undeniably there, but these guys have taken that flavor and kicked the music up to eleven! I get a little tired of AC/DC not only because the radio has killed their songs, but also because a few of the songs just seem to drag and sound like they need a shot of adrenaline. That's what Airbourne has done. No silly effects, no grunting or emo screaming that everyone else in \\"rock\\" is doing, just Gibsons, jacked into Marshall Amps, with the volume cranked and the booze and girls flowin! I think it's damn near impossible to keep your feet from tappin while listening to this CD. If you like straight rock n roll w/ some metal flavor sprinkled in and you're sick of the usual junk on the radio, get this CD, your girl, and some beer asap!
0920668364|1.0|If I could give this book zero stars, I would.  As a daughter-in-law and devoted mother of a son and daughter, I would never give this book as a gift.  I love my children desperately, and do not want them to think about Mommy dying any sooner than they have to, or to create boundary issues.  Boys have a hard enough time cutting the apron strings and don't need to be made to feel guilty.  I love the sentiment this book is trying to convey, but it stepped way over the boundary line.
0634021869|5.0|The Hal Leonard's \\"Recorded Versions Guitar\\" series take you through an album note-by-note. What does that do for you?    Maybe you just want to learn a song that you really like. Perhaps you're that guitarist who wants to study a particular artist or style. Maybe there is a lick or a turn-around that you just can't figure out. The accuracy of these books answers all of these scenarios. They are transcribed in notation for those who read music, as well as in guitar tablature for those who don't.    I have several of these books, and I find them to be an outstanding tool for any student of music. Their transcription of \\"Riding with the King\\" is no exception. Accurately translated and clearly displayed, this book delivers exactly what it promises!
B000ZK4466|5.0|I was just discussing with a friend 3 days ago that there isn't anything out there right now in music that is new.  Not that there isn't good stuff, but just nothing that makes you feel like you've stumbled onto the next new sound.    While Bedlam definitely has the trademark TMV sound, it still sounds new in a way, and is by far the best sound out right now.  I've only given the whole thing a once over so far, but it has me excited about having a collection of new sounding songs to listen to.  I am a true T O O L-head, but I am not ashamed to say that I am jumping on the TMV band wagon...these guys are the best musicians out there right now.
0451457994|3.0|When the book worked, it was impossible to put down.  Mind-expanding, fun, riveting - and creative.  I loved the first half especially.  But when it wasn't working, it was slow and I had to skim.  Too much technical stuff, too much weirdness.  It drifted away from the story and characters and turned into a dull astronomy textbook.<br /><br />I found it interesting that the book was written more or less after the screenplay.  For a book based on a screenplay, it outpaced my expectations, and was worth the read.  What I also found interesting was that this book was quite a different beast from the movie.  Yes, the \\"Hal\\" parts overlapped - and were disturbing in both - but the rest struck me as pretty different.<br /><br />My overall assessment:  fairly good junk food.  Not too deep, but engaging enough to help waste a few hours of free time...
0596101996|5.0|We are in 2008 and this is the Rhino book 5th ed. Try to google the terms \\"javascript variable names\\", you'll have a bunch of articles and tutorials giving you the javascript naming rules. Count how many articles you hit before one of them mentions that the ($) dollar sign is a perfectly valid character in identifiers (it's been so since javascript 1.1). This Rhino book already mentioned this back in 1998 when in its 3rd edition and possibly in previous editions. It is not to say that this is a life changing information, it's simply to illustrate a point. By knowing what is or isn't possible with the language you can put it to better use. You should own this book, even if you want to buy other JS books or even if you've read tutorials around the web and you think you know what you're doing. This book clearly details the language and its intricacies. If you're a programmer, you'll appreciate that you actually understand how javascript works. The bugs will seem a lot less obscure and some esoteric constructs found in various scripts and frameworks will look less like voodoo. You will certainly need other Javascript books that deal more with advanced practice, architecture and development techniques, but you need a solid foundation to build all that knowledge on.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|This movie was very informative but the idea that McNamara was not at fault for the build-up of US forces in Vietnam is false.

B000A0GYD2|1.0|Well, it's my first ever experience with docudrama format, and the very last - for I was quite disappointed. There's enough archive material to make such lame reenacting absolutely absurd. As a drama it fails utterly (acting is, well, not that convincing) and it's anything, but documentary (you may as well study the history of WWII by means of Pearl Harbor movie). It's just as bad as Armageddon, but with no Aerosmith in the soundtrack.

B001394S1E|5.0|I can give you this movie in three words. Murder, mystery and intrigue. I know that sounds like every other movie you've seen. But that isn't this movie. There are a lot of surprises yet.<br /><br />Pitt, the main guy played by Richard Scott, is someone I can totally identify with. I feel like I grew up with him. He and his friends seem to live just on the outskirts of society. Except, unlike me he stands up to the bad guys. He's got a strength I wish I had. But he kills everyone, and I still like him.<br /><br />In the end all works out. Reminiscent of True Romance, without the love. You should watch this movie. It's movie making and story telling without the fancy (and waste of budget) CGI. Highly recommended.
0307237702|5.0|Barack Obama immediately lays his cards out on the table stating, \\"I believe in evolution, scientific inquiry, and global warming\\". He supports Habeas Corpus, Separation of Powers and the Separation of Church and State. No equivocating, no hedging just straight out this is who he is, this is what he believe. When asked what it's like to operate in the current political environment Obama responds by mentioning Nelson Mandela, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and political reformists in Chinese or Egyptian prisons and suddenly America doesn't seem nearly as desperate. It's this kind of honesty and optimism that draws me to Obama. It's been years since we've had this kind of pragmatism, humility and openness to negotiation in the oval office.<br /><br />Barack's pragmatism is to me his most attractive quality. Rather that treat the Constitution as a sacred text handed to us from above ala Ron Paul he regards it as a \\"framework to organize the way by which we argue about the future\\" As he states, even the \\"founders and ratifiers themselves disagreed profoundly, vehemently, on the meaning of their masterpiece\\" so how could we possibly settle on a single interpretation. Barack writes, \\"We should be guided by what works\\" Amen to that. What a change this would be from the rigid ideological dogma of the Bush Administration and their desire to change the fundamental relationships between the branches of government.<br /><br />My biggest concern regarding Sen. Obama is that he sometimes seems a bit soft and naïve. He writes, \\"Democratic audiences are often surprised when I tell them that I don't consider George Bush a bad man\\" I respectfully disagree. Bush supports torture, lies habitually, tries to divide the country with wedge issues, uses fear to ram through his policies and generally runs the government like a petulant two year old. These are not the actions of a good man with bad policies. These are the actions of a bad man with very poor leadership skills. Later he writes, \\"we would be hard pressed to find a conservative or liberal in America today... who doesn't subscribe to the basic set of individual liberties identified by the founders in our Constitution\\" Finding a conservative who doesn't subscribe to individual liberties is like shooting fish in a barrel. Where was the opposition to the suspension of Habeas Corpus, warrentless wiretapping and torture? For that matter the entire religious right seems determined to completely rewrite the Constitution?<br /><br />Sen. Obama also expresses some satisfaction over the results of the Republican's `Nuclear Option' threat regarding filibustering and the `Gang of Fourteen' Essentially the White House got to pass through some far right judges and the Democrats got to keep the option of filibustering as long as they promised never to use it. What good is the preservation of filibustering if it cannot be used? It was a total capitulation by the Democrats which looked even more pathetic when the new 2007 Republican minority more than DOUBLED the previous record of filibustering for a single year. To paraphrase `The Untouchables' it's just like a Democrat to bring a knife to a gunfight.<br /><br />Regardless of any small concerns on my part Sen. Obama is a tremendous breath of fresh air after the toxic fumes of the Bush years. As he states in his book, a polarized electorate strengthens conservatives and weakens liberals. I find his sense of priorities to be right on the money with concerns over declining wages and a recognition that the Bush Ownership Society essentially means \\"You're on your own.\\" He also believes \\"that the resources and power of the national government can facilitate, rather than supplant, a vibrant economy\\" Despite the best efforts of the Bush administration to show how ineffective and corrupt the federal government can be I still have faith that in the right hands it can help even out many of the monumental inequities in our increasingly winner-take-all society. Last, I was impressed by his desire to spread democracy by leading by example and abiding by international rules of standards. Not because we have to but because it's the right thing to do.<br /><br />Besides a section on health care Barack Obama spends very little time on details. The book is mostly about Barack, his values, his life and his respect for the established relationships between the three branches of the federal government. It's an excellent book and only increased my hope for an Obama victory in the fall.ressed by his desire to spread democracy by leading by example and abiding by international rules of standards.

B000VECAC6|5.0|This is the 4th iteration of this movie that I have owned.  My first was on VHS, then came the Criterion LaserDisc, which was followed by the Criterion DVD edition.  I really wasn't expecting much of an improvement over the Criterion DVD since this is an older movie.  Regardless of what version you own, if you are a Python fan, you are in for a HUGE surprise with this latest edition on Blu-ray.  The picture is near perfection with only a couple of scenes where I noticed the tiniest bit of film grain.  Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was the remastered sound elements.  After trying the different sound choices, I found the PCM soundtrack to be the best.  I really wasn't expecting the sound to be that great for this movie, but BOY was I surprised.  Sony has truly outdone themselves with this latest high def remastering of Life of Brian.  This is the absolute best I have ever seen or heard of this zany film.  There are details in the picture that I have NEVER seend before, and I have seen this movie MANY MANY times.  If I had to complain about anything, it would be that the special features were not in HD, but that is not that big a deal since everything else about this title is just spot on.<br /><br />There are many who would say this movie is a sacrilege.  As a Christian, I would disagree with such a statement.  I have heard some say that this movie is making light of Jesus' ministry, and especially his crucifixion.  They are missing the whole point.  I think this movie illustrates how some people will blindly follow religious leaders, or will just go with the crowd without really questioning what they're doing, or why they're doing it.  The scene where Brian is mistaken for Jesus and chased by the crowd is a good example.  When his sandal falls off, some take it as a sign that they should remove their own sandal, while some choose to follow the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem.  How can anyone NOT see the humor in that???  Also, what if there really were some in the far back of the crowd at the Sermon on the Mount who couldn't quite make out what was being said???  I have seen this movie countless times, and at no point is Jesus ever actually made fun of.  Even the crucifixion scene is obviously not a slight on Jesus' own crucifixion.  He is not the only person to ever be crucified, since there were countless others who suffered this horrible form of death.  The crucifixion scene obviously is not about Jesus' crucifixion since there are much more than three men being crucified.  Of course, I'm sure there are those who would disagree with me.  If you do find this movie to be offensive, then simply don't watch it.  After all, this is still a free country.  To those of you who have longed for a pristine version of this classic Python piece, you MUST get this one on Blu-ray.  I will be waiting patiently for Sony to deliver a comparable version of the Holy Grail on Blu-ray soon.the crowd at the Sermon on the Mount who couldn't quite make out what was being said???

B0010X73ZG|5.0|One night a horrible storm ravages a small Maine town. The next morning the clean up begins. Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) notices the strange mist moving across the lake and though it seems unusual, it doesn't seem to concern him much. He goes into town with his son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and their next door neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) to pick up a few supplies from the local supermarket. Everything appears normal. Then Dave and others in the store notice police cars, firetrucks, and military vehicles driving down the main road in front of the story at high speeds. Soon sirens ring out and an older man runs into the store yelling that there is \\"something in the mist.\\" The doors of the store are closed just as the strange mist that Dave saw earlier on the lake covers everything outside. Screams are heard, the power goes out, and the earth shakes. No one knows for sure what's exactly outside in the mist, but the few people that leave the store to check things out aren't seen from again. The store has emergency generators, but they begin acting up. Dave and a few other volunteers try to fix the generator and soon discover that there are monsters in the mist. Those in the store begin dividing into different factions. There's those like Dave, who though nervous and frightened, keep their wits about them and try to figure out the best course of action. Then there are others like Brent who decides that action needs to be taken immediately and leave the store. There are many who aren't sure what's going on. Then there's Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Wallace) an eccentric woman who proclaims that the mist has been sent by God to cleanse the Earth in preparation for the final days. Some of what Mrs. Carmody says is reasonable, but her self-righteousness minus any compassion and mercy turn her into an apocalyptic cult leader. One by one those in the store succumb to Mrs. Carmody's cult-preaching, proving that what's happening inside the store may just be far more deadly than anything out in the mist.<br /><br />THE MIST is an adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King short story. Darabont wrote the script, directed, and co-produced THE MIST. I really like Darabont as a director. I have a friend who once said that if Darabont only directed five or six movies in his life, it would be enough because each of his films is so well-crafted. THE MIST is Darabont's fourth film and if he continues his pace, he probably only will direct five or six films in his life. But, that's okay.<br />THE MIST is almost a perfect adaptation of Stephen King's original story, with a few slight changes.<br /><br />Mrs. Carmody. It may have just been me, but it seemed like Mrs. Carmody was more than just a kooky lady with some eccentric religious beliefs who becomes caught up in a sacrificial fever. Instead, it seemed to me that Darabont was using her character to vilify anyone who has religious beliefs. For instance, there were a couple of times when she would say something that I would agree with, but I found myself shuddering because her statements were not backed by her actions.<br /><br />However, Mrs. Carmody's portrayal is minor compared to the one huge alteration. King's story is ambiguous and no one knows what happens to the characters but the story ends in \\"hope\\". I guess that ending didn't satisfy Darabont because he took King's story and extended the ending and turns the hopeful ending into one of the bleakest and darkest endings I have ever seen in a movie. Darabont still remains one of my favorite directors, but it does make me wonder if Darabont, whose previous films were ones filled with hope, compassion, and faith (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, and THE MAJESTIC), is taking his career in a different direction.<br /><br />Overall, THE MIST is a monster movie filled with psychological horror and an ending so bleak it might just make you sick. For a bit a trivia, be sure to notice THE GUNSLINGER poster that Dave is painting at the beginning of the movie.e beginning of the movie.

He was a biggest fan of john mayall, he had trouble in collecting his record cuz it wasn't sold in Indonesia.  and when i told him that i can buy it via internet, he was so happy and we both browsed so many albums and finally bought 5 - 7 records. Not long after he received the package, he passed away. I was shocked and whenever I listen to this album, i always remember my Pa. John mayall's album indeed gave the rest of my pa's life a happiness. I will take care of those albums forever. . .. John Mayall all the best!!
B000EXZI0A|5.0|Even though I've listened to songs by the Ramones throughout my life, e.g. \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\", I honestly didn't know anything about the Ramones until after seeing the ENTOURAGE episode when Vince and Eric try to get the script for a Ramones biopic.  After seeing the episode, I had a realization of just how influential the Ramones have been to modern music.  The Ramones were so influential that there really isn't any decent current band that hasn't been influenced by their music in some way.  What's ironic about their career is that the band never received any real popular acclaim until they broke up and most of the members died.  Therefore, it's even more ironic that this cd is labeled GREATEST HITS because the Ramones didn't have any greatest hits.<br /><br />Talking with people I've discovered are Ramones fans, I've come to believe that GREATEST HITS is a good primer for those unacquainted with the band.  This was the first Ramones cd I purchased watching that ENTOURAGE episode and it served as a good introduction for me, illustrating just how wide the scope of their musical talents were.  My favorite tunes from the album include \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\", \\"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\\", \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\", \\"Rock `N' Roll High School\\", \\"Baby, I Love You\\", \\"Do You Remember Rock `N' Roll Radio?\\", \\"The KKK Took My Baby Away\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\", and \\"Wart Hog\\".<br /><br />If you're already a fan of the Ramones, you already own every song on this album so don't buy it.  However, if you've just been introduced to the group, RAMONES: GREATEST HITS is a good album to start with.
0060007737|1.0|Having worked myself within academia for ten years and in the \\"real\\" world of marketing for about as long, I must say that this book fills no purpose at all. It is nothing but an arbitrary collection of guesses that are not proved, could not be proved and would be of limited valuen even if proved. Neither the acadmic nor the practitioner can find any real value in this book.    For the academic, the method of making unqualified guesses without being able to prove any of them is, I hope all will agree, worthless. Research is about being able to test and prove one's hypotheses, but the authors show no interest in that. It is more comfy to just make guesses, but it's not research.    For the practitioner, the scientific failures of the book may not be as important, but where's the value in it. Two guys make guesses about what might work in companies, but they have nothing at all to support their guesses.    All in all, this is a book that should never have been written, never read and certainly never relied upon.

B000R8YC18|5.0|Scorsese's finest film explores the psyche of an unstable individual living in a self-imposed loneliness brought about by his schizophrenia. Travis Bickle is a taxi driver and a man plagued by his inability to integrate socially. Thus, the rejection he receives withdraws him further and further into his own delusions. He harbors nothing but contempt and loathing for the city of New York in which he lives; it is a city he sees filled with decay, crime, violence, and prostitution. Envisioning himself as \\"God's lonely man,\\" Travis is surrounded by people he cannot approach nor relate to, people he consequently perceives as cold and distant. Scorsese places the viewer within this subjective schizoid experience with the cinematography and voice-over.    The plot takes Travis through his stages of rejection and follows him as his delusions evolve new releases for his frustrations. Because Travis considers his own shortcomings the result of other's actions, he extends this view to those around him and perceives others as suffering at the hands of external, corrupting figures also. Early in the film we are introduced to his muse and angel, Betsy, and we hear as he narrates from his diary, \\"they cannot touch her.\\" This is a testament to both his delusional paranoia and his admiration for her. She is dressed in white and is captured walking slowly with a smile -- a symbol of the unspoilt purity Travis sees in her. He works up the courage to ask her on a date and she complies. They meet a few times, however, after Travis takes Betsy to a porno movie, she rejects him. There are a few theories as to why he brings her to the porno movie in the first place but the one I find most interesting (and the one which makes the most sense in the context of the rest of the film) is that Travis has what is known as the Madonna-whore complex meaning he cannot integrate his desires for love and sex -- there exists a dichotomy within his psychology which keeps the two separate. In his mind women who are sexually interested in him must be whores (for how else could they want ME?) and women who aren't sexually interested in him may remain desirable, but ultimately unlovable in the fullest sense. Nonetheless, following her rejection, Travis deludes himself into thinking she must be corrupted as well (she fails to return his phone calls so now he considers her cold and distant like all the rest, and therefore corrupted) and so begins the formulation of his master-plan to liberate the objects of his desire. This concludes the first stage of his rejection.    Travis finds his calling after crossing paths with a 12-year-old prostitute named Iris. Wanting to rescue her from her private hell, he offers to take her away from the pimp controlling her. Upon her refusal of his aid, he is now further troubled by this second rejection. (Getting back to the subject of the Madonna-whore complex, we can see that the woman Travis wants most, Betsy, he cannot have, and the one he doesn't want, Iris, he can have.) These events lead Travis to execute his grandiose plan to elevate himself to the level of a hero and free his objects of desire from their \\"own private hells.\\" Seeking to remove the source of their corruption, Travis proceeds to assassinate a presidential candidate (whom he sees as the paternal figure to Betsy -- Betsy is a staunch supporter of his and a volunteer campaigner) and kill Iris' pimps. Although failing to assassinate the candidate, he does succeed in killing the pimps, albeit after taking a few shots to the neck and shoulder.    As the police arrive in the brothel after the carnage has taken place, we see Travis lift his gun up to his head and pull the trigger. Nothing, his ammunition is empty. Travis then draws his finger to his head and mimicks three gun shots. This symbolizes Travis' final rejection of himself following his previous two rejections.    In the final scene as he lays dying from his wounds, we see Travis' final vision/revelation. In thisvision, the papers applaud him as the hero who rescued the young prostitute Iris and her parents even express their admiration for his actions. We even see Betsy come back to Travis, showing that his delusions are similar to the prototypical Hollywood ending wherein the main woman comes back to the hero at the end of the story. Although here Betsy appears open towards him, he remains cold and does not acknowledge her presence. He has accepted the theory of his fellow cabbie who tells him earlier that people tend to become their job. At the end, Travis accepts who he is as a taxi driver. Just preceding his implied physical death we witness his final spiritual affirmation as the film exits the way it entered, with Travis driving through the city in his taxi cab.    The motif here -- character receiving a vision of desired destiny, which he must reject before death -- is a recurring one throughout Scorsese's oeuvre. It is seen most strictly in The Last Temptation of Christ and Casino, for instance.

B0012FBZD8|4.0|The Invasion, starring the beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig (the latest James Bond),is a remake of \\"The Body Snatchers\\" made back in the late 50s or early 60s.  It has been updated for 21st century viewers, the story is more believable (albeit the viewer still needs to suspend disbelief), and the acting is superb.  The Invasion has a different ending than the original version, and it may disappoint some viewers.  The original ending was a bit more shocking, although depressing, and left viewers with a sense of hopelessness.  If you, however, enjoy Coleman, Craig, a good story, fast-paced films, and science fiction, you'll enjoy The Invasion.

I know your church's opinion and do not need you to re-state it.    These books are an imaginative tale that dares to express ideas that are considered \\"evil\\" by a good portion of the non-thinking illogical world.  Are these the best books ever?  No.  The narrative is not the most clear, and some plot aspects are lacking.  But, the merits of the book are still there.  The book entertains, and still elicits an emotional response to the woes of its heroes.    I'm just sick of reading reviews titled \\"DO NOT READ THIS! DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS!!

B000YAFJYS|5.0|Marjane Satrapi, lives with her parents (voiced by Catherine Deneuve and Simon Abkarian) in Iran during the difficult times leading up to and from the removal of the Shah. Marjane frequently spends time with her grandmother (voiced by Danielle Darrieux) who bristles at the new restrictions placed on women. As Marjane (voiced by Chianni Mastrianni) grows up, she learns about new things, including rock music, and wears band t-shirts under her traditional dress, attends parties to make out with boys, and has remarkable luck staying one step ahead of the police. Eventually, things become so bad in Iran, and everyone realizes Marjane will never reach her full potential there, that she is sent to live in Vienna. Later, she returns, heartbroken, and can't handle the religious and political pressures placed on the young people of her generation. She eventually immigrates to France.<br /><br />Strangely, what I have just described is the synopsis for the new animated film \\"Persepolis\\". This new film from France has been winning many awards and garnering a lot of attention. Even more strangely, Marjane Satrapi bases it on semi-autobiographical graphic novels. The idea alone is enough to garner the project attention, but the end result is very good, giving us a fascinating look at the life of one girl who grew up in a difficult time, in a difficult place, and chose a fairly unique way to tell her story.<br /><br />Satrapi's drawing style is eye-catching. Seemingly very simplistic, she catches a lot of detail by showing the pattern on a dress, for example, to make the drawing seem more significant than a simple black and white line drawing. Throughout, she captures little details like this, allowing us to get a glimpse of what life was like in this tumultuous part of the country's history.<br /><br />Satrapi and her co-director Vincent Paronnaud, have adapted the unique look of Satrapi's graphic novels to this film. I am glad the people backing this film gave her the freedom to retain this unique visual look, rather than try to use CGI or more realistic animation. In a way, this more simplistic style lends itself better to the tone and scope of the story. Yes, there are a lot of larger things happening around her, but the story is about Marjane and her family, and needs to remain fairly intimate. Because the filmmakers stick with the style originated by Marjane, probably be at home in a newspaper comic strip, the film seems to convey Marjane's plight in a more realistic way.<br /><br />I have read Marjane has been very influenced by Italian Neorealism and German Expressionism and this is very evident in her drawing style. As Marjane hears stories of other family members, the drawings take on the appearance of woodcuts, moving in a stilted, jangled fashion. These moments also help to reinforce the romantic nature a child would give to these horrific events. Stories become fairy tales to young boys and girls, so Marjane is unable to realize the events being described are real or dangerous, and gives them a romantic, daring edge while they are scaring her. There is an old silent animated film called \\"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\\". In this film, the characters are all paper cuts and the animation is done by moving these figures every frame or so. This style is so closely related to fairy tales it is almost impossible to think of anything else when you see it.<br /><br />The film is also largely composed in black and white, with brief moments of color at the beginning and end. These moments help to highlight the fact the bulk of the story is a remembrance, a dream of a time past. All of these choices are the right choices and help to make this story right, giving us a real feel for what Marjane experienced growing up in this environment.<br /><br />As Marjane gets older, she becomes more rebellious and more daring. She buys bootleg copies of her favorite rock musicians, wears a Michael Jackson button underneath her traditional Muslim wear,and attends parties with boys. But all of these things are strictly forbidden and she and her friends have to be teenagers in a fairly clandestine environment, adding an element of danger to the evening.<br /><br />As Marjane gets older, she also begins to question authority and lash out at the people in charge. These activities coincide with the growing unrest in their country, and the government's increased efforts on cracking down on these same activities. Her parents realize the country will only get worse before it gets better, so they arrange for Marjane to live in Vienna. With this newfound freedom, Marjane goes a little wild and finds it difficult to live with her host family.<br /><br />She eventually returns to Iran, a more confident, headstrong, rebellious woman. As she grows, so does the crackdown imposed by the government and things are worse than ever. But life in Vienna also beat Marjane down a bit and she returns a bit defeated, a bit worse for wear. She tries to live up to the ideals imposed by the government, and becomes depressed by having so many civil liberties taken away. A well-timed conversation with her grandmother leads her to take the next step and move to Paris, leaving her family behind.<br /><br />\\"Persepolis\\" is almost instantly engaging; the style of animation and the portrayal of a young Marjane draw the viewer into this world. As Marjane grows, we learn about this country, it's struggles, and more importantly Marjane's struggles to live in such a place. And during the final moments of the film, \\"Persepolis\\" is a very moving film; the intimate story has really given us a feel for Marjane, her parents and her grandmother, and their struggles. As we watch Marjane leave all of this behind, for a new life, it is very difficult to feel anything but moved.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about \\"Persepolis\\" is that it is more real, more touching and more emotional than most other films.

1400031524|3.0|I am wondering if Mankell spent any time in Latvia doing research for this book. While it is a very good yarn, I question whether Riga was a grim as Mankell describes. I question this because of personal experiences and because in an afterward in the book Mankell pleads \\"poetic license\\" for the Riga he portrays.<br /><br />I was in Moscow in 1978 with a trade group and encountered a group of Latvians at the Moscow airport. They were waiting for their flight home after some sort of meetings in Moscow. They were singing, laughing and joking and had a very in-your-face attitude toward the Soviet officials who were glowering at them. I don't know if they were using the hijinks to annoy the officials or just having a good time. However, the memory of their spirit has stayed with me through the years.<br /><br />In 2004, my wife and I took a cruise on the Baltic, and one of the ports of call was Tallinn in neighboring Estonia. Tallinn was an attractive and pleasant city. I encountered an Arizona Saloon, which paid homage to John Wayne and his movies; a wedding reception at a McDonald's; and a lot of Finns who had come over on the ferry for the day. It is hard for me to picture that Riga would be in such worse shape. The book was written in the early 90s, but is a decade long enough to rehabilitate the city Mankell portrays.<br /><br />Somehow, I feel Mankell had this great idea for a story and felt Latvia, Estonia or Lithuanian seemed a logical site. Then, he forced his idea on Riga.<br /><br />Also, it seemed a bit of a stretch to have Wallander suddenly becoming James Bond.
B00005JPXY|4.0|\\"Cloverfield\\", the new film from producer JJ Abrams (TV's \\"Lost\\" and \\"Alias\\", director of \\"Mission Impossible III\\"), is an interesting, very successful experiment in filmmaking.<br /><br />Rob (Michael Stahl - David) has just received a promotion and a new job in Japan (wink, wink). Before he leaves, his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas), arrange a surprise party in Rob's midtown Manhattan loft. Jason videotapes the day, borrowing Rob's video camera and videotaping over a tape Rob made of a special day he spent with Beth (Odette Yustman) a week or so earlier. When Rob arrives at the party, his best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is in charge of videotaping the events, so Rob will have a keepsake. Everyone is having a good time until Beth shows up with another guy. But Rob barely has time to think about this when the entire building shakes. Everyone rushes to the roof and they see an explosion and chaos near the Hudson River. They rush inside and the news is carrying a story about an oil tanker hitting the Statue of Liberty. They make their way to the street and an explosion a couple of blocks away causes panic. Soon, the head of the Statue of Liberty comes crashing through and pandemonium reigns. Rob, Jason, Hud and Lily try to get someplace safe and they soon realize New York City is being attacked by a large beast. Soon, Rob receives a teary cell call from Beth, who left earlier. Rob is determined to make his way to her apartment and help her. As they proceed, they run into all manner of obstacles and no one is safe. At least Hud is smart enough to keep the camcorder rolling during their journey.<br /><br />The problem with so many monster movies is the filmmakers show the monster way too soon. This is problematic for a variety of reasons. If the monster is, in the slightest, unconvincing, there is no hope of creating any suspense with the audience. Once they see an actor wearing a big rubber suit, or a CGI creation moving awkwardly, nothing else in the film will seem real enough and all hope is lost. If the monster is convincing, and we believe in it, showing it too soon also robs the film of suspense. Once we see the creature, we are no longer thinking about what the creature might be, what caused it to be created, what are the creature's motivations. This opens the rest of the film up for scrutiny. Trust me, most filmmakers who are making a monster film, don't want to invite this scrutiny.<br /><br />Abrams and director Matt Reeves conceived an idea in which the entire film is presented as a Government file, top secret, and obtained from the videotape Hud and Jason shoot throughout the day. Because this is all handheld camera work, the camera turns to look for the source of noises or destruction. The monster destroys something, causing a noise or disturbance, and then Hud and the others turn to look. Naturally, the monster isn't still standing in the same place. If they are lucky, they capture a bit of a leg or a tail on the video before running away. They use this technique in a smart way; because we are watching someone's camcorder, it takes a long time for us to get a good look at the monster, allowing the film to ratchet up the suspense, putting the main characters in a number of situations keeping us on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />The filmmakers have also smartly cast a group of complete unknowns to play the principals in the film. Because we don't recognize any of the actors, we more readily accept they are young people living in New York, we more readily accept they are attending a surprise party for their friend Rob, we more readily accept we are watching a camcorder recording this party and all of the horrific events after it.<br /><br />This film wouldn't work as well if recognizable actors populated the world. \\"Move Jessica Alba, move, the monster is about to get you\\" is just harder to make work than \\"Rob, you really shouldn't go down that dark subway tunnel\\". Who's Rob? He'sthe guy whose going away party was interrupted by a monster attacking the Statue of Liberty. Wait, that's not real? Oh.<br /><br />Thankfully, with the advent of digital camcorders, the images in \\"Cloverfield\\" are quite good, pretty clear. This isn't \\"The Blair Godzilla Project\\", filled with grainy, dark images. This camcorder captures a lot of detail and gives us a pretty good view of the destruction, of the terror, of the aftermath of this monster's visit.<br /><br />As Rob and his friends make their way through New York, they meet various obstacles along the way, frightening, dangerous obstacles, adding to the suspense of the film. They work through these moments, trying to remain safe, trying to remain alive, trying to get to Beth.<br /><br />As the film begins, we watch as Rob and Beth wake up in bed together and make some plans to visit Coney Island. Then Jason and Lily at the market, buying some things for the party that night, interrupt the images. They quickly fill us in on the details and it becomes clear Jason has borrowed Rob's video camera and he is clearly videotaping over something else. Throughout the film, these moments with Rob and Beth come through, whenever Hud stops the camera, or there is a brief interruption. Watching these moments of Rob and Beth together help to explain why he is so intent on finding her, making his way through the hazardous streets of New York under attack. These moments also help to add one more moment to the film, making the fact we are watching a handheld camera recording all of these horrific events all the more credible.<br /><br />The film also moves at a fast pace. After spending some time with everyone as they prepare for the party and then meeting everyone at Rob's big night, the monster attacks. These early scenes are necessary to give us the framework for the story. We have to have someone to care for and go on this journey with. But once the monster attacks, our group of partiers is always on the go, trying to stay alive and as far away from this creature as possible. At 90 minutes, the film never lags, providing us with a bit of a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" isn't for everyone; I know a lot of people who can't watch a few minutes of handheld camera work, let alone an entire film.

To my dismay, I could not make myself read this book and am still trying to read it for my book club but the author reminds me of a spoiled child that didn't like what she found in marriage so she chose to run and take the advance on her book to pay for her escape and we all must suffer through her narcissistic story.  Her view of her self importance is revolting.  I would not recommend this book.  It is doubtful that I will finish it, this book is not an enjoyable read and if I do finish it will be soley for the purpose of being able to discuss it fully at the book club meeting.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I have to say, before I begin, that a great resonance of this film for me was the fact that it evoked my own musical past.  A Boston-based musician \\"back in the day\\" (WAY back!) I lived many of the same moments as \\"He\\" does in the film.<br /><br />That said, this is essentially a boy-meets-girls story, the twist being that He and She are both musicians.  But unlike most Hollywood-driven stories of this genre, the relationship is only a secondary focus.  Rather, it is the music that is at center stage...and what music it is.  Simple, real, and from the heart, it is the music and its development that carries the story forward.<br /><br />The two leads, He and She (for neither we nor they actually ever learn the characters' names) are played superbly by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, non-actors, but also real life friends and musical collaborators.  He is played with earnest honesty (Hansard is essentially playing himself), and She is portrayed as whimsical, slightly ethereal, and strong-yet vulnerable.  Yet the lack of a Hollywood ham-fisted touch is clearly evident not only in the low budget, almost documentary style of John Carney's spot-on direction, but also in the evolution of the characters' story.  For while this is clearly a love story, it does not follow standard Hollywood protocol.  Indeed, there is no seal-the-deal first kiss, no sex, and the two characters do not set off into the sunset together.  Instead, they come together, enrich one another's lives, and then follow their individual paths...wherever those may lead.<br /><br />But this is not to say that the story or the film is lacking, for in place of the usual detailed unfolding of an intimate relationship to rivet the audience's attentions and emotions, here we get to witness the unfolding of the music, as \\"His\\" songs are slowly transformed from solo street ballads into remarkably listenable arrangements by a pick-up band of nameless street musicians...and recorded \\"simply because.\\"<br /><br />It was in watching this unfolding that I was personally the most captured, because I have known the wonder Hansard perfectly captures and portrays as he first hears Irglov&aacute; accompany him on one of his songs.  I have lived the rush he experiences when his little accidental band suddenly transforms his solo efforts into something that somehow magically exceeds the limits of its own creation.  And I also lived through looking in the mirror, as He does, and realizing that all of his musical efforts ultimately spring from a crushed spirit.  While it is never explicitly touched upon in the movie, I wondered, as He goes off to apparently reclaim the track his life SHOULD have taken, whether he was wondering, as I did, whether his muse would leave once the hole in his spirit was healed and his heart was restored.<br /><br />But perhaps I am projecting too much of my own story on this wonderful film, a movie that people may read into, but which certainly needs no help in touching the heart, the emotions, and the soul.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|I was enchanted with this film. It is quite original, I thought and I loved the multitude of different characters, all interesting in their own way. And who didn't find Tristan utterly adorable and charming? He made this film. For all fantasy/romance lovers, this is a perfect film for you. Though I am still confused as to why Robert De Niro has a huge image of himself on hte poster and dvd and the actor who playes Tristan doesn't even has name on it whatsoever. I was a bit miffed at that because he is the main character while De Niro is barely even in the film. But anyway, this is a refreshing new type of fantasy that will surely appeal to all ages. Also, the blooper reel has some real funny stuff on it.
B00006FM77|3.0|Yep, I again have to agree with Bill Fleck that something just was not quite right on this one. As I mentioned in my review of Chicago III, I saw this band less than 60 days before this 5-day marathon recordfest, and I wish they had recorded that one night instead. However - that said - I must also take to task Mr. Guercio for what I feel to be bad production decisions regardless of the band's state. You have to remember that this was early 1971 and this band had already done over 700 shows. I might get drunk too. It sounds as though the band is ashamed to play \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\". I refuse to believe that after five nights, that was the best take. I will say this: Danny Seraphine was neither drunk nor sloppy. This guy (as I remember well from seeing them) was AWESOME. As good on his instrument as Terry Kath was on his. Speaking of which: Why is Kath playing electric on \\"Flight 602\\"? and \\"Happy Cause I'm Going Home\\"? Why is he up in the mix AT ALL TIMES even when he should be backed off some? \\"Free\\" is terrible - WAY too fast and the vocals...ouch. Then \\"I Don't Want Your Money\\" crawls like a tortoise. These are a few of the things that bug me about this recording. Also we don't need over three minutes of nothing to start this.   O.K....now that that is all off my chest, I also agree ultimately that this is worth having. Like \\"Mr. Chops\\" says, it is a document of an event, and well worth the flaws simply to have that document. Bill, I hear you and agree with you. But we both also agree that one should have this. That is the highest praise, no?
0142000671|4.0|This was required school reading. It was probably the shortest book we had to read, but it was also my most favorite. The plot is simple, but the message is profound. It always somewhat depresses me just thinking about it. A must read for young and old alike.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I had managed to catch one or two episodes of this series on TV and found it frustrating that I was not seeing all of them, so I broke down and purchased this set.  It was an investment in nature.  I cannot give any more accolades here than others have already given.  However, I'd like to comment that the bonus material was also very fascinating.  I cannot believe what some of these filming teams went through to bring us these fabulous shots.  I would not even be able to comprehend spending 2 months in the Antarctic in the dead of winter, but I can say that their work and sacrifice definitely paid off.  The Diaries are a must see part of this set.

I just didn't care. I know many people love this book for whatever reason, but it just didn't do anything for me and I easily forgot about it after finishing it.

It plays like a college or even high school film project that the professor gave an failing grade to. Everything about this movie is sophmoric.

The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read.

I am so glad that I did, because while I was always a huge fan of MM, this book opened up a whole new side of the band and it's front man to me.  Not only is Brian a fantastic musician, he is also a great story-teller and writer.  His childhood was twisted, his life - twisted, yet completely normal.  The book is somewhat gruesome, but also shows a softer side of Brian.  This book is not only a great read for fans, it is also a great read for haters and people who are not fans!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

It brings about good points involving bullying and the long-term affects it can have.  This book was fast paced and had a surprising ending.  This was my second Picoult book and I loved it as much as I loved the first, My Sister's Keeper.  Both are told from numerous points of view and each character had a distinct voice.  I really enjoyed reading this book.
B0000041Z6|4.0|The recent tenth anniversary of Solti's death has prompted me to renew my acquaintance with this conductor's work.  Over a period of several months I have been listening to recordings from various phases of Solti's career of diverse repertoire from Bach to Bartok.  As a result of this effort, I have come to a new estimation of an artist of whose work I had previously a fairly low regard.  This estimation was, I believe, based more on the received opinions of record reviewers than my own perceptions.  I had always believed Solti to be a \\"high-voltage\\" sensationalist who tended to brutalize the standard repertoire.  That assessment, however, misses both the abiding accomplishments of Solti's career as well as the many ways in which his interpretive proclivities matured over the years.<br /><br />The set under review here presents Solti's work with the CSO over a span of about fifteen years.  Earlier versions of certain symphonies with other orchestras, and in some cases later versions with the same orchestra, have been passed over for the sake of presenting a maximally coherent interpretive profile.  In some cases, the compilers' decisions concerning which versions to include were regrettable, though overall one can derive from this set an accurate estimation of Solti's approach to this composer, with its characteristic virtues and vices.  What is most striking about these performances, perhaps, is the sheer virtuosity Solti evokes from the band with which he was associated for such a large portion of his career.  They respond instinctively and with remarkable unanimity to his every gesture.  This is playing that, in purely technical terms, approaches perfection.  Another virtue is Solti's ability to balance detail and structure in unfolding Mahler's densely contrapuntal textures and sometimes convoluted symphonic arguments.  Like his fellow Hungarians Fritz Reiner and George Szell, Solti combines intellectual brilliance with a consummate understanding of orchestral sonority at every level.  But unlike them, his approach to Mahler (and other composers) is warmer, more affectionate, and ultimately more compelling.  Indeed, the very intensity of his involvement with this music can be disturbing, and may account for the impression of sensationalism that has worried many reviewers over the years.<br /><br />However, no single conductor can interpret every work within a composer's symphonic output with equal insight or enthusiasm; and so Solti's  Mahler cycle is predictably uneven--though no more so perhaps than Bernstein's, Kubelik's or Abbado's (to name just a few).<br /><br />Here is a brief run-down of my (mostly positive) impressions of each performance in this set:<br /><br />No. 1:  Solti's earlier version of this symphony with the LSO is a riveting account, justly praised for its brilliance.  The later CSO version, included here, is warmer, more evocative, and also more hazily recorded (early digital).  The introduction to the first movement is quite magical, but thereafter the tension begins to flag, and despite some gorgeous playing, the overall impression is one of fits and starts.  My own preference would be for the superbly remastered LSO version, or better yet for Horenstein.<br /><br />No. 2:  Solti also recorded this with the LSO in the early Sixties.  The later version may lack the grip of the earlier, but it is more sensitive to nuance and atmosphere, particularly in the long Finale.  I prefer the soloists in the LSO version, but otherise the later performance is to be preferred; it conveys a greater sense of occasion.  On the other hand, Solti doesn't begin to convey the spiritual depths of the work as searchingly as Klemperer, Walter or Bernstein.<br /><br />No. 3:  I have not heard Solti's earlier, LSO version of this work, but it was almost universally regarded by critics as unsympathetic.  The later version conveys a welcome cogency in a work that can seem to ramble, but otherwise this is one of the less impressive performances in Solti's Mahler Cycle.  Solti doesn't seem entirely in sympathy with the work's evocation of cosmic forces in the first movement, or pastoral epiphanies in the second and third.  The fourth movement with its Nietzsche setting manages to convey a haunting quality, and the Morning Bells of the fifth are exuberant enough.  But then in the finale, Solti fails to convey a sense of rapt contemplation; the dynamics are marginally too loud, and there is a certain nervous quality that militates against any sense of spiritual exaltatio.  For that, go to Horenstein or Bernstein/Sony.<br /><br />No. 4: Solti's earlier recording of this work, with the Concertgebouw (and Sylvia Stahlman as soloist) was more rambunctious and less well controlled than the one under consideration here. Though the earlier version arguably has more character, many will find the later, digital version preferable.  Solti's interpretation had evidently \\"settled\\" in the interval between the two recordings.  The latter is more of a \\"mainstream\\" or consensus account which effectively conveys this work's nostalgia and whimsy.  Dame Kiri is a splendid soloist in the finale.  In the end, however, I would opt for Walter, Reiner, Kubelik or Kletzki in this work.<br /><br />No. 5:  An unpleasantly hard-edged,  even hard-nosed interpretation, though that impression may be partly due to poor engineering (as many critics have opined over the years--including Solti himself!).  Solti's later CSO recording, done live on  tour in 1991 is far more effective in conveying the work's agonies and ecstasies--and the sound falls far more pleasingly on the ear..<br /><br />No. 6:  A thrilling performance--maybe not a profound as Bernstein, but superbly played and vividly recorded, with devastating cumulative effect.  One of the better sixths around, in my estimation.  Far better than the overpraised Karajan.<br /><br />No. 7:  Bernstein evokes a more haunting atmosphere in movments 1-3, but Solti's incisiveness is also welcome.  Solti is surprisingly seductive in the fourth-movement serenade, and second to none in his ability to hold the ramshackle finale together.  Overall, a compelling account, and once again the CSO cover themselves in glory.<br /><br />No. 8:  Arguably Solti's most famous recording, and justly so.  A performance of a problematic work that successfully combines rigor with sensitivity.  No imporant detail escapes Solti's attention, yet he has the measure of Mahler's \\"cosmic\\" vision.  Tennstedt conveys the work's religious ardor more effectively, and Bernstein is uniquely propulsive in the first movment; but Solti's grasp of the work's architecture is so complete that everything proceeds with a sense of dramatic inevitability.  The solo and choral singing are first rate--indeed, unsurpassed on record.<br /><br />No. 9:  Solti would not seem to be an ideal expositor of this elusive, death-haunted work, and indeed his earlier LSO version could be accused of exposing every dark corner of the piece with a searchlight brilliance.  The later CSO account, however, reveals how much Solti matured as a Mahler interpreter.  It conveys the hushed intensity as well as the tragic import that were lacking the first time around.  Solti's is a dark, turbulent vision of the work--no easy consolations here.  Even the second movement--which is often given as \\"comic relief\\" in the midst of overpowering tragedy--is dark and menacing here, thanks to a slowish tempo and heavy accents. Throughout the CSO revel in Mahler's kaleidoscopic scoring.  A superb Ninth, in my estimation--though it doesn't quite achieve the catharsis of Bernstein or Karajan.<br /><br />In sum, then, the prospective purchaser would probably do better to acquire individual versions of each symphony rather than opting for an integral set under one conductor.  However, if the idea of a modestly priced box appeals to you, and if you are open to Solti's intensely dramatic and hyper-virtuosic style of interpretation, then I wouldn't hesitate to acquire what is ultimately one of the better Mahler cycles around.<br /><br />UPDATE:  As part of their \\"Masters\\" series, RCA/Sony have just reissued in a ridiculously inexpensive bargain box all of James Levine's Mahler recordings made made for RCA during the '70's and early '80's, with three orchestras --the LSO, Chicago and Philadelphia. Though Levine, regrettably, never got around to recording 2 & 8 (was expense a factor?), his incomplete cycle does include all of the remaining symphonies plus the revised Cooke completion of no. 10.  Since single-issue bargain editions of 2 & 8 are readily available, and since Levine remains unsurpassed (in my estimation) among recent Mahler interpreters (warmer than Solti, more disciplined than Bernstein/CBS or DG, to name just two), I would not hesitate to recommend this newly-reissued set as a \\"starter collection\\" for neophytes, or an add-on for Mahler aficionados.  As for the two \\"missing\\" symphonies in Levine's cycle, I would recommend Solti for both: his classic LSO account of the \\"Resurrection\\" has recently been reissued on a single Decca CD in stunning 24-bit remastered sound (and it always *did* sound great); his equally classic Chicago recording of the Eighth is also available on a single CD in the same series.ess is also welcome.

B00064ADR0|5.0|can be found on this classic album by Johnny Winter.  Please listen to the solo that Johnny launches into in the middle of \\"Miss Ann\\" and you will agree. Guitar playing does not get any better than this.    Having been around long enough to remember when Second Winter first came out on vinyl (yes, the famous 3-sided LP), and then buying it again and again in various \\"new\\" music formats as they came along - cassette, 8-track, CD, and finally, this two-disc set, I can without question say that Second Winter is a rock blues masterpiece that deserves a place right alongside B.B. King's \\"Live at the Regal\\" in the Best Blues Albums of All-Time Hall of Fame.  This is the master at his very best.  Buy this CD and then buy it again and give the second Second Winter to a friend.
0385503954|5.0|Atonement is now my favourite of McEwan's novels (a position previous held by On Chesil Beach, A Child in Time and the first terrible chapter of Enduring Love).     It's breathtakingly good, so beautifully written and carefully detailed that you are drawn right in ... to a large English house on a stiflingly hot summer's day, to the war ravaged landscape of France as an army retreats to Dunkirk, to a London hospital swamped by the war-wounded in the aftermath.    As so often in McEwan's novels, something completely unthinkable happens and destroys the lives of all involved. Here the testimony of a thirteen year old girl, Briony Tallis, sends an innocent man to gaol for a rape (or molestation) that he did not commit. Was it simply a misunderstanding from which Briony found it impossible to withdraw once events were set in motion? Was she the victim of her own over-dramatic imagination? Was she simply jealous of the sexual passion that had been ignited between her sister, Cecilia, and Robbie?    Whatever the truth, Robbie's lower social status weighs against him. He is the son of the housekeeper, hitherto treated as a member of the family, and Mr. Tallis has even paid for this education at Cambridge and is willing to finance his further studies in medicine. But although he had been formerly treated as a member of the family, that relationship seems now to carry no weight. He is sentenced while the true perpetrator of the crime is not even suspected, although all the clues are there.    Cecilia pledges her love as her man is led away, but really can there be a happy ending for the two? And can Briony ever really atone for the harm she has caused?    One of the biggest delights of the book for me was the post-modern twist towards the end which has the reading flicking back to re-evaluate the story in the light of new evidence.    I shall give no more than that away, even though I'm dying to. It's enough to say that I found the book moving and unputdownable and surprising.    Back in 2001 I remember banging on to whoever would listen about how glad I was that Peter Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang won the Booker that year. Now, while that book still remains a firm favourite, I'm forced to reconsider!
B000O599ZS|5.0|John Wayne should have been the unanimous OScar winner for his role as Ethan Edwards. It is John Wayne as you never ever see him and he delivers the best western performance ever. That stare as he whirls around to look at the white girl rescused by the cavalry is what acting is all about. Hands down my favorite Western ever made and easily one of the greatest films ever done. Great job by John Ford and the cast including great turns by Jeffrey Hunter, Ken Lucas and the great Ward Bond. Treat yourself and by the Special Edition boxed set.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|Having not read Dracula in years, I decided to read it again and compare it to the contemporary (1992) movie version...Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" starring Gary Oldman. When I initially read the story as a child, I focused more on my stereotyped \\"Dracula as performed by Bella Lugosi\\" and not Stoker's original version. Reading Stoker in the original again I was charmed by the writing style and mores of the times. It holds up well. I then watched Coppola's movie which was tarted up and sexualized for today's audience. While Oldman's over the top performance is great fun to watch, the book is so much better. And if I were Stoker, I would be turning in my grave since the movie version barely follows the book and yet is \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\".

B000001ES9|5.0|After being dissapointed with listening to Rush's latest plastic frisbee, I've went and revisted this old classic to repaire the hearing damage.<br /><br />God, I love this album.....<br /><br />Simply put folks, this is in my estimation Rush's finest moment as a band. Even though it is a debut record, it sure doesn't like it! They are playing with such conviction, hunger and professionalism on \\"Rush\\" for (at the time) a young rock band that I feel it is both inaccurate and irresponsible for dim wits to lable this as \\"immature\\" or \\"childish\\" when comparing it to later works. \\"Rush\\" stands out from the rest of the bands later catalog releases in a number of ways that it is almost a completely different band. [...], because we have a man named John Rutsey thumpin' the skins, and he does a great job! No need for 1,543,453,653, piece drum kits or dodgy sci-fi psycho babble, liberal propaganda, 4/17 jazz time changes or Ayn Rand garbage.... just pure power drumming that serves the songs! Geddy Lee is Geddy here, nuff' said. Alex is playing more hard/blues based guitar in the vein of Leslie West and Jimmie Page(love that!), way before he became an Andy Summers rip-off. Chech out those solos on HERE AGAIN and WORKING MAN.<br /><br />But what about the songs? Yes, the songs are all great Rock 'n' Roll here. Now Rush are not the greatest song writters, that fact is indisputable, but here not only are these songs well written, they are honest and non-pretentious. Here Rush is being nothing more then a rock band, and I love that. FINDING MY WAY is a great opening song. NEED SOME LOVE and TAKE A FREIND might have dumb lyrics, however they are miles better the the tripe Neil would be penning, plus they kick major amounts of @$$es thanks to Alex Lifeson.I really like the heavy romps of WHAT YOUR DOING and IN THE MOOD, which is much like a heavy metal Rush style song.<br /><br />Then you have WORKING MAN....Holy $ h ! t....... this must be the greatest rock song ever written, with Alex's Iommi-esq tones and 110 + guitar solos stuffed in a 7 minute mind f & * k. This is the song to end all songs.<br /><br />\\"...Ooh I Need Some Love......\\"<br /><br />Don't let the fans scare you away from this one, it is really one of the finest pure rock records...ever. This is Rush.+ guitar solos stuffed in a 7 minute mind f & * k.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|This was much better than all the great reviews I'd read.  it has the realism you need to truly enjoy a great movie, not at all hokey like die hard 2.  I mean lets face it, in 2 there are so many things that convieniently just happen to happen, its like they were trying to entertain our kids and left us out.  I dont know why so many rave about 2 being the best of the 3, but now there's a new top DH, and 4 is storming way ahead by a landslide.  I give it 5 stars because you can entertain me that way every day and I'll be as happy as if I danced with Julia Roberts.  Umm,,,, Almost!
0321525655|4.0|On the excellent side I felt the visuals in the book complimented the written text really well and at times I felt as if I was hearing Garr (even though I have never seen him present) doing a live slideshare presentation. Another great thing about the book is that you get an insight into how he prepares for presentations as well as quotes and tidbits from other presentation experts like Nancy Duarte and Guy Kawasaki. All in all it is a beautiful book that is extremely well written.    On the flipside because I am and have been a fan of Garr Reynolds and his blog for quite some time, I would have actually given this book 3 or 3 and a half stars, simply because  a lot of the ideas in the book are on his site of the same name. I have also read most of the books he recommends (and quotes excessively in the book), so I was slightly disappointed that I have been down this road. With that said however, what Garr does well, is he presents core ideas really well and although at times it seems as if the book is a bunch of book and blog post summaries it somehow works. So it is not as revolutionary as Made to Stick or a Whole New Mind and as such can't get the five rating from me,  the unintiated will enjoy this book and should have it in their library.     So the question is would I recommend this book?   If you have never heard of Garr Reynolds or his blog and you are interested in changing the way you think about presentations and improving your own, BUY this book NOW, BUY every book he recommends,BOOKMARK his blog [...]    If you are already a fan of Garr, BUY this book because now you can walk around with some of the best posts from his blog everywhere you go. In fact if he was selling his grocery list on Amazon I would buy it because of the impact his way of thinking has made on my presentations and I need and want to thank him in a tangible way. I hope this is the first of many books.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|It's not surprising that \\"Beowulf\\" is infused with a healthy dose of sarcasm. After all, the screenplay is written by Neil Gaiman (the sly English fantasy writer of the cult fave \\"Sandman\\" graphic novels) and Roger Avary (co-writer of \\"Pulp Fiction\\"). To expect a straightforward narrative from them is like adding E to your girlfriend's drink and then expecting her to act normal in front of your parents.  Throw in director Robert Zemeckis to the combination (he of \\"Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"Back to the Future\\" fame), and there's no way things can go wrong, right?  Almost. Apart from the subtle mockery of the fantasy genre and the 'heroic quest' staple that runs through \\"Beowulf\\"'s plot (the hero proclaims numerous times, in a gruff voice, flexing his biceps, that he is Beowulf, \\"here to kill your mon-stah\\" - the irony is evident), there's unfortunately not that much originality in the film. Once I realized, half-way through it, that the story wasn't going to expand beyond its 700 A.D. source's - the poem's - limitations, I got a bit depressed.  The self-aware winks certainly enliven the material, but there's no escaping the fact that it's a straightforward, simple tale, no matter how hard one tries to spice it up visually.   That's not to say \\"Beowulf\\" isn't worth a look. It's got spectacular eye-candy. The people look much more realistic than they did in the uncanny \\"Polar Express\\". Several sequences particularly stun with the wild imagination on display: the heroic Geatsman defending King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) Danish court from the horrific mon-stah Grendel (Crispin Glover); fighting off mon-stahs of the sea; encountering the sexy mon-stah that looks just like Angelina Jolie... with a tail, and heels instead of feet; or fighting off a mon-stah dragon at the end (I clearly love saying mon-stah).  I liked the ferocity with which the film plunges into its gratuitous violence (the MPAA has got to be crazy to give this film the PG-13 stamp: limbs are flying all over theplace!) I liked the gloomy, ancient tone. I liked how Beowulf is ultimately portrayed as a man as weak as the rest of us, letting his horniness overshadow the stoic bravery, surrendering to Angie's sexuality. The satire is all Gaiman, the mixture of humor and violence is pure Avary.   And yet, despite all the bombast, \\"Beowulf\\" left me unfulfilled. Perhaps it's because of my affinity towards the writers (Gaiman in particular), and the fact that my expectations were so high. I remember reading an article, in which Gaiman remarked upon his conversation with Zemeckis. It went something like this: Gaiman wasn't sure whether to include a super-expensive sequence in the script. He called Zemeckis, who told him to go ahead and write whatever he wanted, because there was nothing that could cost more than $1 mil. a minute to shoot.   Maybe it's the money that got to them. So pumped by the opportunity to impress visually, it's almost like they forgot that there has to be a truly spectacular story to supplement the top-notch imagery.

0143038419|1.0|This book helped unravel an old long-distance friendship that needed to end, thus, it provided wonderful clarity. I realized the person who gave it to me had no sense, but this cinched the rift. \\"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia,\\" by Elizabeth Gilbert, is a flaky meal of chic-lit spirituality lite. Gilbert never met a sentence beginning with \\"I\\" she didn't embrace, and proceeds to advocate spiritual cherry-picking, especially if it's her cherry.<br /><br />Other cultures exist as part of her private playground, with her narcissistic hunger to consume them. She lacks any understanding that people within a culture may see the situation from within a different, or opposite, point of view. Eurocentric cliches of Americans abound. One of Gilbert's Italian friends states that all Americans are repressed. He calls us a \\"savage people\\" (p. 58). Europeans have plenty of blood on their unrepressed hands. Then, cherry dangling, Gilbert meets Felipe in Indonesia, and makes a fetish of his being a Brazilian in his mid-fifties. She describes young Balinese men as having fine Gauguin skin (p. 302), suggesting that American fertility clinics could profit off these guys. If a man had written this racist sperm imperialism cloaked in PC garb - the Great White Lady lovin' up and marketing brown men, it would be recognized as the nonsense it is. This is stuff is more outdated than Margaret Mead, reflecting Gilbert's cosseted values, a contemporary, pseudo-intelligencia, a carnivorous plant run amuck and full of flies.

Having the chance to listen to such pristine music allows an audience member to hear every device the composer can use to enforce a particular mood and provide even more detail to characters! If you loved the book and the movie, you will definitely love this album that creates a world unto its own! This is definitely worth listening to, even if you have not read the book or seen the movie!
B00009UW0N|4.0|This is definetly one of the best horror films of all times and probably John Carpenters best flick ever made too since Carpenter knew how to scare people with this movie by making Michael Myers(Nick Castle)a.k.a. The Shape was very sneaky as well as creepy looking with heavy-breathing, especially when Michael would be someplace one second & then just be gone into thin air the next along with all the creepy music scoring he did throughout this whole movie, making it quite dark in many scenes.<br /><br />Additionally, on this HALLOWEEN DVD, they show clips of this horror flicks movie trailer showing previews that were given before it's theatrical release in the Autumn of 1978, plus they showed a look back on how this movie was really made and what John Carpenter and a lot of the co-stars from HALLOWEEN had to say about it looking back on it when they were making the movie, which made it quite interesting.<br /><br />So John Carpenters HALLOWEEN I is still the most shocking and scariest one of them all and is definetly still the best along with the fact that this Halloween was the one that started the HALLOWEEN phenomenon in the first place, plus Carpenters version was way better and a lot more genuine than Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of HALLOWEEN, since Zombie's HALLOWEEN wasn't nearly as scary or as heart-pounding as the original either along with the fact that Michael Myers wasn't nearly as creepy, nor as sneaky, nor as relentless as he was in Carpenter's version either.<br /><br />The music score in Zombie's Halloween lagged a lot too, unlike the music scoring in the first 2 HALLOWEENs.<br /><br />Additionally, I think what also makes John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN so genuine is Michael Myers was the first creepy mass murderer, especially with a mask, to kill people while secretly stalking them, but since HALLOWEEN was a low budget film that had to be done in such a small amount of time in the Spring of 1978, the producers couldn't afford to make a mask for the Shape at the time, they improvised by spray painting a Capt. Kirk Mask to make Michael's mask look more ghoulish and convincing.<br /><br />Therefore, I think the movies of FRIDAY THE 13TH which was released in the Summer of 1980 and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET which was released in the Fall of 1984 were inspired by HALLOWEEN and that the killers Jason Voorhees and Freddy Kruger were inspired by Michael Myers along with the fact that the original FRIDAY THE 13TH came out 2 years later after the original HALLOWEEN did, plus FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2 was released the same year as HALLOWEEN 2 was which was 1981, which both helped make the sagas of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH a real phenomenon.<br /><br />In addition, the movie title FRIDAY THE 13TH was inspired by John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, since they both included holidays/superstitious days along with the fact that HALLOWEEN was the first movie that used a holiday in the title, which inspired the titles of later horror flicks that came out in the early to mid 1980's like SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, NEW YEARS EVIL, APRIL FOOLS DAY, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, etc.<br /><br />P.J. Soles also co-stars in this movie too, since P.J.'s sexy naked scene with full-frontal nudity in the girls lockerroom showers in Bryan DePalma's CARRIE back in the Fall of 1976 had inspired John Carpenter to have her play the role as the sassy devirginized cheerleeder(Lynda) in this successful 1978 version of HALLOWEEN, since P.J. ends up doing a sex scene with partial nudity showing PJ's ta-tas in this movie before she dies off like every other person who has sex in a typical horror flick.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, it baffles me that in Rob Zombie's 2007 HALLOWEEN version flick, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) was a snotty annoying bitch with an unlikeable character and personality with an abnormally filthy mouth like most of the other co-stars of Zombie's HALLOWEEN version.<br /><br />In addition to that, in this HALLOWEEN version, Lynda(PJ Soles) and her boyfriend(Bob)end up making love at a babysitters friends house in the parents bed along with the fact that Lynda obviously enjoys being seduced by Bob and ends up complimenting Bob by saying \\"Oh Fantastic\\" after Lynda & Bob have their orgasm after Bob finishes nailing Lynda, but in Zombie's remake of Halloween, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) and her boyfriend(Bob)end up going to the old vacant dumpy Myers house to go have sex on a floor upstairs in a sleeping bag, but Lynda & Bob don't end up having a good time at all and end up fighting instead of having a nice time, unlike Lynda and Bob were in the original.<br /><br />In addition to why Zombie's version didn't make a lot of sense to me is Lynda doesn't enjoy getting humped by Bob at all either, plus Lynda and Bob don't even end up having an orgasm, plus Lynda continues to insult & badger Bob instead of complimenting him, almost making you want Lynda to die for being such a bitch with an attitude problem, unlike Lynda(P.J. Soles) in Carpenter's version.<br /><br />Additionally, in Carpenter's version, it was Lynda's first time getting laid and losing her virginity during Lynda's sex scene with Bob in the babysitters parents bedroom, but in Zombie's flick Lynda says to Bob \\"Why do you always have to be a \\"F\\"ing jerk everytime we do it\\", indicating that it wasn't Lynda & Bob's first time doing hubba-hubba.<br /><br />Overall, this HALLOWEEN version DVD's bonus feature explains to us that this movie ws actually in filmed in South Pasadena and that Haddonfield, Illinois was a fictional name that producer(Debra Hill)had gotten from her hometown(Haddonfield, New Jersey)and that since this flick was filmed in Southern California in the Spring time that they had to improvise by using fake autumn leaves with a wind-machine to make it look like the Fall season in the Midwest.<br /><br />In fact John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN did so well at the box office during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1978 that they ended up making HALLOWEEN II 3 years later which was released in the Fall of 1981, but Carpenter rejected to directing HALLOWEEN 2 since Carpetner didn't want to make a sequel, which was probably why they took so long to make a sequel to this HALLOWEEN, so then the job was given to director(Rick Rosenthal)and both John Carpenter and his now late ex-girlfriend(Debra Hill)only

Laurie's 3 teenage high school buddies Annie(Nancy Loomis), Lynda(PJ Soles), and Bob took place at while Laurie was babysitting Tommy(Bryan Andrews)and Lindsay(Kyle Richards)across the street where the murders took place at.<br /><br />So HALLOWEEN II starts out by Dr. Loomis running downstairs from the Doyle house with Loomis still being baffled and alarmed about Michael Myers getting up from the front-yard lawn where Michael fell onto after being shot by 6 times at close range while Loomis resumes his hot pursuit on the hellbent Myers alerting Sheriff Brackett and the local news that Myers is still at large in Haddonfield while the injured heroine(Laurie)gets picked up and taken to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital after her first confrontation with Michael at the babysitters houses with Michael resuming his relentless killing spree by setting his new target destination at the hospital attempting to kill Laurie while HALLOWEEN 2 later reveals to us that Laurie is Michael Myers's orphaned kid sister which explained Michael's motive for wanting to murder her since Michael had already killed his big sister Judith Myers(Sandy Johnson)in cold blood 15 years ago on Halloween night of 1963.3 years later which was released in the Fall of 1981, but Carpenter rejected to directing HALLOWEEN 2 since Carpetner didn't want to make a sequel, which was probably why they

0743289692|5.0|This book is important and historically noteworthy.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a heroine.  The fact that this book could have used a bit more editing is a part of its charm.  She is an inspiration to all humans to trust yourself, teach yourself, speak your mind, work for change, and never give up.  Many Muslim men must hate her, but many more worldwide thank God for her.  More than anyone else, her voice more than any other has brought the plight of Muslim women to the forefront of attention.  Not a light read, but a great one.
1559409002|5.0|Carnival of Souls is very subterranean, going underneath our merely verbal senses. The plot is of little importance, but atmosphere is everything. The eerie music, strange people and oddly shot black and white scenes grab at our fears of loneliness and death. You know (but more importantly, feel) that Mary is inexorably doomed. The effect is powerful because it succeeds in making Mary a proxy for ourselves. The effects are subtle, not depending on \\"special effects\\" in the usual sense. Rather, they rely on creative use of camera composition, restrained acting (where less is more), and hauntingly strange music.
B000ZK4466|5.0|I was always sort of into what The Mars Volta was doing, as they're definitely the stronger of the bands created by the split-up of At the Drive-In (the other being Sparta)... but never felt they reached the same level they had previously.  This album changed my mind.<br /><br />This album is an amazing accomplishment - whether you buy the slightly hokey story they're serving up with it or not - it is a haunting and intoxicating ride.  I can't get the songs out of my head... I wake up and turn the album back on.  I can't get enough of it - and haven't been able to hear it loud enough yet.<br /><br />Can't wait to catch them the next time they tour in the states - hope it is soon.  The mastery of writing and performance captured in these tracks blows my mind.<br /><br />I know it's only January, but there is no question in my mind - this will be one of the best albums of the year.

0743298039|5.0|I wish I could give this the ten stars it deserves since it is SUPURB!     Diane Setterfield established herself as a dynamic, captivating, master storyteller in what I can't believe is only her first novel. It seems more likely a work by a writer at the end of her career, as opposed to one at the beginning.     As a reader, you are pulled in from page one when a mysterious letter appears from a world-renown writer who finally wants to \\"tell the truth\\" about her life to the one person who may be able to understand.  Part fable, part ghost-story (not scary), part mystery, part fantasy, part family saga, this book has it all and truly delivers.     I could not put this book down (if it was possible to read and walk at the same time, I probably would have!), and read it in just two days. However, I was sorry I didnt read it more slowly so I could savor it, although it is one of those stories that will stay with me forever.     Unique, brilliant, captivating, heart-warming, and extraordinary....I can't recommend this book highly enough- it is a MUST READ! This book is ideal for book clubs, as there is so much you'll want to discuss and talk about. I hope Ms. Setterfield continues to write because her gift is truly unparalleled...I'm already a huge fan!
B00006G8HX|5.0|After the death of Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and his corpse is sent to Genesis where his coffin is to remain. Kirk (William Shatner) feels depressed about the lost of his best friend and the crew has repaired the enterprise after the battle with Khan. McCoy (DeForrest Kelly) has been acting strange lately as he channels both Spock's behavior and voice. Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) pays a visit as he knows that McCoy has Spock's soul and learns that Spock is alive on planet Genesis as they must go on that planet to find him. Kirk with his crew (James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols) and his son Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) hop aboard the enterprise so they can find Spock on Genesis, but the Klingons with a leader named Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) have learned the secrets of Genesis as they want to steal it.<br /><br />Energetic and smart third installment of the popular cinematic Sci-fi franchise delivers some goods. Leonard Nimoy himself directed this motion picture as this is part a loose three part trilogy that started with part 2 and ended with part 4, sure it doesn't have the awe or greatness of \\"Wraith of Khan\\" but this is still an enjoyable and entertaining installment with good special effects and good acting. The storyline itself is complicated but good, this movie does have the rebirth of Spock after his demise in \\"Wraith of Khan\\" and it's still worth watching for fans.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent picture and sound with great extras like an audio commentary from Leonard Nimoy, Harve Bennett, Charles Correll and Robin Curtis. A tex commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda co-authors of The Star Trek Enchylopedia, trailer, a teaser to \\"Nemesis\\", Storyboards, photo gallery, Interviews and featurettes epsecially on how to speak Klingon.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|The first time I saw this film I really struggled to follow all the characters. So, I watched it a second time. The beginning seems dark, and poor Anne is depicted as so meek and lonely with her sisters such jerks. Of course, her sisters were jerks. I really did not like the casting of Frederick Wentworth at all. He seemed too old and too weathered to play any sort of romantic lead. I just could not get into the romance between Anne and Frederick.  So, I read the book because a friend told me it was such a wonderful story. I enjoyed the book, so decided to watch this film again. But, alas, it still seems too gloomy and not very romantic at all. I am surprised that so many enjoyed this version.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This movie wasn't what I expected it to be like BUT it was very good. Gives different viewpoints on how the actions of one person can affect many many lives. Brad Pitt was in it so that is always a great thing to me in any movie. I don't know if you need to own a copy but it is worth it to watch. I only watch movies once so I would have been better off renting it.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Extraordinary humor, wide-ranging samples of love, romance, sex.  Not just a chick flick! Nine stories interwoven, including a prospective relationship between a Portuguese gal who doesn't speak English and an Englishman who doesn't speak Portuguese.  Very well done, touching on all of life and love, from the very youthful to death.  Should have won an Academy Award.  Warning: do not watch this film with children under age 18, nor with your mother-in-law.
0877284520|5.0|This is a deck about which I deliberated years before acquiring. I was greatly attracted to the artwork, but the stigma surrounding it held me back. I had heard that they were accurate to a fault, and then in other reviews they were touted as being unreadable. I finally purchased the deck to see for myself, and I am very happy that I did. Created by Aleister Crowley and illustrated by Lady Frieda Harris, this work of art took five years to complete, and remains one of the most enigmatic decks ever created. There is none of the RWS symbolism, and as such, I would hesitate to recommend it to a beginner unless they were completely drawn to it. This is a very black/white deck; quite simply put, it either speaks to you or it does not. I am fascinated by the visualizations, and each time I see them, I see something different, another facet to be read and interpreted.        Some of the card names have been changed: Justice appears here as Adjustment VIII, and Strength renamed Lust XI. Art XIV is the renamed Temperance card.    The Pip (or Minor Arcana) Suits are named Wands, Cups, Discs and Swords. The Court cards are a little different: they are named as The Knight, The Queen, The Prince and The Princess of their respective suits. The majority of the Pip cards have a keyword listed on them. I use this deck regularly in my readings, and look forward to many years of discovering the nuances of each card.    The biggest problem I have with my Thoth deck is the size of the cards. They are larger than average (the better to admire the artwork, my dears), and difficult for me to shuffle comfortably. However, there is another version with smaller, more manageable cards, and I find myself using this one more than the other.  My recommendation is this: don't listen to the hype. Listen to your little voice, and it will tell you if this is a deck that you will be able to personally connect with.
B000QEIORG|5.0|The Foo Fighters' second album, The Colour & the Shape, brings to mind several immediate reactions.  First and foremost, you realize you're listening to one of the best rock albums of the 90s.  Few bands can move from the brain-melting overdrive of \\"Wind Up,\\" to the happy-go-lucky frivolity of \\"See You,\\" to the slow-burning build-up of \\"February Stars,\\" and do it convincingly.  There's something for everyone on this album, which would normally prove to be a handicap for a less capable group.  Many look to this album as the last gasp of grunge, though this not a convincing argument upon listening.  It lacks the self-loathing and screw-you song composition, and instead embraces a sound that's more ready for arenas.  This isn't Motley Crue, though.  With this album, Dave Grohl and his bandmates walk the extremely narrow line between easily approachable and musically dense.  It might make you nostalgic for the days when the radio played material that was at once artistically relevant as well as immediately appreciable by casual listeners (or, you might just sit back and let the 16th notes that Grohl plays on his high-hat in \\"Everlong\\"-- while keeping the beat-- blow your mind).    Sadly, looking back a decade later, another reaction might be that this was the pinnacle of the band's achievement.  With the singles that pretty much everyone knows by heart by now-- \\"Monkey Wrench,\\" \\"My Hero,\\" \\"Everlong\\"-- this album launched the Foo Fighters, and they haven't really revisited this disc's mixture of avant-cool and unpredictability since.  Situated today as godfathers of modern rock, perhaps they feel they've already been here and they've already done this.  It's a shame, because you'll be hard-pressed to find an album that is this catchy but still retains its soul.    If you haven't already heard The Colour & the Shape, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  And try not to wear a hole in it.
B000VI70WM|5.0|when i first bought this album it didnt leave my car stereo for a month. i really cant get enough of it. it's funky-electro and flat out - feel good music. LeBon's voice is amazing and the song 'falling down' couldnt have come @ a better time.
0452289963|1.0|Just another lemming reaction to an Oprah selection.

If you want to improve your spiritual life try the one book that has always been the answer, THE BIBLE!!
0198534469|5.0|Like an a Jack Nickelson impersonator, the impersonator can sometimes outdo, maybe even overdo, Jack.    Tristan Needham is impersonating Richard Feynman here.  In fact, he does Feynman better than Feynman!  Feyman was known for creating graphical represenations from various branches of calculus in a time when such diagrams had become taboo even in physics!  Blame it on the pompous retards, once again they had nearly ruined something for everyone else by trying to imposing arbitrary and ultimately false order upon various physical situations. Their objective this time? It was visualization.    Before reading this book, I would definitely have my head firmly grounded in the fundamentals of applied math.  I recommend 4 months or so of serious self-study in [[ASIN:0195105192 What Is Mathematics?

B000C3H4M2|3.0|This is one of the best albums of the 1970's, an absolutely brilliant combination of new wave and psychedelia that still sounds startlingly original today.  Most critically-acclaimed indie bands of the past 20 years sound drab and ordinary compared to what Talking Heads were doing in their prime.      Also, the remastering is excellent.  I've heard few CD's that sound as good as this.    So why'd I give it only three stars?    The trouble is the dual-layered discs that Rhino decided to use.  I've tried to play the CD side on three different CD players, including a brand new Onkyo and a brand new Sony.  Both had trouble reading the disc and skipped on the last track.  All the other Talking Head dual-discs had the same problem.    There is good news: in the UK, Rhino released all the Talking Heads records as two disc CD and DVD sets.  I'd strongly recommend going to amazon.co.uk and getting those versions instead.
0143038419|4.0|I saw Elizabeth Gilbert on TV talking about her book and she came across as a likeable person and her story sounded interesting. In the beginning of the book I was very surprised how high strung and self-centered she appeared. She seemed like a big drama queen, also trying too hard to be funny. But I thought she toned down a lot as her journey and the book moved on. I don't believe in the highly exceptional spiritual experiences she claims to have had, which is besides the point. I did like the book and she has a good way of expressing herself. Also I thought she had some interesting background information regarding her host countries.
B0010AN7Z4|1.0|Shame on you MGM. If directer Billy Wilder wanted this film in color, HE WOULD HAVE SHOT IT IN COLOR. Who are you to change his vision ? Remember, one of the many awards this film won was for Best Photography, BEST BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY. And Best Art Direction, BLACK AND WHITE ART DIRECTION ! You would do best to buy the black and white print. STAY AWAY FROM \\"COLORIZED\\" prints. This is an insult to one of Hollywood's greatest directors. What next, a color print of \\"Some Like It Hot, or \\"Sunset Blvd\\". SHAME ON YOU MGM!!!!!!!!
B000056OBA|5.0|By and large there are two images of Beethoven that stand rather uncomfortably side by side in the mind. The first, the one predominant before 1945 is that of the brooding romantic genius tormented by the twin demons of unrequited love and deafness, whose soul, like Faust, was half in pawn to the Devil, and the more modern one of the great composer of the enlightenment, a man of immense intellectual talent and innovative musical skill, a preacher of the rights of man, political freedom and humanistic optimism. The conductor Herbert von Karajan stands at the exact bridging point of these two powerful traditions. Growing up in the late twenties and thirties his idol was the great German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. Karajan both admired and feared Furtwängler, who was the musician par excellence whose interpretations appealed most to Hitler's National Socialists.  His attitude towards him remained profoundly ambiguous throughout his life.   I have several recordings of the 9th symphony, but felt I could not reasonably omit that of Karajan, especially the 1963 recording. Of all the recordings of the 9th symphony I have heard his is the most fascinating. To describe it as transitional (which in musical terms is usually a term of abuse) would be misleading and unhelpful. This is a unique and highly personal reading that cannot be dismissed by anyone. The first movement is pure Furtwängler. From the brooding opening chords through to the tragic finale, this is the romantic Beethoven par excellence. Karajan is nevertheless sufficiently aware of where he is going, however, to command an exact and precise tone from the Berlin Philharmonic, which is light years away from romantic impressionism. The second movement is one of the most remarkable in the history of performance. None before and few since have dared attack this scherzo with such lightening speed and diabolic energy. This is frightening stuff - panzers rolling across Poland. Whether or not he should have slowedthe tempo a little more for the second subject to bring out the contrast, will remain a subject for endless debate.    The most difficult movement in this symphony to bring off is the slow third. In poor hands it can become a miserable dirge or sleep inducing lullaby. Moreover, unlike the corresponding movement in the Eroica, it cannot be played in any sense heroically, as the triumph of the human spirit over death or adversity or some such. There is a sense of farewell about this movement as well as happy recollections of things past and yet it is also difficult to listen to it without the sense of prelude before the transformations of the famous final movement. On the whole it's best here to let the orchestra get you out of it with some lovely playing and that is what Karajan, relaxing for once his notorious iron hand, exactly does.   If there was a piece of music made for the hand of Karajan it is the famous finale of this the most famous of all pieces of classical music. The opening is back to the first movement and Furtwängler. These are the grim tones that Beethoven soon seeks to banish with the celebrated \\"Ode to Joy\\". But he is anxious not to push us too quickly into the new arena and after the orchestral introduction, there is a long section of \\"recitative\\" in which Beethoven warms us up. He does well to, as Schiller's Ode \\"Let me embrace you, oh ye thousands\\" is not easy stuff to digest and requires a considerable leap of faith. It has become the \\"National Anthem\\" of the European Union, however, something that barely existed in Karajan's day, so it deserves paying attention to.   Suddenly after this introduction Karajan abandons Furtwängler and it is pure Toscanini - extremely dramatic, operatic contrasts, VERY fast tempi... it is hard to keep up. Karajan is pushing both his orchestra and chorus to their absolute limits. The sound is thick and heavy still and at that this pace.... The iron hand is needed and it is there.   This is an absolutely rivetingperformance of a very great work and a watershed in interpretation. Whether one sees it as the last in great line of \\"romantic interpretations\\" or the first of the modern is irrelevant. If I could keep one CD in my collection it would be this.
B000J6H1SE|3.0|A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is an engaging tale focusing on family dynamics. Anyone who has ever encountered sibling rivalry (read: anyone with a sibling) will relate to the interations between Vera and Nadia, the book's protagonist. The sister's father, Nikolai, is an 84 year old widow who has decided that the cure for his lonliness is to marry a big busted, bleached blond, Ukrainian with a penchant for furs, jewels, peach nail polish and satin underwear named Valentina so that she can immigrate to the UK. Hilarity ensues as the sisters struggle to move past their strained relationship in order to rescue their father, and his bank account, from the gold-digging Valentina. This book will tug at your heartstrings and make you laugh out loud at the same time.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Jane Austen is timeless, as is proven by her popularity as much today as it was in almost 200 years ago!  Her choice of subject matter of human nature will always appeal to people.  This movie is an artist's perspective of one of the greatest novels ever written.  The mood, the use of a muted color pallet and musical score create a visual image of beauty, which portrays the novels theme perfectly.  I am convinced that if Jane Austen were alive today, that film would have been her chosen form of artistic expression and this movie one of her creations.  Kiera Knightley lends an almost luminous quality to Elizabeth Bennet, with a slight edge of mischievousness.  In my opinion the best P&P ever!

B000E1MXSW|5.0|Regardless of your individual religious convictions (or the lack thereof), this film deserves to be seen for its fantastic performances and the scrupulous care with which the original material was transferred to the screen.  \\"The Nun's Story\\" is based on the book of the same name by Katherine Hulme, who wrote it as fiction; however, the book was a memoir of the real-life experiences of Hulme's friend and companion.<br /><br />The cast list alone should tell you something: Dame Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft, Dean Jagger, Beatrice Straight, Colleen Dewhurst, Mildred Dunnock, Peter Finch, Niall McGinnis (a VERY long way from \\"Curse of the Demon\\" and \\"Anna Karenina\\").  Directed by Fred Zinneman (\\"High Noon\\"), the film also boasts a powerful score by Franz Waxman and gorgeous cinematography - it was filmed in Cinemascope, which had recently superceded Technicolor as the color transference system of choice.<br /><br />\\"The Nun's Story\\" recounts Gabrielle Van der Mal's seventeen years in a strict Belgian order of nuns between the two world wars.  Gaby (Audrey Hepburn) is the daughter of a renowned Belgian pulmonary surgeon (Dean Jagger) and has inherited his passion for medicine - she is already skilled in basic nursing and the use of a microscope.  The Van der Mal family is devout, but her distinguished scientist father is nevertheless dismayed when his highly intelligent daughter announces her intention of joining an order of nursing nuns whose members also serve out in the Belgian Congo.  Gaby is planning, under the convent's aegis, to train at the School for Tropical Medicine and obtain a certificate that will allow her to go out to the Congo as a nurse.<br /><br />It must be remembered that in 1925, ordinary women were barred from becoming doctors, certainly from entering a field as challenging as tropical medicine, and that nuns would be a rare exception to this restriction. Thus, the film hints from the beginning that Gaby's motives for entering the religious life gobeyond mere spiritual dedication.  Gaby is sincere in her religious ardor, but it is only one reason that she selects this life.<br /><br />From the outset, the very gifts that make Gaby a likely asset to her order's nursing staff, her intelligence and decisive temperament, present problems in her training as a nun.  Her order's Rule is \\"Poverty, Chastity, Obedience.\\"  As her father says the day he delivers her to the convent, \\"Gaby, I can see you poor, I can see you chaste; but for the life of me, I cannot see you obedient.\\" And, indeed, the training in obedient, unthinking detachment that makes responding to a prayer bell a higher priority than completing the administering of medicine to a patient, all chafe at Gaby's essential nature.  She is influenced and encouraged in this struggle by the charismatic Superior General of the order, played with a wonderful combination of majesty and compassion by the great Dame Edith Evans.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite some bumps in the road, Gaby passes successfully through her year as a postulant and takes her initial vows, where she is given the name Sister Luke.  As Sister Luke she enters the School of Tropical Medicine, receives her coveted certificate, and sets out on the life she has chosen for herself, although it will require three years of further testing by her superiors, who do not quite trust that she has subdued her will and is sufficiently \\"in the mold\\", before she is sent out to the Congo.  During the three-year testing period, Sister Luke passes through two major crises that force her to reexamine her fitness for the religious life, but at last she takes her final vows, and is told to prepare herself to go out to the Congo, where she will join a small group of nursing sisters attached to two hospitals, one for white Europeans and one for the Congo natives.<br /><br />The film then covers the next decade of Sister Luke's life in the Congo, and her struggles to combine her commitment to becoming a fine nurse AND a fine nun, one who personifies her Order's Rule.  However, an appropriate balance between the two becomes more elusive, rather than closer, as the years progress.  Sister Luke's struggle is not helped by the entry onto the scene of Dr. Fortunati (Peter Finch), a difficult but gifted surgeon that Sister Luke must work with.  He brings a sexual charge into the atmosphere and is, moreover, an atheist.  He discerns immediately that Sister Luke, whose skills he considers to be far above those of other nursing sisters he has worked with, is NOT \\"in the mold\\".  When Sister Luke contracts tuberculosis, Dr. Fortunati tells her plainly that he believes her health is reflecting her emotional conflict, but Sister Luke refuses to accept his diagnosis.<br /><br />By the time this confrontation occurs, World War II is shaping ominously on the horizon - years have gone by, and suddenly the Mother House in Belgium recalls Sister Luke, ostensibly to accompany a difficult patient home to Europe.  Sister Luke goes very reluctantly, by now hopelessly in love with the African landscape, and she plans to return.  But within a short time of her return, WWII finally erupts, Germany invades Holland and then Belgium, and Sister Luke's return to the Congo is cut off.<br /><br />It is now nearly 17 years since she entered the convent, and Sister Luke is horrified to find that, after all this time, she is as unable as ever to subdue her worldy feelings to the spiritual direction of the Order. She is consumed with an un-Christian hatred of the enemy (who also occupied Belgium during World War I) that is completely at variance with her spiritual training.  Her hatred is fanned into a blazing bonfire when she learns that her father has been killed by German strafing as he stopped to help the wounded along a road on which thousands were fleeing to the countryside.<br /><br />This information brings Sister Luke to a crossroads that, in reality, she has been approaching since she first entered theconvent.  The crisis she passes through as she considers whether to persevere or break her vows dwarfs her previous struggles, and her decision gives the film its stunning ending.<br /><br />Whether or not you yourself accept the tenets of Christianity or any other religion is not important - the film is a work of art that examines a unique life and a set of experiences that few in today's fast-paced modern world can imagine.  The point is not Gaby's Christianity - the point is one woman's struggle to reconcile two seemingly opposing facets of her character, both of which she sincerely honors, and the inevitable confrontation that forces her to give one up.<br /><br />Today, there are few Orders left that reflect the severe character of the one that Gaby enters so young.  The film offers a fascinating portrait of life inside such an Order and is exquisitely filmed.  It manages to convey the austere beauty of life inside the Mother House, but does not spare the hypocrisies, petty jealousies, and mistakes that flourish within it.  The more colorful life of the nursing nuns in the Congo is also gorgeous. The performances are magnificent, and it is a tribute to Hepburn that her youthful beauty does not undermine her portrayal of Sister Luke.<br /><br />This is a fantastic film and not to be missed.

BOTH are English audio tracked, ONLY PIES DESCALZOS has subtitles EN ESPANOL.  No subtitles on the Around the World OR the concert section.     Additionally, one video clip of LAS DE LA INTUICION, and \\"bonus\\" live concert clips of OBTENER UN SI and LA PARED.  LA PARED seemed to be almost identical to the performance in the concert, but it's not.  LIVE CD disc captures the DVD performance for play when you don't want to watch!    In my opinion, better than the LIVE AND OFF THE RECORD concert.  No \\"preachy\\" video interludes in the concert.  Nothing but pure Shakira.  No need for pesky background dancers and laser light shows.  Just one talented woman performing her music.  A rare commodity in these days of microsecond long attention spans.      I found the audio flawless.  If there's any \\"dubbing\\", I didn't notice it.  An entertaining 90 minute concert romp that you'll enjoy over and over again!  FIVE STARS!
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Although the older version staring Amanda Root is still my ultimate favorite, this version is a more modern, fresher approach.  It moves a bit fast in some parts, as it is difficult to fit the entire novel into about an hour & half.  If you want to experience Jane Austen with a different point of view then this movie is great!

0143038419|1.0|This is a book by a self-absorbed, wealthy, spoiled Manhattanite. Her life seems to consist of basically whining, self-analyzing, and the pursuit of her personal happiness. Her world is All About Wonderful, Deserving Me.    If that sounds interesting to you, read away.     All I can say is YAWN. (With a fair amount of GAG mixed in.)
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This documentary defies description. You just have to see it. The shots are amazing and compelling. It is easy to see that the crew really put their souls into this production and as the viewer you reap the benefits of their effort. An amazing series which I recommend to all of my friends and show off as much as possible!
B000YABV90|5.0|Saw this 3 times.  Great picture, I think the critics are nuts!  They prefer a horrible film like \\"Cloverfield\\".  Just loved August Rush, am going again this weekend.  Hope it wins the MUSIC Academy Award for best song!
0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" takes ideas from Tolle's previous book \\"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment\\" and it moves the discussion from expansion of personal consciousness to how an expanded consciousness can transform our planet.    Rarely do we find spiritual books that offer a clear perspective for both personal transformation of the self and global transformation of the earth that is offered by Tolle in this book.    The title aptly sums up the message: \\"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose.\\" Our purpose requires a transcendence of our ego for both personal happiness and to end the violent conflicts on earth.    The book offers real hope and Oprah has made a bold move to move away from recommending classics to a contemporary spiritual book. Others books you have to read: \\"[[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0001Q5UCQ Living in the Light: A Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0978107004 Nexus: A Neo Novel]]\\"
0393330435|3.0|The early '80s were heady times for computer geeks. Steve Wozniak gives us a glimpse in to the early days of the personal computer revolution, life in silicon valley, and the beginnings of Apple Computer.    In this heavily first person account, the reader can be easily overwhelmed by his first person references. Unfortunately, Woz's rather egocentric views detract from the fascinating story of Apple's early days. The book is written at a fairly low reading level, probably around 6 or 7th grade. Until the reader is fairly deep into the book, this choice is inexplicable. As the story evolves, Woz lets on that he is most moved by his experience working with elementary students and feels a particular affinity to those who are out of the mainstream. He is not explicit, however, it seems his desire is to have his autobiography be an inspiration to those students.    Even with its literary short falls, I found iWoz to be an enjoyable, interesting, and quick read.
0375424474|4.0|Neil Shubin's book is a great general introduction to understanding Darwinian modification by decent.  He bounces around from paleontology, to anatomy, to genetics as he has done in his own life. This gives the book a lightness and readability.  It is almost as if the book were designed to engage college students in a general course on the history of the body.  Its generality is also its limitation.  I read an excerHugh Kennedypt of the book in the Univ. of Chicago alumni magazine touching on design flaws in humans and wanted more of that from reading the book. The haphazardness of evolution fascinates me. So I was disappointed I found no more on the subject than the excerpts.  Nonetheless the book was both entertaining and educational.  It would have been nice to learn more about the oddities that evolution produces which are hard to explain by DNA.<br />Charlie Fisher author of [[ASIN:1600700322 Dismantling Discontent: Buddha's Way Through Darwin's World]]
B00097A5I6|3.0|I give this album 3.5 stars. It's a good album but definitely not their best. The album starts off great with a good rockin' and sing-along song, \\"Turn Up the Sun\\" But the following song \\"Mucky Fingers\\" is just plain...\\"plain\\". The last third of the album is quite good and darn right mesmerizing at times. \\"Keep The Dream Alive\\" hits one out of the park in the 7th inning stretch. It has a super catchy chorus with lyrics to back it up. Noisy but in a good way; a-la songs from the album Be Here Now.<br /><br />As stated before there are some low points and a few fillers on this album but don't let this distract you from the finer points and subtlety that makes this album better than most other rock bands have put out in the last 5-7 years.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|After about the 15th comparison to AC/DC, I decided I had to check out this band so I browsed their Myspace page and listened to some tracks.  I was blown away by the energy.  I picked it up on release day and flipped it into the CD player as soon as I climbed into my truck.  Within minutes I had the volume blasting, rattling the windows, and could see myself in the bar raising a pint to these guys on stage.  INCREDIBLE!    As incredible as the album is,  there's nothing special here....no great guitar riffs, no exotic vocals.  Just a kick a** band that likes its rock and roll loud and without compromise.  Whereas AC/DC is a little more complex in their song structure (and Angus is way beyond this band in the lead guitar category), these guys settle for the simple in your face approach.  The vocals are quite AC/DCish, and remind me a bit of the naughtiness of Bon Scott.  The vocalist has a decent sound, nothing like Scott's devilish purr or Brian Johnson's growl, but his sound fits the songs well.      There will be no essays about the complexity of the songs, the in depth meaning of the lyrics....but there will be some good times across the USA in small venues as these guys tear a path across the States.  Mates, welcome to the USA, and if you don't come to Albuquerque I'll completely rescind this glowing review and send you all straight to hell :-)
0312360266|5.0|This book is about Zoey Redbird who's marked as a vampire and has to basically go to the school to learn about being a vamp. It deals with who she learns who will stick by her; and dealing with hate on both sides (from humans and vampires).<br /><br />There is some cheesiness in this book, but it's tolerable. As usual there are a few cliche's and some things that you can just see coming.<br /><br />Now, there's been a few reviews about this book being anti-christian. I don't see the Casts bashing that religion one bit. They may have hints that it is christians that they're talking about. But Pc Cast is known for her romance paranormal books to be goddess and magic centered. She's not saying that every christian is like that. She maybe had it in there for a reason for Zoey to leave the house.. I mean, would she have left so freely if she actually enjoyed the house?<br /><br />And I didn't see Zoey as selfish one bit. First she was just about any heroine who was just trying to fit into the circumstances given to her. Then, she did what any decent person did; and started a change. I recommend this book to (a person of any religion as long as you have an open mind). Yes, there's a ceremony where they paint a five pointed star (a pentagram). It's not satanic, in fact, a pentagram was used by chistians and mathematicians in greece. Wine is shared... it wasn't done to make fun of christian sermons... there is wicca roots in it.<br /><br />I tore right through this book and can't read the other books. The flow of the book is excellent, somewhat original story. The technique is a tad bit different, probably due to Kristin Cast writing. But there is still alot of commonality with PC Cast's books.

B000AP04NI|4.0|Arguably the most historically important musical in Broadway history (\\"Show Boat\\" would be its only rival), \\"Oklahoma\\" inarguably has the most arresting if not dazzling opening.  We're placed smack dab in the middle of the ripe corn fields of Oklahoma and swept into the freshest, most colorful and vibrant summer morning ever captured on film--accompanied by the inviting \\"O\\" vowel that first lures us with \\"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning\\" and will eventually seal the deal with \\"OOOOOOklahoma!\\"  And before we've recovered from this bracing beginning, we're as captivated as Shirley Jones is by Gordon McCrae's musical-visual picture of a \\"Surrey With the Fringe on Top.\\"  No film let alone musical has a more spectacular beginning, and though it's impossible to sustain this level of exhilaration (for one thing, Rodgers and Hammerstein's second acts always tend to be anticlimactic), the total experience is still the most \\"cinematic\\" of all the R&H screen adaptations (\\"Sound of Music\\" is its closest competitor cinematically, though not even close musically).<br /><br />The producers of this edition do a disservice to the film by the inclusion of the Todd-A-O disc which, in its unrestored state, would best be represented by a footnote in the accompanying notes.  Moreover, the problem of sizing a 4:3 letterbox film to a 16:9 screen will best be dealt with when a hi-def version is available.  Until then, best hang on to your old copy.
0452289963|2.0|What I find simultaneously most fascinating and infuriating about Tolle is his failure to grasp the fundamental contradiction of his book, as well as the New Age movement as a whole: that you cannot discount the role that the mind itself plays in life, even when (maybe especially when) you're claiming to have found a new and exalted level of consciousness or supposed inner meaning. There is no escape from the conscious and especially the subconscious mind; it is always active, and in fact may be heavily influencing Tolle's own sense of his inner being, even when he himself doesn't think so! Also, Tolle's explication of his concept of The Now is absurdly simplistic and out of sync with the realities of modern geopolitical living. Consider that he once replied thusly to an interviewer's question about how he (Tolle) would've handled 9/11 and the response to same: \\"I don't know what I would do, because I can only know what is right in an actual situation which demands a response. It's very hard when you look at hypotheticals.\\" Ah yes, but the whole concept of preparedness and contingency planning is based on hypotheticals and the ability to step out of Tolle's beloved \\"Now\\" so that one can gain the benefit of experiential learning (i.e. the past) and planning for the worst (i.e. the future). So what is Tolle going to do when an emergency blindsides him and he suddenly realizes that--in his perpetual state of Now-ness--he didn't plan for it? It's absurd. This book is manna for the masses--telling people what they want to hear--and as one who has intensively studied the New Age movement, I urge you to pass on it. [...]
B0011ZWAAQ|5.0|Another fantastic album from the DropKicks you can just put on and listen the whole way through. No complaints here; great album great mix, and some more instant sing-along classics to shout out at there awesome shows!
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I personally loved the quasi-reggae sounds of the English Beat, the Talking Heads, and the Police etc. during the early to mid-80's and this is a nice update to those sounds with a healthy dose of African rhythm and guitar phrasing as well.  The songs have a dash of Elvis Costello and I love the lead singer's voice.  These guys just sound like a band having a lot of fun, and I have to say it is infectious to listen to stuff like this.  I found myself grooving along from song 1, so I have to say, even though there's a lot of hype surrounding this band, it sure seems warranted.  Good stuff!

B000GPIPSS|2.0|The 75th anniversary edition of this horror classic really disappointed me. While it's true that the picture is crisp and sharper than earlier editions its too bright and the sound is disgraceful the famous monsters edition had much better audio I think universal needs to go back to the drawing board on this one If you have a previous edition dont waste your money on this one!
B000000WFU|5.0|I remember listening to Pure Moods Vol.1 as a kid and the track Adiemus was forever on repeat.  Then, in highschool I discovered that there was an entire collection of this beautiful music!  It's absolutely stunning.    It's strange that some people find this album repetitive or uninspired.  Really weird.  Because whenever I play it, I have to stop whatever I'm doing and just listen.  Next thing I know, the entire album is over and I feel like I just stepped out of a dream.  It's so enchanting it makes my heart skip a beat.    This all probably sounds like a bunch of hippie-hoohah, but I really, really, REALLY love this album.  The orchestrations, the vocals, the melody, the flow, everything.  It's the best out of the entire Adiemus Project.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Neil Burger directed \\"Interview with the Assassin\\" and recently completed \\"The Return\\" with Rachel McAdams & Michael Pena about a soldier returning home from Iraq.  This film is an adaptation of a story by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steven Millhauser.  The excellent cinematography of Dick Pope was nominated for an Oscar, a similar award which he won from the San Diego Film Critics.  Philip Glass' score was recognized with an award by the New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed the acting in the film.  Edward Norton was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for \\"Primal Fear\\" in 1996 and as Best Actor in 1998 for \\"American History X.\\"  His film \\"The Painted Veil\\" was touching and excellent.  As Eisenheim, Norton's performance is highly controlled, internal.  We are unable to tell if anything is reaching him, but see his desire for Sophie.  In the DVD extras, it took me a moment to recognize him without his beard.  Jessica Biel has been in two very interesting film projects, [[ASIN:B000EU1Q7M London]] and [[ASIN:0792842189 Ulee's Gold]].  In the DVD extras, she says that Sophie von Teschen was a part she actively sought & was delighted to play.  Within the same week, I had purchased and watched the DVD [[ASIN:B000VNMMQG Amazing Grace]].  Rufus Sewell plays the slave reformer Clarkson with flowing long hair and totes a bag full of manacles for most of the film.  When I looked at the box for this film, I was so surprised to see the same actor.  As Crown Prince Leopold, Sewell delivers a tightly knit performance, threatening to be lethal to any around him.  The moment when he strikes Sophie almost made my blood chill.  Sophie looks at him with cold eyes and merely says, \\"Goodbye.\\"  It's an excellent moment.  Paul Giamatti won a Best Actor award from the Toronto Film Critics for his breakout role in [[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways (Widescreen Edition)]].  He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for \\"Cinderella Man\\" in 2005, and won a similar award that year from Screen Actors Guild.  As Chief Inspector Uhl, he will not let go of this case & is committed to following the truth, no matter where it leads.  I found the story of this film to be riveting.  It spiraled into the unknown at every turn for me.  From the almost supernatural illusions of the \\"ghosts\\" to the orange tree that mysteriously grows, I found each new performance of Eisenheim to be an adventure.  Neil Burger kept the pace moving swiftly.  The romantic childhood relationship that seems to bloom into destined lovers captured my imagination.  I enjoyed this film immensely in the theatre and have looked for an affordable used copy for awhile.  I found it!  Enjoy!from Screen Actors Guild.

B0012QTT6M|5.0|Bryan Cranston's Huge Talent Does It Again With Another GREAT Hit!<br /><br />It seems like Brian's talent is limitless as he goes from playing \\"Hal\\" the goofy, fumbling father on \\"Malcolm in the middle\\" to his waaaaaaay out of character role in this new hit dark, comedy, gripping, action-packed drama.  It's funny, it's dark, it's gripping, it's full of action and everything you want a show to be to keep you glued to your seat and counting the days until the next episode.  This is a great show.  Don't miss it.
B000VDDDY6|2.0|This set was at the top of my list of titles to buy when buying an HD DVD player and I was somewhat disappointed. The level of detail in the original camera negative after the restoration was astounding, making my old DVDs (I bought the first 40 DVDs released about 9 years ago) look not that good. But. And there is a but here. The digital upgrade that was done to all the episodes were bad, really bad. All shots of the Enterprise in space, either orbiting a planet or treking through space, looked like bad CGI. The ship had no substance and didn't look real at all. In the documentary on disc 10 they said that did it in the spirit of what it would have looked like if it was done today. But it wasn't made today, it was made in the 60's, the greatest decade in American Television. It had groundbreaking special effects and to \\"upgrade\\" the effects using the technology today is like discarding everything that those amazing people at Paramount's effects department did. The fact that it looks the way it does originally is what I, and I expect many other Trek fans too, love about the show. It's a timecapsule to the what things were done back then and the groundbreaking ideas that Gene Roddenberry had that would make really great television. The next thing I see is people saying that Ray Harryhausen's or Willis O'Brien's work on \\"Jason and Argonauts\\" and \\"King Kong\\", respectively, now isn't good enough anymore and redo those magnificent effects too. I look at the effects in Star Trek in the same league as the work of those magnificent people. I would advise people to just skip this set and buy the DVD set with the original effects and music intact.   Oh, yes, the music. They even redone the music in the entire season, discarding the really great recordings that Alexander Courage (and his colleagues) did on the show. They also made the mistake of having Kirk saying his famous \\"Space. The Final Frontier\\" speech in the second pilot (the first was \\"The Cage\\" made into the two part\\"The Menagerie\\") \\"Where no man has gone before\\".     Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this set and cherish the DVD set or the 40 DVDs earlier released.
B000AM6OK8|5.0|This is the yardstick everyone measures late-period Stones against. Seriously, whenever the Stones put something out, if it's good it's \\"their best since Some Girls\\". And I'll tell you why, too: the last truly fantastic record the Stones ever put out. \\"Truly fantastic\\" differs from \\"Good\\", of course - I don't exactly fall into the camp that believes the Stones magically lost their Midas touch after this came out. But there's not much doubt in my mind that they've been rather inconsistent since the '80s, and this was their last grasp at true excellence, rather than simply goodness. It's not perfect, though. I'm no fan of the discofied \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\\" - I'll take the Temptations original over it any day, and \\"Lies\\" is a lazily written punk song that's little more than a ton of anger. But in other places they play up the punk and disco influences quite well. The group's attitude in the '60s was definitely punkish, inspiring groups such as the Stooges and New York Dolls, so it makes sense they try a style that they helped pioneer. Other punk songs, \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\", with VU-esque lyrics about homosexuality and decadence; the hilarious, hypersexual \\"Shattered\\", and the satiric triple-guitar assault \\"Respectable\\", come off much better. And the disco track \\"Miss You\\" is some of the best disco I've ever heard, with a fantastic bass line, even better sax solo, and all kinds of efficient hooks. A couple songs that are neither punk nor disco work just well, too: the anachronistic slightly boogie of \\"Before They Make Me Run\\", Keith's critical look at his drug problems; the funky, so exaggeratingly sexist it's gotta be ironic title song; the lush ballad \\"Beast of Burden\\", proving Mick's strength as a vocalist; and the hilarious televangelist send-up \\"Far Away Eyes\\", a straight-up country song. Stereotypical as it is to say this, Some Girls is definitely one of their best albums. Oh, and I don't buy all the \\"big-time comeback\\" stuff about this release - I really enjoy the group's mid-'70s discs, Goats Head Soup, It's Only Rock `n' Roll, and Black and Blue. Those three are just screaming for reevaluation. But that's another story. By the way, it's worth noting that the album versions of \\"Miss You\\" and \\"Beast of Burden\\" are, as you'd expect, much better than the single edits.is release - I really enjoy the group's mid-'70s discs, Goats Head Soup, It's Only Rock `n' Roll, and Black and Blue.

B00001OH7N|4.0|Yeah, this is the one where Bowie's wearing a dress on the cover. It's also the point where Bowie really found his style, but people tend to forget about that. It is a bit uneven, though - there are a couple bombs, like the ill-advised Syd Barrett tribute \\"All the Madmen\\", the \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" soundalike \\"Saviour Machine\\", and the bizarre sea chanty \\"After All\\". But there are also a lot of solid, slightly glammy rockers: the long, heavy \\"Width of a Circle\\", with its bizarre lyrics about having sex with Satan in hell; the Zep-like \\"Black Country Rock\\"; the acoustic-based Vietnam protest \\"Running Gun Blues\\"; \\"She Shook Me Cold\\", the best heavy blues rocker Cream never wrote; and especially that title track, which mixes Latin and Eastern influences. Of course, you may probably know it best for the brilliant cover by Nirvana, but the original is certainly worth listening to as well, if only for the mantra-like coda that Nirvana decided to leave out. Plus there is one very good weird track - \\"The Supermen\\", which mixes a heavy, grimy guitar riff and a driving rock beat with Nietzsche-influenced lyrics and operatic backup vocals. The mix on this album is very weird - Bowie's voice is generally mixed way above the guitars, so if you don't like it you're out of luck - but in pretty much all other terms this is a highlight for Bowie. And even the weaker tracks have all kinds of personality. This is the album that established Bowie as one of the most creative, distinctive, and memorable '70s rockers, and while it's flawed it's also quite worthwhile.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I was more than pleasantly surprised hearing this album. JM is not standing still. For me, Stop This Train and Dreaming With A Broken Heart are standouts. But, the whole album is good or better.
B00001OH7V|5.0|This really fits in with the same formula as Low, but if you ask me it's better. Half of it is made up of off-kilter, synth-heavy, oddly produced, avant-garde, unabashedly inaccessible songs, and the other half a collection of moody, ambient instrumentals. The pop songs are all notable, including the fabulously catchy \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"; the convoluted cabaret-rocker \\"Joe the Lion\\"; and the title track, Bowie's greatest and most famous song. Everything about it is just so perfect - the beautifully over-the-top, near-symphonic synthesizers; the chugging guitar part; the vocals; the lyrics; the melody; and especially the emotional weight of the song. It's his only \\"heart-on-sleeve\\" tune, and it achieves that goal perfectly.  I don't care how many DJ's have decided to play it to death, and I definitely don't care that it's six minutes long. Anyway, I also like the dense space-rocker \\"Sons of the Silent Age\\" - Bowie's sax part is one of his best. And while the pure schizophrenia of \\"Blackout\\" would fail if it was anyone else's songs, schizophrenia is just part of Bowie's routine, and it works perfectly for him. Then it's onto the almost entirely instrumental second side, where Bowie abandons any pretense of being commercial. \\"V-2 Schneider\\" is awesome, riding a beautiful synth riff along the same line as that from the title song and adding a great sax part, presumably played by Bowie himself. \\"Sense of Doubt\\", with its menacing piano motif, is pretty cool too. It's true that it's not a significant progression from Low, but what it, and the sound collage in general, does is perfects the formula set by Low.  And while it's true \\"Sense of Doubt\\" is pretty much just piano motif and accompanying churchy synthesizer part, I like both of those themes so much it doesn't matter to me. Flowing right into it is a beautiful slab of Eastern mysticism, \\"Moss Garden\\". And Bowie plays a brilliant sax on \\"Neukoln\\". The weakest song on the record - and by \\"weakest\\", I mean in the sense that \\"I'd rather have steak than ribs\\" - is the funky \\"Secret Life of Arabia\\", and even that's good fun, although it's totally anticlimactic coming after the instrumental suite. This isn't an easy album to digest, though. The first few times I heard this record, it left me cold outside of the first three songs. But now that I've given it several months to make its mark, it's my favorite Bowie record.se that \\"I'd rather have steak than ribs\\" - is the funky \\"Secret Life of Arabia\\", and even that's good fun, although it's totally anticlimactic coming after the instrumental suite.

075640407X|5.0|I've read this book twice since it came out last year, and enjoyed it quite a bit both times.  While it is true that I can make it through almost any book once, I only go back to the good ones. This is a good one.<br /><br />Why? Well, one reviewer says he likes the book because the hero gets by on his wits rather than his warrior skills,  as other author's heros (or sidekicks) do -  like Lan, who is simply the greatest warrior ever, or Josselyn and his vambraces. To be fair, however, we have to note that he has more than his fair share of wits. He is really smart. He is in brainpower what Lan and Josselyn are in swordpower. Even as a child. he was unnaturally quick to learn things, and to deduce things. He starts at University early, but he has had private tuition in magic which puts him miles ahead of the other students, even without his quick wits. So its not like he doesn't have an unfair advantage when things occur. On the other hand he is still an adolescent, with no money or family behind him, so maybe it balances out.  However you balance that, it is infinitely more fun to read about someone who thinks quickly and outwits his adversaries instead of using his incredible strength and skill as a swordsman to slide and dice his way out of trouble.<br /><br />It is also helpful that this is a retrospectful novel. It is told by the hero as an adult, perhaps of middle-age, when he is largely out of the hero business, apparently by choice. So there is a double view of events sometimes, even  if just the narrative shell of the tale.<br /><br />I recommend this one, and since the entire triology has already been written (but not completely revised for the press) it seems like the next two will be its match and we'll have thousands of pages of great reading - but not till 2009 for Vol 2, and some later date for Vol 3. I'd rather all 3 were out and I were recommending the entire tale - may I live so long, and may you too.
1400079179|5.0|This book was so compelling and the author made such good use of cliffhangers in each chapter that I simply couldn't put it down.  I literally devoured this book in a few days.  I looked forward to reading it in every free moment I had. The juxtaposition of light and dark are powerfully presented in this novel.  The spiritual meaning of the Holy Grail was truly profound, and a great metaphor for the feminine foundation in  spirituality.  The controversy sparked by this novel speaks to its power and  society's unyielding need to ignore the feminine and support the patriarchy.
055358894X|4.0|In his debut \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora,\\" Scott Lynch tells an intriguing story that, more than anything, depends on his ability to sell the reader on the main characters' abilities in the art of the con.  Before the meat of the plot ever reaches the reader, we are deep into a connected subplot that is, in itself, thoroughly enjoyable and absolutely critical to our belief in what happens later in the novel.  Because this initial confidence game is so well detailed, Lynch hooks his readers by giving them an intimate knowledge of the characters and their skills.  He does this in one way, in particular, that is worth mentioning.  Lynch makes clever use of time in this novel, and doesn't write it as if it must pass, from beginning to end, in chronological order.  His primary device are the interludes - chapters between the primary plot advancing chapters, that relate relevant bits of the primary characters' pasts - which help the reader to understand the motives and means of the characters.  His secondary device, used mostly in the opening chapters of the novel, is in allowing a single chapter to be read in a non-linear fashion.  This allows for a part of the plot to be carried forth prior to the explanation of what the characters are planning.  It's a clever device, and one that makes these earlier chapters all the more intriguing.  I also appreciate that Lynch avoids clich&eacute; characters.  The character of Locke Lamora could have easily been everything we want in a roguish character: intelligent, charming, witty, and very deadly...in other words, James Bond as a thief.  But, rather than making such a predictable character, Lynch creates characters with flaws.  Lamora is a great thief, but not a perfect one.  And this makes him more believable.<br /><br />Additionally, I enjoyed the scope of this novel.  Having read this on the suggestion of noted fantasy author George R.R. Martin, it goes without saying (to his fans, at least) that I can appreciate a novel (or series) with an enormous scope.  This, however, had a very limited scope - one coastal city - that allowed for a more detailed telling.  The city itself becomes a character.<br /><br />This is not to say that the novel is perfect.  Lynch has many sub-chapters (each chapter is divided into many interrelated parts) wherein characters outside of the primary group of cons and thieves are the primary focus.  This, then, highlights the relative lack of detail given to these parts of the story.  That is not to say that these parts are undetailed, but that there aren't enough of them to make them seem as relevant to the entire plot or to contribute much to the realization of the city Lynch has created.  For example, and without spoiling the plot, more detail regarding the worries or consequences, perhaps even the political problems, surrounding being conned out of a fortune would have made the story a deeper one.  While we have a good deal of detail about the city's wards, its celebrations, its clothing, and so forth, we have relatively little about its politics, great or small, and these would have made for a broader and more complete tale.<br /><br />A secondary criticism, and this is really just a pet peeve, is Lynch's use of profanity.  My criticism is not about the general use of it.  After all, the primary characters are thieves, not priests (a little joke for those who've read it, already).  My criticism is that authors manage to create cultures, geographies, cities, nations, religions, and any number of other things, and yet characters resort to the exact same curse words I might utter after hitting my thumb with a hammer.  At the beginning of a story, when we desperately want to believe in the world Lynch has created, and the story is doing all it can to aid that belief, a sudden \\"No s***\\" is like a cold smack from reality that briefly jars a reader (or at least this one) out of belief in the story.  But this is a minor criticism and, as the novel progressed, I becameused to it.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this novel to readers of fantasy.  It is quick paced, engaging, and altogether different from much of what's out there.  A good read, for certain!, I would strongly recommend this novel to readers of fantasy.  It is quick paced, engaging, and altogether different from much of what's out there.  A good read, for certain!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie had me laughing constantly in the midst of this journey with some very interesting & unique characters.  The cross-cultural relationships and language barriers in translation made for some very interesting dialogue, often funny and often quite profound.  All the characters were extremely well cast and the acting was excellent. This is a very different role for Elijah Wood and he performed it flawlessly. This movie will not only make you laugh, but also bring some new insights into the dilemma of those who survived the horrors of World War II.  The ending will surprise you and leave a deep impact.
B00125WAWS|5.0|The Great Debaters was inspired by the true story of the debate team at Wiley College, an African-American college that was originally created in 1873 by the \\"Freedman's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\\" Their goal was to help educate and prepare newly-freed slaves as they made the difficult transition into a new life.<br /><br />Now, with that as a historical backdrop, you know \\"The Great Debaters\\" has got to be rich in history, import, meaning and cultural significance. And it is.<br /><br />Professor Tolson (played by Denzel Washington) started coaching his now-famous debate team in 1929 and the movie is set in the year 1935, when 40 college kids would show up to audition for the four coveted spots on his team. If this movie were just another \\"academic cinderella story\\" it'd be interesting and entertaining but The Great Debaters is so much more than that.<br /><br />Born and raised in southeastern Virginia, I know a little bit about what racism looked like in the 1960s. This movie gave me a keyhole peak at racism in the 1930s and it was something I'll not soon forget. The scene depicting Forest Whitaker's confrontation (over a lost pig) with two no-account white racists was very believable and powerful and it was equally memorable and disturbing.<br /><br />Another scene that showed a lynching was probably the most haunting scene and yet witnessing that horrible event proved to be a catalyst for one of the debaters.<br /><br />If you go online and do a little background reading, you'll learn that some artistic license was exercised in telling the story of The Great Debaters (for instance, in 1935, they won a debate against University of Southern California; they never debated Harvard). However, for the most part, the story is good and true and very worthwhile.<br /><br />I don't buy a lot of DVDs but this is one movie I'd like to own. Powerful story and very well-told. And speaking as a history snob, the background details (the depiction of the 1930s time period) were also very well done and accurate.<br /><br />And an important PS to this movie review:  According to an article in the New York Times (published Dec. 5, 2007), Wiley College has been struggling for years to keep their doors open, and in recent years, that struggle has become even more severe. The article also states that Wiley has not had the financial wherewithal to sponsor a debate team for many years. Hopefully \\"The Great Debaters\\" will effect a sea-change in this historic college's financial fortunes.nd accurate.

015603283X|4.0|\\"The Club Dumas\\" is an exciting and engrossing mystery/thriller book by Arturo Perez-Reverte.  It overall involves Lucas Corso, a mercenary book detective whose job is to hunt down rare books, who is hired to find out if a part of a manuscript by Alexandre Dumas, the author of  \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is original.  Based on the author's incredible writing, it  makes you feel like an invisible character standing on the side, in the shadows, looking to see what will happen next.  I loved this book and enjoyed the ride.    I gave the book only a four rating because I still have some unanswered questions.  For example:  Why was Irene Adler included in the story and what was her overall purpose?  What does the number IX engraving really mean?    Overall, I recommend it to any one who has read \\"The Three Musketeers\\" or someone who wants to know more about Alexandre Dumas.  Moreover, the book includes some history details that I found interesting.  It had me thinking about it during the day, when I did not have time to read it.  Based on this book, I will be reading more books by this author.
B00009ATIX|2.0|Science fiction film directed by Steven Soderbergh telling the story of astronaut Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who is sent to explore a mystery involving a space station orbiting a planet that seems to delve into the human psyche.  Although the film has some good cinematography, the plot is tedious and the theme evasive.  The characters are rather bland and not very credible leaving the viewer with a rather empty feeling when the film is over.    The psychological profiles of Clooney's character along with Jeremy Davies' are simply not credible as astronauts who are on a long mission in outer space.  What agency in their right mind would send someone whose wife comitted suicide on such a precarious and solitary mission.  As far as Davies, the character is psychotic and mentally unstable from the start.  Again, what organization would leave such expensive machinery in the hands of a pair of basket cases?  In terms of the story line, the plot clumsily conveys the theme of a psychological struggle for lost love with endless scene reptitions reaching no real climax or suspense.    All in all, the film has some good cinematography but is burdened with a slow unengaging plot carried by excessive repetition of scenes through characters that are rather bland and not very credible leading to a fish-tail ending.  A sleeper at best.  For this type of film, Kubrick's '2001' is a more engaging film.
B00005JPXY|5.0|Just like many of you, when I saw the preview for this film I instantly dubbed it \\"a must see\\". What can I say? Something about the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the streets of Manhattan had me hooked. More importantly I couldn't wait to find out what exactly was causing this carnage. So it was with great expectations I strapped myself in for what was sure to be an incredible ride.     Now I could go on and on here about who the cast is but you would have no idea who I'm talking about. That's one of the things that really make this film work. There are no mega-stars on screen threatening to steal the spotlight from the story. I'm a huge fan of J.J. Abrams' work thanks to both Alias and Lost, so I was excited that he produced the movie. Everything he touches lately seems to turn to gold and this movie is certainly no exception.     The story is actually very simple. The entire film is shot from a hand-held camera giving us the point of view of a small group of friends who are trying to get out of New York. As the story unfolds we learn that a monster is destroying the city and the military is called in to stop the beast and evacuate the citizens. As these friends try to flee for safety, they unwillingly find themselves closer to danger.     This is not a film that offers answers and explanations, but rather we are only exposed to the minimal knowledge these friends have. They don't care where this monster came from or how it can be stopped. All they want to do is get out alive and help each other get there. I've read several reviews where people hated this aspect of the movie, but I have to admit it really worked for me. I love when filmmakers and writers think outside the box and Cloverfield is an excellent example.     The special effects and production value are top-notch and I found myself constantly wondering how they filmed certain scenes. This is one movie that will really immerse you into the experience and several times I had to remind myself tobreathe because of the intensity. The subway scene in particular is breathtaking and wonderfully terrifying.    There are lots of reports out about the jerky camera shots causing people to feel nauseous. Unfortunately, I can testify that this is indeed true. Whatever the condition is called, I have it. Several times I found myself having to look away from the screen because of the motion sickness I felt. However, the movie was so good and so involving that I couldn't look away for long and was able to fight through it. This move made me sick and I loved every second of it!

B000OV170W|1.0|Reading through the reviews here I see nothing about Ms. Picoult's method of writing. I found it to be choppy, disjointed, and confusing at times. For example, each chapter's title is a character's name which we're supposed to know that he/she is talking (1st person)to us. I constantly had to refer to the chapter beginning to remind myself who was talking. Going back and forth from the past to present also was a bit confusing. Naming a dog \\"Judge\\" while dealing with a judge in the book was a bit much. This book did not have a nice flow to it which spoiled the enjoyment of reading.  The subject matter was interesting but the ending was like it was written by a novice beginner writer.  I've heard Picoult is a great writer but obviously not my type or style.
0743455967|5.0|This book on writing is also a biography of sorts and offers insight into how some of his books came about. Great reading and inspiration to aspiring writers.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|I will limit myself to the technical side of the release:   Blue Ray transfer is excellent. Very smooth payback of Video and DST-HD Master audio track.   The sound tack is a little bit not as exciting as it could be for the movie like this. Low frequency effects are almost not existent (very rare). Sound engineers would get (B-) from me for the job and \\"no bonus\\".   Video transfer is very good (A+).
0385733577|5.0|I was first drawn towards this book because I thought it was a spin-off from Harry Potter. Well, it's not, but that doesn't mean it's not great. This book can hold it's own. I can't wait for the next book!

0375842381|5.0|The books are wonderful. I read them last year, before the movie was made. Pullman's writing is phenomenal. The descriptions of the characters and the daemons are amazing. I highly recommend them. These books are great for teens, but I think they are also great for adults.
0553805460|5.0|I'm not one to read books, but I met Jordan Belfort one night in Manhattan Beach while he was writing his sequel to The Wolf of Wallstreet. I must admit, he was quite in to himself, but I decided to give his book a try anyway. I just finished it, and all I can say is wow. This man has lived out his nine lives, and despite all the bad reviews on Amazon, I did LOVE this book. Thank you, Jordan. You've got me reading books again. Can't wait for your sequel and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie! (Amazon users, take notice that a good majority of bad reviews are from men, not women! Hmmm...jeaslousy?)
B00005JKDR|5.0|The movie is terrific just by itself, but the extras really make it worth picking up. The \\"outtakes\\" and \\"Mike's New Car\\" are fun, even if they are short.<br /><br />The film itself has great visuals and style. One of my favorite Pixars.
1594481717|4.0|From my standpoint I can see where Daniel Pink is formulating all his thoughts concerning logistics (left brain) versus imagination (right brain), but I don't entirely agree with all of his comments in A Whole New Mind. His tone sounds as if there will be no jobs for anyone with analytical strengths. It seems as if there is a sense of \\"machines will take over the world\\" drama. Pink's reasons are very convincing and factual about creativity rising within the job market but it doesn't necessarily mean that everything stated in his book is actually going to occur. Pink's methods may contribute to making more money in the future, but not all jobs want their employees to be the creative types. Some may strictly want employees who execute as they are assigned.      The book challenges people to simulate their minds in logical reasoning and creative purpose. Through deep analysis of the brain's workings Pink states his thoughts on the future and how humans should use their brains in preparation for the future. Pink states that the right brains are rising to balance out the artistic, emotional, and purposeful side of humans that isn't utilized often.     Abundance, Asia, and automation are the set reasons for the arousal of the right brain. The standard of living is higher than ever before. Asian countries can execute left brain jobs for cheaper wages. Machines are more precise and less emotionally attached; hence jobs will also go to the cheap machinery that can do it better, rather than an inconsistent human. The Conceptual Age, as Pink calls it, has sparked because of these three reasons.    There are six specific impressions that Pink believes would greatly benefit human brains as a whole and improve job security. Design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning are those six impressions. By assimilating Pink's justifiable reasons and six impressions anyone can be a force in the Conceptual Age.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I really enjoyed their first album and couldnt wait for the second to come out. The guitar work is fantastic and along with the peircing vocals make this cd truly amazing. The solo on Blackbird (track 8) is an amazing piece of work, and Ties that Bind is probably the best rock song to come out since the 80s. This CD has been in my car stereo since the day it was released. (I'm still not sick of it!!)
0385486804|5.0|I first read Krakauer's Into Thin Air a few years ago and was so drawn in that I could physically feel the events he described.  When I read Into the Wild I again was touched but this time in a different way.  Krakauer lets the reader decide for themselves if Chris McCandless was overly foolish or just living out the wild life that most men his age seek.  Some of us go father than others and Christ went too far and paid the ultimate price for his actions, but that doesn't make him any less foolish than millions of other young people that make stupid mistakes.<br />Krakauer is a highly interesting person and the most enjoyable chapter of the book is when he describes a climb he attempted alone when he was young.  I hope that Jon expands on his stories some day and releases and autobiography because he is a great writer with a great story that I hope will be told someday soon.<br />As for Into the Wild I highly suggest this book.  It will make your life fuller and will be something that you carry with you forever.
B0002V7O3S|3.0|snd it may well be.  The acting was ok, but too many flared nostrils. James Garner looks good for his age, but, all the suspects seemed to do was take lie detector tests, it was boring.  The director should have done more with what Travis saw on the space ship.  That was a lot more interesting, as a matter of fact it didn't look all that sanitary for a operating room.  The whole ship looked pretty dirty, the aliens may be advanced but they sure are slobs.  Enjoy!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the alternative rock bands that made it really big in the mid-90s., culminating with the \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" album that reached No.1 on the Billboard 200 album charts. After a sideway with Zwan a couple of years ago, Billy Corgan decided to resurrect the SP name and finally a new Smashing Pumpkins album appears in Fall, 2007.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" (12 tracks, 53 min.) starts off as an immediate sequel to \\"Mellon Collie\\", with heavy guitar riffs. By now the band is reduced to, as it appears in the album's liner notes: \\"artfully crafted by Jimmy Chamberlain Drums, Billy Corgan Everything Else\\" and so we can really say this is a Billy Corgan solo-album but for the Smashing Pumpkins name labeled on this album. The album's first half is pleasant, if not too remarkable. What sets album apart from a near-yawner is the epic 10 min. track \\"United States\\" which kicks of the second half of the album, an epic track which eventually leads into a Corgan guitar solo reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page on \\"Dazed and Confused\\", I mean it is soo eary... but yet so beautiful... The rest of the tracks go by, but none seem to resonate much with me. I keep playing \\"United States\\" over and over again.<br /><br />Is \\"\\"Zeitgeist\\" a poor album? No. But I don't know what this album adds to the Smashing Pumpkins catalogue. It seems to want to recreate the hey days of 1995 (Mellon Collie), except this is of course 12-13 years later and the music scene has moved on.... no wonder that this album dropped off the Billboard charts very quickly after its release. For Smashing Pumpkins/Billy Corgan diehards only.
0452289963|5.0|When I reach the end of this book, I start over. This has been going on for over a year. Thanks to Eckhart Tolle, I am much more aware of when I am lost in thought rather than present in the moment.  I am also painfully aware of when my ego is reacting to others, and this has helped transform my interpersonal relationships.  Not everyone will be ready for this book, but I cannot recommend it enough.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|I Love Danny Boyle, His movies (trainspotting, the beach, 28 days later) always manage to entertain me and confuse me at the same time. Sunshine, starring the blue eyed Cillian Murphy, is more on the confusing side. The plot is this, the sun is dying and one attempt to restart it has failed so another ship is launched to carry out the mission and things, of course go wrong. The crew is the usual bunch of pale faced astronauts all with their own expertise. The ship itself is massive, but claustrophobic. We don't really get a sense of what the day to day life is like, everyone is spread out checking equipment, growing plants, and sending messages home. You get the feeling that they are all dreading the deliverance of the \\"payload\\" which will restart the sun, and which Cillians character Capa is the only one who knows how to use it.<br /><br />I got confused about the crew exposing themselves to the obviously radioactive dangerous rays of the sun for thrills. I also got confused when they discover the first mission's ship and think its okay to go rescue it. I mean you have ONE chance to save the earth from freezing to death and you think \\"I am going to go have a looky-loo at a ship that disappeared 7 years ago, what could go wrong?\\" everything apparently. Pretty soon all spaceheck breaks loose. Oxygen is lost, hatches are blown, sabotage, fire, trajectory issues. People start dropping like mosquitoes drawn towards a zappy light, and the camera starts shaking like a leaf while the \\"bad guy\\" is never shown full on. In the end it comes down to, and it always does, the heroics and determination of one person.<br /><br />It's an alright space film, its beautiful to look at (especially Cillian) and had Boyles usual eye for details and ambiance. I didn't like the ships \\"voice\\" it was some chick and she sounded turned on all the time, I guess that's better than \\"hal\\" sounding creepy.
B000TGCR4C|4.0|I generally hate subtitles and usually avoid movies that are subtitled.  That being said, this movie is simply so good I forgot that it was in a different language.  The story, plot, scenery is just simply excellent.    The video transfer is beautiful and is great HD for your set.
1594489505|5.0|Simply brilliant to me, even better than the Kite Runner i think. The kite runner just had too many depressing moments in it and personally it was just too much for me, but this novel had just the perfect amount of sad times and happy. And I dont know what people are talking about when they say Khaled only shows the negative side of an afghan, after reading his novels i have a completely new view. Not that I ever thought badly of them but it gave me a feeling i've never felt before, a more open and accepting feeling and its amazing to me how a book can totally change ur perspective of something the way his novels did for me. LOVE LOVE LOVE this book, and I hope he writes many more.

B0000CNY5G|4.0|I'm not a fan of Westerns but I am a Brando fan so I sat through lots of people shooting each other in dusty towns to watch the wonderful Marlon.  The script is pretty good for a Western...the character Brando plays, Kid Rio, begins as a scoundral who plays really cheap tricks on the ladies, but eventually turns into someone with character.  Brando plays all of the nuances in his masterful way, and of course, he is in his physical prime here so he is quite amazing to watch.      The supporting cast is all first rate.  Karl Malden is appropriately venal, Slim Pickens is delightfully disgusting, Katy Jurado gives a terrific performance as Malden's wife, Ben Johnson is always good as a bad guy.  The one performance I found lacking was that of the young girl who plays the love interest.  I found it hard to believe that Rio would have turned his life around for such a lack luster little thing...just my personal opinion.    It is very long but we are now used to see films finish in under two hours so maybe I'm just conditioned to that length. It's definitely worth seeing...just make lots of popcorn.
B000FILW86|5.0|This is the album we have been waiting for.  I'm buying \\"Rockford\\" and \\"Budokan the complete concert\\".  I should have done this 2 years ago.  I have rediscovered Cheap Trick.  I was a huge fan when I was 13 back in 78.  I saw them live at the Sunken Garden's show in San Antonio back in 79....it was simply the best concert I have ever seen to this day.  I then saw them on the Dream Police tour(w/out Tom P.).  I have become highly disillusioned when it comes to the current music scene.  The \\"American Idolization\\" of the biz has made it a joke.  Cheap Trick has managed to survive and thrive in this mess.  All of today's young power pop/punk bands owe it all to Cheap Trick.  I prefer to listen to the original!!!!  Thanks guys....keep it up!
B000ZK4466|5.0|I love all three previous albums, most notably deloused and amputecture. I was suprised at how many people didnt like amputecture. Well, maybe bedlam will bring you back to tmv. this cd is fast paced, heavy, and doesnt have any filler noise like in frances. At first listen, some of the tracks sound the same, but you just have to listen to it a few times.  My personal favorite on the cd is ouroboros. It really shows cedrics talents in this song. Every song on this album is great. Even though its missing alot of the intense guitar solos, its different from all their other albums in a good way. to all the tmv haters out there, you should watch the video \\"two girls one cup\\"
0525950079|5.0|Just as perfect as Pillars Of The Earth. I loved this book in the same way I loved Pillars Of The Earth( Mr. Follett's novel touted by Oprah). The style is the same-- the setting is the same, albeit changed by the natural passage of time.  The characters are new but just as strong and endearing as those in the first book. In fact there are descendants of the original characters.  World Without End is a joy and a delight to read with all of the twists and turns, scandal and sex and machinations of the clergy and those who come in contact with them.  It is political and visceral-- beautiful and shocking. I was sorry when it ended, just the way I was sorry when I finished with Pillars Of The Earth.  I am proud to have these books-- I'll read them again in a couple of years so I can visit these people, places and circumstances again.
0151013047|5.0|Hamid's \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" is a very well written account of a Princeton educated Pakistani man named Changez who encounters an unnamed American man in a cafe in Lahore.  Engaging him in conversation, Changez tells us his story, a story of a Western thinking man from a Muslim country, who is a product of his times.<br /><br />Changez wants a piece of the American dream, and he gets a large piece of it - good education, great job, an upper class girlfriend.  That all changes with 9/11, and the paranoia that came with it.  With the changing attitudes of the American people come the changing characteristics of those who are suddenly on the defensive, much like the Japanese Americans during WWII.  Not understanding this ultimately racial paranoia, the Muslim Americans of the Middle eastern origins start fighting for survival and preservation, in the only way left to them - fundamentalism.  This fundamentalism is reluctant, as it depends on the accusations and persecutions from other parties.<br /><br />Hamid's novel is very engaging and can be read in one sitting.  Though a slim work, physically, it delivers a punch and keeps the reader thinking and contemplating - how many friends do we lose through imagining enemies?  Highly recommended.
0385522401|4.0|This is novel that fits firmly within the late middle period Ian McEwan. Look at his development so far. He started out as a novelist of the macabre, determined to shock the 1970s literary establishment with stories of rape, incest and child snatching. Deliberatly upset the cosy little Edwardian sherry party middle class relationship problems of English fiction that were prevalent at the time.<br /><br />As he has reached his own middle age, what does he provide us with - neat little stylish middle class novels depicting the lives of Briony's, Henrys, Edwards and Florences. All told in the stately, formal language he so railed against in his early years. (Though this is standard for the eminent British novelists these days, only Martin Amis has found a voice that can tackle the full range of modern society)<br /><br />Not that McEwan can't write. Far from it. He is probably the most precise, restrained, psychologically pure writer alive right now. His forte is not the big 'state of the nation' novel (witness his train wreck 'Saturday') but the Bronte 'two inches of ivory' mode. Depicting, with exquisite brushstrokes, the precision of an emotion, investing each description with the absolute authority of reality. He is to fiction what his made up protagonist in Saturday, Henry Perowne, was to neurosurgery<br /><br />Before Atonement and Saturday, novellas were McEwan's staple. On Chesil Beach revitalises this form, and it is masterful. The time segment of the Aristotelian unity is compressed to a mere three hours - a honeymoon couple, in July 1962, in a hotel overlooking Chesil Beach have dinnner, try to have sex, then have an argument on the beach. But interwoven with this is a great backstory building up the characterisation of Edward and Florence, their family lives, their motivations, their anxieties, their ambitions, their path to marriage. The period detail is exquisite - the woody church halls, the CND meetings, the melon with glazed cherry, the latest Nabokov on the table. One can hardly believe on shutting the page that one has read a mere slip of a book - 160 or so pages of wide spaced text.<br /><br />The novel is deliberately a restrained period piece. Written consciously from a standpoint of modern awareness (and in this it reminded me of John Fowles's 'French Leuitenant's Woman' about 19th Century sexual mores, written in the late 1960s'). McEwan knows his readers are moderns - people who have generally grown up far more promiscuous, profligate and comfortable about sex than poor Edward and Florence. He presents us with two characters who are so restrained, so bound to the pre sexual revolution way of life that their innocence is a tender naivety, wide eyed virgins embarking on full adulthood. We are forced to think back to a time when it was normal for couples not to sleep with each other (or anyone) before marriage, and consider whether the vast social changes since then have bettered us, or harmed us, and in what ways.<br /><br />The novel is not perfect, however. It is structurally flawed. I think McEwan has not yet fully mastered the short form (though he is closer than most). While a true masterpiece of a short novel like 'The Great Gatsby' is a flawless thing, unimprovable, in style, realism and plot, 'On Chesil Beach' ultimately fails to convince because the hinge on which it depends - that lives can be changed based on a messy botched sexual experience on the wedding night - does not work. Would a couple, back then, really break up because of this? I venture not. Which is a shame, because McEwan gives us some masterful writing in building our engaged focus, our imaginative sympathies, towards this premature climax.ardly believe on shutting the page that one has read a mere slip of a book - 160 or so pages of wide spaced text.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|Classic Science Fiction & a must own.  I've seen it many times.  The final cut includes discussion about it's production. etc. which is worth while.  All the films character are well played.  Rachel is excellent, sensual yet not sexual but mysterious and vulnerable.  Harrison Ford is great as the  Blade Runner.  Set design, costumes, atmosphere, melancoly rain, smoke & filtered light all add to its uniqueness.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Check it out: It's a rock and roll spaghetti western, soldered, duck taped and spit-welded  into a future as charming, funny, and entertaining as Dune, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Speaker for the Dead all rolled into one.  This show is the best sci-fi I have seen since the first time I watched Bladerunner as a kid. I'll go further, it's the best sci-fi TV show ever to exist. Get it, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY! And while you are at it, call up the thieving cretin bastards at Fox and cus them out for axing something so good so soon.
0452289963|5.0|One of my all-time favorite spiritual books, despite the fact that it's now on Oprah's book club list.  I won't hold that against it! =)    Be careful, however, not to intellectualize the teachings and minimize them to the point where they become another exercise for the mind--that also would be an egoic pursuit and something that ought to suggest you are prime for a second reading.  I'm guilty of that!      A fundamental tenet of Buddhism is emptiness--which is a freeing of oneself from the mind.  This book guides you along that path, away from the time-bound, mind-obsessed self.  As long as you are stuck at this low level of consciousness, you will be in pain, whether you are fully aware of it or not.  Of course, we all have to operate at this level to some extent in order to function in the world.  But the distinction here is that nowadays the vast majority of people have formed their entire identity around that - around a label, a title, a role, knowledge they've accumulated, their past, what they own, etc - and haven't been able to escape from that burden even for a moment.  The truth is that you are none of those things and Eckhart describes this in a very elegant manner--a perfect signpost to direct people to a higher level of consciousness.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|Iv'e only included that title for my review as I am an official hard core, note for note, die-hard fan, who has even been in a touring Led Zep cover band. (the drummer) First of all, the second it kicks off, it hits you with a nice mid-bass roundness and an overall dynamic punch that was never on the original. Yes, just like \\"How the West Was Won\\" made you smile and say, \\"Wow - why wasn't this the live release!\\"  So, yes the sonic impact is vastly improved over the original version even if you have meager equipment. (Noticable in the car and outdoors on a portable).      The second thing you notice is that there are different versions of some of the original songs. Jimmy Page must have found better sounding, but not neccessarily better played versions from that 3 night stint at Madison Square Garden.  I say not better played because I hear mistakes on some of the new versions that were not on the 1973 release.       Third, we get 6 new unreleased live songs. My favorites being \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" that just seem to have a swagger and grind eclipsing the studio versions.  There's great versions of \\"The Ocean\\" and the full \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" that are different from the DVD version. \\"Heartbreaker\\" hits you live and sloppy and now I know why they left \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" off of the original, but it's interesting none the less.      Overall, this is just a dynamite re-issue.  You get different recordings of the tour, 6 new songs, and a REAL re-mastered beefed up live audio landscape that will have old fans smiling and newbies wondering how they did it almost 35 years ago!!  Highly reccomended!!!
B000002LE6|5.0|This is one of my fave Prince albums.  The picture and artwork is arguably his best album cover in my oppinion.  I loved his style the most during this period.  It was strange, surreal and bordering on drag queen.  This album was an intense \\"spiritual journey\\" that Prince was riding. I was still in high school and has no clue what was going on with Prince at the time, I just wanted to hear the music.  I was most excited when purchasing this particular album, because my Prince obsession had peaked during this time and I cannot describe the fascination over the material and concept of \\"Lovesexy\\".  It intorduced me to new sounds and emotions I had never felt at the tender age of 17.  Now I understand more the reason he pulled \\"The Black Album\\" and replaced it with \\"Lovesexy\\".  I remember being so confused and a bit agry why Prince deprived us from a new album that he seemed to regret making.  Like I said, I just wanted to hear the music.  It was a calculated move and Prince always knows best in most cases.  Even though his decisions seem bizarre to us common folk, later on you see the light and it magically comes together.  \\"The Black Album\\" sounded good way back then, but if you listen and compare the 2 together now, you see the glaring differences.  \\"Lovesexy\\" is of course more \\"positive\\", the lyrics are more about God and love.  It was also engineered better and more time was spent on each song. \\"The Black Album\\" seems more of a concept album, sort of thrown together, who knows if it was ever really meant to be released, it could have all been a publicity stunt for all we know.  But what \\"eye no\\" is, \\"Lovesexy\\" shines as a brilliant Prince album that made an indelible print in my heart and soul during that time.  \\"Anna Stasia\\" is still one of my all time Prince faves. I also love \\"Lovesexy\\" and \\"Positivity\\".  Prince was so creative back then, it seems like he spent alot of time and energy on this album. The only complaint I have with this album and it's a major one,I so wish they would release it with individual tracks!  When I make Prince compilations for friends, I can never use this cd to extract songs from and it stinks man.  The mysteries of Prince, what can u do, right?
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Now I am sure there is at least one kid right now who is reading this, still holding a gruge with MCR for \\"selling out\\", and you know what I have to say to that kid. I completely agree with you, but Im okay with it. This album is not Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge part two, nor is the Bullets part 2.   This album is nothing like old MCR, this is more of a show, its a spalsh a spectical (forgive me Billie Joe for using your words) it was meant to get attention from fans, not media, just fans and in that case  it is amazing.    Even the most hardcore scenster has to admit for the most part this album rocks, sure WTTBP was played WAY TO MUCH, but hey we werent complaining when people started to play Helena every 12 seconds so why start now?       Yes Yes, its not old MCR   Frank doesnt wear X's on his eyes  Mikey lost the glasses  and Gerard has turned into Gerald  but these are boys have still made an amazing album that still has the classis MCR heart and energy, but with a less basement show sound    The album is a combination of punk, old school rock, and some bad 80's hair dye  and all around good fun  minus bert mccracken
B000C20VPA|5.0|\\"Casino\\" is a crowning achievment on alot of different levels.  The directing, the acting and the story.  You feel so involved while viewing it, you get so tangled up in all the crap that ends up happening.  It's an emotional investment worth the payoff.  All of the performances are brilliant, especially the scenes between Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro.  There was some funky energy between the 2, like they really hated eachother at times.  They're fights and tirades seemed so real, I was mezmorized while watching them.  When Sharon Stone finally gets confronted in the Italian restaurant, and Robert DeNiro graps her and she mutters, \\"I wouldn't do that if I were you\\", I felt the raw emotion of her performance.  This role was Sharon's crowning achievemnt in film in my oppinion.  This is one of my favourite films, I wish someone could make another epic drama like this again, there seems to be a shortage of good stuff like this around.  ENERGY PEOPLE!
B000Y7U98C|2.0|Sunshine starts out with a lot of promise...interesting cast, great spfx...but soon devolves into a pointless thriller. I couldn't even finish it I was so bored. No wonder this mess was shuffled into and out of theaters in, like, one week. Shame on you, Danny Boyle. You can do better than this.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Liked the first \\"Saw\\", hated \\"Saw 2\\", liked \\"saw 3\\" but have some complaints.  The first problem I have is they always seem to use these \\"dumb white guys\\" for the protagonists in the films.  it's like, how can you really pull for them and feel sorry for their situation, when their character is borderline unlikable from the get-go?  I also find the storyline abit confusing at times, there is so much going on, you seem to have to be completely wrapped up in all of the films storylines to understand fully what's going on.  As far as gore, this had got to be the most digusting horror film I have EVER seen.  I almost never have to look away from the screen but on this one, I simply cannot watch the brain surgery scene or the twist torture sequence at the end.  I can only look for a second and then immeadiatley look away again.  I guess this could be a good thing, that's why were horror fans right?  This was Shawnee Smith's movie, I love her in some other films, she's always plays quirky roles.  I wish she would have acted more edgy and bizarre like in some of her other roles.  Check her out in \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" and \\"The Stand\\".  She rocks.  I still haven't seen Saw 4, can't wait even though it seems like I'm sort of dissing the whole franchise, I still want to see saw, huh?
B00011F5DK|5.0|What a wonderful game!  My daughter loves it, and I've been bringing it to our Friday night Bible Study/Fellowship and now my friends are buying it!  I only have one suggestion for the manufacturer... it would be a great plus to have some sort of frame to place over the board for a two player game. (I've made one out of cardboard and my husband is going to create one for me in his sheet metal classroom :o) That way, you do not need the travel version for a 2 player game.    I love the fact that it is a fairly quick game; easy to play one game before bed on a school night :o)  Great game for planning out moves, critical thinking, etc...  I have also purchased Trigon for more fun :o)
1591396190|5.0|What can I say that has not been said about this book? Here is a more personal appreciation.    This is the first book I've read about branding and differentiation. The author is full of common sense but the  weird thing as that this type of common sense is not so common in business. Obviously this is not a step by   step guide to building a great business. There is no such thing. What you do get is a nice framework   to position your idea and see how you compare within your extended competitive landscape. Applying this  framework to your own idea might require more intuition than you think (otherwise creating the next best thing would be too simple) but the author uses many case studies as examples of how to use the framework.   Of course, he has the benefit of hindsight but that's no reason to dismiss the ideas. Great book and fun to read.
B00122Z7NK|4.0|This album is a lot of fun. I'm a guy with eclectic tastes ranging from alternative country to ambient breaks and I dig this album because 1. it defies categorization. 2. it's orginal. Sure, maybe the sound has been \\"done before\\", but it still sounds fresh to my ears. It's the kind of album you can listen to a long time and find a new layer to entertain you. 3. The music manages to combine a sense of humor and fun with a hard/dark edge which I love and few acts do well these days. Think Daft Punk meets Chromeo meets Hexstatic. The first track is awesome, like 2 DJs doing Darth Vader's March vs. a Joy Division cover while on laughing gas. It could be the soundtrack of a classic Kung Fu movie meets MJ's Thriller video remake. The rest of the album is great too, only a couple tracks that I haven't really liked so far (D.A.N.C.E. among them, but it grew on me.) If you're a musical purist, and complain about how it's not really this or that genre/style, or too derivative of Daft Punk or anything else, don't get it. If you like smiling and listening and grooving at the same time, buy it. You won't regret it.
B000V63B5E|5.0|One of the best Love Rock songs I have ever heard was \\"Bed Of Roses.\\" I have listened to it for many years. Now that I have an Amazon Account I found it and downloaded from this album. Bon Jovi is a great musician, with immense talent and he has great songs. This is what's great of purchasing through this method. Although it's not expansive to download the entire album, to me it is more efficient to download the ones you enjoy the most. In this album there are, in my taste, 4 great Bon Jovi songs \\"Always\\" \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" \\"You Give Love a Bad name\\" and of course \\"Bed of Roses\\" if you like this type of Rock bands you will enjoy these songs for an amazin $3.96. !!!
B000YMBBH0|5.0|I purchased this 3-pack as a gift for my brother-in-law. He only needed the last two of the movies, but it was actually cheaper to buy the 3-pack than just the two individually. It is important to note, however, that buyers should not assume that this is a boxed set. It is simply just the three movies shrink-wrapped together.  Regardless, it is a great deal.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the movies themselves are really good too! ;)
B00104W8T6|1.0|A collection of horrible nursery rhymes with some of the worst, most twee lyrics ever on top of the world's lamest music.  Especially since Juno is supposed to be into early punk, this wimpy folk music is extremely annoying.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Blinking in my inbox like a traffic light in a vacant downtown intersection, there it is, the e-mail from Waste (Radiohead). The e-mail came in around 1:30 am, plenty of time to sit down with it a few times in the wee hours of the morning. With this release, there was a first for both me as a music buyer, and Radiohead as a band. In Rainbows, the band's seventh studio record, is being released sans record label, and more importantly, sans physical compact disc or LP. The mp3 download of the record was offered about a week ago for a \\"name your price\\" offer. People going to their website could basically let their conscious guide them to either giving Radiohead $20 or .20 cents for the new album. The adventurous soul could also shell out over $80 to get actually discs and vinyl that would arrive in a box set sometime in December. But enough about all that. The good news the hard disc is in the shops as they say, and I usually see it priced around 8 bucks, and on amazon the price is extremely reasonable. So let's all rejoice shall we?    Is it any good? In a word, yes. The style has not changed much from their last three - Kid A, Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief. I expected the usually knob twiddling and squelched sound effects, and they appear from the start. In Rainbows has its share of sparse beats, incomprehensible vocals and lush orchestration, but not much in the way of straight forward guitars (so what). It does have plenty of emotional punch and in it's own weird way, well composed, classic styled tunes. Like their last three albums (and Thom Yorke's solo work), I always really enjoy what they put out, but ultimately feel they give some listeners (new ones) a cold experience, more times than they should. On occasion, they manage to break through the blips and whirls with some stunning emotion and almost jazz-like improve instrumentation. In Rainbows does this and more.    I always go back to OK Computer and compare how I felt when I first heard that. It was just as challenging (at the time), but was more rewarding than anything anyone could have imagined. It became a classic. Kid A was also a challenging and stunning new idea of what the band could do. That too became a landmark record for them and rightfully so, it changed how the music world viewed them and what they were capable of. I've always thought the follow-up releases (Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief) were nothing more than extensions of Kid A. Both contained their moments but failed at becoming the next watershed record we all thought would eventually happen. In Rainbows surpasses both Amnesiac and Hail on all fronts. So why are people not completely warm to it? I'm not sure? Maybe after 6 stellar records, 2 or 3 of them being downright essential owns, is releasing a really really good record just not good enough?    In the end, In Rainbows does its job, and does it extremely well, there are some excellent tunes on here for sure. Nude is an amazing highlight, a song they have been working on for quite some time, and from the sound of it, they've nailed it. Beautiful string arrangements and a minimalist approach to the vocals are both creepy and endearing at the same time. The opening track, 15 Step, builds to an amazing climax of beats and strings and drowns out all the song's frosty start with clank after clank of drumbeats and samples. It could be said the style of such a song is very Radiohead, though it lacks the emotional punch of earlier Radiohead songs like: How To Disappear Completely, Let Down, or Street Spirit. This is not true. There's a lot of emotion that Thom pours into every muffled lyric. The album's seventh track, Reckoner, oddly hangs its hat on a nice and simple, plucking guitar lead. Very Beatles inspired of all things. The guitar sound on Reckoner defiantly rubs shoulders with another almost mumbling vocal line from Thom. It proves to be another interesting mix of electronic and traditional instrumentation. The album's closer, Videotape, is probably In Rainbow's most cohesive, epic, yet minimalist moment. The drum and piano loops are mesmerizing, the sparse piano seems to paint this apocalyptic picture (at least in my head), and the results are amazing. This is only trumped by my favorite track, the hauntingly beautiful, All I Need. Slow in tempo and heavy on bass lines, Thom's voice seems to sound the best when dripped at this slower pace. Great lyrics, nice and moody, it's some wonderful stuff captured on wax.    So, have Thom and co. set their bar to high? Doubtful, but as In Rainbows' Nude says, \\"there's seems to be something missing.\\" I just think the missing parts aren't that important anymore, especially to the band. In the end, that's the catch, because In Rainbows is a really great record in the scheme of things. It's a shame its (now over) business model is over-shadowing the songs in these early stages, time will tell whether that holds up. I'd like to think that good songs always win out, in which case, I love Radiohead's odds.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret Review    I own both the book and the DVD for The Secret.  Both the book and DVD are excellent resources.  I found that the DVD had very functional examples.  It was engaging and informative.  I liked the speakers and the actors.  The book was excellent.  I have heard criticisms that the book was repetitive. It was.  But I didn't mind that. I think sometimes messages need to be repetitive. After all, don't we have to keep sending thoughts out to the Universe?  The beginning of the DVD states, \\"Little did I know that out of my greatest despair would be my greatest gift.\\"     This has been very true of a life struggle before I even knew of \\" The Secret\\".  My greatest despair --- living with an alcoholic --  turned out to be my greatest gift.     I discovered  Al-Anon (a support group for families of alcoholics) ------ and a life-saving book by Toby Rice Drews [[ASIN:0961599596 Getting Them Sober: You Can Help! (Getting Them Sober)]].   Both this book, and 'the Secret' book, have been so important in vastly improving my life.
B000ZK4466|5.0|I think De-Loused is one of the most awesome rock albums I've ever heard, but they veered into experimental prog - experimental even by prog's standards, that is. While it was easy to admire their artistic drive and capability, the albums that came after were just not as much fun for the listener as they appeared to be for Mars Volta (although they will rock your face at a concert no matter what).<br /><br />Bedlam is largely a return to their original approach, so there's more rock and less avant garde noise. It gets downright blistering, in fact. Even the lyrics are less indecipherable, when they aren't layered with effects.<br /><br />The inherently progressive nature of this rock will continue to put off potential fans; if you haven't liked previous Volta albums, there's nothing here that will change your mind. Me, I love all these songs, except for \\"Tourniquet Man,\\" the only place where the album loses some steam. I think it's amazing that people can still make this kind of music, considering the oppressively ubiquitous popularity of \\"indie\\" rock, which is now no more outside the mainstream than \\"alternative\\" was by the mid-90s.<br /><br />Anyways, Bedlam works as an antidote to the current trends. Just like De-Loused, it's very difficult to go back to more radio-friendly music without feeling a little let down by a lack of adventurousness -- and frankly, a little bored and restless.
B000SQJ2JG|1.0|This is dp's worst album, NOT because Ritchie isn't here, NOT because Gillan isn't here, BUT because it's not any kind of hard rock. CTTB is really shame after Machine Head and even after Burn.<br />However Stormbringer was also weak, more funky than hard rock, but Come Taste The Band is soul-funky album! Tommy Bolin was great guitarist, Coverdale is really good vocalist and Hughes had really good vocal range, BUT they weren't the proper people for Deep Purple - They are sunky-soul musicians, and that was the reason why DP died in 1976.<br /><br />I'M NOT GOING TO LISTEN !SOUL! ALBUM FROM BOGUS DEEP PURPLE.<br />if you are hard rock/metal fan, CTTB isn't worth to listen it even for 1 times.<br />If you are a died fan of Tony Braxton or Whitney Houston, Than,  This album is only for you!
B000065BPB|4.0|Don't buy these expecting to travel with them. But if you want a good set of headphones for home use these offer good sound at a good price.  As others have said, these are a little tight, and can get uncomfortable when worn for hours if you don't take occasional breaks.  You probably want to go with a different set of headphones if you think you will be sensitive to this squeeze.  On the other hand, the pressure does help to keep out surrounding noises.  Good sound quality playback through the speakers in the headphones, and they feel like a quality product design.  They do fold up slightly which is nice, but they are still pretty big.  Regarding external noises while wearing the headphones, I've noticed that higher pitched sounds/voices come through more than lower tones, but you don't notice either when actually listening to music.  Also, as another reviewer noticed, the cord does act as transmitter for noise when it is moved/bumped; ie not good for working out/excessive movement as the coiled cord is bulky too.  The cord is durable though, no problems with the connections at either end.  In summary - Good product/sound, large size, noticeable squeeze on ears.
B000002UE9|4.0|Poisons best album was unleashed in 1988 and much like Guns `n' Roses Appetite...and Motley Crues Dr Feelgood it truly captured the zeitgeist of the moment. An album that probably has very few people willing to publicly trumpet it's virtues years later but one that I'm sure remains to this day a guilty pleasure for many.<br /><br />The album consists of Poisons hair metal/party metal/pop metal/whatever you wanna call it and just looking at the track listing will give you an inkling of what your going to get with numbers entitled Love on the Rocks, Nothin' But A Good Time, Look But You Can't Touch and Fallen Angel. Where the real talent of the band lay is not in musical virtuosity, nobody is going to mistake guitarist C.C. Deville for Eddie Van Halen or Paul Gilbert anytime soon, but in their ability to combine their passionate delivery with PG rated good time vibes and a simple delivery of hook laden songs. This isn't a Dream Theatre album. Nor is it heavy metal in the likeness of Judas Priest, this is hard rock with a smirk on it's face and an unfeasibly large cod piece down it's pants. And when your in the mood for it there is nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />If you play this album wanting a charming portrayal of regular 80's hard rock conventions then this is it. If you want erudite examinations of the human condition then look elsewhere. But as long as you are in the right frame of mind it's hard to go past the excellent Nothin' But A Good Time or Fallen Angel. And the massive hit of Every Rose Has It's Thorn somehow caught the imagination of so many that it became the bands biggest hit which is ironic when you consider that other hair metal bands were far more into the soppy ballad than Poison who truly give the impression on this album that they'd rather get their rocks off by rocking your socks off than by buying a new house from the proceeds of another lighters in the air girlie love song.<br /><br />An album so enamoured of, indeed, nuthin' but a good time that it's hard to review. But along with Dr Feelgood from the Crue and a couple of other albums circa 88-90 this would have to be the glam metal genre at it's very best. But still not five stars due to things being a bit too simple and due to some of the sentiments just coming across as a bit too try hard. Though by all accounts the band certainly lived the life, good on `em cos somebody has to do it!review.

He remains the supreme guru of every uber-geek born after 1975, but the mere mention of his early, repellent films such as \\"Pink Flamingos\\", \\"Female Trouble\\", \\"Polyester\\", and \\"Desperate Living\\" still brings tears to my eyes, recollecting their noxious fumes of art-house swill.  It's when he went relatively mainstream with the quirkiness of the offbeat \\"Cry Baby\\" and \\"Hairspray\\" did I appreciate his knack for oddball nostalgia.<br /><br />That this film has little of Waters' input is a blessing.<br /><br />More or less, this is a buoyant, corny musical, cheerily adapted from the colossally entertaining Broadway show which, in turn was based on Waters' 1988 film.  The film version breezes and bops along, coasting on a stellar score that, unfortunately, the cast isn't vocally up to par enough to sustain the momentum.  Most of them looked bored.<br /><br />Its major distraction is John Travolta - in a bulbous fat suit and grotesque make-up, and spewing an inaudible, peculiar lisp, he looks less human and more like Jabba the Hut during a Night of a Thousand Stevies, and that's when you can hear his dialogue at all. He sinks every scene he's in like the Titanic in a muumuu.<br /><br />The rest of the ensemble is mostly fine; the glaring exceptions are Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken - they halt the film dead with their impotent duet.  Blonsky is adorable and wonderful and she and Efron are cute and exuberant together. Queen Latifah is always a joy to see on screen.<br /><br />Listening to the limp soundtrack, it's a wonder that the musical numbers worked on screen, but they do, and the finale `Can't Stop The Beat' is wistful and high-spirited.<br /><br />So, \\"Hairspray\\" isn't \\"Singing In The Rain\\", \\"West Side Story\\" or \\"Hair\\".  But it isure ain't \\"Paint Your Wagon\\", \\"Grease\\", or \\"Rent\\" either.  And for that we should be thankful.  Amen.  My grade: Bfor that we should be thankful.  Amen.  My grade: B
B000002JOH|4.0|Pantera fairly ripped the head off the metal planet with this album and it's predecessor. But this and The Great Southern Trendkill are probably considered their crowning achievements. As the years have passed the heaviness factor here hasn't been, as even though there are a number of Scandinavian or Floridian death metal and black metal bands that are heavier they appear less so since they often release albums with poor production and even when the production is cleaned up with ultra modern studio techniques the sheer one dimensional nature of the bands in respect to lyrics mean that Pantera still sit almost alone upon a pedestal. And they are certainly the heaviest band to enter the mainstream even if it was only just.<br /><br />The album opens up with Mouth For War and instantly your snapped to attention. The sheer vitality of the heavy factor, the sheer violence in Phil Anselmo and his delivery and the meaty sounds which multi-track recording allow bands is there for all to see and they back it up with A New Level which sends the tempo up and down the register, the slower sections hitting critical mass. Not all the songs are barnstorming brilliance, Walk isn't all that memorable, but just when you think you've heard the heaviest the band can produce along comes ... Hostile. Just quite how angry one has to be to write a ditty like this is hard to imagine, certainly a headspace only a few can survive for long. After that is the number This Love, where Anselmo truly sounds like he's about to have an aneurism or some other drastic medical emergency and that's a compliment. And to me the much missed Dimebag Darrel never sounded so caustic, so utterly Mr Heavy God-darn Metal than on this track where it seems he's in mortal combat with his guitar and it's not certain who will live to tell the tale.<br /><br />The only other song however that reaches such a height for my mind is By Demons Be Driven, the sort of song you think soldiers about to go into battle might listen to in order to get their blood lust up, such is the animalistic violence on display and it's truly inspiring that Pantera with the production and engineering assistance of none other than Terry Date managed to capture such a maelstrom onto the master tapes.<br /><br />As the album wears on, and as the listener wears out, there are issues with whether something this heavy for an entire release can be truly pleasurable for all that many people. Which probably explains the short life span of so many death and black metal bands, the sales figures are just too low although with the internet they can at least reach their pockets of fans scattered across the globe. In line with my review for Nevermores album This Godless Endeavour, I have to admit defeat here and state that this record defeats me utterly,  my personal feelings is that this for me is a three star release for the sheer pleasure I get from Mouth, ... Hostile, This Love and By Demons Be Driven alone but the rest startst to bleed into one long volcanic eruption but for those with a stronger constitution this probably rate a very health four stars, thus my awarding it that many here.to get their blood lust up, such is the animalistic violence on display and it's truly inspiring that Pantera with the production and engineering assistance of none other than Terry Date managed to capture such a maelstrom onto the master tapes.

B00000DHRZ|3.0|Offspring have made millions with a very simple plan done very very well and it's quite a minimalist plan. Ultimately the band have done it again as they have produced an album with nice production techniques, very concise songs that are perfectly edited towards the attention span of their audience and with a genuinely (mildly) amusing sense of humour proving that just because you sell millions doesn't mean you can't have a laugh which is quite refreshing - especially since this was the 90's remember.<br /><br />The band here has unleashed a pop punk hard rock album with plenty of full bodied tracks replete with Dexter Hollands endearing non singing style cutting through with clarity which is important if you want people to actually get the jokes your sending forth. Production by Dave Jerden is fine, the band aren't exactly writing Bohemian Rhapsody here or the next album by Dream Theater. Once again all the lyrics are included along with the sort of mildy amusing cartoons we've seen on other Offspring album booklets.<br /><br />As per most of their other albums this one is held together wholly and solely by the hit singles, it seems that the band only write a few good tunes per album and then proceed to fill in the gaps with noise that sounds appropriate without actually taxing their songwriting skills. Here those hits include the rather substandard-for-an-Offspring-single She's Got Issues and the genuinely amusing Why Don't You Get A Job. Some of the tracks like The Kids Aren't All Right and Feelings come close to hitting the nail on the head and of course there is the flagship single Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) which has a typically bouncy delivery and it resonates with a lot of people because we all know someone who tries so darn hard yet just doesn't get it. Which is perhaps why apart from it's fun aspect is why it became the albums signature hit.<br /><br />All up another piece of hard rock fluff by a band who seem to have the midas touch as everything they release goes gold, or more like platinum.more like platinum.
0767803434|5.0|Air Force One  DVD<br /><br />Air Force One  starring Harrison Ford is one of my favorite movies for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />First it shows you what an U. S. President ought to be:<br />- An Honorably discharged veteran (in the movie he had won the Congressional Medal of Honor)<br />- Brave ( he chose to stay behind and fight the terrorist who had hijacked the plane)<br />- A man of action, not just words.<br />Glenn Close plays a superb Vice-President.  In the movie the President's family on the surface mirrors Bill Clinton's, wife with a teenage , blonde headed daughter.  Too bad reality is so different.<br /><br />Anyhow as Bill Clinton recently said it's all a fairy tale.<br /><br />Highly recommended for people who want to know how a President is suppose to be and for fans of Harrison Ford.<br /><br />Gunner February<br /><br />P. S. Did you know Harrison Ford was a carpenter when discovered for the first Star Wars movie?
B000001IPL|4.0|Offspring caught everyone by surprise with just how good this album was. It took off, quite literally blowing many other bands out of the way to get at the charts in numerous territories and it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Firstly the band were one of the earliest to use the pop-punk schtick. And given there was some real abrasiveness in their wattage and Dexter Holland actually had a bit of the ol' nasal twang happening you sort of believed it. As opposed to Blink 182 (the Danger Danger of their generation).<br /><br />Secondly the thing was propelled by the buoyant yet full bodied blasts of singles such as Come Out And Play which speaks at a simple yet highly effective level to the fire in the belly without totally submerging it's intelligence to suck up to the punter, the stupidity of much of the behaviour being sung about isn't glossed over. As for Self Esteem, this is an interesting piece of introspection wrapped up in a PG rated sense of fun.<br /><br />Thirdly the body of the album apart from the couple of huge singles also feels good and sounds good. Nitro (youth energy) is an excellent way to start off an album and further songs like Bad Habit, Gotta Get Away and Genocide continue to batter the listener with tracks that feel full of intent.<br /><br />Towards the end of the album things start to unravel a bit - the band should of cut two or three tracks off the album as What Happened To You, So Alone and Not The One are all fairly anonymous and by then your not really all that interested in the title track tacked unceremoniously onto the end of proceedings.<br /><br />And that's pretty much why I can only give this four stars. The album has Offspring at their very best with energetic delivery of fresh sounding hard rockin' numbers that have more vitality in them than so many of the more offensive pretenders in the genre. One of the better hard rock albums of the 90's with easily enough middle finger to have you taking them seriously. For now.

B000001FYL|3.0|As the soundtrack to a movie that bombed badly you could be forgiven for dismissing this Jon Bon Jovi solo effort but it would be wrong to consign it to the scrapheap without giving it a listen if you've ever had a soft spot for his day job band Bon Jovi.<br /><br />Released initially in 1990 and produced by the main man himself and Danny Kortchmar to good effect the albums eleven tracks are all within the confines of the projects brief - ie they are all country tinged to a greater or lesser degree. Most people who were anywhere near a radio in the Western world around 1990 will be familiar with this albums resident hit single and title track Blaze of Glory. And it's probably fair to say that this song is the high point of the record as it has a good chorus, simple yet effective construction and some emotion. It's also pretty much the most hard rockin' number on the entire album.<br /><br />Some of the songs miss the mark badly such as the utterly plastic and fake sounding Bang A Drum and the last track, Guano City, is mercifully only one minute long. Some other tracks however do work to a reasonable degree such as lead cut Billy Get Your Guns and there is some genuine maudlin emotion on songs such as Dyin' Ain't Much of A Livin'. Blood Money tries to work a similar done-me-wrong emotion but falls pretty flat while most of the other tunes blend in with the wallpaper fairly quickly.<br /><br />Jons' familiar voice tends to walk by your side throughout this release, it really does come across as very much a solo effort though anoraks might want to know that such luminaries as Jeff Beck, Elton John and Aldo Nova do turn up on the album in places and the booklet includes the lyrics to the whole shebang. Mind you, once you open out the booklet the side opposite to that with the lyrics has a full size picture of Jon - wow, just what I always wanted!<br /><br />All jokes aside my advice overall is that if you are a Bon Jovi fan and don't have this yet then definitely get it as you'll find a few gems here. And given the directions Bon Jovi have gone over years the country tinge to this album makes perfect sense in hindsight.here.

B000MRA5NS|3.0|I got this on Blu-ray because i thought the video quality of the standard DVD was horrible. The older James Bond movies on the Ultimate Edition version has video that was almost HD in quality.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is definitely an upgrade for the picture quality, but is by no far as good as other blu-ray or HD-dvd's out there.<br /><br />The movie was \\"ok\\". I dont like what they have done with the franchise, but i will still watch the new bond movies. I still like the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies over Casiono Royale.<br /><br />Casino Royale only had 2  good sequences. The one in Africa and the other at the airport. The rest is watching them play cards in the casino.<br /><br />Anyway... its entertaining.
B000002BPS|3.0|After blowing the doors off so much of the opposition with their incisive Smash album Offspring hit the racks with this '97 offering to the strains of a big budget in terms of promotion. Yet the band sound quite unchanged by their success to their credit and while the production of Dave Jerden, who also did the later Americana album, is qutie smooth and nice it doesn't sound overly lush - I mean this isn't an '07 power metal album from Germany!<br /><br />The album kicks off with an amusing appeal-to-the-teenagers spoken word intro track that sets the musical and intellectual tone of the album and as such is one of the best intro tracks I've heard. The album then gets cracking with track after track of hard rock infused/infected with pop punk sensibilities and time signatures and much of the album comprises songs with very bouncy delivery to ensure that as few people as possible realise they're listening to a hard rock band (a dirty word/phrase circa `97).<br /><br />Ixnay on the Hombre is highly successful in fleshing out further the Offspring sound, the band utlising the album to give themselves more options when it came time to choose the set list on their ever increasing headlining tours. My personal favourites here would be Mota which really does scoot along to a sort of stop start rhythm and .... Well that's perhaps my only really favourite tune here. Much of this album just didn't resonate with me and it just came across as something you'd only really love if you really loved the band. If you just thought there were some great numbers on Smash and so bought their next album you'd probably not be thrilled with this as the numbers aren't as biting, the introspection isn't so spot on and tends to sound a bit try hard. That could be a wrong read on my part but this album seems very middling despite the fact you can feel the energy bristling out of the tunes, which is why I've given an album with so little connectivity to it's audience three stars anyway, just to reward the obvious effort that went into creating it.ious effort that went into creating it.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Parks' debut combines the chugga chugga style of fat chord riffing prevalent in post grunge hard rock to a semi industrial feel provided by the screaming of one of their two vocalists backed up by scratches (DJ style that is) provided by Joseph Hahn.<br /><br />The album is spearheaded by a number of hit singles and other very strong songs interspersed through the albums running time and that means the listener is regularly hearing great stuff, this album is a good example of how to pace a record. Starting off with a very typical Linkin song in Papercut which is hypnotic in it's semi industrial feel the album then segues into One Step Closer which is one of the best raucous numbers on the disc. Following accepted hard rock tradition the third track is a slower number but here the introspection has a different feel due to the muscular nature of the bands music overall on this release.<br /><br />And so the album continues, great hard rockers with slightly different feels to each other such as Crawling and Pushing Me Away laced with some more angst ridden self awareness like the downright depressing In The End.<br /><br />Production values are good, as this album could of felt somewhat claustrophobic without clarity in the mix and the lyrics are included in the booklet - as is the T-shirt ready band logo. Seriously, someone at the record company had some faith in this mob and this debut given how professional the project feels from top to bottom.<br /><br />A good hard rocker of an album if your in the mood for something different, that being scratches and dual vocalists being used to deliver the emotional content rather than the more traditional heavy metal band delivery.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Four stars for this album that continues the Linkin Park story in much the same vein as the debut. An interesting mixture of traditional post grunge hard rock married to the use of two vocalists of very different styles - one more traditional and the other more an abrasive screamer. The hard rock aspect isn't anything too special truth to be told, most of the late 90's and 00's hard rock contains this style of chugga chugga riffing to create the soft dynamic of the verse as opposed to the fuller wall of sound for the chorus. The melody is mainly supplied by the vocals and the musical variation of this band, two vocalists aside, are the scratches as per what rap DJ's started doing back in the 80's. Believe me, I was there and it wasn't pretty! But with Linkin Park this side to their sound is actually interesting because they are doing it within the hard rock/heavy metal universe where such touches are rare. And it has to be said that the scratching does give the band an industrial edge particularly when Mr Screaming Vocalist cuts loose with his sandpaper screech.<br /><br />As to specific tunes that I feel are indicative of this album that would have to include Lying From You and Breaking The Habit - the latter very much having the longing introspective feel of some of the highlights of the debut such as With You and In The End. And it's this introspection that gives the album the legs to get into four star territory. Sure, it's very much a product of 90's era misery guts music but it does give Linkin Park a greater pallete with which to work.<br /><br />What also gives this a healthy four stars is the enhanced CD section of which the main aspect is a feature called The Art of Meteora. Which is interesting even for someone such as myself who finds the acceptance of spraypaint designs as art a bit dubious. At least it shows the band at play, so to speak, rather than trying to convince us all what serious artistic genius types they are. The other special features are just web toolkit kind of stuff which probably you'll only use once - I mean how often are we all gonna visit the Linkin Park website...<br /><br />A good album, not excellent but it certainly proved that their somewhat different formuala could work for more than just one album and the healty sales figures proved that there was a market for it too.t kind of stuff which probably you'll only use once - I mean how often are we all gonna visit the Linkin Park website...

B000FTWB7G|3.0|Having picked up this album within a couple of days of it's release it has taken me this long to get around to reviewing it. Which isn't a good sign admittedly. After the release of Origin and the explosion with their more `proper' debut Fallen this band certainly built one heck of a vehicle for world domination. 14 million copies and counting is impressive by anybodys standards and I felt compelled to give it no less than five stars... So after getting a live album out of their systems the reconvenced and rebuilt Evanescence certainly had a lot to prove in terms of their ability to follow up the huge success of Fallen.<br /><br />And on the strength of this release it would seem that they both did and didn't achieve it. This album is thirteen tracks of music that is recognisably from the same band that produced the world dominating Fallen. However a number of changes have occurred and one is an alteration of guitarist which has meant that the band are effectively running a bit short in the grunt department. No offence to Terry Balsamo who was Amy Lees' main songwriting partner on this album but his riffs are less insistent, less biting. And the situation is that the production does not help matters as it appears more dense, like your listening to the album with the stereo in the next room. That's about the best way I can think of to describe it.<br /><br />Having said that the claustrophobic feel to the production certainly suits the effect Amy Lee is aiming at in many of these songs as she delves deeper into her miasma of depressive subject matter. As Classic Rocks stated in the last line of their review of this album `lighten up woman!'. Yet it is this very feel that leads to track three, Weight of the World, being so effective. And certainly the albums opener Sweet Sacrifice could almost of been on the earlier Fallen as it rides an excellent vocal melody. And as the album wears on the band show themselves willing to take chances with slower paced structures and more frequent use of piano based passages, something which gave the band more opportunity for changing up and down the gears when I saw them on the tour for this album.<br /><br />Other highlights of this album are the way it all feels like it fits together. Sure, as stated above the band plays around with some different time signatures and heaviness levels but it all seems to fit which speaks of a single minded focus tying it all together. Some studio trickery on tracks like Lose Control show the band more in control in the studio environment and that augers well for the future.<br /><br />Lowlights would comprise the single minded unhappiness of the album. For a band that seemed so fresh and empowering, admittedly with a somewhat similar lyrical bent, on their first album they somehow sound flat here. Melodies are often strained or totally unmemorable which leaves one struggling to pick out great songs whereas on Fallen it seemed everything had that midas touch.<br /><br />Evanescence have here succeeded in extending their muse somewhat and have built a more dank and difficult listen. Also the lyrics - which everyone knew would be scrutinised to the nth degree in light of the interpersonal issues striking the band - are kept pretty generalist to my mind with the exception of lead single Call Me When Your Sober. The band have not been able to reproduce the vitality of Fallen however nor have they been able to master the huge recording budget thrown their way by making the production values work for them. A must for fans but the casual listener should approach this with caution.use of piano based passages, something which gave the band more opportunity for changing up and down the gears when I saw them on the tour for this album.

0802136834|5.0|What I liked most about this book is also what since distresses me most about films circulating on this topic. Weir so thoroughly researches the profusion of biographic material available (besides Britain, courts throughout Europe had documention on the wives of Henry and him) that it is clear there is no need to fictionalise this fascinating story (you wouldn't even try to imagine it). And although it lends itself so well to a series (or a film) once you have read this book the inaccuracies in (Gregory's, for example) fictionalisions on the screen tend to get annoying. Wonderful book -the story is historic and timeless at the same time. (If you can recommend a good, unembellished biographic DVD, please do.)

B000X9PNOG|5.0|This DVD was released very quietly; if I hadn't seen an HDNet showing of it on cable, I'd have never known it existed. I've been a fan forever, so it's not hard to sell me on Meat Loaf.  He's a man who polarizes people though - you either love him or hate him; there's no middle-crowd.  That said, I think this is the DVD that is capable of the widest appeal to date.    Meat Loaf's voice was destroyed years ago by his own reckless overuse and abuse.  I've seen concerts where you'd swear somebody took a mixmaster down his throat and shredded his vocal cords.  You just have to know that you're not going to get a vocally pristine performance from the man these days.  That said, 3 Bats Live offers Meat in quite strong vocal form.  Not perfect by any stretch, but what's important about Meat Loaf isn't that he hits the notes like Celine Dion, it's that he is more invested in singing them to his audience than any other performer in the business today.  He gives 100% into every single performance and really makes you believe that rock, sex, and having a good time are the only important things in the universe.  His connection to and appreciation for his audience is absolutely genuine and one has to respect that he pushes himself on stage right to the bleeding edge and beyond.    The tracklist is quite good covering all the high points of the 3 Bat albums with a few covers tossed in for good measure (the Stones' \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" being the highlight).  \\"Blind As A Bat\\" comes off as the album's shining moment for me; I thought it was an astounding performance of a great song.  The joy of things is that there aren't any skip-over songs... Meat makes everything interesting.    The cinematography is astoundingly good.  The picture is crisp and reflective of the HD mastering that was used.  The colours are intense and the camerawork is first-rate.  The greatest part of the DVD (and the part that sets this concert apart and above the Melbourne DVD) is the DTS audio mix which is phenomenal.  This is a disc that you can pop in to show off your 5.1 system.  The Melbourne concert was a profound disappointment in terms of the surround mix and that mistake has been dramatically fixed here.    If you're looking for a concert of perfect, flawless vocals sung by pretty young things that don't have a clue what they're singing about then this is not the disc for you.  If you want to see one of the great rock performers of all time put in an ridiculously intense 2-and-a-half hours of recklessly-abandoned pure rock and roll in a beautifully mastered concert, then add this in to your collection.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I had some reservations about this film before venturing to see it at the cinema. The rating, PG-13, was lower than the R the first movie had which brought a degree of trepidation about the content being watered down. As well as that I wondered if it would indeed be possible to achieve the degree of excellence which the first film had met.<br /><br />Having watched this film again several times on DVD I believe that although the current film has not achieved the same degree of oppulent excellence as the first it has come pretty close. It is clear that the lower rating is intended to attract a wider audience and the naughtiness which abounded in the first film is still there in the second although not so obvious.<br /><br />Both films display a degree of enlightenment of how to perceive the past. Others have characterised the Elizabeth films as mere historical dramas and romances and to a degree those perceptions are correct insofar as the settings go. However, this is, to me at least, a superficial interpretation but other perspectives have greater strength.<br /><br />Growing up in England, I was exposed to wonderful television programmes and films which depicted a historical portrayal of merrie olde Englande which was very historically inaccurate. I used to believe that the grimy industrial England portrayed by Dickens amongst others was an inferior time of high infant mortality, short live spans and very Hobbesian in nature. Until, that is, I discovered that Dickens was paid by the word and to keep his readers interested he portrayed the country in such a way that they would crave for more. Simialrly, closer examination of merrie olde Englande showed that it was not very merry at all.<br /><br />In conjunction with that, history of human sexuality was largely began from Victorian times with their sense of prudishness and repression and it has been falsely claimed that much of current life was non-existant before so-called modern times.<br /><br />Viewed from these perspectives both fims shed a different light on events of Elizabethan times. Elizabeth is not a single strong woman, she is a survivor against men who resent her grip on power. She was, like Margaret Thatcher, the strongest \\"man\\" of her time. Similarly the record of the times showed that although there were certain societal rules which needed to be followed, they were often broken but unless they were discovered and exposed they continued. Feints within feints as Frank Herbert would write in Dune.<br /><br />What I love about these films, aside from their radical perspective on past events and the personalities of the time, is their focus on intrigue and plots. The machinations of the Catholic Church as exemplified by Philip of Spain in the battle to prevent the supremacy of the Anglican church from occuring, the jockeying for power utilising religion as a front, the godfather ruthlessness of the time and indeed the correlation with the penultimate scenes of that movie, all within times which were supposedly much simpler than our own.<br /><br />Ultimately though Elizabeth is human, a woman, a woman of strength who subborns her own needs and desires to those of her country. Elizabeth the consumate politician. Is this a story of Elizabeth I or the current monarch residing on the throne of the United KIngdom? Sometimes one wonders, not least in the role of the closest of her advisers.<br /><br />There is much for thought and entertainment in this film.

There is much for thought and entertainment in this film. Blanchett's performance is stunning once more and Clive Owen has come a long way since his Chancer days. All in all this is an excellent film and will be judged as such in the longer term.
B00005JPSM|2.0|I absolutely loved \\"Mostly Martha\\" and therefore was a bit sceptical about a remake to begin with - unfortunately this version didn't even come close. It has none of the warmth of the original. And it totally lacked the intriguing dialog and relationship between niece and aunt. Although I liked all actors in other movies - here they just failed.

I read this book at least a couple hundred times; well, repeated it because after a few readings you have it well memorized.  The book lends itself to your reading it with inflection and even whispering.  A terrific gift for all new parents or grandparents.

0061251305|5.0|After hearing a presentation on the concepts of Tribal Leadership, I immediately saw the clear connection to most business models and the relative ease of implementation. At my company, we motivate our teams by leveraging shared values to build cohesive relationships.  Tribal Leadership has given my executives a true systematic approach to raising the performance potential of their teams.  It brought instant calibration to our assessment efforts and took the guess work out of selecting tactics to move individuals forward to a state of mind where they are performing well, focusing on team results and obtaining more satisfaction from the workplace.  \\"We're Great!\\"  I highly recommend!!

0786838655|4.0|Shocking news, someone stole Zeus's master bolt, and Percy Jackson is the person who gets the blame. Now, Percy has only ten days to get the master bolt from the real thief otherwise he will be severly punished by Zeus. On Percy's quest, he finds some new friends, enemys, and shocking truths about his family. I really enjoyed this book because there are alot of fight scenes and discoveries that always change how you read the book. I liked the the conflict the most because it's really cool to see how Percy gets the bolt back and how they used unusual ways to accomplish their quest.    Most of the conflicts in the book revolve around the stolen master bolt. Along his quest, he meets his friend Grover, half goat and have person, and his friend Anabeth who looks like a normal person, but she is actually half-blood. The farther Percy gets into finding the real thief, the closer he is to finding out where his father is, who abandoned him when he was a baby, and more shocking truths about him. I liked this part because he figures it out as he is going through his quest.    But Percy has to do more on his quest to find the thief.  He also must solve the riddle of the oracle, which warns him that one of his friends is going to betray him and also that there is a power that is more greater than the gods. So now Persues Jackson must find the bolt, and solve the mysteries of the oracle in just ten days.
0765357151|4.0|I Am Legend is a great quick read that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's coming next. This is a collection of short stories, and I enjoyed I Am Legend better than the others included. This is a great imaginative twist building on vampire stories of the past. It has a much darker outlook than the movie. I think Hollywood decided it couldn't leave their audience hanging without hope. I preferred the original story to the movie, but enjoyed both.<br /><br />The influence that Richard Matheson had on Stephen King is apparent.

B00007FOMP|5.0|Marvin Gaye-What's Going On *****<br /><br />It is beyond the comprehension of my mind why for the sake of me that Motown didn't want to release What's Going On. Not only did it go on to be Marvin Gaye best selling album, and one of the best selling of Motown in general, it spawned three monster hit singles, The title track, 'Mercy Mercy Me', and 'Inner City Blues.' But more then that What's Going On has gone on to be acclaimed as one of the very best albums of all time, appearing on just about every best of list you can think of.<br /><br />Originaly released in 1971 What's Going On is the master, Marvin Gayes greatest achievement. Yes, his early hit singles were fantastic and have themselves gone on to become classics, and readio staples, and yes whats going on and all the sexual music to follow is perfect for that sort of thing but none of it can hold a candle to this album. This is his most important. The Orchesral arrangements made by David Van DePitte make give this record character and layering. Marvins vocals are insindeary. You can tell that he really feels what he is singing, and you can hear his heart breaking on this record as cliche as it sounds, it's true. That may be in some small part due to the fact that Marvin helped wrote every track on the album.<br /><br />Opening with the classic title track, 'Whats Going On' which is a plea, much as the entire album is starts things off nicely, I wont go into to much detail of the song because it's all been said. 'What's Happening Brother' is in the same vein as the title track but with lyrics a bit less personal. 'Save The Children' is the best example of the brilliance of the production on this album, which Gaye also lent a hand in. See he layered the vocals on all the songs many times and in several ways, even using backing vocals and choirs for texture. 'God Is Love' is a plea to live and let God. To let him take care of things, and live the way he wants us to and take care of the world he built for us. However your religious beliefs maybe the song does not come across pretentious, self-rightious, nor preachy, just simply as a man at his whits end asking us to help each other up instead of breaking us down. While seaguing straight into 'Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)' another one of the major hit singles on th elabum we find Marvin bringing to our attention the state of the Earth and how little we take care of it and how much we destroy it. 'Right On' aside from the underlining message has one killer groove. The original album closes with what I concider to be the strongest and best song that Marvin Gaye ever recorded, 'Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler).' Still get chills all over my body when I hear this song. Breathtaking isn't the right word just the first that comes to mind. Would have sat perfectly well in the hands of a punk band at the end of the 1970's the way the lyrics are written which is wht I feel makes the song most enduring is that the lyrics really are written for everyone. A perfect end to and amazing album.<br /><br />Depending on the version of What's Going On that you purches it may come with two bonus tracks. They are the B-sides to the original singles. 'God Is Love' is just a alternate version of the album version but really worth owning for true fans. 'Sad Tomorrows' is just a great song that was left off the album but would have fit right into place had it been left.<br /><br />Inspired by the return of his brother from Veitnam, Marvin Gaye wrote one of the greatest, most personal, and important albums of all time. The album plays like one continues song seageing into the next one with ease and coming to a close with 'Inner City Blues' which much like a well written essay ends as it began wrapping everything up again in one beautiful bow, and thats what, What's Going On is a world of horrid, horrid situations wrapped in a wonderful melody and voice.beliefs maybe the song does not come across pretentious, self-rightious, nor preachy, just simply as a man at his whits end asking us to help each other up instead of breaking us down.

B00009V7T2|4.0|The Mars Volta-De-loused In The Comatorium ****1/2<br /><br />De-Loused In The Comatorium was the start to something outragious, something over the top, something amazing, something called The Mars Volta. Rising from the ashes of the great post hardcore punk band At The Drive-In, The Mars Volta is a band all to themselves. A cross between Santana, Radiohead, The Replacements, and Frank Zappa's Mothers Of Invention. What a cross bread, but they manage to make it work somehow. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez is this generations Frank Zappa, Carlos Santana, Bob Stinson, and Johnny Greenwood all in one. Almost everything is written and arranged by him. With as vital as he is to The Mars Volta his vision wouldn't able to come across without his amazing backing band, and especially with out the great Cedric, the front man for Volta, and maybe the most powerful performer since James Brown.<br /><br />This is unlike the rest of the bands albums, Frances The Mute, and Amputechture because it is less instrumental and more rock n' roll. The bands latter albums would feature less vocals, and the vocals it did feature were prodominatly in Spanish, which is another amazing quality about the band. Mixing English and Spanish lyrics gives the album and even cooler feel and more interesting texture. 'Eriatarka' and 'This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed' are the albums two strongest tracks, complete with great use of delay and effects to inhance the sound of the songs, but not over done, and with great time signature changes to keep the extended length of the songs as not an issue. Many of the songs are longer then six minutes in length which can for some listeners be boring, and I too must admit at times that can get old, but the Mars Volta does this wonderfuly never letting the song dull for a single second. 'Televators' is reminicent of Radiohead, the feel, lyrics, music and all are very Radiohead friendly. I would love to see those two bands share a tour, they are both very simular in that they continue to push the envelope and grow.<br /><br />As a whole The Mars Volta is a band for those who are excited about something new and different instead of the same old clear channel radio. More experimental, and progressive without losing their rock and punk roots make this one band to at least give a chance. De-loused In The Comatorium was a great start and a real sign of what was to come from one of todays best and most exciting bands.sh the envelope and grow.

0765316889|5.0|Is Evil always evil?  Or is Evil only evil depending on your viewpoint?  That's one of the central themes in Brandon Sanderson's entertaining sequel to Mistborn.<br /><br />Once \\"Well of Ascension\\" gets over its sluggish beginning, the book moves along like one of the earlier entries in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.  The pacing and characterizations are done well, there is plenty of political 'House of Games' intrigue, and some of the absolute best action sequences you'll find in the genre.<br /><br />The book would have benefitted from more sizzle between Vin and Elend (who seem more like brother/sister than lovers); I understand that in this genre there shouldn't be too much sizzle, but just some sizzle would have been effective.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000MXPE74|4.0|The Fratellis-Costello Music **** 1/2<br /><br />Costello Music couldn't be a more perfect title for The Fratellis 2007 album. To sum up this review in one sentence it is the album Elvis Costello and The Attractions would have made after This Years Model had they not had a complete artistic epiphany. Fresh on the coattails of Britains best band to come along in years, Arctic Monkeys, The Fratellis followed their formula of nice changly guitars with Costello inspired rythms and lyrics with a Oasis sincibility, and boy did it work. Many are calling them the best band to come along in years, a title that all the other before mentioned bands were given in their time.<br /><br />'Henrietta' starts off the album at full speed setting the tone for the ride to come. 'Flathead' is next. Used in the classic IPOD commercials where the siloute of the girls dance. A great song, very new wave meets british invasion. Think 'One Thing Leads To Another' with 'Happy Together' by The Turtles. 'Chelsea Dagger' is perhaps the most Costello sounding track of them all. It would have easily fit on his This Years Model album. Great lyrical imagry and attitude. The driving back beat makes the track kick. 'Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night' and 'Vince The Loveable Stoner' are slower but none the less powerful or great. 'Whistle For The Choir' is the stand out track on the album simply because it sounds nothing like any of the other songs on the album. More mellow then the rest, and fantasticaly written lyricaly and melody wise, the song is like and m&m, as cheesey as it sounds it's melt in your mouth good. But don't be fooled by the abundance of ballads this albums has some searious rock n' roll like 'The Gutterati?' the guitar heavy 'For The Girl' which spons the fantastic line \\"she was into the stones/ when I was into the roses,\\" and the killer 'Baby Fratelli.' This album truly has something for everyone.<br /><br />Costello Music is an album of amazing songs from start to finish complete with driving rock beats, poetic lyrics, and the Beatle-esq pop feel. All fans of rock, in any form will find something here that they like. This is a great album thru and thru as Keith Richards would say.ats, poetic lyrics, and the Beatle-esq pop feel.

B000XRG9IW|2.0|Wow, I don't think i've ever been so under-whelmed, annoyed and bored all at the same time.     It's like flamboyant 70's prog rock turned into slow, plodding, cliche, bad heavy metal.  I couldn't get through the whole CD.    They do not remind me at all of classic Sabbath, what an insult.  It sounds like \\"Helmet\\" meets \\"Yes,\\" and the result is...fairly lame.    I can't believe they earned a Rolling Stone spot recently.    I just can't get behind this, sorry.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Magic gives me the same sort of feeling that Nebraska, The River, Born To Run and Born In the USA did. Great pop songs and Bruce's voice is back, and the songs themselves are as good as what he wrote back then, it's that good.    There isn't a bad or hum-drum track on Magic, and while it's a bit over-produced and lacking some production fine tuning, as if it was polished up for corporate radio and high end sound systems, the songs still carry it.  This is no Tunnel Of Love.
B000ZK4466|5.0|The year and a half wait is over and the Mars Volta has finally unleashed its fourth LP, the Bedlam in Goliath.  The question that begs to be asked is, was it worth the wait?      Although it isn't their best record, the Mars Volta have not sounded this tight since their debut LP.  The Bedlam in Goliath has been proclaimed a concept album but is really a display for the group of reinvigorated artists to play music for music's sake.      At first glance, the addition of drummer Thomas Pridgen and the continual maturation of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez as a producer are largely responsible for the album's success.      Omar produced and mixed this album in a very flattering way for new drummer Thomas Pridgen.  Prigden takes front and center stage here.  Omar did the group's third LP a huge disservice by mixing down Jon Theodore's drumming.  Thankfully, he did not make the same mistake again.      I can not say enough about Pridgen's ability.  Words will not do him justice, he is that good. He must be heard on Bedlam to be believed and when combined with the rest of the Mars Volta, comprises an unrivaled juggernaut in music today.      Rodriguez-Lopez has channeled his Miles Davis/John McLaughlin inspired solo work for this record.  Along with Bixler-Zavala's vocals and Pridgen's drumming, Rodriguez-Lopez's guitar dominates this record.      It is great to hear the technical strides Omar has made in his playing since Frances the Mute.  Amputechture only gave us a taste of his development.  On Bedlam, Omar combines his trademark frenzied playing with jaw-dropping riffs to near perfection.      Thankfully he has cut down on the noodling between Amputechture and Bedlam as much as he cut down on the aimless ambiance between Frances and Amputehcture.      The influence of John Frusciante's pop sensibilities on Omar's guitar playing can not be overstated.  Once again Frusciante guest stars on many of Bedlam's tracks but he is not the primary guitarist featured.  Rodriguez-Lopez recently stated that when you hear two guitar solos being played, Frusciante is playing one of them.   It is a friendship and musical collaboration I hope continues for many years.         It is worth noting that this album needs to be heard on a set of great headphones in order to be fully appreciated.  Doing so reveals the unsung but integral contribution of sound manipulator, Pablo Hinojos-Gonzalez.      With headphones and a silent dark room, the soundscapes crafted by Hinojos just might prove to be too intense for the listener to wrap their mind around.      For example, play Metatron the way I have recommended and be prepared to get blown away by intricacies you just can't hear with a car or home stereo.  This is what the Mars Volta is all about.    I do have one complaint:  Keyboardist Ikey Owens is more or less absent on this album.      Although they might superficially channel other recording artists, the Mars Volta have once again proven they sound like nothing else and nothing else sounds like them.  Any attempt by critics to refute this by saying they ape bands like King Crimson or Roxy Music is just name-checking, hispter rubbish.  I doubt the failed novelists and college english major dropouts over at Pitchfork have even listened to a King Crimson album all the way through.  After all, when do they get the time to pull themselves away from their Feist and Devendra Banhart records?    The Mars Volta are their own genre.      Bedlam is a one star album for people who hate this group.  For the Mars Volta faithful: 4 and a half stars.    Highlights include everything but Tourniquet Man.  Tracks that are two of the best the Volta ever recorded: Ouroborous and Conjugal Burns.      Bring on the 5th LP.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I can't get over how good this DVD is.  Great sound, nice color picture, legends galore in their prime or just a tad past or before it, and of course it's all tied together and revolves around Cash's songs and commentary.    Completely non-pretentious, everything's mic'd up separately and live (no digital enhancements or huge mixing boards).  It takes place in a famous theatre that looks like more like a southern evangelical church.    I guess the best part is watching legends of rock, country and blues in their primes, or in their youth, make brief appearances and managing to blow away the crowd.    Everything else has been said here for the most part, it's just something you can truly appreciate and enjoy, even if you aren't the biggest Cash or country fan, but love the roots of country, rock or the blues.    One minute Dylan's strumming his guitar with Johnny in front of the fire place, the next has Jerry Lewis kicking his piano bench off the stage during one if his mid-song fits, Bill Monroe belting out his classic bluegrass, a clean cut Hank Jr. showing off his beautiful country voice, or Neil Young eliciting a standing ovation, and it goes on and on like this...just amazing footage, and reminds me of what TV used to be like in the 70's, with our 4 channels.    A must have!

B000OVLBGC|5.0|I had heard that \\"The Lives of Others\\" was an excellent movie but, then, someone once told me the same thing about \\"Porkie's\\".  The plot sounded impressive and I got all that and more.  This is a movie about the paranoia of totalitarianism (in the form of East Germany) and the lessons to learn from taking our freedom for granted is reason enough to see this film.  However, there is a greater message (cinematicly speaking of course.  After all, what's greater than the US Constitution?).  The message that I took away was the ability of one man to make a difference even in the worst of conditions.  While we focus on the spying, eavesdropping, and intimidation by the State, one man finds the courage to question the purpose of what he's doing.  It doesn't change everything but it changes somethings and that, to me, is the real point of \\"The Lives of Others\\".  I could elaborate at length on this but I'll keep it short.  The ending works into one of the greatest personal messages I've ever seen delivered and it took me totally by surprize.    I'm as guilty as most reviewers are in giving out \\"5 Star\\" ratings.  I try to save them for movies and books that I thing are truly outstanding.  In doing so, there are rare occassions that I wish I could award \\"6 Stars\\" for those few works of art that exceed the mantle of \\"Great\\".  \\"The Lives of Others\\" would be one of the few recipients upon which I would bestow such a rating.
630398021X|4.0|I liked this movie because it moved quickly and Ralph Fiennes was excellent in his portrayal.    However, I've never seen such intentionally vulgar, full body displays (in an \\"R\\" rated movie) of a Rape in progress--which cinematically delights in the graphic humiliation of a woman; And which accepts as normal a somewhat gritty city.        Moral dignity is not a theme in this movie.  Fast action, wonderful camera work, and decent acting by all other supporting cast members is.    I feel dirty after watching this movie and believe viewers should be so advised.
B000Q7ZHVE|5.0|This is an outstanding album! It was a huge hit in 1972, spent five weeks at number 1 on the album charts, and went PLATINUM in the days when few albums did. While some of the lyrics may be trite (most of the songs were written while they were teenagers) the music is GREAT! If you love acoustic guitars, this album is a must. It includes their first number 1 hit single, Horse With No Name and another big hit I Need You. Several other songs received significant airplay on stations including Three Roses, Sandman, and Never Found The Time. The only weak song on the album is Pigeon Song. Highly recommended if you like acoustic guitar music!<br /><br />While this is a great album, this release of it is kind of expensive and you can find other CD's of this album for less.
B000I0QLZU|2.0|I won't bore you with my views on Tomb Raider the film.  Chances are if you are here researching this to buy, you've already fully formed your own opinion on this.  Why people feel the need to post lenghty movie reviews here I'll never understnd.  But here is something that you might find useful to know:  the blu-ray edition is a real mess.  This happened to be the first film that I put into my new blue-ray player to view on my new 1080p tv and I was shocked.  The film is shockingly grainy.  I could see all kinds of grain and noise and garbage in the picture through much of the movie.  It looked like a really poorly made standard def movie.  I started playing with my player and tv thinking surely I must have not set the right options on it or something.  Either that or my equipment must be horribly defective in some way.  It wasn't until I tried a couple other blu-ray disks that I realized what a poor transfer this disk is.<br /><br />If you are a big Tomb Raider fan, you still might enjoy watching this (after all, we've all gotten used to standard-def equipment over the years).  But if you are looking for a film to showcase your fancy blu-ray player and tv and get that \\"theater-like\\" experience, then definitely avoid getting this disk.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|Though I have always liked Johnny Cash, the recent movie about him sparked my reinterest in him. The DVD of his shows brings back many happy memories, not only of him, but of the guests on his shows.
B000M341QE|1.0|We found this movie boring and confusing. It was difficult to tell who was what and frankly my dear I did not give a damn.  The best part was the end when everybody got shot. It would have been a better movie if those scenes had taken place in the begining and I didn't have to watch the rest of it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I loved watching this. You know the songs - the music is great. But what makes it come alive is that the cameras and editing catch the right action at the right time. For example, when one of the band members breaks into a solo or even a short riff, you are right there, watching their faces or their fingers. Good job, all around.
B00004Y87O|5.0|There's many reasons to like John Carpenter's Escape From New York, but I particularly enjoyed watching Donald Pleasance playing the tough-as-nails president. Kurt Russel does a great Clint Eastwood parody throughout, and makes \\"Snake\\" jump off the screen. The only flaw with this film is that they set the future in the not-to-distant decade of the 1990's. Perhaps New York needed a few more years before it became the maximum security prison for the entire United States. At any rate, once you get past this minor distraction, you'll find yourself immersed in a race against time, where Snake must rescue the country's top man from a band of crazed lunatics. Watching the film since 9/11 also brings into focus some other interesting aspects. This is one of the few films that uses the World Trade Center as central location. And the whole notion of terrorists flying a plane into a building--well, it almost serves as a prophetic warning of things to come. It just goes to show, in the realm of science fiction, anything is possible.

0316010669|5.0|I've loved reading Malcolm Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker for years. Standouts include \\"Clicks and Mortar\\" about internet shopping and \\"Big and Bad\\" about SUVs. In his usual fashion, BLINK draws from a broad range of sources and studies to help us understand the world we live in and our own role within it. I suggest you buy this book and keep it on your nightstand. Read it little by little and allow the chapters to sink in slowly. If you're like me, you'll be amazed at what you begin to observe in your daily life. Gladwell's gift is not so much inventing new ideas, but rather in putting ideas together and allowing us to see what was there all along.
B000J4QWNQ|2.0|Boring film.<br /><br />What's cool about it? Some boats and planes and cars a fancy condo. A couple decent gory \\"deals gone wrong\\" shots.<br /><br />What not cool about it? Everything else! This film (at two hours and twenty minutes) just spends too much time trying too hard to be \\"cool\\". Gratuitous sex scenes...club scenes...back and forth with the \\"I don't trust them\\" dialog. So much boring dialog. So much of nothing. They may as well have put their bathroom breaks in there too. It's just too much.<br /><br />The HD DVD presentation isn't too impressive either. I don't know if it was how it looks on film too or just on this transfer, but the picture is very unexciting. I've only read about the bonus features, which sound cool from what I've read, but I never count those myself.<br /><br />I just can't recommend this film. If it were an hour and a half maybe. It just doesn't move fast enough. Total snooze.
B0001I55SS|4.0|This going to sound like I am being sarcastic but I am not.     I got a copy of the VHS tape of this movie when I was in Med school in 1982 and any time I could not get to sleep I would put this on and I would shortly drift off.    Having seen this when I was young and optimistic may have a good part to do with why I am fond of this movie. In truth the story is silly and the acting resembles that of a poorly done high school play. Everything from the wise cracking VINCENT Robot to the dumb \\"Scientific ESP\\" angle is almost too painful to watch.   But there is \\"something\\" about this movie.     This is one of those movies that has many bad aspects ( acting, script, and story) but the bad parts all fit together to make something that is better than the sum of its parts. Sort of like a dog that is so ugly it's cute. The old Batman TV show was the same way, it was so bad it was good. This movie fits together the same way.     All that being said, the cinematography is excellent ( I did not say special effects) and the soundtrack blends well the images on the screen.    Like 2001, it is a nice quiet movie that is very relaxing and will put any insomniac to sleep.     Maybe it is only because it evokes a time when I was much younger but I admit I like this movie. And it is a better than using sleeping pills.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|sergio leones the good, the bad and the ugly is not just one of the greatest westerns of all time, its one of the greatest films ever made. its definately one of my favorite films and for running 3 hours long it never gets boring. TGTBATU is about 3 gunslingers who embark on an epic search for a fortune in hidden gold. that simple plot makes for an amazing film that features many memorable scenes, interesting characters and great music that since first watching the movie i havent been able to stop humming. this film is near flawless and is one of few films that i have no bad comments about. this is simply an amazing film that you must see at least once in you life. this dvd release is very nice. the extras are interesting and the packaging is very cool. i especialy liked the poster reproductions. stylish, influential, exciting, funny, epric. a true masterpeice of cinema. if you havent seen it buy it right now!
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Like many , I've been introduced to these guys through the timbaland collaboration. I'm not a timbaland fan and frankly wish he'd disappear, he seems to crop up everywhere these days. No artist is safe!    But, I loved Apologise and decided to give these guys a go when I listened to a few samples of their music. I love it. It's the sort of soft-rock music that Coldplay, Keane, Embrace offer.   The lyrics are great, really thoughtful and sincere. The music is great too. They really deliver the goods. I'm glad I gave them a go, this album is worth picking up for Coldplay fans like myself awaiting some new material. If you liked Coldplays x and y then I think you'll like this. The sound of the album reminds me of that album for some reason.    Stand outs are the original version of Apologise (though the timbaland mix is tagged on to the end of the album) , All Fall Down, Say (All I Need)- my personal favourite, Stop and Stare, and Goodbye Apathy.     Something tells me that these guys will go largely unnoticed which is  a shame.  I hope they do get out and promote this in Europe, if a lot more people heard what they can do minus timbaland then I think they would be received well.

Having said that ...  the content  is good. But the author and publisher  must look into constructing it   way better than it is now.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is that rare Hollywood production, a fine work of art.  Ostensibly an ordinary comedy with a fantastical angle, the film is actually a felicitous combination of morality play and comedy.  And it accomplishes that delicate balancing act between humor and pathos.  It's laugh-out-loud funny.  Besides, the technical mastery of continuity and timing that keeps the viewer interested through the obligatory repetition required for the theme of a man caught in a time loop, the story examines the ways and means we can play out our lives.  Given enough time and trouble, we can choose one or a succession of methods with which to deal with such a predicament: disbelief, panic, realization, despair, opportunism, futility, self-awareness, and growth.  The hero passes through all of these.  The movie is a profound lesson on life without a sermon, with wit and humor, with only glimpses of melodrama, and most of all with the gift of hope.  Despite the misery of this world, with a constant and continual effort to improve we can find the secret of existence, meaningful love, and the truth about ourselves.  Unappreciated after its release, later seen as a sleeper, this minor masterpiece will in time become more widely appreciated and eventually an esteemed treasure.
B000001DYY|4.0|It's still TFF but without Curt there.  Something's just seems a little bit off not enough to knock this CD too much.  As the writing is still as strong as ever and the vocals on various tracks are what keep me interested in Elemental...really enjoyed the last track \\"Goodnight Song\\" more than most of the others.  But they are pretty good in there own right.  Nice one.

B00005JPUN|3.0|jack Arnold's 50s B Sci gem is and always be the definitive version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, The dismal Donald Southerland remake was long and tedious. Now we have Nichole Kidman in a faster paced (and that is the only strong point of this movie) and this time around it is more high tech. A space shuttle crashes to earth bringing a deadly virus that instead of replicating humans, invades their DNA and turns them into the previous \\"pod people\\" incarnations. The sudden flash and pan of reactions truly hurts this movie and leaves it without an emotional center as she searches for her son whom may be immune to this virus transmitted this go around through body fluids.<br /><br />Veronica Cartwright who played a strong supporting role in the remake is very good in the cameo and is able to convey more emotion in her short screen time than Kidman who dominates this tale.<br /><br />Again, if it wasn't for the faster pace (which made the original so enjoyable--along with the unique premise at that time), this movie would just be another inadequate remake.<br /><br />I am not endorsing it. Again, never fix something that isn't broken. Hollywood is running low on ideas, they are crafting big budget comic book movies, remakes of TV sitcoms (Kidman was seen in the movie version of \\"Betwitched\\") or tamping with classic movies.<br /><br />The movie does boast some special features--which isn't say a great deal, they are pretty standard for the newer films.<br /><br />Worth a watch through a rental, but definitely not worth buying.
B001394S1E|4.0|This movie is a must see.  Richard Scott is great as Pitt, the guy, who can't quite seem to know what to do.  But he manages to stand up to the bad guys and even though he ends up killing them, you can tell that he didn't want to.
B0011HOEYY|5.0|No need to say more about this film other than it is as good as could be expected from the teaming of Denzel, Crowe and Ridley Scott. Be aware though of the high level of truly repulsive violence in it, no matter how much it is an integral part of the story. I noticed people literally jumping out of their seats at the theater I saw it in, funny thing is, when a single animal is killed in the movie they decided not to show it on camera, I guess movie goers are a lot more offended by the killing of animals than that of people in films.  With the possible exception of \\"A Good Year\\" which wasn't that bad but wasn't great eiter, it seems like Russell Crowe hasn't made anything but great, great films in the past 10 years, starting with LA Confidential and up to this one. He has to be the biggest sure thing in Hollywood these days.
0765318741|4.0|Stephen King calls it one of his influences, and critics have labeled \\"I Am Legend\\" as one of the top-ten all-time vampire novels. With the recent interest stirred by the movie, I gave in and decided to give the book a shot--with favorable, though mixed, reactions.<br /><br />The story is masterfully told. Set in Los Angeles, as opposed to the film's New York City, the first-person narrative is at times claustrophobic, lucid, surreal, and achingly human in the midst of tragedy. Robert Neville is a brilliant creation, a perfect vessel for Matheson's exploration of traditional vampire myths in a world of reason and science. Even as Neville tries to survive after the loss of his wife and daughter, he finds himself committed to finding a solution, a cure if  you will.<br /><br />I read the entire story in one sitting, with a page count of under 170 pages. The pacing is perfect. The character development is credible and insightful. The muted comments on society are thought-provoking. Matheson's prose is tight and full of active verbs that make this stripped-down story surprisingly vivid. In conclusion, he adds a touch of bittersweet irony found more often in the tales of Ray Bradbury than vampire novelists.<br /><br />While the story is masterful, it did not move me emotionally or intellectually. It seems a bit distant, supremely logical, even cold, in comparison to the newer breed of vampire novels that sometimes wink and nod while giving us chills. Nevertheless, \\"I Am Legend\\" deserves the praise and attention it has received. In its time, it was clearly a landmark in the evolution of the genre.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I play this movie in my Sony S500 Blu-ray player and my Bravia 52\\" XBR4 and is amazing the video quality. It pops out the screen. No grainy picture and the sound is great too.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|You could call Vampire Weekend the Minutemen of the 21st century. Though singer/guitarist Ezra Koenig is more likely to greet you with a cheery wave than a punch in the shoulder the way the late D. Boon might have, both bands' defining characteristic is their propensity to overlay leftfield genres onto a solid foundation of user-friendly punk. By now it's no secret that Vampire Weekend's modus operandi is to hybridize African pop music and college rock, thanks to pre-release blogger buzz that rivaled that of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, as well as the band's own accounts to the press. In a recent interview with National Public Radio, Koenig explained that all of them had been taken with African music at some point in their lives, and described a love affair with an obscure Madagascan compilation CD from the 1980s that set the whole project in motion.<br /><br />Say what you will about a bunch of white Columbia University graduates tapping a relatively destitute region for inspiration, but you can't be an aspiring artist in New York City without spending some time exploring the world around you. The Afro-pop influence is what lends the guitars and synthesizers their sunny, sprightly tone, splashing color onto an otherwise monochromatic canvas. To most American ears, however, Vampire Weekend will sound like nothing more than well-written indie pop with bits of punk, caffeinated electro-pop and surf rock thrown in. You never get the sense from Vampire Weekend that the band members are overwhelmed by their own concept, and all of the world music gobbledygook that bloggers have used to describe it ultimately obscures the fact that it's a fabulous party record: uptempo, uncomplicated, and disarmingly catchy.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason why Vampire Weekend doesn't sound prototypically \\"African\\" is because of the drumming. Chris Tomson's jaunty rhythms keep everything firmly grounded in the Western rock tradition while the rest of the musicians try more cross-cultural things, and they provide a handful of songs with their brightest moments. On their first single, \\"Mansard Roof,\\" Tomson stamps out a beat that's halfway between a march and a shuffle and sped up to 160 bpm, while 8-bit electronics and synthesized strings run to catch up and Koenig sings what sounds like an optimistic version of Green Day's \\"Basket Case.\\" You don't just bounce to \\"Mansard Roof\\"--it bounces you, and when it's over after two minutes you're hitting the repeat button like a rat trying to score another food pellet.<br /><br />\\"A-Punk\\" gets even quicker with a rhythm section straight out of Rocket to Russia and surf-rock guitars that recall Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello dancing on the set of Beach Party. Indeed, there's a strong vintage streak running through this record, from the Buddy Hollyesque pianos on \\"Walcott\\" to the cheeky `70s post-punk of \\"One (Blake's Got a New Face),\\" though the band pulls off the neat and not unimpressive hat trick of sounding only like itself. \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" (also the name of the musical style they're said to have created) comes closest to the traditional Afro-pop they were ostensibly reaching for, with Tomson playing the djembe and Koenig singing in high vocal trills, but it's followed by \\"Campus,\\" a silly little love song anchored by a bass chord progression that mirrors the one in the Minutemen's \\"Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Truth,\\" and we're back in familiar Vampire Weekend territory: low-maintenance and extremely habitable.<br /><br />The only song that doesn't ring true is the closer, \\"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance,\\" a waterlogged British reggae number whose myriad missteps highlight what Vampire Weekend does right nearly everywhere else. Pulling from disparate musical sources and throwing them into the salad bowl is part and parcel of Vampire Weekend's methodology, but this one sounds too derivative, capturing The Police at one of their more lugubrious moments. Koenig's reggae vocals are uncertain where they once seemed pliant and confident, and instruments don't mesh but exist loosely atop each other, unaware of the others' existence. The track's melody, title, and cautionary metaphors are all downers; it's like ending a party with a warning about getting mugged on the way home. By contrast, some of the band's best songs are about absolutely nothing. The entire subject of \\"One (Blake's Got a New Face)\\" is that Blake, whoever he may be, has a new face. And the opening line of \\"Oxford Comma\\" isn't at all what you'd expect from a group of good Columbia boys who assumedly aced all of their classes: \\"Who gives a f*** about an Oxford comma?\\"<br /><br />In fact, there's something quite telling about that line, in that it may shed light on who Vampire Weekend is and their approach to making music. Not that they ever intended to hide anything. Of course Koenig and company know what an Oxford comma is, just like they know what a mansard roof is and what kwassa kwassa is--pieces of information you have to study in school or, you know, seek out on your own. Yet there's nothing particularly sedulous about Vampire Weekend, nothing so self-consciously academic as to appear like a footnote in a music history exegesis. Even the most potentially encyclopedic moment on the record--\\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\"--sounds as though it was played on a college lawn to sun-impregnated students without a care in the world. On their debut, the young men of Vampire Weekend come off like well-traveled but still curious explorers, excited about the possibilities about where their chosen path might lead, and capable of using the resources under their belts to get there. Scoff all you want at their Ivy League pedigree; Vampire Weekend is one of the best examples I can think of to demonstrate education's true (and often obscured) purpose of personal enrichment, and lucky us, we get to reap the benefits.t and confident, and instruments don't mesh but exist loosely atop each other, unaware of the others' existence.

0152048049|5.0|I  can't heap enough praises on this little book on big themes of the most touching universal kind and a French literary masterpiece of all time.  Le petit prince written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and first published in 1943, is a bittersweet fable of a young prince who leaves his tiny planet to explore the universe and yet in fact tells of the dark side of life, love and loneliness, pain and suffering, death and parting, think Camus, Sartre and existentialism.  That's why there is always the impulse to sob everytime the book is read.  It's not just a children's book but a must-read and must-own for all on serious philosophical subjects and life's lessons through the eyes of the innocents with most delightful drawings. Join the wisdom and charm of the little prince's rose-and-star-filled world. You simply can't resist this beautiful 60th Anniversary collector's edition of The Little Prince, the timeless thought-provoking French literary masterpiece in the latest translation presented in gold stamping and embossing enhanced hardcover and slipcase with a satin bookmark!

B00007LTIA|4.0|Fresh off the success of the previous blockbuster, 'Close to the Edge' (1972), Yes returned the following year with 'Tales From Topographic Oceans' (which I will refer to as 'Tales' from now on).  Greatly attracted to and inspired by some Schastic scripture, Yes lead singer and lyricist Jon Anderson decided to embark upon an extremely ambitious project.  Enthusiastic about the possibilities of this was band mate (guitarist) Steve Howe who, in the company of Anderson, would spend long, candlelit evenings writing out the music.  Notably absent from these sessions was the continually-estranged (keyboardist) Rick Wakeman, who saw this project as the epitome of \\"pretentious\\" and \\"overwrought\\".  Regardless, the band soldiered on, creating a double concept album.    The lineup had changed slightly since the previous album.  Stating that he felt that the band could never do better than 'Close to the Edge', former drummer Bill Bruford defected to King Crimson.  His replacement was Alan White, a friend and fan of the band for some time.  The other members, however, remained together as such: Jon Anderson (vocals), Steve Howe (guitar), Chris Squire (bass), and Rick Wakeman (keyboards).    But what about 'Tales'?  It is perhaps the single most polarizing album ever put out by Yes, or perhaps even in progressive rock in general.  There are people who swear by this album, and just as many it seems who absolutely hate it.  As I said in the title, few are truly indifferent.  First of all, it's *long*.  While there are only four tracks, each exceeds twenty minutes in length.  Second of all, it's esoteric, even by Yes standards.  'Tales' is a dense and enigmatic work to say the least.  Musically, it's long-winded and often through-composed.  There are elements of repetitive reinforcement, but for the most part each track is an isolated affair.  Instrumentally, while the usual suspects are featured (Mellotron, Hammond organ, et al), they are used in a variety of unique manners.  Oftentimes, the music has a \\"tribal\\" or \\"primitive\\" cast.  I'll admit this is annoying at times, particularly because of all the progressive rock bands, Yes retained the most of the typical 60's \\"let's all hold hands and love one another\\" tripe.  It is ironic, then, that Anderson's attempts at \\"holistic\\" music that brings people together instead created one of the most marked rifts between fans of the genre at any time in the decade.    As mentioned above, Wakeman made no secret how much he detested this album.  During one live performance, he famously ate curry while playing the keyboard parts one-handed until he was forced to commission the other hand for solos.  While Anderson and Howe set up elaborate, pastoral studio sets that would not have looked out of place at a Gabriel-era Genesis concert, Wakeman pretty much twiddled his thumbs and sulked.  Paradoxically, I would have to say he did some of his best keyboard work for this album, even though he often complains about his lack of input.  The Mellotron in particular was used masterfully, in a showing almost equal to something Tony Banks of Genesis might have done.  Obviously, though, it wasn't enough because Wakeman took a hiatus from the band after this album.    I'll spare you the usual track-by-track review, as words really fail me on this album.  You'll just have to hear it and decide from there whether you like it.  If you really like Mellotron and Moog, you will likely find enjoyment in this album simply from that perspective.  It is really a wonderful study in keyboard work, even if Rick Wakeman doesn't think so.  Also, I would have to say that I much prefer Alan White's work on this album to that on the following 'Relayer' release in 1974.  The drumming on 'Tales' has a much more immediate atmosphere than that on 'Relayer', which seems a bit recessed and laid back.  Watch out, though; Alan White differs from Bill Bruford with drum fills that *just don't quite work*.  The first of these is right after the driving Moog bass note at timecode 3:28 in \\"The Revealing Science of God\\".  Of course this is just my humble opinion, and after hearing the whole thing a few times it sounds less jarring and even deliberate, but the first few times I heard it I just couldn't shake the impression that this was a mistake.  Please don't get me wrong; Alan White is an excellent drummer.  I just don't personally like his work as much as that of Bill Bruford.    Jon Anderson's vocals are impeccable as usual, and the layered harmonies thereof can truly inspire chills.  The playing by the rest of the band is no less excellent; after all, it *is* Yes we're talking about here.  Even the production, though it sounds a little rougher here than for the previous two albums, contributes to an atmosphere of sonic perfection.  The climaxes of the first two tracks are some of the most powerful music Yes has ever released, particularly Wakeman's fantastic Moog solo in \\"Revealing Science\\" and the glorious layered vocals at the end of \\"The Remembering\\".  I must say that I don't care for the final two tracks nearly so much as I like the first two, but to each his own, I suppose.  At the end of the day, I regret that I could not offer a particularly unique perspective on this album.  It's certainly good (on the strength of the first two tracks), but I would not consider it one of the band's best works.  'Close To The Edge', 'Relayer', and 'Fragile' would all rate above it in my opinion, with 'The Yes Album' nipping closely at the heels of 'Tales'.  As with 'Relayer', this is purely a fans' album; listeners new to the band should try 'The Yes Album', 'Fragile', and 'Close To The Edge' (and in that order) before they even consider 'Tales'.  As I noted in my 'Relayer' review, I'm not trying to sound like a condescending prog snob.  I just want to save prospective buyers some time and money.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This is a disappointment. No, I am not a \\"snob\\".  Why on earth did they not change Sally Hawkin's hair to make it softer and more appealing as time moves forward in the film?  Anne Elliott is supposed to have a \\"second spring of youth and beauty\\".  Sally Hawkin's is youthful but she never achieved a modicum of loveliness, there was no change in her look from beginning to end.  As other reviewers have noted, her sister Elizabeth is supposed to be very pretty also. With the great costuming and sets, why not complete the picture Jane Austen painted and have the characters look the part?
0743486285|3.0|As a huge fan of all things autobiographical, I will say that this book has bits and pieces that are incredibly interesting.... the problem is finding those treasures.     I could not help but feel that a lot of the \\"diary entries\\" in this book were contrived while the book was being written. It was as if Nikki Sixx found his diary, read through the pages and recounted stories that went above and beyond what someone would truly write in their personal diary.     Funny that it just so happened that those \\"celebrities\\" who gave legal waivers to allow the use of their names in the book are the only ones who happened to show up in the book - no \\"name withheld\\" type of information ever appears.     Funny that a diary entry would end with \\"doing massive amounts of cocaine but want to be up at 7am\\" and the next was \\"10:30 am - I'm late, everyone's mad, guess I'll do more drugs to cope with it\\" - but still had time to make an entry?     I am not doubting Sixx's addiction and feel that he definitely had some demons to battle throughout his career - I just feel that he, like so many other rock star authors (ahem Slash) may be on the road to recovery, but still wants to recount the lifestyle that almost killed them because they STILL want a taste of it.     I realize that heroin was the love of Sixx's life during the year this book was taken from, but for that to be the ONLY thing mentioned in the diary besides the name dropping of semi-famous women, seems odd to me.
B0002F6AH0|3.0|I very much regret A&E Home Video chose to do an extremely amateurish job of producing [[ASIN:B0002F6AH0 The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)]].  Laurence Olivier's fine narration is barely audible during the initial ten or twelve seconds of many episodes, a situation which could and should have been corrected by A&E Home Video; and at the end of every episode the viewer of this product is instantaneously clobbered with a way-too-loud blast of recently-included advertising, something A&E Home Video could and should have moderated.<br /><br />This brilliant television series deserved better.  Thankfully, excellence of material far outweighs those errors A&E Home Video committed in producing the boxed set; but they are none the less aggravations which distract the viewer and hence detract from this release's expected quality.<br /><br />My rating of three stars is the best compromise I could think of, between the one-star rating A&E Home Video deserves and the five-star rating I'd give the television series itself.

The molds have, of course, been re-tooled, but the kit mainly remains unchanged.<br /><br />Revell continues its rendition in an oddball 1/28 scale, with good points and warts intact.

The only fix is cut-and-fit with plastic card stock, then putty and file-and-sand.  .<br /><br />Parts fit is precise; surface detailing is delicate.  On the negative side are wrongly-shaded red plastic parts; prominent ejector pin marks on wing struts and wheels; crude, rudimentary moldings mar the radial engine, twin Spandaus, and cockpit detail; the landing gear struts are still too spindly for adequate support.<br /><br />The decal sheet has been updated.  The late-war German crosses are depicted, rather than the more familiar Maltese crosses.  The cockpit interior consists of a bucket seat, instrument panel, and control stick -<br />all in all, quite spartan.  A skilled modeler could simulate the metal tubing structure and add more detailed instruments, and a map case.<br /><br />This new generation kit comes with three nicely detailed figures, two ground crew and a standing pilot.  The old kit had only a seated pilot.<br />Too bad Revell didn't upgrade the molds for Spandaus and Oberursel UR II radial.<br /><br />The only tricky operation is mounting the top wing.  The fuselage-based cabane struts must be precisely aligned, or else - getting the top wing locator pins to fit all the cabane and interplane struts can be a real frustration.  The model is large enough to invite wire interplane and control cable rigging.<br /><br />You will be quite pleased with the finished model, as the dreidekker is a standout design in any scale.  As for that spindly landing gear:  within two years as a display model, the struts warped.  The only solution was to scratch-build a wire foundation for basswood struts.<br /><br />The drei that I first built in 1959 is now accompanied with the re-issued kit bought last year.  The 1959-built model is unmodified, and its front end cowling appear passably similar to the new model's modified front end.  Yes, a styrene model can last half a century, as long as it avoids direct sunlight exposure..

B0000C7PQK|1.0|I understand musicians want to break out of molds and try new sounds.  With Enigma's other newer cds, it took me awhile to warm up to them but then I did and I love them now. Even though they tried new sounds, they still had those little Enigma signature marks within some of the music.<br /><br />  This one I'm finding hard to warm up to.  Maybe eventually I will but I'm not feeling it at all.  They're going way, way off from any kind of sound that made Enigma, Enigma and it's really turning me off.  They use to have a mysterious quality to their music but now it's just  a regular band sound.  I think if it wasn't Enigma I might have liked it a  little better but since I was hoping for something that resembled the music I absolutely loved and could let go and fantasize with-I was really let down and unfortunately, I got something completely and utterly different and I am really disappointed.<br />They don't even fit into the genre of New Age music anymore.<br />It bites.<br />Oh well.<br />If you're not looking for Enigma's signature sounds, even remotely, then this may be alright for you.  If you are, forget it.  It's not happening. Enigma has died.
B000YABV90|4.0|This is a powerful film. When I saw the previews I didn't feel the need to rush to opening night, obviously, but I knew I'd see it eventually and that I'd probably like it. I expected a somewhat emotional string playing feel-good movie along the lines of a long line of those that have gone before it. The previews didn't do it justice.<br /><br />If you love music, if you love creativity, if you love against-all-odds feel good stories, you are going to want to see this film.<br /><br />The impossibility of the yeah-right plot actually works if you get pulled into the story. Imagine a scene from Hook with the Lost Boys, imagine Fievel gazing at the moon singing \\"Somewhere Out There\\" and Pinocchio's longing to be real, and his imprisonment, and you get a sense of Evan aka August Rush's journey to becoming found. Add Mr. Holland's Opus and you have an idea of the pulling together of events into a symphonic \\"no way, but if it could happen that would be so cool\\" finale. There is a some cheese and some serious emotional strumming going on, but because the film is full of longing, searching, and seeking, which is pretty much the human condition, I found August Rush to be soul-marking like all things beautiful and poignant. If you are moved by music and art, if stories of lost being found, and wrongs being righted, and the good guys getting a break, then August Rush is for you.<br /><br />Very little bleeping language, and sex is completely behind the scenes. Who says a film has to have sex and f-bombs to work? There is a bit of violence, a fight between brothers with thrown fists and some blood. A few scenes are scary because one particular character is emotionally unstable and throws a mean temper tantrum, so really sensitive kids may have an issue or two.<br /><br />The entire film is love honoring and respectful of humanity, beauty and the audience. God is treated with respect as is the church. I saw so many spiritual allegories that I quit counting so I could absorb the film. The only things that bugged my cynical self were too many blank faced closeups. And when the laws of reality make something not even close to possible, i.e. during a packed-out, standing-room-only concert, two characters walk parallel through a mass of people toward the front of a stage and can actually get through and unmolested at that.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a keeper.s that bugged my cynical self were too many blank faced closeups.

B00008MZ0N|4.0|Of course this movie was made with one thing in mind...bringing tricked out rides to the big screen and create illegal racing scenes for youth enjoyment.  Fast and the Furious does this well, and for most people, that seems to be where the excitement ends.  Seeing all three F&F films myself, the original is easily the strongest of the bunch - not so much for its cars and racing, but for overall production.  Although it is over-the top fantasy, I enjoyed the story and characters much more than the two sequals.<br /><br />The story is about a young cop named Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) who goes undercover in the street racing world of L.A. to discover who has been stealing shipments of electronics from big rigs on the highway.  All evidence leads to a group within the racing realm, whether it be the whites, asians, or hispanics.  Brian eventually works himself in with Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his group of race buddies.  The situation becomes complicated for Brian, constantly fighting with one of the guys, caught in the middle of the race gang wars, dating Dom's sister, and being suspected as a cop by Dom himself.  Eventually Brian is forced to choose to help his new race pals, or complete his mission by taking Dom in.<br /><br />The characters were actually pretty good for this type of film.  Vin Diesel steals the show with his magnetism and screen presence.  Though Brian was played out well by Paul Walker, there was never enough substance to make this main character shine.  Dom's buddies, girlfriend and sister were like a family (though crazy at times), but nevertheless kept me entertained for the most part.  The other gangs of racers, especially the rival asians, were fairly mencing and added quite a bit to the progression of the plot.<br /><br />The cars themselves were very nice.  There aren't any exotic cars here, except one small scene with a black Ferrari.  Most of what you see is typical tricked out rides, but the movie does do the job of letting us see inside the cars and under the hoods quite often at all the details.  Dom races Brian in a quick street race at the end of the movie in his pure \\"Detroit Muscle\\".<br /><br />The races are like the title suggests.  The movie wastes little time at getting the races going and showing off the rides.  There actually wasn't as much street racing as I had hoped for, and the best car action was actually a scene where Dom and the gang are attempting to rob a big rig on the desert highway.  The plan backfires, creating a decent climactic scene of suspense and action that keeps things intense and rolling till the movie's end.<br /><br />There is no doubt you will want The Fast and the Furious for car and race viewing pleasure.  Though the story and characters make this feel like a B-movie, I felt it was a very good B-movie, which easily feels more mature and solid than its two sequals.<br /><br />This particular dvd version also includes a 6 minute short film, picking up with Brian after this movie and setting things up for the next film in Miami.  There is no dialouge, just music to accompany the scenes.  It is nothing special, but for a little short film, its nice to view at least once to make the connection between this film and 2 Fast 2 Furious.<br /><br />Acting - 3.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4er the hoods quite often at all the details.

B0009IW98O|5.0|I've owned this release on vinyl for many years before getting it on disc and it is without a doubt my favorite Bob Seger album. Bob sings with absolute joy and soul. The band is tight and guitarist Michael \\"Monk\\" Bruce shines on tunes like \\"Turn On Your Lovelight\\" and \\"Love The One You're With.\\" His style is R&B with just a tinge of jazz and is reminiscent of early Steely Dan guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff Baxter. Skip Knape's Hammond organ puts down a driving groove on most tunes and Pam Todd and Crystal Jenkins' vocals help make the Stills cover more soulful than the original. If this disc doesn't make your feet tap, check for a pulse.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|2 Fast 2 Furious is your typical sequal.  The actions scenes and effects nearly double that of the original.  We have a returning character - Brian O Conner (Paul Walker), with the rest of the cast composed of fresh faces that don't carry the same charm from the firt film.  Then there is the story, script and dialouge - all felt thrown together with the excuse to produce a sequal so we can get another chance at more tricked out rides and races.  Unfortunately unlike its predacessor, all that leaves an impression in the end is the race action.<br /><br />The film begins right away with an explosive street race in Miami at night, which I found more enjoyable than the street race in the first F&F film.  In fact, this is one of the best action senes of the movie.  At the finish line, cops arrive soon after and take in Brian, who is already wanted for helping Torretto escape in the first film.  Brian's record can be wiped clean if he plays ball by going undercover and busting a big dealer in the area - Verone.  Brian requests that his old pal \\"Roman Pierce\\" (Tyrese) accompany him to complete the deal.  The pair go undercover, working for Verone, where another undercover (Eva Mendes) joins them.  The whole Miami-drug dealer plotline felt too cliche, so it added very little interest for me.  Verone was very boring as the villain and his men are laughably bad and uninteresting.  The script and dialouge only adds to the problem, making the film as a whole seem very juvenille and thrown together as compared to the first film.<br /><br />The races and cars are obviously the reason to watch this.  The first street race is probably the best, but there are numerous other races and cop chases on the highways throughout the film too.  The driving felt faster and more intense this time around.  Unlike the first film, we do not nearly get to see into these vehicles as much and what makes them tick (except the gps units the cops installed to watch both Brian and Rome).  The two cars that they are given to drive in are nice, but like the owners of the two muscle cars in the film say, kinda look like \\"cracker jack toys\\".  They just didn't have as strong appeal as the rides in the first film either.  The bonus this time around was the muscle cars.  There are several race and chase scenes involving these beautiful machines.  So if you are into American muscle, there is definelty more of that this time around.<br /><br />This is an ok sequal, pretty average as far as sequals go.  If you loved the first for the cars and races, you should be satisfied with 2F2F.  However, the rest of the movie doesn't carry much else to even the load.<br /><br />This dvd (just like the Fast and the Furious Tricked Out Edition) contains a 6 minute short film of Brian's journey from L.A. to Miami, which sets up the beginning of this film.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 3<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 3.5iven to drive in are nice, but like the owners of the two muscle cars in the film say, kinda look like \\"cracker jack toys\\".

B000EGEVZK|5.0|This is an incredible historical document.  Please stop whining about the quality of some clips on this DVD.  You are witnessing what very few people outside of NYC experienced in the mid 70's being able to watch some of the earliest footage of the Ramones.  Some of the other clips are hilarious, e.g., lip synching Rock & Roll High School on the Sha Na Na show; what looks like a woman standing to the side of the stage at one of the college shows trying to (get this) do sign language interpreting of the lyrics.  If you are interested in the history of R&R this DVD is priceless.
B000ZK4466|2.0|As much as i LOVE TMV, i can't help but think that this album sounds rushed, as if they were on a deadline to finish the album. Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs on here, like \\"Goliath\\" which is a remake of \\"Rapid Fire Tollbooth\\". Then There is \\"Wax Simulacra\\" and \\"Cavalettas\\" which are the other few i enjoyed. Most of the other songs just sound too cheesey for me to soak in. This album is no Amputecture or De-loused. I'm also sorry to say that i won't be reccomending this to anyone. :(

0452289963|5.0|There is a lot of deep information in this book that needs to digested and understood.  Eckhart Tolle does not belong to any organized religion.  His beliefs are common sense.  Many people will find value in this book as a result.  The idea of living in the now and finding peace in the present moment is not a revolutionary concept.  However, it is a very important thing to remember, because the present is the only reality a person can control.  It is also important to remember not to be resistant, judgmental or attached to material things, but this is very difficult for everyone to do.  Having an awareness of how our personal actions affect others and an awareness of the environment are two main themes in the book.<br /><br />  The chapter on pain bodies is very interesting.  I truly believe that people carry negative emotional baggage that affects them throughout life.  Tolle's discussion of the ego is thought provoking too.  I never thought an individual's ego could be the source of so many bad things like greed, violence, and jealousy, but there is a lot of truth to the power of the ego.<br /><br />I found a lot of personal value in this book.  I think the most important lesson I learned is to embrace uncertainity in life, because it can leave the door open to many possibilities.  I think another important lesson is to just focus on the task at hand and not be so worried about time.  The New World is a guide for anyone who feels hurried or stressed out in life.  The New World is an excellent read.
0439813786|5.0|After reading Selznik's comments about Hugo Cabret I totally agree that he has written a page turner that is extremely difficult to put down.  This book has defined a whole new era of children's books.  The pictures were part of the story themselves.  They did not explain what was written on the page, but they became the story.  Truly an inspirational book.  Kudos to Selznik!

B000026E2S|5.0|just a fantastic album through and through.  they've always had a great guitar sound, but on this, their final album (as the chameleons that is), they had improved their songwriting skills enough to match their great sound.  some insightful and touching music here.  skip any best of collections or their earlier albums if you're only going to get one by them, and get this one!  this review refers to the collector's version that includes the bones 6 songs that were originally packaged with the vinyl.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I bought this tape in its first version VHS  when it first came out in 1996.  Amazingly is still one of the best rutines ever! is timeless!  I upgrated to DVD  long time ago that makes more easy to choose segments if you want to divide your rutines or do it along with other tapes (as I do)  It's been 12 years and even the music is still modern.  Kudos to Raju (the trainer who made the rutine)
158270208X|5.0|When I read other reviews, I was thinking for the money, really, I'll just get a journal.  But one reviewer wrote that it was worth it for the tips she gives, the words of advice and thought provoking ideas, make it worth it.  IT IS!!  Not only is it a beautiful piece, very thick and hard cover, embossed in different ways and with \\"The Secret\\" logo also.  It closes on the right side with very heavy magnetic attraction.  The pages are a joy to write on.  You will not be disappointed.  I find myself using everyday which is what you need to do.  It works, you will be amazed.  This is worth the investment ten times over.  Do yourself a favor and buy this journal.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|There are a lot of things I love about this movie. I love the dialogue about the zombies including \\"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\" I love all the gore scenes; like toward the end there is an awesome gore scene where the zombies are ripping some guy apart and showing his guts. It even has the classic look of the 70's! Not long after the original, the zombies are still coming back to life and feeding on the flesh of the living. A group of friends named Stephen, Peter, Roger, and Francine leave Philadelphia in a helicopter and see that the epidemic is worldwide. They soon take refuge in a huge mall and make themselves at home. Soon, more zombies get inside the mall and they must fight for their lives. I highly recommend DAWN OF THE DEAD!!!
B00000117E|5.0|My only regret is that I did not buy this album when it first came out (I would have been ~ 14).   I rank this with Jimi's \\"Band of Gypsys\\".  It is a timeless classic that gets better with age....and better and better and better.  This type of passion is so rare, and watching him play drives home just how special he was (get the DVD!!).  Any one of \\"Million Miles Away, Walk on Hot Coals, I Wonder Who, or Who's That Comin'\\" would have made this a great album.  The fact that they are all on one CD is stunning.   I simply cannot get enough of this masterpiece.  Snag the DVD for an extra treat...having the visuals makes the music even more alive.  In the words of Donal...God Bless Rory.
B000001ESP|3.0|I find it fitting how the title of the last song on MOVING PICTURES is called \\"Vital Signs\\"...<br /><br />MOVING PICTURES is hailed as the RUSH masterpiece, by far this group's most commercially succesful record. What was hinted on PERMANENT WAVES comes to full fruition on pix, with the ultra commercial \\"RaDiO HiTz\\" poping up fullblown for the rock station DJ. Now, I am not disdaining \\"Pictures\\", but one cannot help but foresee the \\"signs\\" of impending doom when listening to this. This is the last time in the band's career where they played any form of good ol' hard rock music, at least on the first side. PERMANENT WAVES was *mostly* HARD ROCK, with just a sprinkle of commercial radio fluff mixed in. PICTURES however, is split between the line, a mixed bag of salvageable tunes, atleast two \\"classics\\" and some forgetable stuff. After this, the TaNk-O-RifFs would be forever exhasted.<br /><br />Side 1 has the best stuff here.<br /><br />1) Tom Sawyer. The heaviest thing here. It's big and it's commercial, it's banal with those droning synths, but it does manage to rock out, even for a pop song.<br /><br />2) Red Barchetta. A mini-epic, harkens back to the good ol' days. Best song on the album.<br /><br />3) YYZ. Dumb... I don't get why people praise this track vehemetly. Sure, the instrumental work is impressive, but where the h%ll is the song?<br /><br />4) Limelight. Another decent rocker. Again, it's nothing like Anthem or Bastile Day mind you, but it still resembles the beloved Rush of old.<br /><br />Side 2<br /><br />5) The Camera Eye. This is one of the worst pieces of $ h ! T put on record.<br /><br />6) Witch Hunt. An unremarkable tune. I suspect it was simply made to fill space on the album.<br /><br />7) Vital Signs. This song is almost a joke, a sad joke. This is the exact moment where RUSH's heart splits in half. Here the band becomes a Police cover band (yes, this does sound like a Police b-side tune!), Alex Lifeson even going as far as knicking Andy Summers trademark reggatta tones. This is desparation from a once great band, trying to survive in a new decade completey alien to this band.<br /><br />Rush has now crossed corporate rock territory here, along the lines of Styx, Kansas, Foreinger and Journey. They is very few traces of the early hard rock Rush left now, The band wants to become the next in line on the corporate stadium rock genre, and it now shows. Heavy Rotation pop-rockers like TOM SAWYER and LIMELIGHT, lots of cheesie keyboards and synthisizers and definate castration of Neil's lyrical content, with songs about fast cars and being rock stars.<br /><br />This record is not $ h ! t, it is more like the smell of $ h ! t before it would physically hit the fan on the next record.

1594489505|5.0|What reader can ask for more than to be dropped into another world, a world so complete that its characters and even an alien culture become absolutely real.  After accomplishing this with The Kite Runner, Hosseini, amazingly, has done it again with Splendid Suns.     Set in Afghanistan during the last 20 or so years (years that saw the Soviet occupation, the civil war that followed the Soviets' departure, the rise of the Taliban, and the overthrow of the Taliban), Splendid Suns is the story of two Afghan women, Mariam and Laila, born some 20 years apart.   Of entirely different backgrounds, they nonetheless find themselves thrust together when the brute Rasheed takes 14-year-old Laila as his second wife and moves her into the violent, airless home he occupies with Mariam.    I approached this book with trepidation, fearing what I had heard of its violence and bleakness.  To my surprise, I found that the theme woven throughout the pages was love.   Through the characters, it becomes clear that love withheld or love perverted and twisted can be a crippling, malevolent force.  Likewise, for a person who loves or allows himself to be loved or even learns to love, love can be salvation itself.  This certainly plays out in the characters' lives.  Could the same also be true for a society, a religion, a culture?  It will take a smarter head than mine to answer those questions.  But one can always hope.    I find Splendid Suns the best kind of fiction--well written, informative, enlightening.  I am a better person for having read it.
0553804677|5.0|It's not every day that you get introduced to a new author's work and you get wowed.     This is a book that _will_ wow you.      It's technically a fantasy novel.  It's not really fair - there is almost no \\"fantasy cliche\\" elements in it.  What I mean to say is - there are no elves, wizards, typical storylines, etc.  Hey, I like that stuff.  But I also like it when an author can come up with something fresh.  That's what you get here - a new author with a fresh take.    The story is set in a medieval world.  No surprises there.  But it's NOT a carbon copy of other worlds previously done.  Furthermore, the main character is not a prince; he's a criminal!  Yes, the hero is a thief, part of a ring of lovable criminals.  Well developed, they all speak with their own voice, have their own motivations.  By the end of the novel, you know them so well you can anticipate what they'd think, how they'd react, what they'd do.  This is a very well written book.    The story is a good one - it's the beginning of a saga centered around Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen.  Two friends and conspirators, up against the world.  They are strong and intelligent, and ambitious.  Their larger than life jobs catch the wrong kind of attention, though -- too successful for their own good, and now they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.  How will they get out of it?      The pace of this novel is so exciting that you might stay up all night to find out.  I loved this book.  Fortunately, I purchased it a while before getting to it -- so the next one was soon to come out.  You have it even better - the second book IS out.  Pick 'em both up!    Highly recommended.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|It is shocking that this film was so ignored by the Academy Awards in 1961.  How could Henry Mancini win for \\"Breakfast at Tiffanys\\" over Miklos Rozsa's flawless score for \\"El Cid?  Yes, there were some great movies that year, but how did \\"Flower Drum Song\\" get more nominations than \\"El Cid?\\" Well, with that said, it is thrilling to finally have this masterwork on DVD beautifully produced and packaged! My only petty complaint is the Intermission music should be on Disk 2 to lead into the second part of the film, not at the end of Disk 1.
B000HIVIOW|1.0|I am a BIG fan of The Snowman. I am, however, disappointed that Amazon has chosen to advertise this particular DVD release as containing the David Bowie introduction, (can be seen on youtube, if you wish to see what I'm referring to...), etc. Bowie is nowhere to be seen on this DVD. When I brought this fact to the attention of Amazon support, (asking them if maybe I had just ordered the wrong version, and if so WAS there a version with Bowie included?), they simply offered to take back the disc, and give me a refund. Fair enough, I suppose, but I really wanted a copy of The Snowman, so I kept what I had.     Unfortunately, I see that Amazon is still advertising this DVD as including the Bowie material. Bowie has a history of being involved with children's music, etc. I have a green vinyl recording of Bowie narrating the orchestral piece \\"Peter and the Wolf\\", as well as \\"A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\\". And, of course, there's always the classic film, \\"The Labyrinth\\". It would have meant a lot to me to have been able to have a copy of \\"The Snowman\\" with Bowie's intro, and narration... too bad that Amazon continues to falsely advertise this DVD as containing the Bowie material. If you are a Bowie fan AND a Snowman fan, don't buy this disc...

(IT'S LIKE CORPSE BRIDE MEETS EDWARD SISSORHANDS)<br />JAMIE CAMPBELL BOWER (ANTHONY) HAS AN AMAZING VOICE ('JOHANNA'). THE SUPPORTING CAST IS PERFECTION. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.  EVEN ALL THE COCKROACHES WHO SACRIFCIED THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE PROUD!<br />SASHA BARON COHEN DESERVES AN OSCAR FOR HIS 15 MINUTES ON THE SCREEN.<br />BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY. I MEAN 'REALLY BEAUTIFUL'!  FANTASTIC ORCHESTRATIONS.  THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS AMAZING.  YOU CAN FEEL THE MOOD, ALMOST TASTE THE ROTTEN MEAT PIES AND SMELL THE STENCH OF THE SEWERS. THE LYRICS ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO CATCH ESPECIALLY WITH THE HEAVY COCKNEY ACCENTS SO SEE IT IN A THEATER WITH A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM.  THE ORCHESTRATIONS ARE EXCELLENT.  THE BLOOD IS EXCESSIVE (BUT I GUESS WHEN A THROAT IS SLASHED WITH A RAZOR, IT DOES GUSH A LOT OF BLOOD) AGAIN, ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  IT'S REALLY VERY STRANGE SUBJECT MATTER FOR A MUSICAL, BUT IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.<br />I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

075640407X|5.0|I really enjoy seeking out new authors, especially in the speculative fiction space.  So it's not difficult to convince me to try a new one.  This book got some early buzz - I remember seeing it on The Signed Page newsletter, and giving the synopsis a read-over.  It sounded interesting to me, as it might to you.  So I decided to order it along with a few others, hoping for the best.    If you're on the fence and/or unsure - this book is fantastic!  You will love it.  What's most important in a speculative fiction novel?  The story.  And, by proxy, the author's ability to be a storyteller.  In both aspects, Rothfuss shines.  His character Kvothe, and Kvothe's story, are characters you can sympathize with.  They're well developed and well written.  And the style of the story - Kvothe _being_ a storyteller, relaying his story to his captivated audience - is probably not as easy to write as it seems when reading it.  But it works!  The back and forth between story and \\"current time\\" is minimized and done well, which is a delicate balance that many authors utilizing this format don't always get right.    And the story is an excellent story!  I don't want to give too much away, but Kvothe is a lovable character who you can understand, root for, and cringe with.  His escapades keep you reading.. and reading.  You feel like you know the terrain, the towns, the people, the cliques, the enemies...    I've heard that Mr. Rothfuss had some personal tragedy in the past year, which will delay the next book.   I wish him and his family the best.  It's going to be difficult to wait until April 2009 for the next installment, but it will be worth the wait.    A very exciting new author, and a very, very good start to a great new series.  2007 was a great year for new speculative fiction authors.    Buy this book.  Highly recommended.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I borrowed the first season from one of my friends and once I started watching it I couldn't stop it. The characters are marvelous and the story itself is pretty intricate. I can see what the fuss was all about. The only problem is, now I'll spend a reasonable amount of money buying all the seasons availabe for myself.
B000005H3M|5.0|I'm not  a drummer (a Jazz guitarist actually) but Buddy Rich is one of my musical heroes. He is up there in my personal Olympo. He embodied what I believe music should be. Virtuosistic abilities, fun, attitude, adventureness, deep value, hard swing, melodic-harmonic-rhitmic richness, beautiful charts. Buddy Rich is up there to me in the history of good music, with Bird and all the best cats. In these days I am trying to buy everything I see from the man to own his full story (but he recorded a lot believe me!!). Going through the various periods I have to say that Buddy is always simply unreachable whatever he plays, but the best big band albums are to me some of the best music he recorded in his immense career. This one is fantastic. It swings hard from the beginning to the end, the chart are sublime, the program absolutly interesting 'till the last note, and the band tight and well rounded. And I don't want to say nothing about Buddy. BUDDY RICH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Believe me, if you want stellar Jazz that swings hard, if you want to have fun with a jazz record, and if you want to buy something really precious, something that you will treasure forever, buy this album. Thank you Buddy for all the fantastic emotions your music gives me. AND YOU DUDE, BUY, BUY, BUY THIS ALBUM.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|At long last, Batman is coming to Blu-Ray. It sure took Warner Bros. long enough, but hey, better late than never. Hopefully since they delayed this thing to be a tie in with The Dark Knight, they'll throw in some sweet extras to make up for lost time. As long as it has all the same goodies as the HD-DVD version, plus that awesome picture transfer, I'll be happy. But still, it's been a really long time coming, so I'd hope that they make this a \\"special edition\\" release to make up for lost time.
0375842209|5.0|This is an AMAZING book! I bought this for my 13 year old daughter, and read it myself when I ran out of my own books to read. This was such an original story, it was unforgettable, beautifully written, and heartbreaking. I am an avid reader, and this book is hands down one of the best I have ever read. It is marketed as 'young adult' but is as intelligent and complex as any book marketed to adult readers, and better than most.  Several of my friends and family members have borrowed the book and fell in love with it, lent it out to thier friends, who also loved it. Everyone who reads it counts it as a favorite - I would highly recommend this book to anyone!
159102594X|5.0|The Blade Itself was getting some buzz, and kept appearing in my recommendation bin.  It sounded interesting, so I decided to purchase it when I placed my next order.      I'm really glad I did.  Make no mistake - this is a fantasy novel.  It's got wizards (Magi), it's got Kings, idiot princes, held-back but capable commoners, it's got an old empire, a new empire, and an evil host challenging it.  Okay, so what?  What makes this new author so successful?    Because he can tell a great story.  One thing you'll note in my reviews is that while I do care very much about technical aspects - I'll always lean toward the quality of the story.     Like George R. R. Martin's novels in the Song of Ice and Fire series, Abercrombie tells the story chapter by chapter from different character points of view.  Some critiques of the novel complain that the feeling is too similar to Martin, and then try to match some of his characters up to Martin's.  Don't do that!  It's not fair to either author, and honestly, it's not valid.  Others have done the shifting point of view thing before Martin!  The fact that it conjures Martin shows that Abercrombie is successful at doing it.    What stuck out to me is that I found myself really pulling for certain characters (the likable torturer, Sand dan Glokta; the talented Major West; the honorable murderer Logen Ninefingers) and really disliking others (The royals and nobles, Arch Lector Sult, the dandy noble Jezal dan Luthar, etc).  The book doesn't include a map.  I usually like maps with fantasy novels.  But you don't even really need one for this story - Abercrombie describes the lands so well and the people within that you achieve immersion into this universe without it.  That's telling to me.    I was upset when this one ended.  I wanted more, immediately.  I have to admit to buying the UK edition straight away.  Now I need the third.  For such a young author, Abercrombie really understands how to tell a story, develop real people, and-- he really understands human nature.      An astonishingly good debut from a new talent in the business.    Highly recommended.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I saw the musical \\"Cats\\" on stage at the Civic Center many years ago. However I will definitely say the stage production I saw does not hold a candle to the DVD version of the musical.<br />The DVD production is simply extraordinary! With a talented cast led by Elaine Page, Sir John Mills and John Page this version of the musical stands on its own merit.I highly recommend this version for those who loved the original theatrical production, you will not be disappointed!
B00008RH8S|5.0|Delta's first album is still her best, in my opinion. The songs are fresh and original and her voice is simply superb. If you only buy one Delta CD, make it this one.    Mind you the others are good too, so if you like this one sample her others.
B000W4KT64|5.0|Tracy Turnblad wants nothing more than to appear on Baltimore's version of \\"American Bandstand\\".  She goes home from school every day and watches the show while she and her best friend dance to the songs.  Her quest for fame soon becomes a desire for fairness as she becomes an integral part in fighting for the rights of those who are different.  This movie has a terrific cast who sing and dance with a delightful energy and enthusiasm.  It is highly recommended viewing.
B000P12LWY|5.0|While not 100 percent  historically accurate The Tudors does a good job at telling what life was like in the court of Henry VIII played brilliantly by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.<br /><br />The story starts several years after Henry becomes King and goes through everything from the Field of Cloth and Gold, the various plots against the French and Spanish, the birth of Henry Fitzroy (the Kings illegitimate son) and much more.<br /><br />Most of the story centers on Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and his increasing love affair with Anne Boleyn and which led him to cast Catherine off and break with the Church of Rome to marry Anne.<br /><br />The cast is very good. And while it is not 100 percent accurate the acting, scenery, and costumes make up for it.
B00008RWB3|5.0|Imagine (if you will) an attempt to capture the whole of human experience in a semi-plausible all-too-near future North America.  Now imagine that the attempt works.  And it does a pretty good job of getting a good cross-section and eviscerating it (it is a cross-section, after all) in all of its banal humanity.<br /><br />The physical weight of this novel can be a bit intimidating.  Most folks don't feel this ambitious when it comes to their pleasure reading.  Which is too bad, really.  Because if you just take your time, you'll find yourself well-rewarded.<br /><br />But yeah, you've got to be prepared to take a joke.
B000LT2IHI|2.0|I bought this for my son for christmas.  It is a nice idea and looks very cute but has a lot of problems.  Most importantly is the balls don't easily fit in the mount you have to really push them in.  This is to hard for my 11 month old son to do.  Secondly, it only has one song which is anoying after a while(it also goes wee, and another noise when you get the ball through his mount).  Finally, sometimes the balls don't come out of him and you have to tilt the toy to get the m loose. He losses intrest in a few minutes. It does have a sturdy base which allowes for standing which is I think it's onl plus.  I would not recomend this toy.

0380713802|3.0|I really did laugh out loud at times. Bryson tells of travels in Europe both of recent times and flashbacks to a trip through Europe when he was younger. I especially enjoyed the parts on places of Europe that I have visited myself. I was a little disappointed there wasn't much time spent in Germany. In this book, Bryson seems to try and get laughs at the expense of people. I had to knock off a star for that.
0345444051|3.0|I like to think of this book as the anti-Independence Day.  Childhood's End is a pretty typical piece of Clarke fiction -- that doesn't make it bad just that you have a pretty good idea going into it of what you're going to get.  That said, I would venture to say that it's probably best served up to some mid-to-late-teens burgeoning sci-fi fans that are in need of a twist to the Asimov, Bova, and Pohl that they've likely been reading.
B00004XPPE|5.0|A \\"cold  war' chiller that still maintains one's attention today after 44 years.While a  brilliant, but truly eerie professor (Matthau) is holding center stage at a symposium, pontificating on the number of \\"acceptable losses\\" in a nuclear war, a computer malfunction sends an American bomber streaking towards Moscow. As scientists scurry to contact the jet,Fonda, doing a superb job as American President,effectively uses the \\"hot line\\",trying to buy time and to allay the fears of the Soviets. The plane is finally contacted, but the pilot has been specifically trained to disregard any orders from anyone once he has flown past his fail-safe point.Fonda then relays an impromptu plan to the Soviets  to avoid nuclear warfare. Stay tuned! I would assume that all age groups, once seated, will still find this film downright scary and absorbing.
0452289963|5.0|I read A New Earth right after it became available in bookstores.  I recommended it to my friends as a \\"must read.\\"  And now, this week, Oprah recommended the book to the world!  I was happy when she picked The Secret for a discussion on her show and I knew it would help raise the consciousness of everyone who read it.  But A New Earth has the power to totally transform the consciousness of mankind.  I've read the entire book - but the first and last chapters are so inspiring - I've read those chapters five times!  The first chapter is The Flowering Of Human Consciousness.  I think we are all ready for that to happen.  It really gives us hope for the future.  No matter what we DO....the only hope for positive change in the world is through a change in consciousness of mankind.  This book will help.....a lot!  Now, if Oprah can recommend the books by Dr. David R. Hawkins and Gary Renard sometime in the next few years - wow!  I can't even imagine what a wonderful future humanity will have!

0765348276|2.0|...I've seen it written in a few places that Scalzi follows in the Heinlein tradition of scifi.  The Heinlein that gave us Stranger in a Strange Land.  The Heinlein that gave us The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.  And the Heinlein that gave us Starship Troopers.  In full disclosure mode, I admit that I'm not terribly familiar with Heinlein's work.  I read a novel or two of his in high school before largely moving on to Gibson, Vonnegut, and other novelists that better resonated with me.  A lesson there?  Perhaps not....
B000ZK4466|5.0|i thoroughly enjoy this album. now, some specifics...    -thomas pridgin is an insanely good drummer. there are spots on the album where it might sound as if he's showboating and what not, but anyone that knows the volta knows that he's only playing what he's told. he hits harder than jon theodore, but doesn't quite have the finesse that jon has yet. of course, he's only 21.    -the lyrics are much more understandable than on any other album. there are some obscure lyrics that you'll have to look up, but compared to previous releases, TBiG is a breeze.    -if you want to compare this album to another, i'd say it is most closely related to deloused, but it's still completely different.    -i love all of the music. very few places where it lags or stays on a particular part for too long.    -tourniquet man is by far the worst song omar has offered on a mars volta album. seriously, it's terrible. someone mentioned it was like a worse version of limp bizkit trying to cover 'behind blue eyes'. i completely agree.    -my favorite track is by far 'ouroborous', and wax simulacra also rocks my face. most of the others are on my severe likes list, with goliath near the bottom of the pile, right above tourniquet man.    -some people have mentioned the lack of flow between the tracks on this album.     arrange them in this order and it's seamless. it's like a riddle omar made for all of us!  -4. wax simulacra  -5. goliath  -3. ilyena  -6. tourniquet man  -7. cavalettas  -8. agadez  -9. askepios  -10. ouroborous  -11. soothsayer  -12. conjugal burns  -1. aberinkula  -2. metatron    my album rankings go like this...  1. deloused  2. amputechture  3. the bedlam in goliath  4. frances the mute    of course, i didn't even realize that deloused was my favorite until i'd had it for about 1.5 years, so that order is subject to change.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Do yourself a favor and read the novel first.  (Trust me, it won't take long...)  Once you have the novel under your belt, you will be properly primed for their film interpretation.<br /><br />Translating the world of smell into a novel was difficult enough and S&uuml;skind did an amazing job with that.  So for them to convert it into this film...  I applaud the effort.  They managed to get visceral enough.  It's all about the potent imagery, after all.

1570627215|3.0|Judging from the title, I went into this thinking: This is Hesse's take on the life of Siddhartha Gautama....  You know, the Buddha?  Instead we get this thin parallel of Hesse's \\"Siddhartha\\" rubbed up tangentially against Gautama's life and acts.<br /><br />I suppose that this prejudice tainted my overall read.<br /><br />That said, I did not find Hesse's Siddhartha to be a particularly mature or captivating work.  It was well-crafted and (at times) thought-provoking but not particularly imaginative.  Between this and Demian, I found myself thinking of Hesse as a watered-down, optimistic Kafka.<br /><br />Oooo....  Now there's an idea.  The Buddha in Metamorphosis.  (Hey you! Come back here with my idea!)
B0000048CP|5.0|The legendary fourth album by Bathory, Blood Fire Death begins in very subdued fashion, with acoustic strumming and melodic chanting, before breaking into the heavy stuff, which consists of great, powerful riffs, a medium paced, driving beat, and vocals somewhere between the fully blackened of Bathory's past and the cleaner approach on later albums, such as Hammerheart.<br /><br />The pace picks up on \\"The Golden Walls of Heaven,\\" and the guitar is less about riffing and more about wailing away.  Album highlight \\"Pace 'Till Death\\" follows, one of the more aggressive tracks, which bleeds right into \\"Holocaust,\\" such that any line between the two songs isn't noticeable.  Slower, heavier riffs return on \\"For All Those Who Died,\\" and this is really a style that Bathory does very well.  The riffs remain compelling, and just grab your attention in a way that most bands cannot do, and I have difficulty explaining it, as the riffs aren't necessarily complex, but they just work so well with the music that you have to listen.<br /><br />But the real highlight of the album is the driving title track \\"Blood Fire Death,\\" which caps off the album at a good ten minutes in length.<br /><br />I honestly can't say for certain what about this album appeals to me.  I listen to very little black metal, which is where Bathory's roots lay, and there's no doubt that follow-up Hammerheart is much more accessible, but something about this album is very attractive.  It blends the driving, riff approach of later records with the more aggressive approach of earlier ones, and clearly marks the transition between black metal and what would become viking metal.  But at this moment, before Bathory is completely different, the sound takes on elements of both in a very powerful blending of styles.<br /><br />A shame that there will be no more.<br /><br />RIP Quorthon<br />1966-2004
B000EGF0QY|5.0|I keep this book on my nightstand at all times.  Every essay in here is a true gem, a work of art.  This collection is testament enough that David Sedaris is a true genius of American literature.  Even if he's living in France.  Not that he's an \\"ex-pat\\" or anything.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I'm gonna have to go back and listen to Jeff Beck's version of \\"Blues Deluxe,\\" because it's rivaled by a damned fine rendition on this album!  Hell, this whole album is great!  A lot of killer electric blues, different styles of songs...it just never gets boring.  Joe Bonamassa plays with a lot of grit and groove, and it makes the music very enjoyable and a helluva lot of fun to listen to.  Good stuff!
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is a truly remarkable book that has already taken a high place in my literary pantheon of Sheer Genius. What starts out as a young detective's murder mystery (with a nice hook) quickly turns into a far more sensitive and provocative tale than I can really do justice to here. (At least not without some substantial spoilers...)<br /><br />Lucid and compelling, Haddon's prose is a bit of Vonnegut (circa Breakfast of Champions) and a bit of David Foster Wallace (but DFW as Infinite Jest's Mario channelling Chuck Palahniuk).<br /><br />It's really quite the read and I heartily recommend it.
B000002I99|4.0|I believe this is the first effort from Alice Cooper without the original Alice Cooper Band, so it goes without saying that this goes in somewhat of a different direction.  So, rather than the bits and pieces of creepy morbidity, scattered throughout Alice's early catalog, this album is dominated by these tendencies.<br /><br />But Alice is, as always, inventive, eclectic, and full entertaining, demonstrating that even his dark lyrics can be applied to a number of musical styles.
1416523359|1.0|This book is just plain boring.  It drags and has not substance.  King creates his own language (blood bools?) that I just plain do not want to understand.    The interesting thing about King is that he always has a good concept.  However, he tends to destroy it with his writing style - which is just too convoluted.  He needs to write succinctly or just give us all a rest.    Uggh - dont bother with this one.  I actually would love my $$$ back.
B000002KET|5.0|Continuing the experimental vein found in Vol 4, but with considerably more success, Black Sabbath's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is really an exceptional album.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan is one of those writers who could probably draw any reader into any topic.  [[ASIN:0143038583 The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals]] is a captivating and enriching narrative of Pollan's journey to \\"look as far into the food chains that support us...and recover the fundamental biological realities that the complexities of modern industrialized eating keep from our view\\" (281).<br /> From a family meal at McDonalds to a meal wherein he \\"hunted and gathered\\" all the ingredients himself (or mostly), Pollan details how we face a  much larger question than simply \\"meat or no meat.\\" He reveals how shopping at Whole Foods presents its own dilemma, even for those who are already conscious about what they eat.<br /> In the end, Pollan doesn't really come to a conclusion in terms of a choice. His point is to start a conversation that needs to happen because we are allowing the USDA to dictate our eating habits.  We have taken for granted that while we may be on the top of the food chain, we are still a chain, linked to countless other forms of life and ecosystems. Pollan hopes for a day when \\"we would no longer need any reminding that however we choose to feed ourselves, we eat by the grace of nature, not industry, and what we're eating is never anything more or less than the body of the world.\\" (411)
B00004LN16|3.0|An attempt by AC/DC to return to bluesier material and to turn away from the arena rock feel of many Brian Johnson era albums, Stiff Upper Lip has a more laid back feel to it than many AC/DC albums from the last 25 years.<br /><br />But despite a return to roots formula, the album is a bit of a mixed bag.  There are a lot of solid songs here, but very few that are remarkable, as the band is less than inventive with their riffs and lyrics, and it's not until \\"Safe in New York City\\" that anything interesting happens on the guitar.<br /><br />The duo of \\"Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll\\" and \\"Satellite Blues,\\" which start the second half of the album, is one of the stronger portions, with interesting guitar, good lyrics and vocals, and...well, it just feels more like AC/DC than does much of the rest of the album.<br /><br />The second half is considerably stronger than the first, with generally more entertaining songs, and I can appreciate what Angus and the boys were trying to do here.  But there's just too much repetition, either of a less than amazing riff or of a lyric line, to be a top notch AC/DC album.
0446577391|2.0|Maybe my expectations where set too high by reading \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" [ASIN:B000MJ08AQ The Pillars of the Earth] prior to \\"Stone Cold\\".  Since I'm a relatively frugal person, I did make myself finish the book.  In a nutshell - I felt that the character and story line building were weak and hastily written.  Since I have not read other work by this author, I don't know if this is his writing style, or just a book that needed to be finished to pacify his publisher.
B000063DFQ|4.0|A great offering from Iron Maiden, Piece of Mind has great instrumental work, strong melodies and harmonies, solid songwriting, and, for the most part, just kicks some serious a$$.  These are some classic metal tunes!
B000RLCJ5Q|5.0|Personally, I have always found the Clash to be one of the greatest punk outfits to ever walk the earth. This collection proves it.
B000001FO4|4.0|The follow up to a very strong rock n' roll debut, Cinderella's follow up, Long Cold Winter, gets off to a decent start, with \\"Bad Seamstress Blues,\\" though the second half of the song, \\"Fallin' Apart at the Seams,\\" fails to impress.  \\"Gypsy Road,\\" on the other hand, is rock gold!  Strong guitar work, a great vocal performance, and catchy melodies really grab the listener, and it's no wonder that this is among the band's more famous songs.<br /><br />\\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)\\" is a great ballad, and is followed up by a real rocker in \\"The Last Mile,\\" a personal favorite of mine from this album.  The album's title track, \\"Long Cold Winter,\\" is so far from stereotypical \\"hair metal,\\" that it's not even funny...A slow, ultra-bluesy number, and a real album highlight.<br /><br />In sum, this is a pretty good album.  A few tracks are clear filler, but for the most part, it's strong and, occasionally, surprising.  Good stuff!
B000002UAU|1.0|The CD is totally worthless to me since it won't play in my computer's CD-Rom.  It has the Compact Disk logo, but doesn't conform to the required standards for that logo - totally unethical!  I use my computer as my stereo, and never would have purchased this CD if I'd known that the publisher doesn't comply with compact disk standards.
B0000029AL|4.0|A very strong debut from one of America's longest tenured rock n' roll outfits.  Aerosmith plays some straight up rock on this record, that would serve as inspiration to generations of hard rock bands to come after.  They haven't reached their song-writing glory days, yet, and Steven Tyler's vocals haven't quite found that fantastic screech, but all the ingredients are here for a great rock band.
0525950079|5.0|As I'm typing this, I'm actually sad that it's over......the book, that is.  Having been a long time fan of Pillars of the Earth, I never thought I'd get the opportunity to tour the Kingsbridge Priory again and see what's been going on since my last visit there.  When I heard that Follett was writing another book in the same locale, but 200 years later, I was beside myself. You see, I've been on a two year reading hiatus and nothing could get me out of my funk.  Every book I picked up was just okay and not good enough to get me back to my ten book a month reading frenzy.  Thank goodness for Ken Follett.....he did the trick.<br /><br />There's nothing better than starting off the year with a BFB (Big Fat Book).  I started this one on January 1st and it will now be on the list of those other great books that I started on previous New Year's Day....I Know This Much Is True, A Fine Balance, The Great Santini..... just to name a few. I'm always drawn to the larger books at the beginning of the year and never seem to be disappointed in my choices. The only bad thing about this book is that I found myself so invested in the characters that it was hard for me to pick up another book immediately after finishing this one.....I just didn't want to leave Kingsbridge.<br /><br />There have already been enough descriptions of this book in all the previous reviews here.....four kids playing in a forest, where they know<br />they shouldn't be, witness something they will carry with them into adulthood.  While they all go their separate ways, their lives will forever be entwined because of this event.  As a reader, you're more than willing to wade through the thousand pages it takes to find out the ramifications of what this day entailed, because Follett has a way of making all of these characters your \\"people\\" so that you want to read on and on to make sure nothing bad will happen to them. Unfortunately, in the 1300's, there is more bad than good as every time you think things are turning around, the people of Kingsbridge are hit with yet another calamity and injustices are divied out evenly across the board.<br /><br />There's a lot made today of separation of church and state and it's so amazing to read a book set in a time where the church was so very powerful and rich and very corrupt....well two of those three still remain today. It's all a power struggle for money and land and title but, thank goodness, there's so many other good people in this book to even it out because some of these characters are so vile and despicable you just want to reach into these pages and deal with them yourself.<br /><br />World Without End comes highly recommended by me.  I think it can stand on it's own but I would definitely recommend reading Pillars of the Earth first so that you can appreciate the story Follet is trying to tell. This is historical fiction at its best.  All I can say is enjoy and I wish I was just starting it with you.<br /><br />I've seen and read some of the interviews Follett has done, where he mentions the length of the book with the hope that the reader would love it so much that they wouldn't want it to end, so he made it longer than he might have. Well, this is one reader who wished it was even longer ---that's how much I loved it. I'm actually envious of all those \\"Oprah\\" readers who just finished Pillars of the Earth because they get to jump into World Without End right away.  All I can do is hope for yet another sequel.people of Kingsbridge are hit with yet another calamity and injustices are divied out evenly across the board.

B000089RV6|5.0|I once saw a review that called this album \\"pretentious.\\"  Not sure how you might come to that conclusion, as this is some hard rockin', a$$ kickin', riff driven, groovy rock n' roll.  It's about as unpretentious as you can get.  There's not a weak track on here, and thank God AC/DC didn't call it quits with the death of vocalist Bon Scott, as this album is, along with Appetite for Destruction, one of two must have albums from the 1980s.  A few years past its silver anniversary, this album still sounds fresh and wonderful, and if you can't have a great time listening to this...well, I pity you.
B000000W5B|5.0|I believe that this is one of the best stone's records. They really made something diferent here.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|A nice dose of hard rock, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Airbourne's sound is often compared to that of AC/DC, and there are certainly similarities, but in general, such comparisons are more driven by shared Australian roots than by sound.  If you remember, they said the same thing about Jet, which was just silly.  Sure, the riff driven hard rock is here, but Airbourne feature a much more \\"sing-a-long\\" style to their vocals, where it seems the entire band is in on the singing in nearly every song.  I can't imagine a band such as this not counting Acca Dacca among their influences, but there's a good deal of differences, as well.<br /><br />In general, this is a good, hard rockin' album.  No frills rock n' roll, which is always a good thing.
0897500482|5.0|I came into this world many years later since Lee had closed his eyes upon it. I can only imagine the loss it must have been to the world to Martial Arts. But, he never left in spirit. An essence of his philosophy and his approach to martial arts still lives through his followers and this book. I learnt Aikido for 5 years, but found it not very handy when it came to tackling an opponent in the street. That's when someone recommended Lee to me. JKD is much faster and more practical (make no mistake, I still worship Aikido from bottom of my heart...JKD is only a natural next step in the route I took for my education in Martial Arts) when it comes to handling a situation in the street. But this book is not a step-by-step guide to beat someone black and blue. It's Lee's philosophy, his approach to martial arts (which is called Jeet Kun Do) - a way of life, from Lee's perspective.    I am only qualified to speak so much, but definitely recommend this book for everyone who wishes to understand Lee's apparoach to Martial Arts and, in turn, benifit from it to develop his or her own perspective.
B000001EHS|4.0|A good compilation for the hits, but it doesn't get at the music between those hits, where Def Leppard was just a killer rock n' roll band.
B0010ZR160|5.0|gone baby gone...a true classic crime thriller...a story about a 4 year old girl missing and private eyes patrick and angie are on the case but nothing is what it seems...believe me when you take a journey into this world you will see drug dealers, addicts, pedophiles, dead child, i mean ben really put it out there for this gritty film to be a classic and he did it perfect. when i say dead child u will understand once u see the movie. the point is that this is a mortality tale and it asks some tough question...you will see this movie and be angry with social service for not helping children who are living messed up homes or you would be angry with the police for not protecting your child from pedophiles it really does make you think with this movie. i have to say that this is ben first gritty film and he gets an A for this movie. i thought that ed harris and morgan freeman were brilliant in their roles but i was very surprise at casey his younger brother who is very good in this role as patrick trying to find out the real truth behind the missing child case. this is a tough watch because of the material that is in the film but it is true classic crime thriller that is so worth the watch and a true disappointment at the oscars for not nominating this film for best picture. this is a must!!! have for your dvd collection and a brilliant work for ben!!
B000002H92|4.0|A good live album, full of energy, that, sadly, I misplaced along the way.  But for those of us who didn't get to hear The Doors live, this strikes me as a great substitute.
0312323867|3.0|\\"Something Borrowed\\" was great:  smart, funny, well-written, an engaging read.  I loved Rachel and was happy to see Darcy get her well-deserved comeuppance in the end.  I looked forward to \\"Something Blue\\" very much, and it was as well-written as \\"Something Borrowed\\", but I found Darcy to be a completely unsympathetic idiot.  I didn't really care whether things worked out for her or not, and I found her \\"transformation\\" to be somewhat unbelieveable.  It just seemed highly unlikely that someone like Darcy, who'd spent her entire life being bossy, demanding, needy, shallow, self-centered and manipulative would change as quickly as she did in the book.  Plus, I found a little bit of a the disconnect between Darcy's character and the first-person narrative - the person narrating sounded way too smart to be Darcy.<br /><br />Not a bad book, but whereas I'll definitely re-read \\"Something Borrowed\\", I probably won't re-read \\"Something Blue\\".
B00008OLIO|4.0|The essence of a raw rock n' roll record, M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e really score with this, their debut.  Before they had fame and fortune, they put out this record.  It has none of their hits, but so much grit and groove.  I've heard that this is, essentially, a demo that was rushed out as an album.  From the sound, that may be true.  Songs aren't tight, in that well rehearsed way, and Vince misses a note or two, but there's a lot of good rock n' roll here.  Highlights are opener \\"Live Wire\\" and \\"On With the Show.\\"<br /><br />The bonus tracks (especially \\"Toast of the Town\\" and \\"Tonight\\") flow really well with the original album.  I honestly didn't know they were bonus tracks, for the longest time.
B000VSBX34|3.0|What a shame Apple couldn't have included the extremely rare , almost never seen mono video promo of 43 years ago.  I have a very grainy copy and the vocals are all together different for John. Also Paul and George's vocals are very much mixed forward and are very melodic compared to both the stereo and mono vinyl releases. John's voice is very high pitched and the instruments are quieter. I don't know why it would not be included on the very expensive collector's edition.
B000002KIK|3.0|The weakest album of the Ozzy Osbourne era of Black Sabbath, Never Say Die! suffers from inconsistency, both in terms of song quality and the album's overall sound.  While not a bad album, it lacks the coherent approach that their best albums have.  Decent, and probably in the collection of completists, but casual fans needn't worry with this one.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Musicals are running amok in Hollywood and theatregoers were treated to at least 3 of them (there may be one I missed) with the gentle and lovely Once, the movie turned broadway musical turned movie Hairspray, and artistic visually stunning Across the Universe.  While Hollywood likes churning out Broadway adaptations regularly (in the case of Hairspray), these unusual experimental musicals are welcome.  Once was my favorite this year.  Across the Universe was the most stunning.    Across the Universe is set up for failure though.  It's a jukebox musical, right?  To me, those are dreadful, big Vegas style romps that try to gain a narrative from splicing well known hits together.  Across the Universe has the Beatles songbook, with songs too well known it seems to generate enough originality.  But the film has a weapon in the form of Julie Taymor, who has proved her artistic weight in gold.    If you're reading this, your are by now familiar with the setup.  It's a love story in the middle of the social unrest of the 60s, set largely against the Vietnam War and all that came with it: civil unrest, peace rallies, protests, and drugs.  When the setup is clear, you realize the Beatles songbook was, in fact, a narrative for the times.  Songs like \\"Revolution,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" and \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" are at home here.    But narrative aside, it's the visuals that steal the show.  Across the Universe is like a long form music video.  Yet the story is cohesive and the imagery for the songs brings the story to life.  The two that stick out in mind very clearly are \\"She's so Heavy,\\" which in the film makes a dramtic statement about the draft at the time - complete with freaky looking Uncle Sam's with excellent choreography, and \\"Strawberry Field's Forever,\\" which is a dramatic duet from the two male leads while one struggles with his art and love and the other struggles in the Vietnam War.  After you watch the film, you may not be able to help but pair up some of the images with the Beatles songs.  There's also some notable cameos, and while Bono's is well publicized, it's Eddie Izzards take on Mr. Kite that steals the show.    The film suffers only from it's grand ambition.  Notably, there is a little character clutter.  This seems to be the case with the character of Prudence, who's appearance seems superfluous, appearing briefly 3 times in the film, once so someone can sing \\"Dear Prudence\\" to her.  To me, however, this was the only major misstep.    Across the Universe is a visual marvel and takes the musical into experimental realms not yet explored in the general Hollywood arena.  The talented cast executes the Beatles songbook quite well and demonstrate that pop stars don't need to dominate a musical.  Taymor combines the performances with imagery I guarantee you haven't seen in a musical before.  The visual achievements alone make it worth the while.  The music isn't half bad either.
B00008WT5M|4.0|A strong album, featuring some of the best material from the Brian Johnson era of AC/DC, The Razors Edge gets off to a strong start, with the well known crowd pleaser \\"Thunderstruck,\\" which also had the privilege of opening 1992's Live.  \\"Fire Your Guns\\" follows, and is really some of the better \\"filler\\" in recent memory, which a lot of attitude and power behind the music.  \\"Moneytalks\\" concludes a great trio of tracks to start the album, with some killer, bluesy guitar work courtesy of the brothers Young.<br /><br />Title track \\"The Razors Edge\\" is a gritty, dark piece, very different from most of what AC/DC has done on past albums, and is a welcome addition that helps to shake things up from the typical Acca Dacca formula.  A number of solid, hard rockin' tracks follow, giving the album a solid middle, though not so chock full of classics as 1980's Back in Black.<br /><br />Not their best, but very solid!
B000001EHS|5.0|Most of the hits are included in the album but its missing afew like  Gods of War,Die Hard Hunter,Love and Affection, Women,Foolin' etc. which I think deserve to be in the album.I guess you cant have it all.Still a great album and must have for the Def Leppard fan.
B000002J0B|4.0|Like the middle son in a family in which both the elder (Led Zeppelin [IV]) and younger (Physical Graffiti) get all the praise, Led Zeppelin's 1973 album Houses of the Holy is an oft overlooked piece of the collection.  But there's no question that the album is strong, piecing together a variety of styles and approaches in what was Zep's first album where they wrote all of the songs, rather than reinterpreting a couple of blues classics.<br /><br />It isn't my \\"go to\\" Zep album...in fact, it's well down the list.  But it is my favorite Zep to spin when I'm feeling like listening to some laid back music.
0553582038|2.0|I cannot remember such a let down from such a great series that maches this.  This book alone has secured GRM this decades Robert Jordan award for losing control of a popular fantasy series.  But what makes this so much more painfull is the fact GRM does something Jordan never did, he wrote a tedious and boring book.      He creates several completely new character POV's that bog down and just confuse the story.  Martin has reached the same problem the many other writers of five plus book series have run into.  If you quit adding and changing characters the story gets dull, if you add too many the story line bogs down and you get books like this that are more than five hundred pages of nothing.      It is hard to see if GRM can recover his series from this book.  The next book promises to bring back his better characters that were so painfully missing from this book, but just writing a good entertaining book will not do anything to clear up the mess he has made.  By the time the next book in this series comes out it will have been somthing like seven years since I will have read a book in this series that I cared about, and I don't know my intrest will have lasted that long.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|Judas Priest has never been among my favorites.  I could never put my finger on it, but something about Halford's vocals just never did it for me.  I'm sorry to say that that feeling doesn't appear to have changed with this, their most recent release.  However, the guitar work on this album is really strong, and makes up for my lack of excitement for the vocals.  \\"Wheels of Fire\\" is a notable album highlight, and \\"Angel\\" is a strong metal ballad, before the powerful, riff driven \\"Hellrider.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, despite its great moody guitar, I cannot get behind the lyrics of the epic finale, such as:<br /><br />\\"Loch Ness<br />Confess<br />Your Terror of the Deep.\\"<br /><br />Come on.  I can live with lyrics about Hell and demons and such, but Nessie?  This would have been a much better track without such comically dorky lyrics.  Shame.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very conflicted about this album.  Halford's vocal performance wan't bad, but it still isn't my cup of tea.  But the guitars were great, throughout.  A mixed bag, really.
B000BNX3AU|1.0|I am so tired of movies where the entire plot seems to revolve around sex.  In this case how long its been since the main character had it, how much her siblings encourage her to get it from anyone, how much can the guys get and how many girls can they get it from, etc.  This entire movie was like this from start to finish.  I didn't even care that the girl ended up with her guy at the end.
B00003003R|4.0|A nice live album.  Retouched to some extent, so it lacks a true, raw live feel, but all the hits are here, as well as some fan favorites, and it's all played with great energy.
1594489505|5.0|I keep asking myself how a physician could capture so completely  the beauty and pain of a country that most Americans will never see, and  talk about as if they knew what is best for that country? I read both of his books and came away with great understanding. I was also fortunate enough to met and eat with Afghanis when I lived in the Middle East. I bought several copies of both books for friends, and look forward to reading more works by  this gifted storyteller.
B000002G87|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Eric Clapton.  His work with Cream, while enjoyable, was never as mind blowing to me, as it seems to be to many other listeners.  And that is what makes my love of this album all the more stunning.  A mix of originals and revitalized blues classics, this album is very strong, from front to back.  \\"I Looked Away\\" and \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" are both great openers, while covers of \\"Key to the Highway\\" and \\"Little Wing\\" are both familiar, while still very innovative in their treatment.  The only flaw to be found is that the band was short lived, and no follow-up to this masterpiece was ever created.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Not since Madonna appeared on the music radar has an artist captivated my eye, ear, and heart the way Ms. Winehouse has.  I realize they are worlds apart musically, but the presence and panache that they both exhibit are what makes me draw the parallel.  Amy has the f-you attitude that Madonna had when she was starting out.  She seems more concerned with doing her thing than warming up to those who would criticize her.  Her delivery comes across as spontaneous, her in-between ramblings as extemporaneous--without any thought or concern for what people will think.  Madonna was never this natural or uncalculated, but just as brash.  And then there is that voice...like Etta James, Billie Holliday, Bettye LaVette, and all The Supremes rolled into one beautiful confection--chased with a shot of Tequila.  Just listen to \\"Back To Black\\", \\"Love Is A Losing Game\\", and \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" and you will see an artiste/icon in the making.  I hope and pray that her time in treatment will bring her back to the road she should be ruling.  It would be a great tragedy for her to fall prey to the same habits that have robbed us of so many of our greatest talents.  Don't let the reviews that talk about her supposed drunkenness dissuade you from buying this dvd--she may be tipsy, but she stays on top of her game, and lets the songs speak very clearly for themselves.  The documentary is fascinating--with her demo performance included alongside observations from her fans, a record label exec (very articulate in respecting her awe inspiring talent) and her father (charming in his own way).  One suggestion: Turn the subtitles on during the documentary to catch all that Amy (who speaks very fast in a heavy British accent--one of the reasons people always think she's drunk) has to say.  She is funny, charming, smart, self-effacing, and--that rarest of qualities in someone in posession of such brilliance and success--REAL!  I, for one, can't imagine the world without her!<br /><br />BTW--Anyone knowing what the \\"Back to Black And White Extra Option\\" is on the dvd--please share it here.  Did I miss something?  God, I hope so!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: To anyone out there wondering abut the blu-ray disc of this concert that has a bonus concert from another date, I've seen it.  I bought a region free blu-ray disc from an individual on a popular auction site, and was disappointed to see Amy in a sad state throughout the video, but most especially toward the end.  I had to stop it--it just really hurt to see her looking so vulnerable and seemingly dazed.  She was still great--even in this state, but sadly, she's just not at her best.  Even so, I did enjoy watching some of it, but Amy just seems checked out to some extent, and seems to be finding it difficult to stay focused and soldier on.  With the hindsight of July, it's especially poignant watching it.<br /><br />I kept hoping and praying Amy would stay on course and survive her demons, but nothing can bring her back now, and I'd prefer to remember her as she'd probably like to be remembered--when she was on her game.  So, I watched the original concert instead, and it was nice to have a new and improved copy of that monumental concert.  The picture is wonderfully clear, and she seems even more as if she's in the flesh and blood on a stage in front of you when you watch her here.  In my estimation, it's really worth tracking down a copy of this just so you have the London performance in this much improved blu-ray presentation.  I'm so grateful that we have this amazing account of who Amy was as an artist--truly original, amazingly soulful, and altogether brilliant.  My, but I can't help but think what else we would have seen and heard from her.  What a bright star she was...one knowing what the \\"Back to Black And White Extra Option\\" is on the dvd--please share it here.  Did I miss something?

B000002KDS|5.0|What a great album!  After their masterpiece, Love It to Death, I didn't expect Alice Cooper to follow up with another incredible album, but this one delivers, from the comical \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Be My Lover,\\" each with a more classic rock feel, to the unique \\"Halo of Flies\\" with its rambling lyrics and melodies and varied moods, making it feel like more than a single track.  \\"Desperado,\\" with its soft, matter of fact vocals leading into harder vocals marks an interesting midpoint for the album, along with the upbeat \\"You Drive Me Nervous,\\" where Alice's vocals seem a bit more frantic and frustrated than nervous...a fact for which I'm all too willing to forgive him, as the song is an album highlight.  \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" is yet another highlight, with its high energy, leading into the eerie, dark, and fairly soft \\"Dead Babies,\\" hinting more and more at Alice's later lyric tendencies.  But it's a strong track, despite its morbid lyrics, and plays well after two harder numbers.  The album closes with \\"Killer,\\" which is actually a good deal creepier than \\"Dead Babies.\\"
B000R6PKP2|4.0|Blade Runner has never been prettier, and I find it kind of sad that very current films (such as 28 Weeks Later) look horrible next to this (don't buy 28 Weeks on Blu-Ray, stick with regular DVD; it looks the same and costs less).  SKIP the director commentary-Scott likes to pat himself on the back about how great he is, and talks non-stop about Alien.  About a third of the way through it drove me so crazy I had to switch the commentary to the second track, which consists of writers and is more entertaining and interesting (and they talk about this movie, NOT Alien).  The added goodies in the package (origami unicorn, holographic plaque, hovercar) are a nice touch.
B000002KB8|5.0|What is this that stands before me?  A metal masterpiece...that's what!  I cannot begin to imagine how music might be different (and most certainly worse) had Black Sabbath not made this album, nor the five that came after.  Every time you hear music that's not cheery bubblegum B.S., it's probably got some roots, somewhere, dipped into the deep well of Sabbath, and this is where that well began.  But I don't give it a perfect score simply for being groundbreaking.<br /><br />This one is different.  \\"Black Sabbath,\\" from which the band, obviously, has derived its name, is heavy, menacing, and the clear root of the future doom metal genre.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|Great music.  Still inspiring.  I bought this cd for my son who is a runner.  He plays it as he nears the end of his course.
B0000029AP|5.0|What some consider to be Aerosmith's best album, Toys in the Attic certainly delivers a rock n' roll wallop!  There just isn't a weak track to be found, here.  If you're new to Aerosmith, this might be a good place to start.  Filler that is anything-but comes between more well known Aerosmith tracks, like \\"Toys in the Attic,\\" \\"Walk This Way,\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion,\\" but great albums aren't simply a collection of hits, and Toys delivers from top to bottom.  If you like rock n' roll, I can't imagine how you might not like this album.
B0006399FS|5.0|I don't know the reason for all U2 hate reviews.  Take those reviews for what they are, as such negativity usually reflects a limitation on the part of the reviewers.  And yes, in some cases, jealousy; it is easier to criticize others than to do something concrete and meaningful with your own life.        This release is phenomenal, with music that transports you and lyrics that are full of meaning and emotion.  The band is very cohesive and the music is tight.  Bono is as full of energy as ever and his voice has matured with age and has a pathos at times that is haunting.  Gone is the over-produced hype of Zoo and PopMart (although I appreciated both for what they represented and said about our culture) and instead we have songs that are complex and full and speak to our hearts.   Try to truly listen to the words of \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" and you can't help but feel deeply touched by them.  Add incredible music that drill that deep bass and singing electric guitar and tribal drums into your belly and it is a transcendent experience.  And of course, they just truly rock out at times as in \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", reminiscent of Bullet the Blue Sky, and \\"All Because of You\\".  Finally, Yahwee is a prayer with the power to change the world - if we work for it. What an amazing c.d.  To my hear the only somewhat weak song is \\"Man and a Woman\\" - but that just speaks to personal preference.  I don't think there is a bad cut here.  Keep up the good fight, U2; and let's help them by working in our own communities and to find peace and love in our own hearts.
B000002J03|5.0|How ballsy is this album, to begin with a track that immediately goes beyond any normal boundaries of rock n' roll?  Common (corporate) sense would seem to dictate starting the album off with an accessible track, that will pull in new listeners, but \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" goes into an extended atmospheric, percussion driven breakdown, before returning to form.<br /><br />This leads in to the dualistic \\"What Is and What Should Never Be,\\" with its soft verses and poweful, driving chorus.  I'd call it an album highlight...but what isn't a highlight on an album as good as this?<br /><br />A heavy blues follows, in \\"The Lemon Song,\\" which demonstrates Zep's ability to make even standard blues forms sound new and refreshing by plugging in and playing with a thick sound, over which Robert Plant's vocals sound soulful, and to accompany it all with a great Jimmy Page solo.<br /><br />The combination of \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Living Loving Maid\\" is one of the few song tandems that is never heard in separate parts, along with Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions,\\" which are always played back-to-back, off of 1977's News of the World.  Whether the two songs, one of which perfectly flows into the other, were intended to play as one is something I don't know with any certainty, but \\"Heartbreaker\\" does play perfectly into the intro of the following track.<br /><br />I could easily write about every track on this album.  It's stellar throughout, and is, in my opinion, probably the best Zeppelin album, though it doesn't have as many \\"famous\\" songs as Led Zeppelin [IV] or show as much range in style as Physical Graffiti.  But it's great from front to back, and usually my first choice when I'm needing a Zep fix.
B0008ENHTE|4.0|If someone tells you \\"Bulitt\\" is McQueen's finest film, they're lying. But if you're a fan, Steve McQueen's \\"Bullitt\\" is a must have. Let me explain.    McQueen in front of a camera is almost always magic. His outtakes are better than most of today's \\"stars\\" Oscar performances.     \\"Bullitt\\" was released when I was 10 years old, so after seeing a few sliced and diced versions on tv, I was thrilled to see it available in this 2 disc version. The second disc takes you behind the scenes, and you get to see the actors' relationships off camera.     The famous \\"chase scene\\" holds up well after 40 years. It has more soul than all the digitally inhanced \\"fast and the furious\\" movies put together.     Steve McQueen looks into the camera as if to say there's a private joke between the two of us, and man, is this fun!    The problem is, I could go buy one of the new Mustang Bullits. I could cut my hair like Steve, lose a few pounds, and practice a lot in front of a mirror.    But I would never be that cool.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|Early AC/DC can be a bit confusing, especially for the new fan, as the band had multiple releases, domestic (Australian) and international, and the tracks weren't at all consistent between those releases.  Their first, full fledged international release was this album, High Voltage, which is essentially a combination of their first two releases in their native Australia, High Voltage and TNT.  From the Australian High Voltage, the band draws only two tracks, those being the \\"She's Got Balls,\\" and \\"Little Lover,\\" while seven tracks are pulled from the Australian TNT (yes...\\"High Voltage\\" is off of TNT and not the album of the same name).  There's no question that there's some great material, here.  But the band is still young, and it shows.  Their writing isn't quite as strong as on later releases, but it's still a very enjoyable, raw album from a very young band.<br /><br />Much of the material left off of the international release can be found on '74 Jailbreak.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|Dear Jiminiss,  I read your review of the Mothership CD which has been digitally re-mastered.   I couldn't agree with you more. I have \\"Houses of the Holy\\"v which I think I purchased in the 90's.  I noticed that the Mothership sounds like Robert is in a different room singing from the band. And you know I really like the sound quality of the \\"Houses of the Holy\\" CD much better. You get a much richer sound. I think Jimmy Page did not do a good job re-mastering the Mothership CD. The base quality is very poor, the music is almost leveled out, prefabricated if you will.  I'm really concerned about the 02 DVD release early this summer, I love the arena sound quality, the only clean up the fuss. Don't start messing with tones and evening  out the quality.  Personally I'm disappointed in the Mothership sound quality. And I hope they don't make the same mistake and flatten out the 02 Arena CD.  Great point you brought up, and I'm glad you did. Good job!!!!!!
B000IZJ1KC|4.0|I'm not going to try to categorize this one, as it draws from too many sources, but suffice it to say that this was an unexpected bit of riff driven metal that is thoroughly entertaining.  If you like later Immortal, you'll probably like this, as well.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Don't watch this movie at night, and when you are alone! I did and I almost turned it off. Almost, but it was so good, entertaining, & suspenseful I kept it on. Halle Berry is also surprisingly very good in this. Her acting isn't fakey or like she knows a camera is on her. I very much reccomend this movie if you are looking for a suspenseful spook.
B0001Z363W|4.0|A different approach from Zakk Wylde & Black Label Society, in that most of the songs feature some acoustic work, though often in conjunction with electric, and he doesn't use as many of the same guitar effects found on a number of his other albums.  As such, this album relies more on songwriting and vocal performance.<br /><br />Some songs really stand out, such as \\"Won't Find it Here,\\" but others are forgettable.  But it is nice that Zakk and BLS wanted to do something different, and the album is generally good and enjoyable.  Some of his other albums get a bit repetitive, album to album, but this is a breath of fresh air.
1400032717|5.0|After reading \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time,\\" I immediately placed it on my list of top ten books.    \\"Curious Incident\\" takes you inside the mind of an autistic boy, and in doing so, tells us some things about how our own minds work.  The lack of emotion in his thought processes is, to some extent, a defect, but it also shows us how emotions too often cloud our own thinking.    I have long been fascinated with the \\"disconnect\\" that so many intellegent people have when it comes to social skills.  More so than any book I have read, \\"Curious Incident\\" gives us some clues as to why this disconnect exists.    The book is well written, funny, and full of interesting tidbits.  Put it at the top of your list too!
B000000OQY|4.0|An album with two distinct halves, G N' R Lies is one part a \\"live\\" recording, previously released as the pre-Appetite for Destruction water tester Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, while the second half is a collection of acoustic originals.  As such, the album has two very distinct feels to it, and boasts both some highlights of Guns N' Roses' catalog, as well as many fan favorites.<br /><br />Beginning with the \\"live\\" half (which isn't actually live, but a studio recording with crowd noise added in for effect), the band performs two originals and two covers.  \\"Reckless Life,\\" written well before the band had much of what would become their dangerous reputation, is a strong opener, as is the follow up cover of Rose Tattoo's \\"Nice Boys,\\" both of which fit the band's style very well.  They follow these with original \\"Move to the City\\" and a cover of Aerosmith's \\"Mama Kin,\\" which demonstrate the band's less heavy tendencies and pay a tribute to one of the rock classics that came before them.<br /><br />The acoustic half is all original material, beginning with the hit \\"Patience,\\" which is likely the most well known track on the album.  The tongue in cheek \\"Used to Love Her,\\" with its comically dark lyrics follows, prior to a revisitation of Appetite track \\"You're Crazy,\\" which loses little of its edge, despite being unplugged.  \\"One in a Million\\" closes the album, and is a clear highlight, though it also deals with some controversial material.<br /><br />All in all, a great EP coming between the groundbreaking Appetite for Destruction and the enormous scope found on the Use Your Illusion albums.
B000002AP1|5.0|GOD, THEY JUST DON'T MAKE ALBUMS LIKE THIS ANYMORE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ROCK AND ROLL, BUT THIS IS THE REAL STUFF, THE KIND YOU USED TO PUT ON AND YOUR PARENTS USED TO SCREAM AT YOU TO TURN THAT DAMN THING DOWN!  I SAW IGGY POP PERFORM LOTS OF TIMES IN THE 1970'S, HE ALWAYS PUT ON A GREAT SHOW.  THIS ALBUM IS FROM 1973, IT'S 35 YEARS OLD AND BETTER THAN ANYTHING COMING OUT TODAY..................
B000002KE2|4.0|Though they hinted at experimentation on Master of Reality, Vol 4<br />is the first truly experimental album from the great Black Sabbath.  Of course, it isn't all different, and Sabbath are still heavy as hell, but this album shows their ability to break the mold that they themselves cast, and to try something different.  To some extent, this album suffers somewhat from the new direction, and their efforts to do something different while remaining heavy are better realized on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but it still marks an important moment in the development of Sabbath.
B000V7B90C|5.0|This DVD is GREAT fun! If you are an AC/DC fan, this needs to be a part of your music library. I especially loved the old footage of a very young Bon Scott and Angus Young! The mind's image of Bon Scott in a dress and pigtails is rather repulsive, but when you actually see it, it's very funny.     I read the reviews below which panned this offering because it didn't have Dolby sound. Well, I'm not a sound expert, so I can't tell you whether it does or doesn't have Dolby sound, but I can tell you that it sounds GREAT to ME. That's all I care about! Besides, if you look at all the reviews that have been posted on Amazon by the others who have whined about the sound on this DVD, you will see that the vast majority of them are negative reviews. Seems like some people just enjoy looking for anything to complain about and when they find it, they have a field day.     I do understand that sound is much more important with music DVDs than regular movies (to me, anyway). I get that. The fact is, though, that unless you are a sound expert, or someone who can hear a pin drop 50 feet away, then this DVD sounds just fine. Great, in fact! I give it five stars. No, it's not perfect, but then, nothing is. The five star rating is because I don't know how to give it four-and-a-half. AC/DC fans, get this DVD today!!    Peace.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|A very laid back, cool, guitar driven album from David Gilmour.  It does lack some of the magic that he did with Pink Floyd, but there's still a good deal of interesting stuff, here.
B000W1V7KE|2.0|I don't understand why this movie ships with the Toshiba HD DVD player.  The intent of the filmaker was to give the look of a 60's era film.  For someone viewing their first HD DVD - they will be extremely disappointed in the picture.  I tweaked with all picture settings trying to make it look better.  After a bit of research, I learned that this was the way the film was produced.  Just don't let this be your first HD DVD viewing experience!
B000002J1U|4.0|Led Zeppelin III always struck me as an early attempt to achieve what was done so masterfully on Physical Graffiti, which is to explore, more fully than has been done thus far, all of Led Zeppelin's many and varied musical interests and abilities.  While it's not fully successful in achieving this goal, the album is still very strong, though perhaps not so strong as their other albums, through Physical Graffiti.<br /><br />The album does have very strong moments, however, beginning with the heavy, roaring \\"Immigrant Song,\\" which is often considered inspirational to the later genre of viking metal.  This is really a great song, and instantly recognizable.  \\"Friends\\" has a darker mood that plays nicely into the more upbeat \\"Celebration Day.\\"  A true album highlight can be found on the slow, bluesy \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" which really showcases the band's soulfulness, both on instrument and in voice.<br /><br />\\"Gallows Pole\\" is an effective midpoint for the album, combining blues, a partially bluegrass feel, and some great vocals, before the mellow \\"Tangerine\\" changes the mood once more.  In fact, a good deal of the second half of the album is based on more acoustic blues and bluegrass, which is why this is a fairly experimental album from Zep.  It's very good, but I think they do it better on Physical Graffiti, which is so huge and expansive.  But by listening to this, you can really tell where they were planning to go with that album.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|Ritchie Blackmore was a hard rock icon.  His virtuosity, signature sound, and onstage flair, helped make him one of the genre's first guitar heroes as a member of Deep Purple.  Blackmore's personality and approach to music, contributed to his reputation as a mysterious, larger than life figure, as he left Purple to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio.  Over the years, much has been said about Blackmore, how he managed Rainbow, and the numerous lineup changes to the band.  The truth seems to be somewhat shrouded in myth.  This release provides a look at Rainbow near the high point of the Dio era.<br /><br />The circumstances concerning this performance are discussed in the bonus materials.  The details vary, but basically just prior to the concert, Blackmore was being detained in an Austrian jail.  Upon being released, he rushed to Munich, to take the stage only slightly behind schedule.  Rather than being upset by the circumstances, Blackmore seems to be in a good, perhaps even a sedate mood.  Beneath a huge illuminated rainbow, the band plays for nearly two-hours, covering the best of their material at the time.  Blackmore lets his guitar do the talking, as the concert becomes a musical odyssey, where most of the songs become extended vehicles that display a dynamic range of sound and styles.  Much like Purple, Rainbow live is nothing like the records, as the songs transcend their traditional format.  Each performance is truly unique, with much dependent on the mood of the `Man in black'.  This appears to be a very good night.  The band is tight, adept at taking cues from Ritchie on the various long improvisational numbers, anchored by drummer Cozy Powell.  Recent additions are Bob Daisley on bass, and David Stone on keyboards.<br /><br />Not yet the metal icon in black leather, a youthful Ronnie James Dio is relaxed and comfortable running the show.  One of the seminal voices in heavy metal, Dio has the gift to take you to magical places.  Seeing him in jeans and a white tasseled shirt, thoughts may wander to his future work with Black Sabbath and Dio.  High points include Kill the King, Catch the Rainbow, Man on the Silver Mountain and Sixteenth Century Greensleeves.  With the many extended instrumental breaks, Dio is often absent giving way to Ritchie and the band.  Through Blackmore is most often on center stage, Still I'm Sad features David Stone's extended solo break, followed by Cozy Powell's drum solo.<br /><br />The only sour note is Blackmore's destruction of a guitar in the finale.  Indicative of the time, the excess is pure theater.  Fortunately it does not appear that anyone was injured while Blackmore was whipping guitar remnants around, though it appears that it could easily have happened.<br /><br />A release from this lineup of Rainbow is a gem well worth having.  The quality of the video is mostly good, with a variety of unobstructed camera angles.  The audio is muffled at times, but overall very listenable.  The bonus materials include vintage music videos for Gates Of Babylon, LA Connection and Long Live Rock `n' Roll.  Interviews with Bob Daisley and roadie Colin Hart, though unfortunately nothing from either Blackmore or Dio.  There is a slide show with a commentary by an unnamed but quite informed narrator.  Also included is a booklet of detailed liner notes and a mini reproduction of the original concert program.d shirt, thoughts may wander to his future work with Black Sabbath and Dio.

B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC is in top form on this legendary album.  Their playing is tight, the song writing is great, and Bon Scott's vocals take on a rougher, edgier sound on this, his last album.  There just isn't a weak song here.  You can rock all night to this one!
B000OZ28IS|3.0|Restless: Two Stories in One    In Restless William Boyd gives us two stories in one: the stories of Ruth Gilmartin and Eva Delectorskaya.  But sadly only one of the stories is fully developed.  Ruth Gilmartin, a single mother, teaches English as a second language and lives in Oxford, England with her son Jochen.  Her life gets complicated when her mother, Sally Gilmartin, gives Ruth her memoirs revealing herself as the British spy Eva Delectorskaya.  Boyd structures the memoirs one chapter at a time into the novel. This results in alternating chapters of the two women's lives, with two viewpoints, two settings, and two time frames, the seventies and the forties.  Ruth, along with the reader, becomes absorbed in her own mother's past.  And what a Machiavellian past Eva had: a contrast to the routine existence Ruth lives.     Boyd's creative use of two storylines within one novel makes reading interesting.  Eva's undercover story takes center stage.  Each chapter ups the ante in violence and intrigue.  Her entanglement with Lucas Romer, her boss, leads her to plant fake documents meant to encourage the U. S. to engage with the British in World War II.  Boyd packs this thriller with mystery, drama, and devious manipulation, compelling the reader to search for answers.  He builds a complicated plot for Eva's story, and withholds information as well as any mystery writer. By the time the story has played out he ties up all the pieces with finesse.      He is not as meticulous writing Ruth's story.  He inserts plotlines and leaves them unfinished.  What happened to Hamid's love for Ruth and his connection to the protests against the Shah, to Ludger, Ilse, and their connection to the Red Army?  What about Detective Constable Frobisher? Why did Boyd build so many fascinating questions in Ruth's story and not resolve them?  One writing theory is if the author puts a gun on the mantle in the first chapter, he better let the reader know why it was there by the last chapter.Boyd put too many guns on Ruth's mantle and we still don't know why in the last chapter he included them in the story.  Though William Boyd is a talented writer, this careless oversight keeps the novel from being exceptional. Boyd needs to go back and edit.
B000E6EJAC|4.0|Mott the Hoople is a band that, admittedly, I haven't dug into deeply enough.  This album is certainly their most famous; the fans will tell you others are better.  I don't know whether that's true, but this album makes me want to find out.  A nice combination of pop-rock, in the vein of their collaborator David Bowie, and harder edged rock that occasionally borders on proto-metal, though with a slightly more progressive bent, All the Young Dudes delivers on all fronts.  The instrumental work is strong, as are vocal performances, the songwriting is very good, and it's a thoroughly enjoyable album that, as a band's most famous album should do, encourages listeners to really investigate the band's catalog.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album is collection of 27 of The Beatles' songs from the 60s and two from the 70s.

0805079831|5.0|The Shock Doctrine is one of the most important, and terrifying, books you will ever read. It is the comprehensively researched and compellingly argued history of the dark side of modern global free-market capitalism. Klein shows how the free-market fundamentalist prescriptions of influential economist Milton Friedman (deregulation of industry, privatization of public assets, elimination of government spending on social services) have inspired a group of corporatist ideologues to rise to the highest reaches of power in both the American government (Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld) and the international institutions that rule the global economy (IMF, World Bank, WTO). Essential to this view is that lasting economic reform can be most effectively implemented only in response to a national catastrophe.     Klein shows how nation after nation has been devastated by neoliberal economic \\"reforms\\" imposed on peoples who have been \\"shocked and awed\\" into submission by overwhelming catastrophe, whether in the form of \\"natural\\" disasters resulting from global climate change (tsunamis, hurricanes), American-sponsored \\"regime changes.\\" or war. She shows how dissent has been controlled in each case by the most brutal forms of repression, murder, and torture. Klein takes us around the globe from Chili, to Russia, to South Africa, to SE Asia, to New Orleans, to Israel, to Iraq, and many other places detailing the consequences of the rise of disaster capitalism. She goes on to document how a globally unrestricted and unending War on Terror is simply the logical extension and natural environment of the disaster capitalism complex. The global economy as a whole is now increasingly dependent on industries that profit on the prospect of biological and environmental catastrophe and unending war (whether in terms of prevention, implementation, or reconstruction); industries in which the rulers of the world are deeply invested.
B00065MDRW|3.0|King Crimson's debut effort, In the Court of the Crimson King, should get an award for the album cover, which is very cool.  Beyond that, the album is fairly up and down.  The title track, \\"The Court of the Crimson King,\\" is nice but not great.  \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" has some very unique and interesting vocal work, but \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is a mellow, bordering on dull, track.<br /><br />Overall, I can tell these are well written songs, even if they're not \\"my thing,\\" so to speak.  A good album, and for prog rock aficionados, I can see why it's regarded so highly.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Honest to gosh, I don't know what the big deal about Sophia Coppola is. I went to see this movie with HIGH expectations, based on the HIGH amount of hype (and of course, to see Bill Murray, who rarely missteps in even the most miserable product), and went away scratching my head wondering why everyone is praising this film as if it's the second coming of Kane.<br /><br />Lost in Translation is deadly dull, it overdoes the typical Japanese stereotypes, and it completely squanders the talents of Murray as well as Scarlett Johansson. Apparently Coppola had to really chase after Murray to get him to do this film. He should have shut off his phone.<br /><br />Lost in Translation comes off as a big-budget student film.<br /><br />The movie earns its single star only for Murray's Joey Bishop imitation.<br />Save yourself some time and just fast-forward to it.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|A classic album, probably most famous for \\"Money for Nothing,\\" but far more worthwhile for other \\"hits\\"  like \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Walk of Life,\\" as well as the exceptional, atmospheric title track \\"Brothers in Arms.\\"
B0001GMIOE|5.0|the battery handles well, i was shocked when it drained after maybe 100-200 shots, but i realized i'm always using IS, autofocus and live view on my 40d that time, i was learning the functions of my new camera so it was drained right away, soon i'll be testing how many shots i could take with a full charge with this battery, my only complain is that it's expensive, canon is being not so reasonable here, they are not the one who's making the batteries and yet they price it too much.
B000002J09|5.0|Many consider this to be Led Zeppelin's greatest album (and, perhaps, the greatest album ever).  While I disagree, it is an amazing composition.  While not so wonderfully experimental and epic in length as Physical Graffiti, it is, pound for pound, the strongest of Zep's efforts (note: this doesn't mean it's my favorite).<br /><br />Every song on this album is an instant classic, from the back and forth calling of voice and guitar in \\"Black Dog,\\" to the driving riff rocker \\"Rock and Roll,\\" and on and on, every song here is in top form, to the more delicate and atmospheric \\"The Battle of Evermore,\\" and the blues classic-gone-heavy \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\"  It's all great.<br /><br />Of course, no review is complete without mentioning \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" possibly Zep's most famous song, but to say that that one piece defines this album is to have a very limited understanding of the albums magnificence.  \\"Stairway\\" is great, if overplayed, but the greatest albums aren't based on the quality of their \\"hits\\" but on that of their in-betweens.  While hits may create album sales, its the overall quality of each and every song that makes an album worth repeated listens, rather than listening with frequent visits to the skip button.<br /><br />The quality of the album can be thought of thusly: \\"Stairway\\" would make a nearly perfect album closer on a (classic) hard rock album.  It's nearly eight minutes makes it epic in length, it is varied in its style from soft and vocal driven with an almost tender guitar part, to hard with a killer solo and rougher, louder vocals, and it's generally a well written and played piece of music.  It is everything one could want in an album closer to leave a strong and lasting impression on listeners.  But on Led Zeppelin [IV], it's the midpoint.  The album returns straightaway to a hard rockin' effort on \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"<br /><br />There's really not enough good I can say about this album.  In my youth, I resisted Zeppelin.  I didn't even give them a fair shake until I was a bit older.  And, as someone who still resists most mainstream music (at least current mainstream music), I can sympathize with anyone who resists the garbage that the music industry wants to force feed us.  But when I finally listened, I immediately understood why Zeppelin had such appeal...they're damned fine musicians!  This isn't the typical garbage of the mainstream, but a band that was so good that their unique approach to rock n' roll BECAME the mainstream.<br /><br />Great album!til I was a bit older.

B000VR824S|5.0|Different from first Crossorads Festival on DVD ( the one held in Texas in 2004), was the following: (1) this one took place in the Chicago area in July of 2007; (2) had comedian Bill Murray as a host, beginning the festivities and humorously introducing many of the performers; (3) had some new faces at the concert.    Of the performers that were not on the 2004 DVD, the ones I enjoyed the most were Albert Lee (incredibly-fast hands), Susan Tedeschi, Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood and Derek Trucks. Of the new faces, none was more startling than Beck's young bass player: Tal Wilkenfeld.    I have to admit I do not understand why Willie Nelson and Sheryl Crow were there, as this was a guitar festival and neither one is known for that particular talent.     Speaking of talent, here's 10 guitarists, just offhand, I'd love to see if Eric keeps hosting these festivals: Mark Knopfler, Mick Taylor, Ronnie Earl, Keith Richards, Peter Green, Dave Mason, Jack Bruce, Sue Foley, Walter Trout and Robben Ford. I'm sure I left out a ton of other great guitarists, but those just came to mind.    There were touching moments in this all-day concert, too, and you can see the love Eric has with King and Winwood. The whole thing, really, is one big love affair the artists share for each other and the good cause for the concert. Speaking of that, the $20 you shell out for this four hours of music all goes to rehab center in Antigua.    Overall, this is another outstanding Crossroads Guitar Festival and I just hope they keep coming!
B000000QFV|4.0|Despite being from neither the  Ozzy nor the Dio led era, this is some strong  Sabbath, behind some great vocal work from Tony Martin.  Continuing the tendency toward a variety of metal more closely associated with power metal than with the menacing doom metal tendencies of their earliest years or the more experimental material from the later half of the Ozzy era, Sabbath puts out an album that is fast paced and aggressive, and it genuinely sounds as if they're enjoying making the music on this album.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Michael Mann proves again, with this film, that he comprehends the minds and machinations of criminals better than just about anyone else.  He gives these characters depth, complexity, and crackling dialogue as he takes us deep into their world and their way of thinking and behaving.<br />Tom Cruise is so good in the role of the criminal Vincent that after a few minutes, you will forget who it is you're watching.  Jamie Foxx is also expertly cast as the unlucky cab driver, Max, who is forced to go along on a dangerous, all-night ride through the streets of L.A. as Vincent forces him to drive him from one \\"hit\\" to another.<br />Jada Pinkett Smith also performs well as an earlier fare who ends up embroiled in the mess and nearly loses her life.<br />Mann lovingly photographs the city and adds the usual perfectly chosen songs to fill out the story.<br />Highly recommended and probably underrated.
B000002JSN|5.0|By the time 1975's Physical Graffiti rolled around, Led Zeppelin had stored up more spare rock n' roll credibility than most bands ever come within triple platinum of, and they were prepared to use it to record a masterpiece that went beyond any expected norm.  While perhaps not so densely packed with great tracks as Led Zeppelin II and Led Zeppelin [IV], Zeppelin's 1975 effort is a phenomenal piece of rock n' roll, with clear inspiration and experimentation in some many different directions.  While the back to back \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and \\"Kashmir\\" are the only widely known (i.e. known by fans who don't own the album) tracks, this album shows both the scope of Zep's musical vision and talent better than any other album and, of course, that's primarily because this is about 30 minutes longer than any of their first five albums...extra time which gives the band a good deal of freedom to explore a wide variety of approaches to their bluesy rock, with tips of the cap to classical, bluegrass, and other genres.  The album also continues the fantastic work done on 1973's Houses of the Holy, which I believe was their first album to break away from the blues tradition of re-recording classic blues numbers (some have criticized Zep for this, but it's been done in the blues for a very long time and, as a blues based band, Zep were simply doing what their idols had done).  The lack of earlier blues or traditional songs makes this album wholly Zeppelin, and it just feels more Zeppelin (if that makes sense) than does  Houses, their first such effort.
B000V86OKG|4.0|I just finished watching the highly enjoyable 2nd season of Dexter.  Like the first season, it's a highly entertaining, clever, original show with good writing and some very good characters.  The first part of this review focuses on the series, and the second part focuses on season 2 in particular.<br /><br />I won't go too much into the story as 200 people have already done that, but Dexter is a Miami cop (a lab nerd, really, he analyzes blood spatters) who moonlights as a serial killer. The twist is, he only murders \\"bad\\" people (most of whom he finds via his job working in homocide). The series explores how Dexter, who feels very little emotion, blends in with society and \\"fakes\\" being human, with some interesting and sometimes comical results.<br /><br />Aside from the aspect of the show incorporating Dexter's struggle to fit in with society, I completely disagree with all the reviews that claim Dexter provides a view \\"inside the mind of a serial killer\\". Please - Dexter is fiction in the truest since of the word, the series isn't realistic, which is fine with me because as far as I can tell it isn't trying to be realistic. If you want to get \\"inside the mind\\" of a killer, you shouldn't be looking to fiction (instead watch any of the number of true crime shows on channels such as A&E, or watch HBO's excellent interviews of The Iceman, which are available on DVD via Amazon or a good rental store/website). But you are truly doing yourself a great disservice if you are fooling yourself into thinking this fictitious story represents the mind of a killer - real serial killers really are monsters, and Dexter has more in common with Batman than most real world serial killers.  This paragraph wasn't meant to detract from the show, as I don't think it's creators are trying to realistically portray a serial killer, but rather to address what I think are some misleading reviews.<br /><br />Rather, the gist of this story is a tale, or rather a question, of morality: is Dexter good or evil? Sure, he's a bloodthirsty serial killer who brutally hacks his victims apart, and he takes enjoyment in it. But his victims are people that the world is better off without, and whom the criminal justice system has failed to get off the streets. And, while he may be emotionally detached, when he's not hacking people up he's an all around pretty decent guy (good brother, good boyfriend, good son, good employee, good \\"father figure\\" to his girlfriend's kids ...), and he lives by a strict, if bizarre, ethical code, which is more than we can say for most of us.<br /><br />If you have a somewhat dark sense of humor and an open mind (no this isn't a straight up comedy, but there are a number of comical elements), then definately check Dexter out. I think this is a very entertaining series, one of the best currently on television and certainly worth watching if you can deal with a little gore and a somewhat disturbing subject matter.  This definately brings Showtime onto my radar screen, as Dexter rivals many of the excellent series found on HBO.<br /><br />*******************<br /><br />Season 2 specifically:<br /><br />I'm not going to go into too much detail on the story, as several reviewers have already done so (and some have IMO given away far too much of the story, thanks for the spoilers, guys).<br /><br />But in Season 2, the focus at the Miami PD is the search for Dexter himself - that's right, some of his victims have been, err, discovered, and the search is on for a serial killer even more deadly than The Ice Truck Killer.  Dexter, naturally, views the investigation from the inside, with some interesting results.  On his personal life, Dexter developes hugely as a person - by the end of the series, he almost seems human.<br /><br />Overall, Dexter is a very good show and Season 2 is just as good as Season 1, though the introduction of a new love interest gets old fast, and adds an almost soap-opera like aspect of the show that I didn't really like.  But if you enjoyed Season 1, definately continue the series into it's second season.  I'll be looking forward to a third season.nto it's second season.  I'll be looking forward to a third season.
B000001DVD|4.0|Def Leppard have a reputation of being a fairly poppy band, and a far cry from the much heavier aspects of the NWOBHM.  This, to some credit, is based on their hits, which do have this tendency.  But this album, containing only one such hit, is miles away from what I expected it to be.  Rather than the overly pop-oriented rock you hear on the radio, what I found was a mix of the Def Leppard I knew and thoroughly un-pop hard rock bands, like AC/DC.  As such, the album is a complete surprise and one I recommend to any that are familiar with Def Leppard only from their radio play and music videos.

B000I0QKDS|4.0|I've never been able to get into Jeff Beck's later fusion material, but early on he was a bluesy rock n' roller, and this album showcases his talents in that light.  Rod Stewart does a great job on vocals, as well, on a combination of original compositions and blues covers.
0066214122|4.0|I'm surprised this story hasn't been turned into a movie....yet.<br /><br />The story is incredibly interesting. The concept is chilling and looming.<br /><br />On a scale from one to ten on readability it would get a nine. It was tedious at times.<br /><br />The style of writing make this book suspenseful, however, I found the characters to be horribly boring. I can't remember what any of the characters looked like, and I didn't feel anything for them at any point while reading this book.<br /><br />Also this book was not inspiring - but then again, I doubt a fast-read would be. I didn't remember any ideas from this book. In fact, I soon forgot about this book. It's a fun ride while you are on, but looking back, it wasn't very fruitful.
B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden's early albums, with Paul Di'Anno on vocals, was a rawer, rougher Maiden, that more obviously drew influence from bands like Black Sabbath than they did in later years.  While the sound is not so technical or an polished and precise as it became a few years later, early Maiden is thoroughly enjoyable both as its own piece of metal history and for the obvious contrasts it presents with later, and more famous Maiden.<br /><br />Iron Maiden, the self-titled 1980 debut, is a fantastic piece of metal, before Maiden had a truly distinct and defined sound.  Songs like \\"Prowler\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" (which doesn't appear, apparently, on this very first issue) have clear Sabbath-esque tendencies (and who can blame them?) in their heavy, thick riffs and even the guitar solos sound like something that could have come from the fingers of Tony Iommi.  That's not to say that the band is purely a copy cat act.  In an era where punk seemed to be recently dominant, Maiden played with a level of songwriting and musicianship that rarely finds its way into the stripped down aesthetic of most punk music.<br /><br />Maiden also, on this earliest album, showed initial inclinations toward writings based on horror, mythology, and the supernatural, and it's a fair consideration to wonder whether Bruce Dickinson's later lyrics written in that same vein were to the purpose of continuing a theme with which the band's fans were familiar.<br /><br />Without question, there are a number of very strong tracks on this album, and it's an interesting and worthwhile piece of the Maiden catalog, even if it is overlooked by fans of their most famous era.  My only wish is that Paul Di'Anno could have been coaxed back to the band during the period of Dickinson's absence (1995's The X Factor and 1998's Virtual XI), giving us two more of these \\"raw\\" Maiden efforts and bringing the band full circle.<br /><br />Up the Irons!

0143038419|5.0|This was the author's story, not mine. But reading this book changed MY life. I was reading it when I left my husband and realized it is okay to be 28 and divorced and I CAN start my life over. I realized that the people you love want to help and want nothing in return. I read the portion I have quoted below while living between my parents and my friend's guest rooms and felt like my life was falling apart. Everyone I have spoken to about this book took something different away from it. This is my favorite part, and sums up my new perspective: \\"In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices.\\"
B000063DFN|5.0|In my opinion, this is Iron Maiden's best effort.  While not as famous, perhaps, as their most recognized album, the slightly overrated The Number of the Beast, Powerslave remains a must-have metal album and a Maiden classic.<br /><br />From opening number \\"Aces High,\\" it's clear that Maiden are putting their best foot forward on this album, and it's worth owning for this track alone.  \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" is the only real \\"hit\\" from the album, but among such a collection of songs, it doesn't stand out as the best, head and shoulders above the others, but as one of many great pieces.  \\"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\\" is the album's sole instrumental piece, and a strong one at that, with the thumping bass really driving the song, before \\"Flash of the Blade,\\" an album highlight, sets a slightly darker tone with its melodies.<br /><br />While the album is great, I've always found \\"The Duellists\\" to be the album's weakest point.  Not a bad track, mind you.  The vocals/lyrics are not quite up to the level of the others, though some excellent guitar work makes up for it.  This leads into \\"Back in the Village,\\" which is meant to be the sequel to Piece of Mind's \\"The Trooper,\\" and really sets a great tone for the second half of the album.<br /><br />Another highlight of the album is the title track, \\"Powerslave,\\" which is a killer track with darker lyrics and great riffing...just an excellent track.<br /><br />The album finishes in prime Maiden fashion, with an epic, atmospheric track, in \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\"  Classic Maiden.<br /><br />Up the Irons!
B00023BLXK|2.0|I was really hoping to enjoy this movie, really, I was.  It was just so lame.  The acting WAS horrible...it seemed forced among all actors.  Their was NO chemistry between the main characters.  Even the cameo with Patrick Swayze was ridiculous!  He had no spirit in him.  It was almost as if the writers wanted him to bring (tie in) these movies together.  Ugh..maybe you should see it just to say you did, but rent it first before wasting your money on poor acting.<br />BTW, if you are seeing it to see Swayze, he LOOKS horrible.  His face lift makes him look, well, fake.  It's just a bit too tight.  He was extremely \\"fine\\" in the original DD.
B00008WT5C|4.0|A killer album from Bon and the boys, this one's a non-stop rock n' roll assault.  There's no sense in describing an AC/DC album in too much detail.  There are killer riffs, a few Angus Young solos worth writing home about, probably a couple of songs you've heard get some good radio play (most notably \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" and \\"Problem Child\\" on this album), and a lot of songs you never hear on the radio which still manage to kick a$$ and make you want to have a good time.  All the \\"filler\\" here is good, and \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" has to be one of the best songs about sex ever...these guys will tell it like it is!
B00006AW2M|4.0|Excerpts from from Perfect Sound Forever feature, Feb. 2008:    And that's why Satanic Majesties is arguably the boldest piece of work the Stones ever conceived. Despite its flaws, it's a radical departure from the norm that few artists have ever attempted. For one time only, it seems, The Stones ditched their monochromatic sound and worldview for a multihued, anything-goes mindset that really was \\"like a rainbow,\\" to paraphrase the disc's only major hit song.    ...    Here, they morphed into a different band, much the way XTC did when they developed their psychedelic \\"alter ego,\\" The Dukes of Stratosphere. There is no song on Satanic Majesties that could ever have easily fit on another Stones album. The rocking \\"Citadel\\" comes close, but its angular, stop-start rhythms and metaphorical, storybook lyrics (ostensibly about Andy Warhol's New York City scene) are far from typical Stones fare. Also, the R&B drive that fuels almost every other Stones LP is completely missing. Songs don't plow over you; they slowly seduce you with art rock arrangements. Brian Jones purportedly plays no guitar at all on this album.    The mold-breaking qualities of Satanic Majesties spawned a cult audience, but not amongst most Stones fans. This album tends to turn up in the collections of psychedelic music or art rock fans. One high-profile enthusiast is Peter Gabriel. The former Genesis front man said in the Jan. 1983 issue of Trouser Press magazine that \\"For me, Satanic Majesties is far more interesting than (The Stones') other albums because they were trying to do something a little different. But they got so slagged off by the press and avoided by the public that they decided, I think, never to take such a risk again. That's a pity.    More at Perfect Sound Forever.
B000000OSE|5.0|Part of a two album masterpiece, Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I provides a slightly more straight up, bluesy, rock n' roll approach than its counterpart, Use Your Illusion II, which is somewhat more experimental.  I've heard a few complaints that the Illusion albums are overproduced, and I can't honestly say that I understand this complaint.  They're certainly enormous in scope, far beyond what Appetite for Destruction reached for, but what exactly does it mean for something to be overproduced?  In truth, these complaints are from those who wanted Appetite Part II and didn't get it.  But on to the album itself...<br /><br />UYI I is a nasty bit of rock n' roll.  Aggressive, full of attitude, and showcasing any number of GNR's influences.  From the the guttural base line that starts off \\"Right Next Door to Hell\\" through the powerfully epic \\"Coma,\\" the album is a true rock n' roll roller coaster.  Most of the tracks are hard rockers, with exceptional guitar work from Slash, that would have fit in just fine with the Appetite material, though they're effectively balanced out with the slower tracks, the move from the aggressive \\"Perfect Crime\\" to the Stones-esque \\"You Ain't the First\\" being a perfect example.  Want something bluesy?  They got bluesy rock in spades, with \\"Bad Obsession,\\" \\"Bad Apples,\\" and a number of other tunes.  Soaring atmospheric rock?  Sure, try \\"Coma\\" or \\"November Rain.\\"  It's all here, and it's all great!<br /><br />The true measure of a great album, I've always felt, is not in the quality of its hits.  Rather, the so-called \\"filler\\" is far more important in creating a great album.  Do listeners skip over the songs between the hits, or do those songs quickly become favorites?  It's a daunting task, with the Illusion albums, for any of the in-betweens to truly be favorites, as there are so many hits between the two albums.  But, nevertheless, UYI I succeeds in this, with the \\"filler\\" making a good album great.<br /><br />So, what's my definition of over produced?  As far as I'm concerned, it means that this album is able to kick your a$$ in many more ways than one.ar as I'm concerned, it means that this album is able to kick your a$$ in many more ways than one.
B000000OY9|1.0|I had the unfortunate experience of hearing this album again last week which reminded me why I traded in this piece of garbage years ago in college. This is hands down \\"THE WORST NEIL ALBUM EVER\\"!    Electric drum kit? Please. At least it fits the trend of the '80s....his worst album would be released during the worst music decade. Do yourself a favor and save your ears...don't buy or even listen to this album unless you need a laxative.
B000002KDO|5.0|This is the album that, without question, completely sold me on Black Sabbath.  I'm not sure what did it, but I remember a rush of excitement the first time I heard the crushing riffs and  Ozzy's tinny vocals on \\"Sweet Leaf,\\" and my outlook on music hasn't been the same since.  For a long time, this was my favorite Sabbath effort, and it remains a genre classic that rarely gets the radio play it so obviously deserves.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Other Amazon reviewers have done a good job in describing the story line of this historically significant film, so I will give you my opinion on the artistic and technical merits of this fantastic production.    The actors were superb, right down to the smallest roles. The set designs and filming locations transport you right into late 18th century England. The scene lighting was perfect and never looked artificial. The costume design and hair/makeup were outstanding. The cinematography was at the pinnacle of the art form- even the scenes in the rain looked like you were actually there. The soundtrack was extremely clean, never muddy, and the background music and title themes were terrific. I didn't see the film on the big screen, but if my DVD is any indication, it must have been phenominal!    How many more ways could I say the film was good and that I enjoyed it? Another reviewer stated his/her disbelief that this movie was ignored for an Oscar, and I second that. The only other comment I can make is that you should check out the stirring rendition of the religious hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\" at the end of the movie. It features a military bagpipe and drum corps accompanied by a military band, and it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|Perhaps the definitive album from The Allman Brothers Band was this live recording, which demonstrates their musical prowess more than any studio recording ever could.  This might be the best live album ever recorded.
6304806418|5.0|Based on the broadway show, Evita tells the rise of Juan and Eva Peron and their takeover of Argentina. The musical numbers are excellent and Madonna's voice truly does justice to this film. And let's face it: Madonna is truly in her element playing a character who fails as a movie actress and sleeps her way to fame. Even bad chemistry is chemistry, I suppose.
B00008BXJJ|4.0|A strong live record, though it probably draws a bit too much from the Brian Johnson era (or, to say it better, not enough from the Bon Scott era.  This album is offers up a strong contrast with AC/DC's first live album, If You Want Blood, You've Got It, and it's clear that the transition from gritty, dirty, barroom rock n' roll to a more grandiose, occasionally less bluesy style, has been completed.  While my preference lies with the former, I'm not one to argue that there's only one proper AC/DC, and this is a nice offering of mostly later material.

B000H7JD4A|4.0|Oh, how this album makes me sad!  Not because it's bad, of course, but because it's some of the best songwriting that Iron Maiden have done...ever!  But as their songwriting and cohesiveness as a group have increased, so too have Bruce Dickinson's vocal abilities decreased.  This should come as no surprise.  The great Maiden frontman has aged considerably since first appearing on 1982's The Number of the Beast.  And, of course, you have to applaud his willingness to go out there and give it his all.  But, sadly, there's some rust on those pipes, and he can't quite pull off this stellar material like he used to.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong!  This album is still very strong.  It's also one of their darker and more cerebral offerings and certainly worth owning (I do!).  I just wish it had been written fifteen years ago.
068485743X|5.0|I so loved this book. I have read it twice, and will keep it for a reference.<br /><br />Problems found in writing are grouped in chapters.

B000002KFJ|5.0|One of Black Sabbath's best, though you wouldn't know it by listening to radio, with its insistence that the only worthwhile Sabbath is from Paranoid.  But what the Hell do they know?<br /><br />I enjoy a good many of the tracks on this album enough to count them among my favorite Sabbath tracks (\\"Hole in the Sky\\" and \\"The Writ\\" in particular, but the others are also great).  It's a different Sabbath album, and I've always thought this was their album most akin to hard rock, rather than the metal genre that they were so instrumental in founding.<br /><br />Their best?  No.<br /><br />Still amazing?  Yup.
B000RZIGSG|4.0|As a young girl I saw this movie and it has stayed with me ever since. This was a kick-a** chick flick. The scene where Nick and Grunt were waiting with roses for Alex after she rocked the dance audition still gets to me. Alex is a modern day heroine. This film inspires you to follow your dreams and to never give up. Alex's spririt was just contagious. You felt her highs, lows and frustrations as a young person finding her way and could relate.  I love this film. Yes, this movie was a blockbuster,the soundtrack was a mega hit, and the cut-out, off the shoulder sweatshirt spawned a fashion frenzy, but that wasn't even a factor to me. I saw this movie after it went to video and had no idea of the film's popularity. To this day, in my opinion it remains one of the most inspirational films for women. The film's energy will resonate within you long after you see it. You care about the characters and what happens to them because they are just like you and I. Then of course there is the soundtrack. Back in the day I think I scrambled 2 flashdance soundtrack cassettes from playing it so often. Watch it and enjoy!
B00008WT5J|3.0|A decent album, released as a movie soundtrack, and including mostly previously released material.  But, since most of it can be found elsewhere, there's not really a good reason to own this one.  Maybe if you REALLY like \\"Who Made Who\\"...
0393061310|5.0|There is a whole industry of books that explain why the world is the way it is. They are all by definition reductive and fail to grasp the actual complexities of the development of humanity. But, that being said, Guns Germs and Steel is among the best.    I can boil down Diamond's argument into a couple sentences: Why has the west been the dominate power for the last couple centuries? Because the West had access to (you guessed it) guns, germs and steel. Why did they have access to guns germs and steel before everyone else? Accidents of geography and evolution.    That's pretty much it. If all you care about is the thesis, I have just saved you hours of reading time. If you're interested in how he got there, or want to feel humbled (as I did) because your range of knowledge is no where near Diamond's, then read the book for its brilliant explanation for why things are the way they are. You don't have to agree with everything Diamond argues to enjoy this one. Even at five hundred pages, it is reductive with too much of a reliance on technology as the explanation for the way the world has turned out, but it is still a magnificent read and guide for how to develop and explain an argument.
B000002P5W|5.0|Every time I think that Electric Ladyland is the true masterpiece by  The Jimi Hendrix Experience, I remember that \\"Little Wing,\\" one of the most commonly covered songs in rock n' roll (my estimation...not a statistical fact), is here on Axis: Bold as Love.  What can I say?  They're all masterpieces by most bands' standards!<br /><br />But this one definitely has its own vibe, and is a different beat from Ladyland and Are You Experienced?.  In some ways, it's his most experimental work and, though it doesn't top the more experimental numbers on Ladyland, it is, song to song, more varied and unique.  The first half of this album is really just amazing, and as strong as anything this band ever did.
0895260131|5.0|This book was very popular while my unit was in Afghanistan. It's very useful to help wrap your brain around some of the fundamental differences in Islamic vs western thinking. Forget the golden rule forget live and let live. Anyone who thinks they are informed about Islam should at least read this book, agree with it 100% or not.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Nothing too inventive here, but Jet revisit some earlier and much missed rock n' roll styles.  Some say they're an AC/DC clone, but as a big Acca Dacca fan, I just don't see it.  Just because they play some rock n' roll, doesn't make them an AC/DC clone.<br /><br />There's some good stuff here, and some mediocre stuff as well.  I like the harder rock material (\\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" & \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" for example), but it's a bit too soft, overall, for my palate.<br /><br />There seems to be a bit of a rock revival with bands like Jet and Wolfmother (seriously, what's in the Aussie water?), but they don't quite live up to the standards set by the classics of the genre.<br /><br />Fairly enjoyable, nevertheless.
1594489505|5.0|Unbelievable!  I loved this story of a girl who grew up struggling in a world with total male domination and how she suffered through it physically and emotonally in so many ways and persevering until the end.  I would read this book again and again!  I can't wait to read The Kite Runner!
B000001F7R|3.0|A much rawer Def Leppard than found on later albums, though it suffers somewhat from poor production and vocals that generally miss the mark.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|One of the most enjoyable DVD concerts that I have seen.  What made this so entertaining  - and I have seen it several times - is the obvious enjoyment this trio - Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon had in singing and interacting with each other in a casual, not formal, presentation of their music.  Absolutely delightful   Definitely all five star performances.
B0000067L4|4.0|It's always a strange album that features both live and studio recordings, as it so clearly shows the capabilities of a band in both settings.  Some bands were studio masters while others were only truly captured on stage.  And, though they did some very good studio work, Cream is clearly one of the latter, as this album shows.  The live effort is very good...bluesy, soulful, and possessing a very rich, full sound.  The studio work, on the other hand, isn't up to par with their best material, and sounds out of place after the live tracks.<br /><br />It adds up to a bi-polar album, but one that is still worth spinning.
0375758992|1.0|Okay, now as a former and recovering English major I'm going to admit that Ms. Fuller is actually a decent writer, But I do want to point out a few things the other reviews don't cover.  First, Ms. Fuller is stridently politically correct and distorts the historical facts of the former Rhodesia in an effort to demonize the whites.  The distortion does border on reverse racism, however much I hate to trot out the r-word.  Secondly, this woman is absolutely obsessed with toilet functions and other bodily things and takes any opportunity to describe them--particularly her own. She takes an almost narciscisstic delight in describing herself in these terms.
B000N3ST9I|3.0|What to say?  It's heavy.  It's got groove.  So far, so good.  But the songs get a little repetitive and it borders on metalcore a bit much for my tastes.  Good, though.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|MY children loved the movie at the theatre, and now they can love it in the comfort of home. If you have not seen it, I highly reccomend it!
B000002B2X|4.0|Their shortest album, Alice in Chains's Sap also houses some of their most compelling harmonies.  The true appeal of this band was always been the harmonization of Layne Staley's vocals, with those of Jerry Cantrell, which creates a very haunting vocal performance and conveys a sense of musical emotion better than most other acts I've heard.  I believe this EP uses other vocalists in the harmonies, as well as the Layne/Jerry combo, and this is the strongest vocal performance on any AiC album.  It's worth owning for the first two tracks alone!
B000EGF0NW|4.0|While not always pleasant to read, I found Lucky more compelling and much more likeable than that drivel-fest book, The Lovely Bones. Lucky is a blunt first-hand account of surviving rape, and its long-term effects on the victim, including physical and emotional trauma and, consequentially, its indirect impact on the victim's loved ones. I'd recommend it to all women, if not for reading pleasure, then at least as an eye-opener.
B00008OLIC|5.0|One of the best by the  Cr&uuml;e, Dr. Feelgood offers up a heapin' helpin' of blues infused, hard rockin' music.  \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is a classic track, and is complemented by other killer stuff such as \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" and \\"Sticky Sweet,\\" as well as four (!) other well known Cr&uuml;e tracks in \\"Kickstart My Heart,\\" \\"Without You,\\" \\"Same Ol' Situation,\\" and \\"Don't Go Away Mad.\\"<br /><br />This is, in many ways, the Cr&uuml;e's pinnacle.  Not so raw as early efforts like Too Fast for Love and Shout at the Devil, but with superior songwriting and performance than albums like Theatre of Pain and Girls, Girls, Girls, Dr. Feelgood is the culmination of all those early years, in one great album!<br /><br />Great Cr&uuml;e!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This is definitely added to my all-time favorites list. I loved it. Not just one, but Three awesome muscle cars. (The last horror movie to have a decent car in it was Phantasm, ffs!) The soundtrack is great. Kurt Russell as Stunt Man Mike - rocks. You get a likeable psycho, plenty of gore, a muscle car high speed crash that leaves out No details, a car chase & six females. There's even a backwoods hillbilly in the mix.....
B00008WT5E|5.0|Only in the rarest of cases have I heard a track from AC/DC's Powerage get radio play, yet it may, in fact, be their best album.  This album has no \\"hits,\\" in the manner of Back in Black or Highway to Hell, but what it has aplenty are great, hard rockin' songs and some of the best writing the band has done.  The first five tracks are all worthy of being compared to anything the band has done, and it's really just an incredible album all around.
B00000HZFH|5.0|These guys are amazing. I really wish they are more well known. They write absolutely gorgeous music. Some of the melodies and harmonies these guys come with are amazing. I highly recommend any of their albums. To bad warner brothers does not do enough for them. That is my opinion at least.
B000002KHB|5.0|Many consider this to be Deep Purple's greatest effort.<br /><br />They're right.<br /><br />But it isn't because of \\"Smoke on the Water\\" that Machine Head is such an amazing album, despite the fact that the general public incessantly refuses to acknowledge that this band wrote any other songs.  Rather, the entire album is fantastic, from the droning \\"Highway Star,\\" to the groovy \\"Maybe I'm a Leo,\\" all the way through closer \\"Space Truckin'.\\"  There really isn't a weak point on this album.
B000X3VN46|5.0|It's rare to find an artist that isn't afraid to be progressive. 98% of music today is processed pablum. Being a Nightwish fan I eagerly awaited both Dark Passion Play and Tarja's CD. I was majorly dissapointed with Dark Passion Play but not with this CD. Tarja was able to bring the emotion and mystery of the old Nightwish songs to life and she does the same here. She creates the imagery of mystic goddess no matter what she sings. I would not recommend this to someone who isn't willing to open their minds and ears to a different sound. It is unique. If this is about her experience with Nightwish - so be it - she carried the band to some great things and she is entitled to express is just as the band is entitled to express their feelings with Dark Passion Play. Great artists conjur great emotion, that's what makes the music enter your soul. Nightwish no longer touches my soul. Tarja's does. If you thinks she's lost the gothic goddess don't be fooled and check out Die Alive on YouTube. I recommend this for those who like progressive music. Buy the CD, put it on, sit back close your eyes and let the goddess take you on a journey.
B0000028M7|4.0|While not so melodically haunting as either Sap or Jar of Flies, Dirt stands out as Alice in Chains's early masterpiece, with a number of amazing tracks that define the band and their sound.
B000AADYYO|5.0|You know, I'm not sure that I liked Opeth all that much at first. I didn't really \\"get\\" them for a while. But of course, I really hadn't heard very much from them at that point. I was a little put off by the growling, really I think that was all. I had heard a bit of \\"Deliverance\\" and that was about it.     I bought this cd sort of on a wim, because something in me, perhaps in my subconscious, new they were special. And then I awoke from my slumber. Once I heard him sing the beginning two vocal parts on \\"Ghost of Perdition,\\" along with the spectacular riffs, I nearly weeped. I had just bought a new and fantastic stereo and literally had chills.     From blazing, spectacular hard metal riffs to beautiful, clean acoustic pieces, growling to pristine vocals, these guys really do it all. And they do it very well. I'm not a huge fan of death metal (not that I consider them death metal) and am very particular about screaming, growling metal bands. But there are some good ones out there. None better than Opeth as displayed on \\"Ghost Reveries.\\" I am never turning back.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|They could not have picked better episodes. Very strong material and you know it watches good even today! Of course two better character actors in James Garner and Jack Kelly were not to be found in those days. They made the episodes fun to watch. As a kid, I could not wait each week to see what Bret and Bart were up to next! It would certainly be nice to have ALL the episodes in some sort of box set.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|I first heard about Airbourne due to the fact that the group's song \\"Stand Up For Rock 'N Roll\\" was the Official WWE Royal Rumble theme. So I checked them out on MySpace as well, gave a listen & I was instantly hooked! & Yes as everyone can clearly point out they sound just like AC/DC! so if your a fan of AC/DC, Hard Rock & like to crank up your Music Loud & Rock Out then go BUY THIS CD NOW!!!! I give it 5 out of 5 Stars.
038572179X|4.0|This book started off slow for me, but after Robbie types his letter, I couldn't put it down.  The ending was like a punch in the gut though.  Also, the book is far better and more descriptive than the movie.  McEwan is an amazing writer.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Deception has always been an interesting theme, but hardly as well presented as in \\"Closer\\", and in spades. Other reviewers were put off by it, but in the hands of Master Mike Nichols, this is only another classic in the history of the subject (Shakespeare, Oedipus Rex, Lysistrata, etc.). This kind of deceit involves a bunch of pretty people, which may not include you nor I; still, similar things have probably happened to us that we can relate to.Naysaying reviewers might be in denial, but, fact is, the brilliant cast and author (and director) have presented a brutal and honest slice of ugliness that is difficult to ignore. We can only hope to learn, listen and grow from this. Jude Law, Clive Owen & Natalie Portman were applauded for their roles. I've always been a fan of Julia Roberts, and I thought she was their equal. All are appalling people, and there's no love to be lost for any of them. The change in time-frame was confusing, but added to the angst.  A thoughtful, thinking-persons film.The references to Mozart & Rossini throughout are appropriate.
B00005JPXY|5.0|This movie was different from any other movie out there.  It gives a situation no one would have thought of.  The monsters created by digital effects were incredible, completely different.  The small monsters created by the large one were the worst.  If you got bitten, you would seem okay but sometime later you will feel faint and explode.  The characters did a very good job portraying the action.  The scene at the end doesn't give you any insight except death so you have to see it and find out everything in between.  Anyone who goes for action/ horror I wouuld strongly recommend this move.
014305841X|4.0|Fascinating book,unfortunately read by someone who should be narrating romance novels.  A thoughtful, calm reading would have fit perfectly.  Instead, this performer tries to make every sentence sing, and dance, and stand on it's head.  It's a painful listening experience.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This documentary is simply amazing which reveals a lot of secrets of nature without exploiting it.
1853751960|2.0|I bought this book based solely on the great reviews it got here on Amazon.  I usually agree with majority opinion on books but I do not in the case of this book.  I found the material out-dated, uninteresting, and boring.  To be honest I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  It must have been written like 20+ years ago because all they talk about is print vs. radio or radio vs. TV.  I remember a line saying something along the lines of \\"TV is the greatest communication medium ever!\\"  That right there sums up the book IMHO.  The internet is here Mr. Ogilvy -- perhaps you're retired and/or don't care any more, but the rules of the game have changed.  Ogilvy on Advertising is antiquated.  I would recommend the books by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Positiong, etc. as an alternative.
630469878X|5.0|people have given pretty  accurate  desriptions and synopsis of this whole movie.  I would just like to add one thing on the plus and on the beware side.  First the beware  the scene  where geena davis is being attacked that is a little on the graphic side any woman who's ever been raped beware this could trigger  some traumatic memories.    One plus side is  Jimmy the boyfriend he turns out to be a more than all right guy he really tries to help them.    There are  also some great and memorable lines.  My  favorite  \\"YOU ARE DIS-TURBED\\"  \\"yes I  believe I am\\"  BTW  I like the ending.  If they were gonna go they were gonna go their own way not shot by  a swat  team.
B000002C1W|4.0|A broken album, in that it starts off great, and ends mediocre, this one is  David Gilmour's own composition, and is the band's first studio effort without Roger Waters.  Strong points include \\"Learning to Fly,\\" \\"Dogs of War,\\" and \\"On the Turning Away.\\"  Worth owning, if only for the first half.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|This is the first movie I remember seeing in the theater as a little girl so it'll always have a very special place in my  heart.    She didn't leave nothing to Edger  after all she provided him a very comfortable living  on the proviso he takes care of her cats.  At the end of their life span he would've gotten everything  left and that sounded like a good deal of  real estate  and $.    I loved Thomas Omalley the geese  and  rouqfort.  Especially a very funny momment where  this tiny mouse  is gathering the ally cats to help.  you see about 6-8 ally cats running terrified through the streets of paris trying to get there in time to save the day with a tiny mouse  waving his arms chasing them shouting wait you don't know the way.\\"  A parisian man seeing this looks at his bottle of wine and poars it out.  Maybe not one of disneys best but one of my all time favorites.
B000002U9W|4.0|Ahh!  Now we're starting to get into some serious Pink Floyd.  At this point, Floyd has distanced itself from the great, early Syd Barrett material, and is closing in on Roger Waters's own greatness.  I think of this album as the band's last, great experiment, before really finding their sound.  Some \\"get\\" this album...most don't, as it can be rather inaccessible.
B00005JPCF|3.0|I know they were trying to  cash in on the  market of  penguins as the popular animal thanks to march of the penguin and I do think there were a fair amount of funny parts.  However yes if you're trying to stick to realistic animation  there  are a great deal too many unrealistic and totally  illogical plot holes  to it.  Like  why would the zoo just turn loose a phenominal  tap dancing penguin  with a tracking device rather than keep him as a star money making  attraction?  I was  fond of Mumbles from the start.  As to the music choices  ok We all expose kids to pop music at an early  age.  so we have little right to complain about this movie doing the same.  I've seen and heard worse on  primetime  and  even cartoon network and disney channel.  I at 30  found this an interesting and entertaining near 2 hours of  mindless drivel.
B000002GBD|5.0|There's no questioning that this is one of Nazareth's best efforts.  For an oft overlooked band that didn't score a lot of hits (despite having a very long career), the album sure as Hell rocks hard!  Beginning with the familiar and constantly covered \\"Hair of the Dog,\\" the album gets off to a great start, before going into a true album highlight, \\"Miss Misery.\\"  Dan McCafferty's vocals are incredible throughout, especially so on \\"Beggars Day,\\" where he knocks out an incredibly powerful chorus, sounding like a deeper and richer version of Axl Rose, who seems to have clearly been inspired by McCafferty's vocals, going so far as to cover Nazareth on \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\".  \\"Beggars Day\\" bleeds right into \\"Rose in the Heather,\\" offering up an instrumental that plays more as the conclusion of the track before than as a separate track.  The album closes with \\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman\\" (I'm disappointed that Scotsmen wouldn't use the Scottish spelling of whisky), a bluesy number with some funky groove to it, and \\"Please Don't Judas Me,\\" which is a nice song that really focused on McCafferty's vocals, but which probably goes on in repetitive fashion for a little longer than it should.  But that's a minor criticism of a great album.  If all you know is \\"Hair of the Dog\\" and \\"Love Hurts\\" (which is now featured on the album in place of \\"Guilty), then you owe it to yourself to check out this album from a great, overlooked hard rock act.
B0000A0DRY|4.0|Surrealistic Pillow by Jefferson Airplane is a classic rock album from 1967. A lot of these songs have a psychedelic feel to it and how can you not love the hit singles Somebody to Love and White Rabbit. Frontwoman Grace Slick's voice is magic, her voice soars, swells, and belts like there's no tomorrow. Some of the tracks are a bit weak especially the songs Grace doesn't sing but overall this is an excellent album from it's time. Enjoy!
B000002U82|5.0|What can I possibly say about this album that hasn't already been said?  Roger Waters definitely finds his voice on this one, and the album has an incredible flow to it.  Many of the tracks are staples on classic rock radio, and to that end it is overplayed and perhaps a bit overrated.  But so many of these songs are classics, in every sense, it's difficult to give it less than stellar marks.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I've seen Blade Runner on VHS, Laserdisc and standard def. DVD and even in the theater and I have never seen it look this good! I know the movie very well and watching the Blu-Ray disc I'm noticing things I've never even noticed before throughout the movie. I can now notice all lot more subtle details.<br /><br />The image and sound quality is even better than what I experienced in the theater because the print in the theater was probably old and degraded. They really gave this high definition DVD the ultimate treatment when doing the transfer and it shows.<br /><br />Aside from all the extras like diferent versions of the film, the work print, the interviews and the commentaries (which all rock) the experience of this film is stunning! On my 60 inch HDTV I feel like there is nothing better.<br /><br />This is worth every penny! I consider it a must own!
B000002UA2|3.0|Pink Floyd doesn't like to make things easy, I guess, so before jumping into what many consider their masterpieces, they took another trip down film-scoring lane.  While an improvement over their earlier efforts in this area, the scoring leads to a less than cohesive album...one dictated by the events in the film, rather than the thoughts of the band's writers...and it suffers for it.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is, hands down, my favorite movie. It's gripping, dark, and beautiful-so rare nowadays.  A look at the flip side of fame, Joe Gillis narrates his descent into Norma Desmonds twisted fantasy world.  A true gem of a film, its script beautiful and its acting superb(Gloria Swanson's use of her eyes is breathtaking), plus the added bonus of cameos by old silent film stars and Cecil B Demile!   Buy this movie, and I guarantee you will be shocked, sickened, and awed by it.
B000001FMX|4.0|I don't care whether you call it punk or glam or just plain old rock n' roll, New York Dolls's self titled album is thoroughly fun and enjoyable!  From punk rockers like \\"Personality Crisis,\\" to hard rock like \\"Frankenstein,\\" to the oldies vibe on \\"Lonely Planet Boy,\\"  this is just a great album chock full of non-stop rock n' roll.
0143038419|3.0|This was one of my first Kindle downloads, so I got through it without the benefit of paper and ink.  The author writes well, and she makes the book tie together effectively.  She didn't make me like her--there is a certain superficial, flippant gloss to all she says--but the book was a pleasant read on a tropical balcony.  Most people her age cannot write, and she can.
B000002JR8|3.0|The follow up to Pantera's masterpiece, Vulgar Display of Power, this begins with the thrash and groove inspired \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" and after the first three tracks the album seems a bit heavier than its predecessor.  The band does a good job of varying tempos throughout, so the album rarely seems to drag on in monotony.  Phil Anselmo also tries some new things with his vocals, which have taken on a somewhat more brutal tone.  Unlike the higher screams from their earlier albums, and the raspy yell from Vulgar, he occasionally (on \\"Slaughtered,\\" for example) uses a lower growl, which borders on a more extreme metal vocal.<br /><br />While the album certainly isn't weak, it does lack that certain something that they achieved on Vulgar, where almost all of the tracks were noteworthy.  On this release we find a number of strong tracks, but no real killer material that leaves you wanting more.  The grooves aren't as strong as they're capable of, and the material, overall, is just not as amazing as I expect having heard on Vulgar what the band can do.  Good...but not a great one.
0099470438|4.0|This review is definitely mixed. Just as the book changes from plot to a math problem suddenly, that's how I feel about the book. The book, written from the perspective of an autistic 15 year old boy is so different from anything I've ever read. I love that it's different and I hate that it's different. (I have the same relationship with this book that I have with the movie \\"Gone with the Wind. I hate it. I love it.)    The plot is interesting, unique and heart wrenching. Reading the things that this boy does and says and thinks is such a different experience. Through Christopher, the main character, we get a sense of feeling from the people he writes about. He writes about the characters reactions, and through that, we can imagine their feelings.    While the plot is interesting and heart wrenching, it's not told that way. It is told practically void of emotion. In a part of the book, Christopher is reading a tragic letter full of emotion and probably written while crying. After he reads it, he simply tries to figure the letter out. It isn't sad. It's more curious to him. It practically drives me crazy. It's not apathy, but who he is.    The book is written skillfully. The chapters are written on seemingly unrelated topics sometimes, just as an autistic person would write. The sentences are very much like the title. I would describe the book as choppy, because of the language used. It is interesting trying to read the book out loud. Sometimes doing so, you have to stop and think about what it is you just read. I imagine it is much like it would be if an autistic person was speaking.    Trying to understand the language and the thoughts of the narrator is half of the book. I think you might see how that could be slightly annoying. It's almost like going to a different culture. The language is difficult to understand and the culture and thoughts are too. However, when you go to another culture, while hard, the experience is richly rewarding.    Overall, the experience of this book is richly rewarding. The book provides challenge for the reader and great satisfaction. The book is different and for that I highly recommend it.
B00006AW2G|4.0|Leading off with the stellar \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" followed by the twangy country blues number \\"Love in Vain,\\" The Rolling Stones immediately show their two greatest talents on this 1969 album, those being the ability to write a killer \\"hit\\" track, as well as to fill out an album with songs you wouldn't necessarily expect from a band described as being a rock n' roll act.  I've always been amazed at the differences between Mick Jagger's vocals on their more country tracks, where he sings with a nasal whine, and the more rocking tracks (or, at least, the slightly less country tracks), where his voice can be deeper and, generally richer, and nowhere is this more apparent than in \\"Country Honk,\\" versus \\"Midnight Rambler.\\"  The classic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" closes out the album, which is really just a great piece of songwriting.  I have, however, always wondered at the inclusion of the choir, which seems unnecessary and, in honesty, takes away from the song.<br /><br />All in all, a good offering from the Stones.  Better than its predecessor, Beggars Banquet, which follows the country theme to a fault, this album plugs in and rocks enough to give it more variety.
B00005JPTI|1.0|I expected this to be a great movie. I was so wrong. 45 minutes into the movie, I was praying that it would get better. 75% of this movie is SO BORING, nothing that happened with the virus that made everyone into zombies is never explained, nor does the movie explain even why some people are immune. To me, this was just another zombie movie that someone spent WAY too much money to make. Don't waste your time or money at the theaters, wait for the DVD unless you like to be disappointed.
B000024D4R|5.0|After writing what would become two of their truly classic albums, this album comes off as an \\"in-between\\" to most casual listeners, and as a hidden gem to most dedicated fans.  Another of those \\"I've never heard this on the radio\\" albums, this one has all of the things that have made Pink Floyd an iconic name.  Two very short, simple tracks, surround three magnificent, epic tracks, each with a very different feel to it.  I'm uncertain as to whether this has ever been confirmed, but many consider this album to have been based on the animal hierarchy set up in George Orwell's Animal Farm, and the presence of tracks entitled \\"Pigs,\\" \\"Dogs,\\" and \\"Sheep\\" certainly lends credence to that theory.  However, unlike Orwell's criticism of Marxism, this plays more as a general criticism of political blindness and the abuse of power.  A great album!
B00025ETIW|5.0|Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the three best CDs in the world!!!! i recommend 3 Cheers for almost everyone!!! But of course, I'm a huge MCR fan, so how can I not recommend it! :] If you get this, make sure you get Bullets and TBP. My favorite song off this album at the moment would have to be It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's a F**cking Deathwish.
B000002U8G|4.0|A very strong album, closing with what many think is their best track, \\"Echoes,\\" which comes in at over 23 minutes in length.  We're really starting to see a more cohesive Pink Floyd at this point.  David Gilmour has really found his own voice, with his guitar playing, Roger Waters's writing is settling into that sound that is easily definable as being Pink Floyd, and the band is, generally, in very good form.  A great album that you won't likely hear on classic rock radio.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|=] I don't see how anyone can NOT like this CD. My friends (who have no taste in music, haha) actually like this CD!!! Even my DAD likes it. My favorite track at the moment off of this album would have to be Famous Last Words or Cancer. And one more thing, MCR is NOT, NOT, NOT emo.
B00008AWOG|4.0|A beautiful album, with mind-bending riffs, and a stunning combination of clean and death vocals.  Opeth have really demonstrated some ability, here.  Impressive!
B00005PJ6M|4.0|A sequel to a film as unique as BILL & TED bred skepticism at the time, I'm sure, but little did the world know what was going to be in store for our two dim-bulbs this time. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return as Ted \\"Theodore\\" Logan and Bill S. Preston, Esq., respectively, now 5 years older but not a second wiser. They're about to perform at the Battle of the Bands, their bodacious babes from medieval England (Iowa) have agreed to marry them, and their legacies are still in order. Life would seem perfect for our rock heroes, that is if it weren't for the maniacal De Nomolos (Joss Ackland), who has created two evil robot versions of Bill and Ted to go back in time and kill their human selves (and subsequently ruin their lineage). This leads our guys to the afterlife, Hell, Heaven, and back to Earth, having faced their own personal Hells, recited EVERY ROSE HAS ITS THORN  to the Man Upstairs, and gaining the Grim Reaper (William Sadler, in a scene-stealing role) as a slave by beating him in a contest. Now they have to build good robot versions of themselves (with the help of an alien called Station... yeah), save the babes, and ensure their place in rock and future history.<br /> Not as good as the original, to be sure, but it is most definitely non-non-non-non-NON heinous.
B000063DFS|5.0|Coming into 1991's No More Tears, Ozzy Osbourne hadn't put out a truly GREAT album, since 1980' s Blizzard of Ozz.  Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon both sound incredibly dated, The Ultimate Sin was good, but not up to Blizzard's standard, and while Zakk Wylde's guitar work gave No Rest for the Wicked a fresh sound, Ozzy's vocals just didn't seem to really hit home.<br /><br />And then this happened.  A complete album, and the one we've been wanting since we saw what Ozzy was capable of.  Zakk's guitar is just massive, here, and Daisley's bass tightly thumps throughout, backing some of Ozzy's best vocal work.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br /><br />---Zakk's solo on \\"I Don't Want to Change the World\\"<br /><br />---\\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\"...Ozzy's best ballad since \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" and \\"Revelation\\" graced our ears on Blizzard, and possibly his best since Black Sabbath did \\"Changes\\" on Vol 4<br /><br />---Zakk's solo on \\"No More Tears\\"<br /><br />---\\"Hellraiser\\"...gotta love songs about rock n' roll!<br /><br />---Zakk's solo on \\"Time After Time\\"<br /><br />...and so forth.  Even the laughably ridiculous track (\\"Zombie Stomp\\") has killer guitar work...just a joke of a chorus.  If they had thought of a better chorus and title for that one track...some lyrics worthy of the musicianship behind it, then this would get a perfect score.  As it is...4.5.<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE 2002 OZZY REMASTERS of his first two albums (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman)!  They are NOT the originals, and have been rerecorded by newer members of Ozzy's band, as a way to screw over the old members who are owed $$$ for the work they did.  Seek out the 1995 remasters, instead.  Reward the musicians who actually made the music!
1932100660|5.0|I'm still reading this book but it has already made a positive impact in my families eating habits. Part 1 is full of convincing, well studied argument for the need to alter the typical american diet. Nutrition is a hobby of mine I have been reading and learning as much as I can for many years now. I was at one time studying in an allied health field when I lost faith with traditional medicine. There is an abundance of well studied information discredited and ignored by traditional medicine. This book, and the results of this study not making an impact on how traditional medicine views the importance of nutrition, reinforces for me my turn to natural medicine. This is a must read for anyone who cares about the health of their family.
B00006AW2J|4.0|The Rolling Stones really hit their country stride on this one, from the organic \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" through bluesy and occasionally acoustic numbers on the first side, the album picks up the pace (and ups the amps) for \\"Street Fighting Man\\" and \\"Stray Cat Blues,\\" in the second half, before closing with ode to the working man \\"Salt of the Earth.\\"  All of the songs are good, but the album is a little too country and acoustic, and doesn't offer up enough variety.  Good...but one more plugged in track would have made this a stronger album.
1594489505|5.0|If you enjoy good drama, including characters with strong feelings and terrible luck - tragedy is always lurking behind them - you will love Mariam and Laila's story, two women who start as opponents and become best friends. If you are the kind of person who can cry from reading a book, you probably will. The author has a simple style of writing that makes it easy to read the whole book in a day or two. Many dialogues and fine descriptions add to that effect. In short, a fine page-turner.<br />I am not sure the book provides an accurate description of Afghanistan and its people (that's not what I was looking for) but it is good fiction guaranteed to give you a good time. Loved it.
B000002B7T|3.0|Ahh,  Ozzy.  What can I say?  With each release, his material seems to be doing a poorer job of standing the test of time.  While this one starts out with the always fun \\"Bark at the Moon,\\" the follow up \\"You're No Different\\" sounds as if it could be played during the obligatory montage in a dated 80s film...you know, the part where they show a loner on his motorcycle, and perhaps a snippet of a love scene, and try to summarize a long journey during the space of a single song?  Yeah, this song is really not improving with age, sadly.  Straight up (albeit overly repetitive) rocker \\"Now You See It (Now You Don't)\\" follows, with some unfortunate, and completely unnecessary sound effects.  At this point, I must cringe at the way this material is so grounded in the cheese of the 80s.  Fortunately, the album takes a turn toward the positive, with album highlight \\"Rock 'n' Roll Rebel,\\" which features some compelling guitar work.  The remainder of the album doesn't sound quite so dated, but it's hardly Ozzy's best work.<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE 2002 OZZY REMASTERS of his first two albums (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman)!  They are NOT the originals, and have been rerecorded by newer members of Ozzy's band, as a way to screw over the old members who are owed $$$ for the work they did.  Seek out the 1995 remasters, instead.  Reward the musicians who actually made the music!
B000ZK4466|5.0|I have had the pleasure of owning this album for 2 days now and, it just keeps on growing on me. I've been a fan of TMV since 'De-loused' but found 'Frances the mute' and 'Amputechture' to be a little pretentious. Not the case here. 'The bedlam in goliath' runs right out of the gate and does not let up. Before i delve into this review i must confess that i am a huge king crimson fan and an even bigger Tool fan so, TMV fit right in with my musical tastes.<br /><br />  I didnt even know that this album was out until the drummer in my band texted me and told me so. I immediately jumped out of bed and showered, hopped in my car and drove to coconuts. I proceeded indoors where i found a copy then walked back to my car. Now, as with all new releases i must soak it all in. So, i continue home, pack a battie and pop in 'Bedlam'. BAM! right away they barrage you with a full on assault of twisted sounds and then cedric hits a register higher than the almighty himself. I am not going to give a track by track review since people seemed to have covered that already. The concept behind 'The bedlam in goliath' is, omar was in jerusalem in a curio shop and came across a ouija board which he brought home. The band say they used in night after night and the same spirits would come through. The short of it is, the band claims they were haunted by these spirits which interferred with the making of the record. All hub-bub aside, this is an amazing release and MUCH better than what i had expected from them.<br /><br />  Also worth mentioning is the new drummer, forgive me for not knowing his name off hand. He manages to out-shine jon theodore in many aspects of the music and feels like an overall better fit for where they seem to be venturing. If your a fan of progressive/space/experimental music grab this album and prepare to shift into hyper-drive.
B000000OAC|5.0|Led off with a duo of songs that, much like Led Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Living Loving Maid\\", are never heard apart, Queen's News of the World is an album that demands respect.  After the opening anthems comes \\"Sheer Heart Attack,\\" a blazing hard rocker that seems reminiscent of Aerosmith in more way than one.  \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" has a sound that strays back into their earlier albums, softer, very melodic and atmospheric, while \\"Spread Your Wings\\" is a piano driven, but still heavy, ballad.  This album really offers a lot.  The funky \\"Fight From the Inside,\\" the gritty \\"Get Down, Make Love\\"...too much good stuff!  Among the best they've done!
B000WAGVHE|5.0|When I first heard about Hairspray I didn't have a lot of high expectations of it because musicals can either be hit or miss when it comes to bringing them into the movies.  Hairspray did something that not a lot of movie musicals have been able to do crack my top three favorite musicals of all time.  These consisted of West Side Story, Rent, and Pippin.  Now I will add Hairspray into this mix.  What Hairspray was also able to do was be the first movie in eight years that I had to see in the theaters more then once.  I saw Hairspray like four times; two of those four times in the same week. Hairspray proves that musicals are a good reason to get an HD-Television, a Blu-Ray Player, or an HD-DVD Player.  I was disappointed that Warner Bros and it's sister company New Line Cinema dropped HD-DVD because I love the format.  In a lot of ways I bought the LG BH-200 Combo Player because of Hairspray.  The movie shines in High Def.  The colors are just as sharp if not sharper on my Sony Bravia HD-TV then they were in the theater.  The cast was probably the most terrific cast I have seen in a musical a long time.  Nikki Blonski what can I say about her that hasn't already been said?  True triple threat (singer, dancer, actress). And probably the most confident and beautiful actresses I have seen in a long while.   Zac Efron was a really big surprise because I had seen him in High School Musical and I thought he was terrific in that but this was a totally different ballgame.  The real surprise was John Travolta as Edna Turnbland.  His performance was so convincing I forgot for a moment that that was a man in heavy (no pun intended make-up.  The special features on this Blu-Ray Edition are fantastic I thought. You get the origins of where Jon Waters got the inspiration to create the 1988 Hairspray movie and where the 2002 Broadway show came to be and where Adam Shankman (best known to Buffy The Vampire Slayer fans as the choreagraper for the musical episode Once More With Feeling) got the inspiration to create the re-make.  Which also makes this film kind of unique there is equal amount of dancing in this movie as there is singing which you don't see in movie musicals that much anymore.  If you like musical comedies, if you like comedies, if you like dance movies, even if you like movies about the late fifties, early sixties, you will like this movie.
B000002A3T|4.0|David Gilmour's songwriting comes into its own on this album, which is their last to date.  Soaring and cerebral, the album suddenly lacks a lot of that cynicism and bitterness that was a hallmark of the Roger Waters era, and takes on a more positive vibe.  Despite having lost their primary songwriter, this album still fits in fairly well with the rest of the band's discography, and still sounds very much like we expect Pink Floyd to sound.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I get why people feel the need to discuss the pros and cons of   the authentic language, costumes, actions(ie, the costumes, Longbourne,  Lady Catherine's night-time visit).  I love the books too---     But come on-- the admittedly over the top, sunrise walk across the field   with the pained, hopeful, \\"is this really happening to me\\" expression   in Darcy's eyes has to be one of the most powerful set-up scenes ever--it manages to avoid feeling cartoonish to me-- he seems both beautifully vulnerable and yet somehow strong at the same time-----      If you can watch this scene and not wish the YOU had been cast as Lizzie then perhaps you are paying to see films in the wrong genre ----
B00000IMTF|4.0|Off the bat, you can tell that this effort from Rainbow will be better than their debut.  Vocals from  Ronnie James Dio are more powerful and confident on opener \\"Tarot Woman,\\" and the band seems, quite simply, to have written better songs.  There seems to be more energy on this album than on the prior effort, as if the band is more in tune with its members' strengths and talents and does a better job of exploiting them.<br /><br />No weaknesses on this one!  Good stuff!
0375505091|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews, i have to agree with the comments about content however i believe it's important to understand that this was a publication for an accompanying exhibition at the brooklyn museum of art.  It is an exhibition that is still touring around today.  I saw the exhibition and was struck by the quality of the photographs as well as their diversity.  It is as the title suggests, \\"A Photographers Life\\" and should be seen as such.  I really liked the exhibition for it's incite into the life behind all of the famous photograph's we have come to know annie leibovitz for.
B000000OAA|4.0|There's no denying that Queen were one of a kind, and this album demonstrates that again and again.  From straight up hard rockers, to their more operatic tendencies, to acoustic and atmospheric pieces, this album has it all.
0140051317|4.0|This may seem like literary fiction and Roald Dahl's style is extremely polished, but it's not difficult to read at all. Like O Henry, Dahl's short stories have gripping plots and a twist at the end. The author seems to be fond of betting. Quite a few of the stories revolve around bizarre bets.<br /><br />My favourite tale is Lamb to the Slaughter - a murder story and how the frail and semingly harmless victim concealed the murder weapon. Most of the stories live up to their claim of being unexpected, but not everyone is great.
B000068QZK|4.0|The beginning of a new era begins for Ozzy Osbourne, with the addition of axe slinger Zakk Wylde (also of Black Label Society).  And the difference is noticeable, from the outset.  The sound of this album, beginning with \\"Miracle Man,\\" is noticeably heavier, less grounded in 1980s stereotypes, and generally more...well, more METAL!  Zakk's shredding ability carries \\"Devil's Daughter (Holy War),\\" where Ozzy's vocals seem a little weak, and his presence on \\"Crazy Babies\\" really makes the most of a fun, blues infused rockin' track.  Throughout the album, Ozzy does things that are different from what he's done in the past (a good thing...some of the old was getting a bit stale).  This album, while lacking the obvious hits of some previous efforts, marks a turning point in Ozzy's career and a breath of new life into his music.<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE 2002 OZZY REMASTERS of his first two albums (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman)!  They are NOT the originals, and have been rerecorded by newer members of Ozzy's band, as a way to screw over the old members who are owed $$$ for the work they did.  Seek out the 1995 remasters, instead.  Reward the musicians who actually made the music!
B000K15VSA|5.0|You can Blade Runner yourself to death with this impressive DVD box, a suitcase-shaped case containing no less than 25 DVDs, 431 versions of the film, 97 hours of extras, and a lock of Harrison Ford's hair.<br /><br />Actually, this has five DVDs, numerous versions of the film, plenty of hours of extras and featurettes, and a few cool touches like a plastic model spinner toy.  (You've been waiting for that baby for years).  Bear in mind, only the 'Final Cut' of this film is 'improved' with tweaks to the effects and audio (very minor and nothing like the Lucas Star Wars fixes).<br /><br />But finally, we have all of the known Blade Runner cuts that obsessists are familiar with: the Theatrical Version ('82 US), the International Version, the Director's Cut, and new 'Final Cut', and most rare, the Workprint Version, by far the most different from the rest.  There's also deleted footage, a feature documentary, featurettes, and trailer and TV spots and all that good stuff.<br /><br />For the Blade Runner fan, and there are now legions, this is a must.  They've released the 'Final Cut' in a number of different versions (four and five disc), but this is the most obsessive, geekiest, and best of the them.  I mean, you get a model spinner and even notes in a mock folder police folder.  And you can carry the mock 'Voight Kampff' test briefcase around the house with you until Ridley Scott realizes he has some other changes to make.<br /><br />Highly recommended, of course, if only for the little unicorn (forget to mention that).
B00008OLYN|4.0|An absolutely stunning album!  The allure of Opeth is multi-faceted, but a key ingredient has always been their ability to intermingle haunting melodies and beautiful clean vocals with a more brutal, metallic approach.  This album, seen as a companion to 2002's Deliverance, focuses solely on the clean vocals and less on the death vocals and riff driven, metal sounds, to create an amazing album that is positively trance inducing.
0736063684|5.0|This book has a lot of useful information!! This book is arguably one of the best book of its kind. What's it useful for? Mainly to help the reader, from the weekend athlete to the athletic trainer to the professional bodybuilder figure out what exercises work what muscles. As a Personal trainer I would highly recommend this book for anyone, newbie to lifting or serious about lifting the right way for the right muscle groups. It's neatly divided up into sections (arms, shoulders, chest, back, etc.), so all you really have to do...Great book!
B000002B7O|4.0|Ozzy Osbourne's second \\"solo\\" effort after leaving Black Sabbath, and it starts off with a bang!  \\"Over the Mountain\\" chugs along to lead off, before the albums primary radio hit \\"Flying High Again,\\" which is really a great track.  \\"You Can't Kill Rock 'n' Roll\\" is a slow rocker, until the chorus picks up the speed, but this is the first indication that this album isn't quite up to the glory of its predecessor, Blizzard of Ozz, as this material hasn't aged quite so gracefully, and sounds a bit dated.  Not bad, mind you...just dated, and very reminiscent of the early/mid 80s, whereas Blizzard just sounds like rock n' roll and metal, without regard for decade.  \\"Believer\\" returns to form, however, and \\"Little Dolls\\" sounds like vintage (non-dated) Ozzy.  \\"Tonight\\" is a nice ballad, but Ozzy's voice doesn't sound all that great, on this one.  The album closes on hard rocker \\"S.A.T.O.\\" and eerie, somewhat atmospheric title track \\"Diary of a Madman.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this is a good album, but it really doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor.  Some of the material hasn't aged well, and Ozzy doesn't seem to be at the top of his game (as he was on Blizzard, and would be again in the future).  But, still, a good album.<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE 2002 OZZY REMASTERS of his first two albums (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman)!

B000SM7QUC|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing a lot of good things about it.  I thought it would be something I would listen to a few times and that would be that.    Fortunately, this CD exceeded my expectations and I was very impressed with how good it is.  It's not too often that I am THIS surprised by a CD.      It is definitely a 5 star effort.  I would be willing to say its one of the best rock CDs to be released in a long, long time.  Oh yeah, and the Amazon staff reviewer should get his hearing checked.
B0000252YK|4.0|After two albums that have aged terribly, Ozzy Osbourne strikes back, with some quality hard rock.  True, this material is a bit dated, as well, but not nearly as much as the work he did on Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon.  For the most part, this is vintage Ozzy material.  Heavy riffs, soaring vocals...an all around strong album.  \\"Killer of Giants,\\" in particular, is impressive and an album highlight.  As far as his hits go, however, \\"Shot in the Dark\\" hasn't aged as well as, say, \\"Crazy Train\\" or \\"Flying High Again.\\"  On an album that gets away from a lot of the cheese of his last two efforts, that track in particular fails to do so.  It isn't a bad track...far from it...but it is a bit dated.  Overall, though, a very good album...Ozzy's on the upswing!<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE 2002 OZZY REMASTERS of his first two albums (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman)!

B000002UA0|4.0|Early Pink Floyd is psychadelic Floyd, and only rarely resembles the sounds associated with their more famous works of the 1970s.  This is partially because of the presence of Syd Barrett, whose mark on the band is clear and deep, despite only having been with them for this first album (and some spot work on the second).  That said, this is a good album, and many fans think of this early psychadelic era as their best period.  The opening tandem of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and \\"Lucifer Sam\\" is very strong.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This was defiantly the best of the SAW franchise, but they lacked on traps, the creativity wasn't ver great, as the SAWs go on, they get more and more creative. This is a must see for any horror movie fan.
B000002JOH|5.0|I realize that the true fans of a band often find value in their lesser known material, and I agree that a band's \\"other\\" albums are often as good or better than their most famous ones.  As such, I approach most bands with an open ear, and a belief that a \\"hit\\" album isn't always a great album, and an unknown can be a masterpiece.<br /><br />I did not, however, find this to be true of Pantera.  I came into this having never heard a single Pantera song, yet knowing of them more because of the death of Dimebag Darrell and as a band that seemed to have been fairly large in metal, which I was (and still am) exploring.  Having listened to their albums with no expectations, I can say without a doubt that this album, Vulgar Display of Power, is their strongest effort, and a great album.<br /><br />\\"Mouth for War\\" is a killer opener, and sets a high bar for the rest of the album, and \\"Walk\\" has such a killer groove to it that really sets this band apart from other metal acts.  \\"F***ing Hostile\\" really picks up the pace...a groove riff driven piece of thrash that is an album highlight..before a big slow down on \\"This Love,\\" which showcases Phil Anselmo's vocals, both in a regular singing voice, as well as his terrific, growling metal style.<br /><br />\\"Rise\\" marks the midpoint of the album in brutal fashion, though it's followed up by what I feel is one of the weaker songs on the album in \\"No Good (Attack the Radical)\\" which lacks the defining characteristics of prior (and later) tracks.  \\"Regular People (Conceit)\\" showcases some great guitar work, before the album ends on the spectacularly good tandem of \\"By Demons Be Driven\\" and \\"Hollow.\\"<br /><br />\\"By Demons...\\" is just an all-out killer track.  Dark, with a good groove to it, and just an incredible chorus.  Simple, yes, but awesome and powerful!  \\"Hollow\\" then ends the album on a more melodic, slower note, with it's non-yelling vocals and catchy guitar work.  It's not all soft, however, as the song's last half is a return to riff driven metal.<br /><br />In summary, this is really a great metal album.  It has killer riffs, great guitar work, interesting lyrics and vocals that go well with the music.  It's a piece of landmark metal, without question.In summary, this is really a great metal album.

0321525655|5.0|I've been following the Presentation Zen website for a while, and it's nice to see the book after so much time incubating.     This is an excellent book for presenters tired of \\"death by power point.\\" I have checked out lots of other presentation books, and by far, this is the best. The graphics and layout are beautiful, and it has had a profound influence on my presentations. You will need to have a solid grasp of power point and some of its lesser used tools to achieve maximum impact (PP is a hugely powerful program, rarely used to its full potential).     Want to get a feel for the basic theme of this book and what it preaches? See any of Steve Jobs' latest keynotes to get an idea. Clean. Straightforward. Classy. And smooth baby.     Following Garr's advice, my presentations now get mouth-open attention from the audience and kudos from peers. Garr and this book will make you a Presentation Jedi Master.
B000002UA5|3.0|Ummagumma is a two part album.  The first half, a set of new studio recordings, is among the oddest recordings Pink Floyd have ever done.  The second half, their first live release, is magnificent.  It gets points for the great live material.  The studio stuff is forgettable.
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|Well, this is a great live show, but I'm not sure how happy I am with the dvd. The big problem I have is the oboard action of the filming. The show itself is a huge spectacle, which would benefit from lots of long, slow-moving shots that allow the viewer to take in what is happening on stage. Instead, the footage is chopped and slightly erratic. There come points where, between the action on stage and the rapid flurries of changing camera shots, the whole thing becomes a dizzying blur.    I was actually on the film crew for the making of this dvd, and having seen the show live 4 times during that process, I can attest to the fact that this dvd fails to capture the true artistry onstage.     The problem is that the whole thing is edited as though it were a standard concert, with nothing but immobile musicians to view, where active angle changes are needed to keep things interesting to watch. This is not an ordinary concert setting, though. The importance of capturing the huge stage show seems to be lost in the shuffle, with the film being creative right over top of the show's creativity, forming a muddled mess which, while still eye grabbing (and great sounding) really fails to capture the impact of the show in the way it could have.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|A true lost gem, this began (reportedly) as a Roger Waters solo effort, but the band was good enough to play along.  This plays like The Wall, Pt. 2.  The story isn't the same, as this focuses on Waters's own experiences, having lost his father to WWII, but the style of the songs is very reminiscent of its immediate predecessor.  While this doesn't quite measure up to that album, it still has moments of true Pink Floyd greatness (again, not the kind they play on the radio), with tracks like \\"The Post War Dream,\\" \\"When the Tigers Broke Free,\\" \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\\" and \\"Not Now John.\\"  When a casual (The Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Wish You Were Here) fan asks me for a recommendation, I'll usually point out that, if they liked The Wall, then this album is a natural follow-up.

B000006TRV|5.0|While \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\\" may be the most overplayed track in the history of rock n' roll, it does little to diminish the wealth of good material on this album.<br /><br />Many consider this the band's true master work, and they can hardly be blamed.  Concept album?  Rock Opera?  I rarely use those terms, because many disagree about their meaning, but it could be considered either or both of the those, and Waters's song writing really shines on this album because he's able to tell a cohesive story, with all of its ups and downs, over the course of the album's 81 minutes.  While the band often alternates between Roger Waters and David Gilmour on vocals, here Waters's impassioned singing, which truly seems tinged by madness, is on display.  He's not a great vocalist, and many of these songs are out of his range, but that makes his performance all the more convincing, as he portrays a man slowly going mad with paranoia, xenophobia, and cynicism.  As he reaches for notes he can't quite hit without sounding like it's the effort of a lifetime, the listener becomes more and more convinced of the story.
B0009K8L5W|5.0|Shakira's debut album is still one of the best albums of modern spanish latin rock/pop. Her english work will never be able to compare. If you want to experience true Shakira buy this album or 'Donde Estan Los Ladrones?'.
B000003TA4|3.0|This was a great album!  You know...back when I was an angry teenager who hated the world.  But people grow up and realize that teenage perceptions of life isn't representative of life at all, but rather a bunch of self-indulgent BS.<br /><br />Of course, that doesn't make this a bad album.  It's good and I have some liking for grunge, despite my revulsion of the musical forms it spawned.  But it's terribly overrated, too.  The playing isn't near where it should be, though I suppose that would have gone against the band's image.  And because Kurt killed himself when they were on top, people always assume that they would have stayed on top...forever.<br /><br />Nah.  I reserve that assumption for artists with considerably more talent.<br /><br />But if you like some variety, and want something less upbeat, this will do.  Personally, I prefer Alice in Chains to fill that slot.
0767817478|5.0|I simply don't get it... Why on earth everyone hates this movie so much? Is it because it's like a million times better than all those cheesy old movies? With all the lights and things that asians love? If you like Jiban, Ultraman, Dragon Ball and all of that asian crap then go and get the old Godzilla movies. If you are in for a good popcorn flick with very good special FX and a funny ALA ID4 tone, then this is your movie. I for one loved it and I keep watching it from time to time even after all these years. I'm just waiting for it to make it's way to BluRay so I can enjoy it even more.  I certainly hope they are planning to do a sequel sometime in the future although its not likely.  BTW. I thought CLOVERFIELD was its sequel. I was wrong, and that movie did SUCKED.
B000002U9Y|4.0|With the loss of their mad genius, Syd Barrett, the band struggles to find a sound on this album.  However, that same loss sparks the ascension one of the other great musicians of this band, Roger Waters.  The Waters influence on the band, most clearly seen in later compositions like The Wall, is still developing and limited, though it shows itself in brief flashes of greatness (\\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\") that seem odd next to songs that are more reminiscent of The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Warning, may contain spoilers, but if you've seen Star Wars it's okay you'll see them coming anyway.<br /><br />The are no words to describe the anger, the unadulterated fury, the blinding rage, that I felt while I watched this sorry excuse for a film. Literally every shot in here is copied and pasted from one movie or another, whether it be [[ASIN:0783225814 Dragonheart - Collector's Edition]] or [[ASIN:B00003CX95 Braveheart]] or their two favorite sources [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXCT Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)]]. How dare they? The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are two of my favorite films of all time and they have done a great deal to shape me into the person I am today. For anyone who has fallen in love with the works of JRR Tolkien/Peter Jackson and Gorge Lucas you will be angered beyond all comprehension when you see this \\"film\\" rip off those great men's work. I'm telling you, EVERY SINGLE SCENE in this movie is copied and pasted from other, much better works.<br /><br />But apart from the obvious rip off factor, the movie manages to fail all on its own as well. The obvious flaws are there for anyone with any amount of sense to see and are too blatant to ignore. It literally takes one day for our hero to change from an everyday farm boy (Luke Skywalker) who doesn't even know how to hunt to superman who's now all of a sudden breaking into the evil castle (the Death Star) and saving the damsel in distress, (Princess Lea) using his magic (the force) and being saved by his wise old mentor (Obi One Kenobi) who then dies heroically. It literally takes him two days to<br />A) Learn how to fly a dragon,<br />B) Learn how to use a sword,<br />C) Learn to use magic,<br />D) Learn how to sneak stealthy into heavily guarded castles, and much, much more. Wow, what is he smoking and where can I get some?<br /><br />Shortly after escaping the previously mentioned castle, he then leads an army of men who look like Easterlings from LOTR against an army of bad guys who look like Orcs in a fort that looks like Helms Deep while wearing Elvin armor. The bad guy leading said orcs also looks like Dracula from [[ASIN:B0002KVUKM Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)]] and they engage in a battle with an odd resemblance to Dragon Heart. Of course, they win and the beautiful girl he saved, the one he has YET to have a full conversation with despite being with her for about half the movie, runs off to plan to defend her home nation against the evil king who will be attacking in the inevitable sequel (a movie I will make it a point not to see whenever it DOES come out).<br /><br />In short, the plot moves too fast, the characters are bland and one dimensional, the acting is sub par at best, the effects looked like they were done on a ten dollar budget, and it blatantly rips off some of the greatest works of fiction ever made. There is absolutely nothing original about this film, everything here is merely copied and pasted from much better works. Eragon so desperately wants to be The Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, and Bravheart, and Dragon Heart, and Van Helsing, and this, and that, but in the end it fails to be anything but a silly kid's movie so shallow that only the blindest movie goers will manage to get anything out of it. So I ask again, who do these people think they are?<br /><br />Re-watch value; EXTREMLY low.then leads an army of men who look like Easterlings from LOTR against an army of bad guys who look like Orcs in a fort that looks like Helms Deep while wearing Elvin armor.

Eragon so desperately wants to be The Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, and Bravheart, and Dragon Heart, and Van Helsing, and this, and that, but in the end it fails to be anything but a silly kid's movie so shallow that only the blindest movie goers will manage to get anything out of it. So I ask again, who do these people think they are?    Re-watch value; EXTREMLY low.
B000002B7M|5.0|I can only imagine what it must have been like to be Ozzy Osbourne in 1980, when this album was released.  Booted from Black Sabbath due to over the top substance abuse, Ozzy had to score with this one, or fade into rock n' roll history.  And score he does!  There are certainly hits on this album.  \\"I Don't Know\\" and \\"Crazy Train,\\" which open the album, both get play on classic rock radio to this day.  But a great album isn't about the killer...it's about the filler.  Or, to put it more appropriately, it's about the quality of the songs that come between the hits of an album.  And the \\"filler\\" here is anything but.  \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" is a ballad that would have fit in well on Sabbath's Technical Ecstasy, while \\"Suicide Solution\\" is really an album highlight.  \\"Mr Crowley,\\" with some great guitar work from the lost Randy Rhodes and another track that still gets a fair amount of radio play, leads into the upbeat rocker \\"No Bone Movies,\\" before the album finishes with the tandem of the dirge-like \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\" and hard rockin' \\"Steal Away (The Night).\\"<br /><br />There's honestly not a bad track on this album.  I listen to it, front to back, more than any other Ozzy album, and it really stands up as a great piece of rock and metal music.<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THE 2002 OZZY REMASTERS of his first two albums (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman)!  They are NOT the originals, and have been rerecorded by newer members of Ozzy's band, as a way to screw over the old members who are owed $$$ for the work they did.  Seek out the 1995 remasters, instead.  Reward the musicians who actually made the music!
B000VZE1TA|2.0|The Sex Pistols and this album are very important in the whole history of rock and roll because of its influence on countless other bands and musicians to come such as Nirvana, The Clash, Green Day and other punk bands not to mention Heavy and Thrash Metal bands. Although they by no means were the first and only to start the punk movement as many others could lay claim to this honour e.g. The Ramones, The Velvet Underground and even Blondie but the Sex Pistols did have talent but they just chose to play in a certain discordant style to put their message across but that doesn't mean the album isn't good or that they're not good musicians. I thought the guitar solo on \\"God Save the Queen\\" was pretty good and I think this track is their best ever.<br /><br />You have to listen to the album for what it is and what it stands for and as an early representative of the punk rock genre, this is actually very good. I'm just disappointed that after waiting for years for a remastered version ala what Iggy Pop did with his brilliant \\"Raw Power\\" album, this is what they came up with with any benefit from alleged remastering barely recognisable from the original cd I bought many, many years ago.  The Stooges' remastering of \\"Raw Power\\" added extra life to what was a dated album and it now sounds like it could have been released today and this was what the Pistols could have done with this album but alas they let the chance slip away.  If you already have this album, I wonder why you would want to spend so much more for pretty much the same disc albeit with an mlps packaging.  The mlps design is made from thin, flimsy cardboard and is nothing to shout about given the many better mlps designs that I've seen out there although an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese is included together with a fold out colour poster which is quite cool.<br /><br />My recommendation: a must have for any serious music hobbist's collection but bear in mind that this version's sound quality isn't a material improvement over the version you already have and so you may end up paying a great deal more for what amounts to very expensive cardboard and a poster.material improvement over the version you already have and so you may end up paying a great deal more for what amounts to very expensive cardboard and a poster.
B00000IMTE|4.0|An interesting moment in rock/metal history, when links back to Deep Purple and forward to the masters, Black Sabbath, converged with the presence of both Ritchie Blackmore and  Ronnie James Dio in Rainbow.  A lot of talent, for certain, though this first effort isn't their finest.  While they do some interesting things on \\"Catch the Rainbow\\" and the raucous \\"If You Don't Life Rock 'n' Roll,\\" the album is a little more tame than would be expected, given its pedigree.  Not bad, but the band doesn't seem to have challenged itself to write truly great songs.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|Here's the thing that's proving to be somewhat strange for me with the 'Saw' series of horror films. I had seen each of the first three movies in the franchise when they were initially released to DVD, and had developed opinions both good and bad for each of the films at the time. For instance, when I watched the first film, \\"Saw\\", I really didn't think all that much for the movie, I thought it was alright but not worth all the hype it had received. Then I watched \\"Saw 2\\" and felt it was a much better movie than the original, I thought the story was improved, and didn't borrow as heavily from other influences. After that I watched \\"Saw 3\\", but I hadn't seen the first two in so long that I thought the third film contradicted certain elements contained in the first two, and was also much gorier and seemingly short on plot. However, after re-watching each of the movies in the franchise back-to-back my opinions have somewhat changed. I actually found myself liking the original film much better the second time around, and found \\"Saw 2\\" to be fairly disappointing by comparison, due to a lack of character development and an over-reliance on shock and gore, instead of developing an eerily creepy atmosphere and a story that would deliver genuine thrills as the original film had done. Which brings me to my re-watching of the third film in the series, \\"Saw 3\\". Going into this film I wondered if my opinion would change as drastically as it had on the previous two films or if it would remain essentially the same as it was after the first time I watched the movie. Either way, I was curious to see what results awaited my repeat viewing of the film that I felt was the weakest in the series thus far.    \\"Saw 3\\" picks up immediately after the events of \\"Saw 2\\", and we find Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) desperately trying to free himself in order to save his son. However, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) isn't as fair as Jigsaw and has no intention of allowing Eric to escape. Aftertheir brutal altercation (essentially tying off the dangling loose ends left over from the previous film), Amanda joins her mentor, the ailing Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), in overseeing their latest series of tests, one involves a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) who is extremely talented and caring in the operating room yet is cold and aloof to her family at home. The second test focuses on a heartbroken father (Angus MacFadyen) who has lost his son in an automobile accident and would give anything to exact vengeance on those he holds responsible. As each of the subjects advance through their own series of tests, Jigsaw's already deteriorating health seems to be declining at an increasingly rapid rate, but this will not deter the maniacal mastermind from seeing his carefully designed plans come to fruition.    When I watched \\"Saw 3\\" for the first time after it had recently arrived on DVD in early 2007, I initially found the film to be just another standard horror film that was intent on using as much blood and gore as the MPAA would allow in a film. Basically the filmmakers wanted to see just how much they could get away with before the audience was completely disgusted. The traps had seemed more grotesque, and were even more inescapable than those in the previous two films (which it turned out was the case due to Amanda's refusal to give her victims a chance at life, a fact that was shown in several flashbacks throughout the movie), and the results of the traps were even more bizarre and horrifying than what either of the first two films had attempted. Also, I had thought that the story for \\"Saw 3\\" contradicted certain events of the previous two movies, especially the first movie, and a couple of moments in the second, leaving me wondering why the writers of this installment, James Wan and Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the first film together), would contradict their own work from the original movie.    Well, after finishing \\"Saw 3\\" for the second time I must say that my opinion of the film has changed in some instances. I found that the story, which I initially found contradictory, was very well put together and was not contradictory in the least. The story also felt more in sync with the tone of the original film, by having Jigsaw and Amanda's traps be more planned out, forcing their victims to take part in them rather than the rather coincidental approach to the second film where the victims seemed to be allowed to avoid the traps if they could. One facet of the story of \\"Saw 3\\" that I really enjoyed were the flashbacks to events surrounding the first two films, which really deepened the story for the overall franchise and connected each of the films together even more than before. For the most part, I liked that the flashbacks explained the change in how the traps went from being escapable to impossible to survive, and also how careful the planning was for the traps used in the first film. One complaint I did have with the flashbacks was the fact that we are introduced to Jigsaw's past, which was fine, but we are shown a woman with whom he is seemingly in love with, but we learn nothing about her other than the fact that we see them together for a couple of scenes. I really hate it when a movie simply introduces an element into the plot that is intended to be resolved in the next film, so that nothing comes of it in the current movie you are watching. Why bother including a segment in one film if nothing will come of that segment until the sequel, just wait and include the segment when you (meaning the writers) are ready to flesh it out further. Because the segment, though intended to show a much softer Jigsaw from the days before he became the monster he now is, was ultimately pointless and even more irritating due to the fact that it seemed like it's sole purpose was for us to feel some empathy for Jigsaw, and view him more as a normal human who has slipped into a state of insanity, rather than a man who was merely masking the monsterhidden deep within.    The traps of \\"Saw 3\\" were just as I had initially felt, they were way too grotesque and seemed to be intended to shock and gross out the audience as much as possible rather than scare us. I don't understand why horror films have shifted from trying to scare the audience with atmosphere, story and a genuinely creepy villain, but instead have chosen to simply shock us by including as many gross sequences as possible into a 90 minute film, but that's what the powers-that-be must feel is needed to make a successful horror film these days. Maybe it's because we moviegoers have become de-sensitized to such things, that the only way the moviemakers feel they can scare us is by shocking us with as much blood, gore, and sadism as they can get away with under the guidelines of the increasingly liberal MPAA rating system.    As a franchise, the 'Saw' series has definitely fallen into the school of thought within filmmaking that feels it is necessary to show the most gore possible to give the audience a good scare. When this franchise began, the original film was more of an actual horror film, in the vein of the old school horror films from Alfred Hitchcock (\\"Psycho\\") and John Carpenter (\\"Halloween\\"), relying more on atmosphere and the audiences own imagination to create genuine thrills with which to scare us, not buckets and buckets of blood. However, over the course of three films, the 'Saw' series has become just another horror franchise, albeit with much better scripts than your average horror movie (which allows these films to rise above the rest of the current crop of horror offerings), but one can definitely see the downward spiral in terms of quality that is occurring within the series.    The characters of \\"Saw 3\\" were much better than those within \\"Saw 2\\". This time around I actually cared whether the main characters survived their respective traps, unlike in \\"Saw 2\\" where I would have been fine if the majority of them failed their tests. The new cast members to the franchise fit into the same profile as those of the previous film. Both of the two new lead characters were portrayed by acting talents that many people would recognize if they'd seen them, but most likely not by their names. Bahar Soomekh (TV's short-lived drama \\"Day Break\\") was solid as Lynn, the doctor who had all but abandoned her family emotionally, but in the midst of Jigsaw's trial, discovers that she longs for nothing more than to hold her family members yet again. She was so genuine in her desire to do what is right according to the oath she took as a doctor by helping Jigsaw through the pain of his cancer, and at the same time she was so afraid of losing her life to the trap she was in that she was tempted to take a life in cold blood. The character of Jeff, the distraught father, as portrayed by Angus MacFadyen (\\"Braveheart\\") was a character that was so consumed by his thirst for revenge that he teeters on the edge of sanity, and is struggling to retain his last shred of humanity so he can be there for his daughter that desperately wants her father back. Angus portrayed the conflict within Jeff perfectly, each of the trials that he faced tested his thirst for vengeance, while at the same time threatening to strip him of his last shred of humanity, and each time Angus played the indecision perfectly, and in the end gave audiences a character that was so deeply flawed, and yet the audience couldn't help but relate to him and his struggles.    \\"Saw 3\\" is a better movie than \\"Saw 2\\", and felt more in line with the tone and quality of the first movie. However, as improved as \\"Saw 3\\" was, it still fell prey to the shortcomings of its predecessor by featuring an over abundance of gross-out moments intended to shock the audience rather than scare it, and way too much blood and gore, to the point that it detracts from the overall movie.    \\"Saw 3\\" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence, language, and nudity.
B0002V7OI8|3.0|I lack the scientific wherewithal to speak to the scientific accuracy of this film, but I do know a little something about Virginia Beach, having lived in this area for most of my life.<br /><br />There's a scene in the movie where Elijah Wood and his sweet thing are running past a sign that says \\"Virginia Beaches, 6 miles\\" yet in fact there is no such place. Virginia Beach is singular and all the signs I've ever seen leading to the oceanfront say, \\"Oceanfront, 6 miles\\". But that's not my point here.<br /><br />We seen that sign in the background just about the moment that the comet strikes the ocean. And then between the time the comet strikes and the moment the massive tidal wave comes to shore, we see Elijah and Sweet Thing going up the mountainside.<br /><br />Those mountains, replete with pines and evergreens, appear to be the mountains of the Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains which are more than 200 miles from Virginia Beach. It's going to be mighty tough to get from the oceanfront to the Blue Ridge in the amount of time a tidal wave can travel from the ocean front to a few miles inland.<br /><br />Then there's the scene where the guys in the spaceship are chasing the comet in space. They're flying into the comet's tail, and the space ship is taking a lot of abuse because of it. Watching that scene and knowing NOTHING about spaceships, I had to think, \\"Why not fly alongSIDE the comet and avoid the debris field?\\"<br /><br />Lastly, the scenes of people's response to the news that the world was ending was not believable. We all want to think we'd be big and brave, but I doubt that we'd go about \\"business as usual\\" until a few hours before the world ended. I suspect there'd be chaos, even with the subtle hope that the comet's direction could *maybe* be altered with nuclear missles.<br /><br />Thinking about my own life, I'd grab my dear husband and all the canned goods I could fit in my trunk and head up to those secret hiding places, high in the hills of his native home, West Virginia. I'd make this trek a LOOONG time before the last days of earth, mainly because I wouldn't want to die on westbound I-64, just as the movie depicted. (I guess that was I-64, which is THE road from Virginia Beach to the Blue Ridge.)<br /><br />I surely wouldn't wait until the last minute to see how things went.<br /><br />All that aside, I have to wonder about the rest of the science in this movie.<br /><br />One last comment, I agree with other reviewers that the Tea Leoni was not believable as an anchor.

I totally missed Fleetwood Mac the first time around (i'm 26), so I am just now getting into it and am loving it. I have always heard a few of thier most popular songs and even though this is a greatest hits, i had not heard some of the songs and i love most songs on this album now!<br />excellent!
B000A88EV4|1.0|The fact that this movie snatched worthwhile film festival awards from any other movies is shocking and ridiculous.  ANY other film is better than this!  It has all of the worst traits of other movies that I used to think were bad, but now, in comparison to \\"Naked,\\" I am realizing were actually good.  These sour traits are:  rambling, meaningless, nonsensical, \\"existential,\\" blathering BS; disjointed scenes and lack of a story; characters that the audience has NO reason to like or continue watching for ANY reason; violent, misogynistic, nasty scenes that have no explanation nor reason to be included; a boring, annoying, worthless schmuck for a lead who should just be killed off to put viewers out of their misery; but most importantly, lack of entertainment.  Films are supposed to be entertaining, moving, provocative, interesting, humorous -- whatever the genre, a movie must have a REASON to be watched, a motivation for the viewer.  \\"Naked\\" has none.  The only reason I watched it is because I was told to study the acting technique for a film that I am working on, and believe me, it is NOT a film that holds your attention.  After an hour and a half of pure agony, I fast-forwarded through the rest, and sure enough, nothing really happened.  I'm so annoyed that I bought this!  (Amazon is great, though.)

B000ZK4466|5.0|I usually allow an album a few weeks to settle into my realm before I give a proper critique on it, but considering listening to \\"The Bedlam In Goliath\\" has mostly taken up the majority of days lately, I deemed it appropriate to write a review. I am a very big Mars Volta fan, loving every album they have put out almost equally. So, this album is no different in that matter. This is musically TMV's most complex and challenging album. They range in everything from psychadelia, jazz-fusion, salsa, metal, classic-rock, funk & everything in between. It is a huge 75 minute blast of genre crushing music, and with the exception of \\"Tourniquet Man\\", does not let up for the duration. Considering the first two tracks do sound like they could have easily fit on Amputechture, the rest of the album veers off into a totally new world for Cedric, Omar & Co. This is quite the treat.    1.Aberinkula 9/10...Wastes absolutely no time in getting down to business with the chorus crashing through the speakers from second one. A tremendous hard rocking opener with an amazing 2 minute jam for an outro.  2.Metatron 8.5/10...More or less in the same vein as the first track and at times reminds me of the madness that occurs on \\"Tetragrammaton\\" from the previous record. There is alot going on in this song and it can be a little much, but the soft bridge in the middle that leads right back into mayhem is priceless.  3.Ilyena 10/10...After about a minute of disortion drenched vocals, Cedric's crisp near falsetto voice greets us with \\"if you could see..where i've been..\\" with a slinky guitar riff and a funky bassline, makes this the most danceable TMV song since the salsa section in L'Via. Such an amazingly melodic song.  4.Wax Simulacra 8.5/10...This song nearly comes across as an anti-single, more or less a jab at their record company for craving singles. A two minute song (!) that crams more instrumentation into itself than most bands do on entire records. Pure mayhem.  5.Goliath 10/10...A rework of \\"Rapid Fire Tollbooth\\" off of Omar's last solo offering, and what a rework it is. A more or less sped up version of the previous, with insane rapid soloing, and a 3 minute outro jam that brings to mind the \\"Drunkship Of Lanterns\\" outro and will surely put a smile on your face.  6.Tourniquet Man 8/10...A very soft melodic piece that I personally feel serves as an intro to Cavalettas, as opposed to most saying it is an \\"obvious attempt at a single.\\" Cedric's vocals are nearly indistinguishable, and I agree that yes the last 40 seconds or so are completely unecessary, but I think it actually assists the flow in contrast to disrupting it.  7.Cavalettas 9.5/10...Another track that has been taking quite the lashing for no good reason. I can understand that people would like a little more variation out of a nine and a half minute song, but once the song keeps fading in and out trading off with a stellar staccato riff and Cedric crooning oh so melodically, I can't help but love this song.  8.Agadez 10/10...A prime example of their aforementioned departure of their old sound. The verses consist of a very funky/jazzy vocal delivery while the chorus pummels you with Thomas Pridgen making his cymbals his slaves. The song gradually leads to an amazing climax.  9.Askepios 8/10...Enter the most interesting track probably in the Volta catalogue. A very hard to track to describe, but the inital verses drag by with Omar's slow strumming accompanied by Priden's insane echoed drumming. And right when you're about to hit the skip button, the song transoforms into a whole nother beast. The last 2 minutes with Cedric desperately crying out \\"help me..come alive!\\" confirms that the record wouldn't be the same without this strange bird.  10.Ouroboros 10/10...Opens with a near metal riff and pounding drums and leads way for probably the best track on the album. Just amazing in all aspects, and pardon my contradiction, but this song seems like it could have came straight off of De-loused.  11.Soothsayer 8/10...The other quite unusual track on the record. It contains lush strings, minimal guitar, hold for Omar's very jazzy solo in the middle, Cedric's often distortion laced vocal, and a prayer (?) that carries out the last two minutes. This song is hugely epic and soars majestically at parts, but other times seems like it doesn't know what to do with itself.  12.Conjugal Burns 10/10...I never thought I'd see the day that TMV would make a closer that would rival the greatness of \\"Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt\\", but my worries are quickly suppressed. Begins with a simple riff and Cedric's obnoxious vocal delivery, and slowly builds out into freakout mode and then leads way for the catchiest part on the entire record. When Cedric sings \\"all of this time, bedsore containment, where am i now that the music has faded?\\" you know the Volta have done it again.    Do yourself a favor and pick this gem up, and the rest of the catalogue for the matter if you don't have them. Such an amazing record should not be missed, and along with Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows\\" gets my early vote for record of the year.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|For a \\"dialogue movie,\\" this film is gripping all the way through.  It accurately portrays the angst teenagers feel on a wide range of emotional issues.  The story is about five teenagers, each form a different clique, serving Saturday detention in a high school.  There's a brain, a beauty, a jock, a criminal, and a basket case.  The characters, who hadn't met before, have complete mistrust of each other at the start.  As the movie progresses, each character gradually opens up to prying questions from the others; first, it seems, simply to fight off boredom.  At first, their defense mechanisms are on full guard, and some lie about who they are and why they are in detention.  But as the diverse personalities begin to sympathize with each other, they become more honest.  Eventually, they each admit the true reason for their detention, and reveal their most painful emotions.  This film is a cult classic that will appeal to teens and adults equally.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I give this season 5 stars for 2 reasons.  The first is the final episode where they give the fans a chance to see everyone together - and cap that very episode with Lorelai and Rory sitting in Luke's.  For those who are fans, that is the way it should have ended.  The second reason is that if you own the first 6, you cannot leave a collection incomplete, regardless of how the Palladino's departure affected things.  This was easily the best written show on television.  Although it never truly got the respect and ratings it deserved.  For those who have never seen this show, it is a true gem and I recommend you watch every episode.  Better yet, own every episode.  This is a show that anyone would enjoy for the witty, fast-paced dialogue.  This show proved that you can use words to paint images for the viewer that delivered a far superior experience than actually showing it to the viewer.  It was never preachy and never insulting.  It was a family show that wasn't insipid or inane.  A rare gem indeed.
B00006AW2E|5.0|This was the Rolling Stones' third UK album.  A different version of the album was released as the group's fourth [[ASIN:B00006AW2S US album]].  This UK version features eight covers of R&B and R&R songs, plus four Stones originals.  This is really great stuff.  It should be noted that while the CD is labeled \\"Stereo\\", it is actually in mono.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|A worthy sequel to the first two Bourne installments.  Damon has the Jason Bourne character nailed.  The supporting cast is outstanding, including the newly-introduced characters.  The flow from opening credits to final curtain never lets the viewer down.  Matt Damon as Bourne and Daniel Craig as Bond are truly iconic action heroes for the new millenium.  One can only hope that there will be at least one more film upcoming, to seal the deal on Jason's search for himself.
3822856282|3.0|The idea of having models choose their own poses and snap their own photos is a good one but, for the most part, this book shows the value of a professional photographer.    The models are beautiful and the lighting and technical aspects of the images are fine. But there are inherent difficulties of taking a good image of oneself, not the least of which is knowing exactly when the shutter will snap. Maybe it would take 1,000 attempts to find 50 or 60 happy accidents of spontaneity. Either this book drew from fewer photos, or happy accidents are rarer than I would wish.    It is not hard to look at the pictures, and they are not in bad taste -- just not likely to become new classics. I bought the book, I looked it once, then put it up for sale.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I know, I know. I'm pretty surprised also. I can't believe it! But...it's actually a pretty good CD. I didn't give her any of my money..if you (cough, cough) get my drift... But the songs are catchy, a good dance sound to them. Her vocals are still just terrible, but the beats are so catchy. And if I'm not mistaken, sounds like Pharrell in \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\"? It's a good song, I really like it. \\"Heaven on Earth\\" has that nice 80's retro beat that I love to dance to in the car. I can't believe I am giving her work such a good review, but it really is a good CD. Forget that she has fallen off into the deep end, don't judge her work by her personal life antics. Really, that's childish. \\"Piece of Me\\", excuse the terrible lyrics, and just focus on the beat. This is a good beat CD, which makes it so darn catchy. It's a really good driving to the club CD, seriously.
B000PFU7OO|3.0|This may be the first 3-star review. I liked the movie and the album, although in the long run I ended up by only two tracks, \\"Falling Slowly\\" and \\"Lies\\". Both are really strong tracks but I couldn't justify buying the entire album when I found the songs that were not by Glen up to the same par.

All my friends who have a second child get a copy of this book. ****The trick to this book is to re-read it every 6 months.***  We all have a tendency to fall back into old habits.  I always know when it is time to re-read it because my kids start fighting and getting on my nerves again.  I stumbled across this book accidentally and it has made alll the difference in my life and my kids life.  It won't solve all the problems your kids have with each other but it takes you out of the loop so it doesn't bother you so much and they learn to deal with each other in a healthy way.
B00000I9MK|5.0|This is the 4th B&S album I bought, and it was a fantastic purchase. After snatching up their newer albums (The Life Pursuit and Dear Catastrophe Waitress) I listened to their older stuff and this one really hits the mark. There are a couple of super-strong songs on this one, such as \\"My Wandering Days Are Over\\" and \\"I Don't Love Anyone\\". I don't think there's a dud on here, although \\"Electronic Renaissance\\" starts off with a somewhat-psychedelic intro that doesn't seem to match the bands other efforts.
B00005R24K|4.0|Sam Raimi's first full-length film, about a group of college-age kids who find a necronomicon-like book and unleash the evil spirits of demons who possess them sequentially, has an enormous cult following, and it's easy to see why. Low on both plot and character, the film instead offers an enormous number of scares and thrills, and exhibits a precocious (and highly effective) use of camera placement, make-up effects, and editing and story rhythms--this is one of the best-paced horror films ever made. Raimi makes reference to almost every film you can think of that preceded it, from the expected (CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, SUSPIRIA) to the surprising (THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, with the shot of the tendril creeping up Cheryl's dress, and THE WIZARD OF OZ, with Cheryl's zombie mocking Ash just like the Wicked Witch of the West mocks Dorothy). The tone is mostly straightfaced, with little indication of how tongue-in-cheek the series would later become, though there are some indications in the demons' impossibly but enjoyably arch dialogue. The film won no prizes for progressive gender politics: the hero, Ash (the strongjawed and likeable Bruce Campbell) basically learns how to be a man by ceasing to protect the possessed female characters and instead beating them literally to bits. But on the level of delivering purely shocking thrills it would be hard to match this lowbudget work.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I ordered 2 of them and they arrived pre-assembled, very nicely tightened and easy to use. My 20\\" Apple monitors are now very secured, convenient to work with. The position is easily adjustable with the button push, that is very smart design as it keeps the monitors is exact position you set them. Overall I'm very pleased with awesome quality and terrific design of these arms. It is not every day you can buy such great quality hardware. Very recommended.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|I was not dissapointed when I went to go see this movie in theaters, it was amazing. The only part I would've changed about it was to make the zombies a little bit more realistic, like in the 1st and 2nd movie, but other than that, it was a very enjoyable movie.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm a young buck working in radio on the side, and I just ordered a pair.  I love them!  Far better than anything I've used in the past four years.  Works great with our broadcast equipment.  So far have tried them out with country music and news/talk radio.  The music sounds great, just enough bass and not too much to drive someone mad.  I also just did a talk show today and went an hour without taking them off.<br /><br />A guy I work with has used his pair for over ten years and still uses them every night.  I am slightly worried about the outside wiring, but I don't think it will be a big problem if they are handled with care.
0765318741|3.0|... I bought thinking it was a novel.  It turns out to be a collection of short stories, with the novella 'I Am Legend' in the front.  I did enjoy the story, despite the main character being a blond 40ish Irishman and not African American (like Will Smith on the cover).  However, I couldn't really get into the short stories.  Felt like I over-paid for the content inside this book; four stars for the main story, two stars for the 'bait and switch' short story filler.

B000K15VSA|5.0|Don't you wish there was something like this for some of your other favorite films?! I don't want to repeat what you can read in other reviews, but simply state my impression of this collection. For the casual fan you can buy a standalone copy of the Final Cut and be happy. The directors cut dvd was good but the sound quality was lacking. This final cut version not only sounds amazing but looks even more stunning if that was even possible. With the new sound you can hear things not heard before or easily noticed in the prior version. There is also the long awaited commentary track from Ridley Scott.     For the serious fan or film maven, this collection is a must. The documentary Dangerous Days is one of the best most comprehensive behind the scenes features I have ever seen. I couldn't stop watching it. It has been created and edited with meticulous attention to detail and features interviews with many people connected to the film. Then you've got yet another disc with even more excellent features. And then just when you've got all four versions of the film, you get yet another with the workprint!     I think however that there is yet one more version of this film that could be seen. The Dangerous Days feature says that there was a first pass of the film once they initially put it together. I'm guessing it was probably at least 2.5 hours long. I would love to see that one too!
B00006JMQG|5.0|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is famous for being a prime example of German Expressionism, a strange artistic movement in the 1920s that emphasized mood more than story. This film is filled with strange angular sets, heavy reliance on shadow, and a psychological theme. It is a film enthusiast's delight, especially if said enthusiast believes in the artistic content of silent films.<br /><br />Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) is a spider-like man who creeps around on his cane peddling his great find. Cesare (Conrad Veidt) is a Somnambulist, a man in a hypnotic state who tells the future. He also has murderous tendencies, or so we learn when several people in the town are killed late at night. Everything is not as it seems, however, and the twist ending will leave you breathless.<br /><br />The default music on the Kino DVD might put off traditional silent film fans. It relies heavily on guitar, which makes the suspenseful scenes even moreso and adds to the strangeness of the film, but it might be unfavorably jarring. Thankfully there is an alternative score.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the great DVD \\"Farewell I\\" (and the fact that this double CD was going cheap), I tried it. I was disappointed - it is really a 2.5 star CD, rather than a 3, but for old time's sake... None of the stuff is actually bad, indeed much is pleasant enough in an unmemorable way, but it all is wallpaper music, relatively insipid and a long fall from the previous heights attained. That's always the problem, when you've reached the top, there's only one way you can go, unless you actually can soar like an eagle, which this band apparently no longer can do. Of course, this is what happens to all rock bands (except, perhaps the Beatles), the well runs dry and all you get is more of the same, formulaic stuff, trying to rekindle the spark of days gone by, and failing. In his book \\"Heaven and Hell\\", ex-Eagle Don Felder recollects the band looking at new material, all of which was \\"mediocre\\", including a track \\"I love to watch a woman dance\\". Guess what's on this CD?<br /><br />To me, this record represents the Eagles' tombstone, the road into the cemetery, not out of Eden. They should now rest on their magnificent laurels (some truly great songs and the best-selling album of the 20th century, beating even Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\"). Mike Hawthorn, the UK's first F1 World Champion, retired after becoming champion. When asked why, he replied, \\"It's much nicer to be asked, 'Why did you retire?' than 'Why don't you retire?'\\" On the evidence of this album, the Eagles should quietly adjourn to the \\"oldies\\" circuit and stick with the great songs of yesteryear.<br /><br />P.S. On further listening, I'd downgrade my review to a two-star one. There are only occasional flashes of the old brilliance amid masses of very ordinary filler. Best to buy the DVD \\"Farewell I\\" and catch the performers and their songs at their very best, stop buying Eagles right there and leave on a high point.
B00008J2TM|3.0|I was really excited about CCR in SACD.  Knew it was stereo, but was still expecting clear imaging.  Previous reviews had bombed both Green River and Bayou Country.

0060557818|3.0|Pros: A good story idea and lots of original, thought provoking ideas spread throughout the book.      Cons:  The characters are mostly one-dimensional, the writing is mediocre, and the world is not as vivid as I would expect.      I had heard great things about Neil Gaiman and just occasionally this book seemed like it was going to live up to that reputation, but the bland characters and lifeless writing made it hard to appreciate either the great ideas or the unique world.      The idea of the dark, underground universe is a good one and throughout the book there are several other really interesting ideas, notably angels, labyrinths and markets.  Parts of the book are really engaging and you begin to think that the story is going to pick up and be something great, but it never quite manages to do so.      Gaiman's writing style is generally very bland.  Every now and then he will bust out with a great metaphor or a unique description, but mostly, his writing utterly fails to bring to life London Below.  You can never quite visualize anything -- the sights, the smells, the sounds.  One is merely left with the impression of location after location that is dark and shabby with little to differentiate between them.  This, combined with the fact that he gives little background for his world means that the most interesting parts of the story are often when Richard is in the real world.  There are tantalizing hints of the other London being connected with different periods of history, but even these are under-utilized.      Perhaps this would be excusable if the book had good characters, but for the most part it does not.  The villains, Croup and Vandemar, are the only characters who are fully engaging and even then, this is not because of their complexity, but because their evilness is so refreshingly complete -- it extends from the truly horrific to the petty.  Richard is decently characterized, but all of the other characters, particularly the female ones, are extremely one-dimensional.  Gaiman seems to rely on dramatic reveals rather than slow and steady character development to give them personality, but by the end of the novel, I care so little about most of the characters that it doesn't matter what happens to them.  The ending itself also felt a little cliché and predictable, as good as the story was for the rest of the book.     This book has a pretty good story and lots of really nice ideas, but it needs more attention to character development and more detailed, vivid writing.  Perhaps Gaiman should stick to other forms of writing as this feels like it would have worked much better as a graphic novel or a screenplay where visual cues could give the audience a better understanding of the setting and the characters.

Those that do will be illuminated by the film's radiant imagery and metaphor. Those that criticize the film as nothing more than a banal horror film in space ala [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon]] have clearly missed the point. Pinbacker is the embodiment of Chaos incarnate in opposition to scientific order personified by Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Capa and metaphorically illustrates the conflict of science and religion eclipsed by the line, \\"For seven years I have looked into the face of God,\\" amidst the chaotic maelstrom of nature in its depiction of the dichotomy of the universe and the struggle of the human race for survival on the most fundamental and primordial scale.<br /><br />Sunshine is one of the most stunning Bluray films I've watched yet that demonstrates the full potential and capabilities of what the next generation format has to offer.

B000ENBOV2|5.0|Many people have tried to emulate the wit and insightfullness of this seminal work, but nobody does it as well as Helen Fielding. This book is the origin of much of today's received wisdom on the subject of single women living in London (and probably most other cities in the Western World) - singletons, smug marrieds etc. It is laugh-out loud funny and Fielding has managed to pay homage to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice in her plot in a way which flatters both books. A must-read.[[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)]]
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I'm always late to the party, but sometimes that's a good thing.  I never saw KoH in the theatre (due to frugality) and when I first saw the plain, old theatrical release on DVD (free from the library!), I liked the movie, but I could see how people would have issues with it - it felt disjointed and sort of hollow.  I happened to borrow Alexander the same weekend, which was so awful that I kept hoping Colin Farrell would get squished by an elephant.  I was somewhat worried that I liked KoH as well as I did b/c it was soooo much better than Alexander, but I eventually risked purchasing the director's cut DVD from Amazon.<br /><br />I've since watched the movie a couple times more and now I can state more clearly what I feel it's strengths are and complain about my major beef.<br /><br />First, I loved the scenes in \\"France\\" b/c they seemed so gritty and realistic.  One just about felt the cold watching these scenes.  My particular favorite from this part of the film was the scene of Godfrey's camp and all of the little world-building details that went into it - the Hospitaller brushing his teeth in the river, the animal fat being rendered to spread a protective coating on the gear, etc.  That grittiness was pretty much carried througout the movie and I really appreciated it (nothing worse than a period piece without a little wear and tear).<br /><br />Second, I thought the siege scenes were quite wonderful.  One could feel the power of the treb's as they launched their missiles.  I think these scenes were actually a bit better than those similar in the LoTR movies - partly b/c there was nothing to admire about the enemy in LoTR.  The sequence of Balian's siege tower problem and Saladin's reaction to how the former blacksmith copes made me laugh out loud - not in mockery, in sheer admiration (and a little jealousy - Age of Empires never let me do that)!<br /><br />Third, I know some of the multi-culturalism is not historically accurate, but given that this movie was made released in 2005 and can still be viewed today on DVD, I was more than willing to accept a little creative license concerning this aspect of the film.  In our current world, intellectually honest people understand the similarities between the extremists of the major religions - the main one being their universal intolerance for any thing, thought, or person that appears to conflict with their worldviews.  Intellectually honest people are also so tired of the blatant hypocrisy practised by the most self-righteous, so-called religious people.  The themes of anti-fanaticism and true righteousness are throughout the movie.  I know Saladin, Baldwin, and Balian didn't really, fully think of matters in such ways back then, but if their stories (dramatised) can be made so obviously relevant to today's problems, I think a greater good is served.<br /><br />Finally, I though the movie was well cast.  In particular, I thought the performances of Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Edward Norton, Alexander Siddig, and the Syrian actor who played Saladin (Ghassan Massoud I think, but I could be butchering his name) were spot on.  All of the roles were well-played, but these seemed especially nicely-nuanced to me.  For the record, David Thewlis' Hospitaller had some of the best lines - ones that really summed up the feeling of the movie.<br /><br />Now my beef...  I don't pretend to be an expert on the times depicted in the movie (the Age of Empires games and the Brother Cadfael books being my primary medieval education), but I know a little something about a woman's place in the world back then.  I simply could not buy the relationship between Sybilla and Balian.  It was too improbable and bold historically and too sudden to be truly believeable with Balian's story arc (he's in mourning for pity's sake).  Plus, I didn't find the romance added anything to the story.  It could have been a sympathetic friendship with maybe a future romance implied at the very end.  I think the elementsregarding her son (not in the original release) would have been better without the love-story in the background.  Because of my trouble with this relationship, I would actually prefer to rate the movie just shy of four stars.<br /><br />I summary though, if you like well-made epics with lots of behind-the-scenes extras, have any interest in medieval battle (either historical or fantastical), and find yourself worrying more and more about the role of fanaticism in the world, give this cut of the movie a try.  It holds up well under repeated viewing.se) would have been better without the love-story in the background.

When I first put it on the tinny sound of the cymbals on Dance on the Volcano was so obvious...compression out the wazoo?  Since I went out of my way to get the non-US SACD/DVD version, this was a particular disappointment.  Otherwise, it is a high recommendation because of content.  After Dance, other songs didn't appear as tinny on percussion.  Who knows?  I was happy enough to get Duke and Abacab.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I had the pleasure of watching this in the theater when first released back in 1966. As a 9 year-old, my friends and I went just for the racing footage, nothing more. To us, the story-line was secondary. So for years after we would talk about it in those terms until the film faded to the back pages of memory. At 176 minutes, it never really got any air time on television, and if it had it would have been butchered beyond recognition. So finding the 40th Anniversary, 2-disc Special Edition, I immediately bought it and took it home to watch. What an utter joy this film is, on SO many levels.<br /><br />Grand Prix is a story of triumph and tragedy on the mid-1960's Formula One circuit. James Garner plays Pete Aron, an American racer and ex-Grand Prix champion who, because of his over aggressive style, has been relegated to second driver on the British team. The movie starts off and immediately grabs your attention as we are thrust into the Grand Prix of Monaco. The first 20 minutes are as exciting and breath-taking as any film I have ever watched. Due to Aron's over-aggressiveness, the number one driver British driver, Scott Stoddard (Played by Brian Bedford) is almost killed in a horrific crash. The team fires Aron and he ends up being a television reporter for the next couple of races. He is \\"rescued\\" from that drudgery by the fledging Yamura team and is back in the race. What follows is absolutely the best racing footage ever filmed. Rounding out the exception cast is Yves Montand (Ferrari driver Sarti), Eva Marie Saint (a magazine reporter who falls in love with the married Sarti), Tishiro Mifune (Owner of Team Yamura), and in cameos, a host of 1960's Formula One drivers (Jimmy Clark, Graham Hill, Dan Gurney, and Bruce McLaren, to name a few).<br /><br />Although the non-racing storyline has a bit of a soap opera-ish feel to it, Aron having an affair with Stoddard's estranged wife (Jessica Walters), Sarti having an affair with the reporter, and the other Ferrari driver having an affair with one of the racing groupies, it all works. All the mixing & matching relationships help build tenseness on and off the race course. When the crippled Stoddard returns to racing beyond all odds, the tenseness becomes extreme. What makes the plot works is the character development of all main parts. Each person has their demons to overcome, and because of the length of the film, director John Frankenheimer is able to explore those demons well.<br /><br />The special features include a great documentary \\"Pushing the limit: The making of Grand Prix\\" which makes the extra price well worth it. It is very detailed and includes interviews with Garner & Frankenheimer. Also we're treated to a short film about Formula One racing in the sixties, which will always be my favorite period.<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this film to any racing buff as well as someone looking for a strong, plot-driven film. Yes, it's almost 3 hours long but it doesn't seem like it.ffair with one of the racing groupies, it all works. All the mixing & matching relationships help build tenseness on and off the race course.

B000H5TH1Q|4.0|A trash gem from Brian De Palma. Here, Rear Window meets Vertigo in the porn subculture of the 1980s Southern California. Jake, a bit actor in B films (played engagingly by Craig Wasson) finds his girlfriend sleeping with another guy and has to move from his home. A fellow actor needs someone (or so he says) to take care of his house while he is away on a trip, and Jake agrees to do the job. Before leaving, he shows him his favorite neighbor, a beautiful and sculptural woman who strips with her window open each night. Jake spies her with the house's telescope every night, becoming obsessed. He meets her once in the beach, and is able to help recover her purse from a thief, but is incapacitated by claustrophobia when the burglar runs through a tunnel. Eventually, Jake witnesses her brutal murder through the telescope by someone dressed as an Indian. But, if you've seen Vertigo (and know De Palma has been paying homage to Hitchcock in virtually all of his movies) you can imagine not everything (or everyone) is what is seems. Melanie Griffith is also great playing what could be described as the updated role Kim Novak played in Vertigo. Among the movie's odd touches: a musical interlude in a video form with 80s band Frankie Goes to Hollywood playing their hit single \\"Relax\\".
B000Y7U98C|1.0|This movie is ridiculous. Nothing wrong with Science Fiction that takes itself seriously, but please show an effort!    The characters are not developed at all. The only clue you get about their motivations is the obvious mission objective and some conflict between them. Other than that, each character is replaceable and totally forgettable.    And the story sucks too. If we were to send a bunch of unstable post-adolescent college kids on a mission to the Sun to save human kind, well... maybe we don't deserve to survive.    And then at some point, it turns into a slasher movie, destroying any good will that I could still be holding for this movie.    Avoid at all cost!

B000003S5H|3.0|Moon Safari gets a bit of praise and claim to be the best Air album. I honestly cannot tell why. There is only two or three songs on here worth listening to and one is basically a continuation of the other.    \\"La femme d'argent\\" - a fantastic track. Its the only song on this cd worth  listening to.  \\"Sexy Boy\\" - a terrible, horrible, disgusting track. Every time it starts I hit the Next button. I can't stand this song.  \\"All I Need\\" - bores me to tears.   \\"Kelly Watch The Stars\\" - tries to be a good song but doesn't quite make it.  \\"Talisman\\" - This one is more a \\"La femme d'argent\\" part 2 so its good as well.  \\"Remember\\" - This one tries to be good too. Its slightly better than \\"Kelly Watch The Stars\\"  \\"You Make It Easy\\" - another continuation. This time it's \\"All I Need\\" part 2. Still bores me to tears.  \\"Ce matin-là\\" - On the level of \\"Kelly Watch The Stars.\\"  \\"New Star In The Sky\\" - listen to this on as well. Its very good.  \\"Le voyage de Penelope\\" - On the level of \\"Remember\\"    I would recommend Talkie Walkie over this album. It doesn't take as many chances musically as this album does, but it also succeeds a lot more and makes for a more pleasing experience. If you like Zero 7 (and apparently many of the people looking at this album do) then you will enjoy Talkie Walkie a bit more than this album
B000Y179KO|4.0|I have to admit- when I heard that the Eagles were coming out with a new studio album, I was excited, and maybe a bit nervous.  The Eagles are one of my favorite bands of all time, and have produced some great recordings.  That having been said, their studio albums have been a bit of a mixed bag... usually a few gems and an equal number of fillers (with the exception of Hotel California)    After several listens of Long Road Out of Eden, i would have to say that it is one of their most consistent and focused albums.  There's a little bit for everyone... country-rock, pop, folk, and harder rock.  So no matter which flavor of the Eagles you like best, there's something for you.    I was skeptical of the double album at first, but honestly, there aren't any losers here.  From the haunting harmonies of \\"No More Walks In the Wood\\" to Spanish-seasoned send-off \\"It's Your World Now,\\" Long Road Out of Eden is a fantastic effort.  My favorites include \\"How Long,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Hear Any More,\\" \\"Waiting in the Weeds,\\" \\"No More Cloudy Days,\\" and \\"Long Road Out of Eden.\\"     Do yourself a favor and check out this album... The Eagles are back and as good as ever!

When a character commits adultery, deserts a friend during an emergency, tries to get rid of a mentally unstable lover by feeding him (she thinks) contaminated grapes, lies to her husband that he's the father of her baby, lies about whom she had an affair with, causing that man to be beaten up, and goes on about her life with the same expression throughout, with no change or growth in herself, her story is shallow, and the movie is pointless.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly Clarkson's sophomore effort  Breakaway was a pop breakthrough, ruling the sales charts and airwaves of the world for nearly two years with it's hit parade of infectious singles. Yet, that's the best that can be said for the disc - it was so full of hit singles that it fell flat as an album, sounding instead like a prefabricated Best of Kelly Clarkson mixtape.<br /><br />My December couldn't be more different. It's a strong, moody album full of honest tunes with sharp edges. In other words, it is not packed with obvious singles.<br /><br />What's more, from start to finish it is unequivocally a rock record, even when it offers A/C-friendly fare. Huge rock records fronted by women have been few and far between in recent years - Evanescence and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are the only two acts that fit the bill. And, it's been even longer since a notable solo effort by a woman in rock caught fire with fans and critics. PJ Harvey? Sheryl Crow? Alanis Morissette?<br /><br />Pat Benatar?<br /><br />You can hear a little of all of those acts on December, especially in its incendiary guitar tone and whiskey-tinged, less-girlish vocals. The zenith, and Clarkson's definitive application for membership into the sisterhood of chick rock, is definitely \\"Hole.\\" For a few seconds it actually quotes a YYY's guitar tone (\\"Y Control\\"?) before dissolving into a loose, circular riff that would have been raucous enough even without it's seesawing, sometimes-discordant keyboards.<br /><br />By the time Kelly rips into the chorus, wailing \\"There's a hole inside of me!\\" you would be forgiven if you forgot that the song found its way to your ears via the results of American Idol. Breakaway had its share of crescendos, and of wailing, but not once did it sound this tangibly dangerous, this rock'n'roll.<br /><br />It's \\"Hole\\" and other edgier tracks of My December that are putting a scare in record execs and radio programmers alike, but the fear is misplaced. Maybe intentionally? The guitars are loud, but not loud enough to obscure solid all-ages entries like \\"Can I Have A Kiss.\\" The titular sentiment is disarmingly reductive - especially after vicious kiss off of \\"Never Again\\" or, for that matter, of hits like \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\" or \\"Walk Away.\\" \\"Don't move,\\" Kelly vainly pleads, \\"I need to remember you just like this.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" could have turned out fiercer but keeps its rage under wraps, both vocally and in a restrained pop-punk guitar arrangement. Even the chorus files down its edge, admonishing \\"don't waste your time on me\\" before emphasizing \\"my friend.\\"<br /><br />If that understated sweetness seems too dissonant in comparison to the jilted, rebellious Kelly Clarkson on display elsewhere on the disc, consider that the widely-reported original inspiration for the disc was the unlikely Patty Griffin. Most people credit Patty as a top-notch songwriter and the country/folk troubadour behind the acoustic Living With Ghosts or the delicate 1,000 Kisses, to which Kelly's ballads \\"Sober\\" and the superb \\"Irvine\\" owe debt of inspiration. However, the standout in her catalog is the amped up, mostly-electric Flaming Red, which lent a heavy edge to her simple, devastating compositions.<br /><br />My December doesn't share Red's songwriting chops, but Kelly is directly channeling its sentiment and production, which emphasized a blend of sweet and sour. \\"Maybe\\" starts with a pinging, countryish acoustic riff and slowly accumulates some background vibes before finally letting its rhythm section and dramatic strings kick in halfway through, just as the vocals get a little desperate. It's not the best song on the disc, but it might be the most fully realized.<br /><br />As a solo rocker writing with a band Kelly is slightly more prone to missteps than on a disc helmed by a dozen varied co-writers to whom songwriting was a science. Some arrangements feature unnecessary extra riffing when a simpler formula would connect morestrongly, as on the choruses of \\"Never Again,\\" as well as the entirety of the too-frantic \\"One Minute.\\" And, sometimes while chasing a specific sound Kelly disappears into it, as on Evanescence-esque \\"Haunted\\" (retreading the \\"Addicted\\"/\\"Hear Me\\" duo from her last disc).<br /><br />However, Clarkson's co-written lyrics trump the clich&eacute;s handed to her by pro songwriting teams over the course of her past two discs, even on the disc's weaker tracks, such as anony-rocker \\"Judas.\\" The verses of the slight \\"How I Feel\\" hint at Kelly breaking out into Rent's \\"Out Tonight,\\" but remains enticing for the increasing raspyness she slips into her delivery, and the simple two-part harmony on the bridge - a relief from the relentless stacked and heavily-processed vocal chords on the hits of Breakaway<br /><br />The real misstep here are the two songs that were discarded. Tinnily recorded secret track \\"Shivers\\" (or, per Kelly's pronunciation, \\"Chivas\\") is a simple acoustic regret that hearkens to Fiona Apple's playful blend of sass and smarts. \\"So much for true love,\\" she laments, \\"I'll take the shivers instead\\" (adding later, \\"instead of your bed\\"). It's a terrific song that easily holds its own against \\"Sober\\" and \\"Be Still\\" - why waste it?<br /><br />Even worse, \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" rivals \\"Hole\\" for rock and approaches \\"SUBG\\" levels of life-altering catchiness by the time it reaches its slinky, syncopated ... actually, sort of arousing bridge, but it was left off of the disc as an iTunes-only bonus track. Kelly, Kelly, Kelly - what's up with that, dawg?<br /><br />The reality is that Kelly will never stop being the winner of American Idol, which is maybe a promise that no solo disc will go without a hint of the quintessential, occasionally campy songs that won her that contest. Here they're represented by the secular gospel/funk/rock of \\"Yeah\\" (almost descending into INXS's \\"Need You Tonight\\" during its bridge) and the simple chords and R&B tinged beat on \\"Be Still.\\"<br /><br />The most idolized of all Idols or not, Kelly Clarkson's My December isn't Breakaway, and with it she has become something more than a pop singer.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Just goes to show that they just don't make horror movies the way they used to in Hollywood.  The thing about Jaws is that it goes beyond a horror film....it is a masterpiece.  While today's horror films continue to pour on the blood and guts and sacrificing B-actors and a poor story/script, Jaws shows us that a horror film can be big, directed well, contain a tight story and feature top A-list actors in Hollywood.  Chances are you have seen this film by now, if not, jump on in...the water's fine.<br /><br />If there is one negative surrounding Jaws is that it eventually produced some embarassing sequals.  If there is one negative thing about the first Jaws, its that the shark can look fake.  Ironically, it looked better to me than any of the sequals, and we don't really see much of the shark until the films end.  That's the beauty of the horror surounding this film.  We see helpless people swimming in the water, and then out of nowhere the screaming and panic begins, without even seeing the shark.  That is the real scare to this film.  In its day, there were definetly some intense scenes of blood (not so much gore except for a guy's leg falling off).  One scene still compete's today with any blood-filled horror film and that is near the end of Jaws, when the shark jumps on the boat and Quint (Robert Shaw) falls into its mouth, wrestling for about 20 seconds with his lower torso being chomped.<br /><br />What makes the film so accomplished in the end is much more than the horror.  The characters are superb, and the wonderfully written script is used so well by the actors.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw share incredible chemistry in this film, with scene after scene of frustrations, anger, joy and cooperation.  Watching these three in action is a show in itself.  Though not known for its comedy aspects, I found little lines and scenes here and there to be extremely funny, given the nature of things.<br /><br />What bugs me the most about the dvd, is when I have watched Jaws on television there are several extended scenes (not deleted scenes) that are not included on dvd.  I actually like these scenes too and miss them when I watch my dvd.<br /><br />Jaws is a 5 star classic - easily.  It has gone down as one of the greatest horror film accomplishments of all time.  It certainly is not the scariest movie you will see today, but it is an A+ in every regard.  Don't watch this in the bathtub.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Horror - 4.5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5Jaws on television there are several extended scenes (not deleted scenes) that are not included on dvd.

0321544080|5.0|This book is written in such a way that photographers of every experience, style and age will gain huge value.<br />This is now my favorite book to date on photography.<br /><br />My one line summary:<br /><br />It will teach you \\"how to have a single photo tell a real story\\", with emotion and from different perspectives.  In my opinion it is a must for amateurs through pros.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The books is written simply with no unexplained jargon.  If the author mentions an industry word (e.g. Ripping Film), he goes on to explain what it means.  You learn some of the industry street terms and get a feel for the authors experience shooting.<br /><br />Every turn of the page has a compelling photo which is the subject of the lesson.  Some lessons are technical such as how-to on lighting, while others are lessons on approach, demeanor or attitude.<br /><br />The book is emotionally engaging. You want to put the book down and immediate try some of the approaches.<br /><br />The author isn't demonstrating ego - this book is NOT about him!  It's about the the world around him. You turn each page and learn how he captured an amazing picture of someone like  James Brown, or how he found the real story in Augusta.<br /><br />It will give you ideas on how to have a single photo tell a real story.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only real complaint: This is a soft cover and Amazon shipped it in an envelope instead of a box.  The edges of the cover got crimped a bit.<br /><br />Feedback for the author:<br />I'd love for more  - just simply put - I want the second volume. I'd love to figure out how to get this signed :)<br /><br />This is a real gem and I would have loved it in perfect condition for my office desktop.<br /><br />Great job to the author.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I'm a regular at the gym and wanted something to do at home when it was too cold or I was too tired to drive to the gym. No equipment needed and a small space works too. This video is great, not too slow or easy going and the 40 mins is just the right time, then if your partner is around you can always add that part or just modify and do the whole thing yourself. After taking a break from the gym due to exhaustion this was the perfect way to get back into working out.

1582701709|1.0|I watched the DVD and I agree with some of the previous comments that it was, simply put, not worth it. Ms. Byrne employed her movie experience as a producer to cleverly package this prosletyzed message of mind over matter, power of the mind, and metaphysics.<br /><br /> I believe in positive thinking as health to the soul and body. This has been proven medically. I use my faith and hope in keeping the mind from being sick.<br /><br />BUT I DO WONDER. \\"The Secret\\" is to focus on those things that bring you joy and bliss as a positive energy and set into motion 'The Law of Attraction'. What happens if your focus is, for example,  on another person's spouse, or getting out of jail? Covetous feelings and lust  are a couple of feelings that can evoke tremendous internal satisfaction!<br /><br />What if a person really needed money because they were in dire poverty and the only thing near to them with a large amount of cash was a wealthy neighbor or corner bank?  Employing Ms. Byrne's  \\"Ask, believe and receive\\" strategy could be dangerous.<br /><br />I read in a book, written by a licensed chemical dependency counselor, that criminals have a firm belief of entitlement that propels them to get what they want at whatever cost. This is why criminals often do not feel guilt or a belief that they did anything wrong.  The 'genie in  the bottle' can, therefore, be a  Pandora's Box!<br /><br />I HAVE TO WONDER...
B000VNMMPM|3.0|This is a charming movie that has quite a positive outlook, go and do it attitude. I enjoyed the attitude of the movie and the slow transformation of both characters. Angel-A is helping Andre get his life together. In the end, Andre himself has an influence on Angel-A and the characters struggle to go for what they want. I liked the movie, it was a bit slow though. The cinematography was excellent.
B000K15VSA|1.0|Since I only have this movie on the Criterion laser disc, I have been waiting for the International version to be released ever since DVDs first appeared. I have no interest in any other cuts, second thoughts or pandering to fashionistas. I was thrilled to read about the many digital 'fixes' to both sound and picture that were supposed to be coming in the final versions to be released on DVD. Imagine my shock and surprise after purchasing this set when I discovered that I had been ripped off by Ridley Scott, Charles de Lauzirika et al in that the International version has not been improved one iota! It is hardly better than the version on laser disc. The advertising was and is dishonest and misleading. If possible, I would have liked to buy just the one version that I first saw in 1982 and haved loved ever since but crass commercialism has obviously triumphed and I feel comprehensively ripped off.<br /><br />I have experienced only honesty and professionalism since I first began dealing with amazon well over fifteen years ago. I suggest that you should make it clear to potential purchaser's of this package that they will only get an improved version of Ridley Scott's current thinking which will not necessarily include an improved version of the movie they really expect and want. I have read Phillip Dick's novel and none of the filmed releases adheres to his novel in any respect so I do not want to enter into any arguments as to which version is 'correct', I just love the version I first saw even though I did try to watch the first attempt at a Director's cut and was unmoved by it.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|After Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is in line for my next favorite Jane Austen novel. I was very much pleased to learn about the new ITV production of her novels. I own the 1995 Amanda Root/Ciarin Hinds version and truth be told, it took me a few viewings to get used to Ciarin Hinds, but now, forgetting his perceived age, I like him. Amanda Root, I always did like, especially because of the common sense and propriety she brought to the role. Her second bloom that occurred later in this version was simply splendid.<br /><br />This ITV version is quite shocking for me. In some parts it reminded me of an earlier version of Mansfield Park where Fanny kept speaking into the camera. The Anne of this version did likewise, and it was very annoying. While Captain Wentworth's personal beauty was more appealing in this version, there was something lacking still in his performance. In fact, this entire version lacked a certain something. But I think the biggest CRINGE worthy moment for me was Anne running through the streets of Bath. That was quite shocking. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still cringe.<br /><br />Sorry, but I'll stick to my 1995 version until, perhaps, in the future Persuasion is re-done in the true spirit of Jane Austen.

B00136JOVG|4.0|When it comes down great guilty pleasure artists, we often seem to forget what influence they've made on music today, especially back in the 80's. For those acts, we always will think of Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. But, for Billy Joel, he really made the best that was still coming around. 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man, he has still dominated with his music on the radio. While he hasn't recorded an album since 1993's River Of Dreams, his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end. But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol, and doesn't own a Billy Hoel record, than this is a start to download for your MP3 player.<br /><br />The Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy's long and successful career from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The songs here have all been remastered well, and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times. The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man, River Of Dreams, We Didn't Start The Fire, the delight diddy Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time, all the way to #1 hits like My Life, It's Still Rock N' Roll To Me and Allentown. There is so much that is great in music, but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You're Only Human (Second Wind), Modern Woman and a few other good songs. But, those are small complaints, because those songs were only minor hits. Instead, the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead.<br /><br />All in all, The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to, whether you're a hard core fan, or anyone who is new to Billy Joel's songs. This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet, or buy from your local record store. Even though Billy Joel hasn't made anything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+ything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.

1582701709|5.0|Didn't read the book but watched the movie with a Meetup group - \\"The Bay Area Smart Women Group\\". It was an interesting movie and I agreed with most of its statements. I don't see much of material stuff as some comments claimed here.    I liked the explanation by Ray who recommended it to the group: Focus on What and Why, How would take care of itself.
0743277708|4.0|The last time I read this book I was in middle school, and as I remember, I got bored with it about halfway through.  Coming across it now by happy accident, I thought I would give it another try.  It is a weird book, fun, not quite children's tale, not fully, thematically adult.  It contains some interesting social commentary, with each rabbit warren being representative of a certain type of social order.  I like the fictional rabbit ethnography, the rabbit stories and rabbit art forms.  The story drags in parts, but can basically be divided into: Hazel's crew leaves their home warren; Hazel's crew encounters a \\"kept\\" warren; Hazel's crew begins a new warren at Watership Down; Hazel's crew deals with and resolves conflicts with a neighboring, Mussolini-fascist type of warren.  Scattered throughout the novel are efforts at securing female rabbits for Hazel's new warren; beneficial inter-species friendships; fights and frictions between the different rabbits in Hazel's expanding crew.  Adams is really into the plants of England's countryside, so be prepared for descriptive passages of weeds that go on and on.  Still, I guess from the perspective of a rabbit, those passages would be pretty important, right?  Anyway, it's a good read that covers a lot of ground, and is highly imaginative.
0143038419|2.0|As I gritted my teeth through Gilbert's superimposed, ultra-narcissistic narrative, I kept praying that she'd end up actually realizing how completely self-absorbed and boring she actually is.  There is a scene in Ubud in which a Shaman--who, earlier in the book, had been sooooo taken with Gilbert that he asked her to come live with him--looks at the author with complete indifference.  He doesn't know her from Adam.  This \\"memoir's\\" only possible saving grace would have been if it ended at that very moment. Nope!!  She goes on to become the toast of Ubud and, SURPRISE!  Meets the man of her dreams JUST as the section called \\"Love\\" comes to a close.  I don't know what the heck she was studying at that ashram, but everyone there seemed more interested in dear little \\"Groceries\\" than the trivial unbounded universe.  Yes, a memoir ought to be reflective and personal, but its purpose is to give the reader some fresh insight into the human condition or the people and places the narrator experiences (Paul Theroux, anyone??).  Gilbert never lets us look away from her long enough to learn anything except that she sure is cute and popular!! I gave it two stars, though, because there are some funny one liners and a chapter devoted to poor, third-string Napoli and its oft- overlooked cuisine.

This book was one of my children's favorites, they repeatedly asked for it to be read to them.  Later on I found out they thought it was funny to see mommy cry/tear up at each reading.    Robert Munsch (Author) is one of the best children's writers and I have bought this book for my son who now has a daughter. Prefect as a baby gift from a grandparent.
0312360266|3.0|I must have not read the same book as the other reviewers. I really wanted to write a thorough review of this book but I waited a week since I read it and can really remember very little about the book...which is never a good sign. It was a bit stale. Yes, it was done in a creative way, a mark on the forehead and being whisked away to a vampire school is unique. The main heroine is so-so, nothing really stood out for me with her. It seemed like the character relationships/friendships just developed too fast to be believable. Don't even get me started on the end, it was as if the writer had no idea at all where she wanted to take the story. It was absolutely ridiculous; it felt like a cop-out ending to wrap things up. It entertained me enough to finish it though so I give it 3 stars. I will probably even attempt the second book to see if it gets better. If you want to read really excellent vampire books try: Vampire Academy series, Twilight series,and Vampire Diaries series. By far more superior!
B00005JPXY|5.0|Saw Cloverfield a few days ago, and felt compelled to review it. This movie was awesome. Other reviews I've read have criticized the film because the characters aren't particularly memorable or likable. Granted, but I think that criticism misses the point and misunderstands the genre. Horror movies have gotten a lot of mileage out of thin characters, and this one is doing the same thing. (bonus points for choosing NY hipsters as the monster chow)     The point of the movie is not the characters, it's the whole idea. Movies like Cannibal Holocaust and Blair Witch Project have used the recovered footage conceit before, but Cloverfield takes the prize because of how well JJ Abrams and co. seemlessly integrate very convincing effects and quality production. Anyhow, to wrap it up, this move is intense and a lot of fun. Check it out and don't take it too seriously.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|NEXT certainly wasn't as bad as some critics made it out to be.  My local newspaper reviewer said the plot was convoluted - what rubbish!  This is one of the easiest films that one could watch.  Yes, the film could have been much darker and more complex.  Philip Dick the writer had a propensity for that - but of course, what we get is not a sci-fi film noir but a Nicholas Cage film.  I am a big Nicholas Cage fan, but I have to say that he no longer (if he did) has that dark edge.  He's almost cartoony - and his hair needs serious help.  Still, a good cast, a simple story - make this easy to follow.  Rent or buy it for entertainment.  Nicholas Cage's performances would be much better if someone could do a Sean Connery on him and fix his hair.  Seriously.
B000W07EKW|5.0|It all started with the Bourne Identity. I'm not sure what Robert Ludlum's novels are like but I'm pretty sure it's as intense and captivating as the movies. Matt Damon is just right for playing the role of Jason Bourne. In my opinion, the story and cast are above average. Action scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Bourne collection is a must have!
B000O599WG|5.0|High Noon  vs. Rio Bravo?    Should we think of it as a competition when Rio Bravo was made as a protest against the way Will Kane had to go around the town looking for special deputies only to get turned down?    The behind-the-scenes talk is that both John Wayne and director Howard Hawks had contempt for High Noon and the way its protagonist went looking for help to fight the bad guys.  Guess these two guys never heard of the Second Amendment or even of special deputies or posses!    Actually as stand-alone stories both movies have messages worth learning.  One should see true life experiences in both of them.  In High Noon the town's people all had excuses for why helping out their marshal wasn't good for them at the moment.  Good thing the men who fought for us in the Revolutionary War didn't refuse to join the Army because they \\"got a wife and kids\\".      And make no mistake, the U.S. Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment in the base of our political system as a way for the citizenry to remain armed in order to oppose tyranny.  Now it may be true that they were worried more about tyranny from oppressive governments both foreign and domestic, but just how good would the people of Kane's town be against tyranny on a national scale when they couldn't even be bothered to stand up against it in their own back yard?    In High Noon Will Kane eventually finds help from his own wife who comes to see that she owes more loyalty to her vows to her husband than to some goofy religious belief that says that to fight evil you lie down in front of it and spread your legs -- figuratively, if not literally.    In Rio Bravo the sheriff says upholding the law is the job of professionals, then what does he do?  Like his friend says, he employs a drunk and a cripple, and then decides he needs more help and looks to a teenager and deputizes the kid.  LOL  Said cripple, by the way, who so unprofessionally shoots and nearly blows the head off of a fellow deputy and can't evenadmit it when he made a mistake.  (\\"How was I supposed to know the Dude was gonna go and git hisself duded up?  Huh?...  HUH???\\")  And then when Feathers tries to sit guard in the lobby of the hotel and falls asleep Chance treats her tenderly for her effort and carries her off to bed.  Looks like Wayne and Hawks couldn't make up their minds just what it was they believed!  Sort of schizoid, IMO.      Too bad for them, but no reason for us to not take away some important lessons from both of these movies, one of which is that it seems it is never comfortable or convenient nor can we expect the timing to be \\"right\\" when we are called upon to stand up against evil; and having one's personal demons going on inside is no excuse to bow out of the fray, turn inward, and forsake the common good.
0891419195|5.0|My grandfather was an infantryman in Germany in WWII and in trying to gain insight into his service, I read several books on the war in Europe. Later I picked up a copy of this book seeking comparisons between the war against Germany and the struggle against Japan.<br /><br />I'm glad I did because this outstanding book is hard to put down. Sledge is graphic and truthful of his experiences in a truly hellish war. But what struck me as being a bit different than some other similar books is that \\"Sledgehammer\\" as he was called, does not use any profanity or embellish anything at all. He doesn't need to.<br /><br />He is instead very humble and matter-of-fact, realizing that the truth is more than enough to draw you into the carnage, brutality and the waste. His message is that yes \\"war is hell\\" and a tragic waste of good men, some of whom were still just as much boys as soldiers.<br /><br />These guys were trained to kill. There was no choice either, you killed or were in turn killed yourself. After terrible months enduring the crippling heat, disease, incredibly rugged terrain, a fanatical and brutal enemy, the constant sickening stench of death and seeing their friends slaughtered, they finally prevailed.<br /><br />You'd think then they would be sent somewhere to recover from the living hell that was Peleliu and Okinawa...maybe to Hawaii for some much-deserved rest. But instead they were ordered to bury the rotting, maggot infested enemy dead! It's an unbelievable story.<br /><br />Sledge's book will give you the most sincere appreciation for the men who have given so much so we can enjoy the freedoms we all take for granted. In reading it, I realized the war on both enemies was terrible. Yet, a German soldier would surrender if he'd no option while a Japanese soldier would very seldom ever do so. I think when you combine the horrible battleground conditions with the fanaticism of the Japanese soldier, it's evident the war in the Pacific was possibly even more hellish.<br /><br />For a perspective on the war against Germany I'd recommend \\"You can't get much closer than this\\" by A.Z. Adkins and \\"Taught to kill\\" by John Babcock. Both of the above are also truly outstanding books.<br /><br />The next time you are having a bad day and need a little perspective in life, pick up a book like \\"With The Old Breed\\" and re-set your prioritys and values a bit.<br /><br />In so doing take a look at the obituries in your local paper and you realize there aren't many of these great men left. My grandfather has been gone for years and Sledge passed on in 2001.<br /><br />For many, it's too late to say \\"thank you\\".ish.<br /><br />For a perspective on the war against Germany I'd recommend \\"You can't get much closer than this\\" by A.Z.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|Singer-songwriters are garnering a lot more respect nowadays, as evidenced by singers like A Fine Frenzy, Brandi Carlile, Charlotte Martin, and now, Sara Bareilles. Being included in company as the afforementioned is tough, did Sara pull out the stops and give us a worthy addition?<br /><br />By God, did she ever.<br /><br />There's really not a better time to get into piano-driven pop(ish) music than now. A Fine Frenzy came out of nowhere to give us an outstanding CD. Tori Amos, with 2007's American Doll Posse, reminded us why she is the pioneer in this type of music. And the lesser known (which I maintain is a criminal act to not know who she is), Charlotte Martin, who is truly proving to be a force to wrecken with. But now we have Sara Bareilles, a fresh-faced girl with a voice that demands attention with lyrics that are impossibly catchy.<br /><br />Little Voice, I will admit, is a CD that needs to be heard several times to be truly appreciated. Sure, I liked it after the first time, but after the sixth and seventh times, I found myself wanting to hear it nonstop. Songs like Love Song, Come Round Soon, and Gravity are all sure to jump out upon first listen. Others that are sure to come around are Bottle It Up, One Sweet Love, Morningside, and Many The Miles.<br /><br />Each song is complete with incredible vocals, expect that automatically, but the music is well worth a listen as well. Come Round Soon boasts the most earcatching music of the CD easily, but Many The Miles, and Gravity come in a close second and third.<br /><br />My favorite songs are One Sweet Love, Come Round Soon, Morningside, Many The Miles, and Gravity. Basically, if you're the least bit into this type of music you're sure to enjoy this CD. All the things you love about piano-driven music are present and accounted for, all you have to do is put forth the effort to listen to it.
B000YAFJYS|5.0|PERSEPOLIS opens with a woman sitting in an airport terminal,hair covered with a black scarf,smoking a cigarette and thinking back on her life.This simplistic and unadorned hand-drawn animated woman drifts back to a time in her native Iran when life was simple and girls were free.Marji will trace her life from the rising of the Shah of Iran,through the fundamentalist regime to her escape into France in this dark and eye-opening black and white animated look at a child's view of freedom slowing eroding away.This is an emotionally exhausting film and is a tribute to the impressionability of children and then their resilience to \\"wake up\\" as adults when life as they knew it is gone.PERSEPOLIS is a film of incredible sagacity and welcomed intuition and perception.It provides a window into the EAST that strongly reflects back on the WEST. With every parent paying whatever they can to take their girls to see HANNAH MONTANA, I took my two nieces and nephew to see PERSEPOLIS and then out to lunch to listen to their feedback.I was duly impressed with the responses of three children ranging in ages from 9 to 13! Try it,parents.  This film has been nominated for an Oscar.No small wonder.
B00005V9HH|1.0|A film so in love with itself that it spirals consistently out of control to the point that it can't even keep up with itself, the final act - the alleged \\"surprise\\" that you saw coming like a runaway freight train - isn't an epiphany but a sloppy under-the-table hand-job that burned and frayed you for 90+ minutes without a happy ending.  It's a bad con job that mystifyingly has grown a cult following over the years.  My grade:  C+
0553381342|5.0|I do not think an author puts more into his books than Wolfe.  This is a story so much more than about the greedy 80's.  As you are reading you are saying to yourself exactly what Wolfe saids seconds later, as if he is in your mind.  Its about political correctness gone awry.  And its so \\"New York City\\" and you have to live and work there to totally see how Wolfe is so accurate even 20 years later.<br /><br />Sadly now as you read this great novel, you think to the disaster of a movie.  So altered and so miscast.  And reading about the making of the movie, the same fictional pressures of politically correctness in the book hampered the actual movie.  For example Morgan Freeman's a great actor but his character is totally different than the book.  This is a movie that SHOULD BE RE-MADE.<br /><br />In any event The Bonefire of the Vanities is a MUST read.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|Al Pacino is an actor with a career that's a conflict-ridden dichotomy. There are moments in films where he's interplanetary, creating characters of such archetype that you have to wonder if he's born of this planet.<br />Then, he'll throw us Molotov cocktails, in films and, most notably, in his acting, where you scratch your head in amazement that he's had a career to begin with.<br />With this monstrously awful film, Pacino gives one his most unintentionally deliriously funny performances (and remember, I've seen &#34;Revolution&#34;). As Tony Montana, he spits and disgorges his dialogue like Don Corleone doing a Ricky Ricardo impression while swallowing a Cuban cigar. But Pacino is not solo in this pics' derision: there's a bombastic synthesized soundtrack; a misguided, one-dimensional (not-to-mention quasi-talented) supporting cast, most dubiously Michelle Pfeiffer, with her zombified glare and one note delivery; the cinematography was shoddy and dank. Finally, it's another dishrag directorial by Brian DePalma. His catalogue is already littered with junk food masquerading as art, but even I was surprised at the ineptitude of this sprawling, convoluted, cacophonous mess.<br />The films' ascension in the hip-hop community as a classic is equally absurd, seeing that this is a cautionary tale with a violent, tragic ending. Go figure. My grade: D
B00028HBKM|5.0|Nowhere else is the word 'hero' defined better than what our Lord Jesus Christ did for us. He knew no sin and led the perfect life. He dedicated his life to serving God the Father and mankind by God's will. He was and is perfect.<br /><br />But we can never be. Never again, will another walk upon the earth who is sinless, blameless and perfect as Jesus is. Jesus Christ, God's one and only beloved son, given as a sacrifice to redeem mankind and save us from ourselves. God's ultimate love offering given because He loves us so. Jesus came for exactly this, that we may be saved, have a new life more abundant here and eternal life with Him in God's kingdom. Yes, he taught us and lived as the living example of what we all should aspire to be, but also to do what none of us could not do for ourselves. Pay the debt for our sins.<br /><br />Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that gives us the most accurate recreation of the Lord's passion and suffering that has ever been seen. Combining the descriptions in the New Testament's gospels along with the Old Testament's prophecies of the Lord and the historical depictions of Roman punishment and torture devices, we're able to see what the Lord most likely really endured. No question, this film is brutal, but it must be. If not, we only take away the truth in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable. I've seen many a violent film in my time but I found myself cringing more here than any of those. Not because I've never seen worse but because this is what the Savior did for us. It should've been us taking the beatings, the floggings and the crucifixion. That was our punishment placed upon the holy and innocent Son of God.<br /><br />'The Passion' focuses on the last days of Jesus' life here on earth. From the opening, we find him on the Mount of Olives, as the sins of the world are being placed upon him. As the cold, hard reality of the pain and suffering that he is about to endure for a people by large that reject him. But his love and dedication to The Father being so great, he remains committed and fulfills his purpose. He allows himself to be unjustly arrested and convicted of a crime he did not commit. Then handed over to the Romans to be scourged, tortured and ultimately put to death for the love of The Father and every one of us who's sins he bore. As it is written, \\"greater love has no man that he who lay down his life for his friends\\".<br /><br />But all of this would be in vain and just be a sad story had he not risen from the grave. If He were He just a man with some crazy ideas. But He did rise and is Lord and friend to all His people, to all God's children, while extending His invitation to all those who would receive Him. But contrary to popular belief, we are not all God's children. We are all God's creations but not until we are born again by grace through faith, confession and repentance in the Lord Jesus Christ, are we God's children. Jesus said, \\"unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God\\", and \\"I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but by me\\". And so it is. Our sins must be dealt with. And so they were, on the shoulders of the Lord when he died on the cross, shedding his precious blood for us.<br /><br />This movie brought people to question, who's to blame? Is it the Jews fault, or the Romans, or all of us? In a way, all three are true. We are all responsible. He paid the price for our sins, our debt. We all had a hand in it. But it was also the greatest demonstration of love ever shown. The Father's great love and the love of the Lord.<br /><br />Some complain that the film is too focused on the suffering and doesn't show the events leading up to this point, the miracles and the relationships. I understand that but theres only so much time to do it. There is a scene though, in a flashback, where Jesus is building a table and you see a playful sweetness between him and his mother Mary. It's touching and I wanted to see more of that but there are other films that give us more of His life. I recommend 'Jesus of Nazareth' in what I believe is the most compelling and accurate telling. But this film had to stay focused. It too had a mission and purpose. To bring us to face what God the Father and the Jesus Christ did for us. So we could face the reality of it and of ourselves and I believe it succeeds. Many peoples lives were changed with this movie. Many people came to believe and we're saved. Many saved had fallen away and recommitted their lives to the Lord. Others were inspired to reflect and give thanks for the wonderful gift given to us. I know I did. I loved the fact that it got people talking. It got people thinking and discussing. It was on the T.V. and in the papers. People who would never otherwise talk about Jesus were and many who would never go to see such a film did. It was a wonderful time and a credit to the film.<br /><br />The dvd gives us a lovely period looking picture. Lots of browns and muted colors to show the age and make it believable. The print is clean and virtually free of blemish. The audio and score are very good. The dialog is in ancient hebrew with subtitiles which gives it a serious realism and isn't distracting. A very satisfying disc.<br /><br />In closing, 'The Passion' is a wonderful film. It's an undenialble message that will force the viewer to take a stand on what they believe or don't believe. There is no middle ground. And that's a huge accomplishment for a film, to do what it did. Mel Gibson has become a very accomplished director and it all shows here. Many criticize him even to this day for comments he made while intoxicated. People have used it as a chance to bash him and this movie. But as Jesus said, \\"let he who is without sin, cast the first stone\\". We've all said and done things that weren't right and have no right to rake another over the coals for it. He's human after all, just like the rest of us and just as we wish to be forgiven for our own sins, we should forgive him. He made a wonderful film that I suggest anyone and everyone watch with the exception of small children as there is alot of blood and violence that'll no doubt be scary to them. Parents, please use discretion and view it first. Jesus offers his invitation for salvation to everyone from all cultures and beliefs. All are welcome and no one will be turned away.

1897299214|5.0|This is probably one of the more unique books to come out in the past few years, in graphic novel format or otherwise. Delisle, an animator for a French company (though he is originally from Quebec), is assigned for two months to North Korea to work with an educational film studio in the capital, Pyongyang. Delisle's experiences mostly consist of going from his hotel to work and back, accompanied at all times by his guide and translator (except when they lose track of him) and occasionally venturing forth on an officially approved field trip to a museum or other important site.     The things Delisle sees are so bizarre and absurd he is constantly reminded of science fiction movies. His hotel, one of three in the city designated for foreigners, is situated on an island on the outskirts of Pyongyang, is almost completely empty. A great ceremony is made of a visit to the subway, which is \\"lit up like Las Vegas\\" (the rest of the city has sporadic electricity) but only seems to extend for two stops. The downtown is dominated by a giant 100-story triangular building that was designed as a hotel for foreigners during the Seoul Olympics but stands empty and unused. Next to Guy's hotel is an \\"International Cinema Center\\" which is only open once every two years for a festival of propaganda films. Oh and did I mention that every foreigner arriving in the country is required to pay respects to a 20-meter statue of the Dear Leader before going anywhere else? There are more chilling moments as well: the Museum of Imperialist Occupation has paintings of American soldiers pouring motor oil down the throats of children during the Korean war.    Delisle's take on things is a humorous one but the undercurrent of fear and oppression in the country is palpabable on every page. I read Delisle's subsequent book, Shenzhen, (which is also great but lacks the tension) first and felt that his drawings, which resemble quickly sketched comic stripts, left something to be desired. I appreciatedhis style more here, since the book has the feel of a graphic journal; at one point in the book he depicts himself in his hotel room at night sketching out the events of the day. I knew very little about North Korea before reading this and am glad to have had a peek behind the curtain courtesy of Monsieur Delisle!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I absolutely love this adaptation, but I am disappointed that there are missing scenes in the DVD such as Mrs. Allen and Catherine in the tearoom, Catherine's bathtub fantasy, and Miss Tilney and Catherine's conversation to name a few. Though they were short scenes that don't take away from the overall plot, I expected to get the entire movie for what I paid for. I still love the DVD, but I didn't expect to miss parts from the movie.
0887081770|5.0|This book is among my daughter's favorites. She is nearly two years old and has already dog-eared and torn some pages, she literally has enjoyed the book to pieces. This has turned out to be a perfect book for her because she absolutely loves the moon. Seattle winter's don't offer many opportunities for even glimpses of the moon. It's also about a girl and her papa which is something nice for dads to share. Don't expect this book to physically withstand the curious hands of infants. It's not tough like a board book!
B000TLTUL0|4.0|I can just see Tim Burton in conference with Sondheim, saying, \\"Steve, I love your work, I really do, but the general public doesn't want a three hour opera.  Too many notes, Steve.\\"    So Sondheim agreed, maybe thinking he could get his melodies in the heads of more people, to cut an aria here and there, and the number of verses in the ones that were kept. Maybe Burton also persuaded Sondheim that anyone who can sing his music doesn't want to be in a chorus so we may as well leave the choruses out, too.     If you love the complexity and flow of Sweeney Todd, as I do, it will sting a little, but not for long, to realize how much has been cut.  I shouldn't niggle. The horrible, vengeful spirit of the musical was captured beautifully.     Johnny Depp was believable (and sang well) as the barber thirsty for revenge.  Helena Bonham Carter's voice was sweet and on pitch and a minor disappointment--a woman as energetic and forceful as Mrs. Lovett shouldn't have such a feathery sound.  Her acting just about made up for that. The way she played it, Nellie may not have started out all that crazy; she might have been the nerdy girl Benjamin never looked at because he was smitten with Lucy, and Nellie longed for him until nothing else mattered.     Subtext for both the Beggar Woman/Lucy and Johanna was lost when their music was cut. Not so much, however, as to confuse the story. And although their parts were smaller, the Johanna/Anthony romance kept a subtle aspect many don't notice: this is not going to be an easy relationship. In the musical they are bickering before she is even rescued (song cut in movie), and in Burton's version she wonders peevishly how Anthony can think things will work out just because he's rescued her.      Some of the power is lost in doing away with \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" and its reprises, but movies have closeups, which are intense in a way no view from a theater seat can be, so again it just about evens out.     I liked it.  I'll see it again. And it makes me still thirstier for the stage show.
0060899220|5.0|In another of Bourdain's books, The Nasty Bits, he includes an article about books about the kitchen lifestyle that he turns to in the toughest times.  When you've worked a gruelling a double, body exhausted from the day and the night before when you actually had a night off and spent it more than likely overdrinking and drugging, and now you have to deal with the owner and his half realized \\"vision of culinary exquisiteness.\\"  It's these little things that anybody who has ever worked in a restaurant back or front of the house can relate to.  Among these he lists several including Down and Out in London and Paris and Flash in the Pan.  Go ahead and add this masterpiece and the other book I mentioned, Nasty Bits, to this list.  This is what Bourdain truly excels at when writing.  True, he is also good with traditional food criticism, he is interested and therefore writes more interestingly about the overall lifestyle of a restaurant lifer.
B0004Z33G4|4.0|People like my father (who I purchased this for) will absolutely love to have this series.  Mind you, they're quite predictable after you see the first one, but I don't mind seeing a very in-shape Sylvester Stallone going crazy on people.  My dad likes this style of action and pretty much sticks with it.  Besides, he only had them on Beta tapes and I thought it was time to update him.    I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because, well I was brainwashed with it growing up and I \\"think\\" I really enjoy them.
B00000AFFI|5.0|Although her biggest commercial breakthrough is still 1995's dramatic \\"To Bring You My Love\\", and her magnum opus is still 2000's lush, reveltory \\"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\\", the somber, electronics heavy \\"Is This Desire?\\" marks a major high point for Polly Jean Harvey. With a couple songs excluded, this is probably her quietest album, with heavy usage of atmospheric synths and muted, whispered vocals from Harvey. The journey begins with \\"Angelene\\", the albums's first and perhaps finest track. It's a despondant, folky song, with Harvey cooing downbeat lyrics like \\"Dear God, life ain't kind/people gettin' born and dying\\" while a gently strummed guitar and organ ring behind her. \\"The Sky Lit Up\\" comes next, a rousing, 2-minute burst of feedback and and swelling synths. The album's biggest achievement as far as production goes comes in the form of \\"The Wind\\". It's a monstrously creepy song, with a bluesy guitar riff, numerous ghostly wails and shrieks, and Harvey simultaniously whispering and singing the lyrics. \\"My Beautiful Leah\\" is another one of the shorter songs, with a slow, death-march like programmed beat and fuzzy, foghorn-like synths. The obsessive, almost Middle Eastern-sounding tale of lost love \\"A Perfect Day Elise\\" and the gloomy, bass-heavy \\"Catherine\\" come next, followed by the minimal, lo-fi \\"Electric Light\\". \\"The Garden\\" is one of the album's more accessible moments, with a pretty piano line and an almost funky backbeat. Ironically, it's followed by the least accessible song on the album, the racous, industrial-tinged \\"Joy\\". \\"The River\\" follows, a langorous, piano-heavy ballad featuring a feedback-drenched guitar and an eerie, New Orleans-style trumpet. The manic \\"No Girl So Sweet\\" follows, with Harvey's vocals at their most raw and an almost club-like feel. The album finishes on a dark, yet hopeful note with \\"Is This Desire?\\", which tells the strange tale of two inseperable lovers over a ringing guitar line, eerie lo-fi synths, anda heavy snare drum beat. Although newcomers should start with \\"To Bring You My Love\\" or \\"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\\", \\"Is This Desire?\\" is essential for any dedicated Polly fan. An added bonus, it's her personal favorite out of any of her own albums!
B00005JPAO|5.0|I am shocked by the length of these reviews, but they attest to how good the film is.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is, as everyone has said, an excellent film...TV or Big Screen, but...it is not closed captioned as the box and info here says.  I'm not deaf, but I'm hard of hearing, and always prefer CC on my movies, and since this said it was, I bought it, but nowhere could I find how to access it.  Is the button hidden somewhere like an Easter Egg or something?  I tried everything.  It's just false information.
055358894X|5.0|I picked this up on a whim after seeing it in my Amazon recommendations.  I am absolutely relieved that I did! It's a keeper. I am not going to reiterate the plot line as that has been done very well in previous reviews.    What makes this story really work for me is that the main characters are completely human. They are warm and humorous, mean and faulty.  I am so sick and tired of the deus ex machina resolutions to plot lines and you won't find them here. The characters are extremely well drawn through interesting flashbacks and they triumph and most importantly, they also fail.  Spectacularly, I might add. This is no fairy tale ending novel!    This book is also truly enjoyable for me because when things get down and dirty everyone actually bleeds. Usually by no quick, clean method. Incredible detail, but not drawn out. Lynch actually puts thought into the battles and the characters get hurt, badly, instead of taking out their opponents with a slice or two with little hurt to themselves, and you see every moment of it. This makes it much more realistic and exciting than the usual superhero fare. There is a consequence to everything and some people pay with their lives.    To me this was not a story about a mind-bending, perfectly put together and executed con as I thought it would be when I read the synopsis, but what happens when that perfect con falls completely and utterly to pieces!    Excellent first and I am off to buy the second immediately.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|Hollywood is desperate these days to create a decent horror script so they have begun to borrow ones from the Japanese. The problem is that lots of stuff like style, suspense and the horror angle seem to have gotten lost in translation.  No doubt this is a well acted film but ultimately the suspense falls flat and the end is a let down.  The box looks good.....but inside is just empty plastic.
B000WTZ784|5.0|Why inspiring? because this is a band that never quits. First they lost what many believed to be the core of Genesis and that was Peter Gabriel, they replace him with Phil Collins and although the music changed they continue to make great music. 2 albums later Steve Hackett leaves and then later Phil retires from the band but Tony and Mike decide they enjoy making writing together so they audition Ray Wilson and give him the job.  Of course Ray can't replace Phil anymore than Phil could Peter so one has to step \\"outside\\" of the Genesis box and listen to it as a total different entity. If one can do this it's easy to enjoy the cd for what it is, an excellent pop/prog album.    I had the privelege to see Genesis perform with Peter for the Selling England by the Pound tour so I have been with them from early in their career. I find it sad people can't accept change, I have always enjoyed Genesis whether they're playing Fading Lights or The Royal Hogweed.    I've enjoyed CAS since I first purchased it and now to have it in 5.1 surround sound is even more enjoyable to listen to.  The DVD interview gives us an insight into their thought process following Phil's departure and the recording of CAS with Ray. They both commented they knew he was the guy from the moment he started audtioning No Son of Mine.  I think Ray has a great voice and it fits in well with Genesis songs,  in fact there are times he hits tones which are very reminiscent of Peter(the Dividing Line) however there are very few times he sounds like Phil.    There are 3 songs on the DVD which are live, 1 is the song Calling All Stations and then there are two from Polish TV which are from a longer concert they did.  It's a wonderful treat to see them perform live with Ray as their singer and Nik Zidyahu on drums. Nik's drumming is awesome and adds freshness to the music so does the guitarist who performs with them, at times he and Mike play against one another which is fun and great to listen to.  I think thePolish concert video is worth the price of the cd itself, why they didn't give us the rest of the songs is beyond me, it's a fantastic concert and shows Genesis playing with in my opinion new and fresh energy.    If you've always loved Genesis but passed on this because Phil isn't on it, try to get past it and think of this as a new group with a similarity to Genesis. Just enjoy the music and forget about who's on it.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|\\"Fracture\\" is a film that literally remits us to \\"Sleuth\\", an intelligent, astute and provocative challenge to justice and investigators.<br /><br />A mature husband (Anthony Hopkins) has realized his wife<br /> has cheated him with a law agent, and prepares a meticulous plan in order to murder her and at the same time to evade the justice. On the other hand, we have a young attorney who accepts the risks this weird case involves.<br /><br />As you see we have a very smart and amusing film that plays with those visual details that usually are overlooked.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.
B000P12LWY|4.0|Anyone with a passing knowledge of the Tudor Dynasty will find glaring examples of historical inaccuracies in this depiction of Henry Tudor's life. Two examples include the death of Cardinal Wolsey and the depiction of Margaret Tudor.  However, these deviations from history don't detract from what is really great entertainment.  This series features some fantastic acting, especially on the part of Jonathan Rhys Meyers in the role of a youthful, athletic Henry VIII.  Sam Neill also stands out as the power-hungry Cardinal Wolsey and the understated performance of Maria Doyle Kennedy as the strong-willed Catherine of Aragon has to be mentioned.  The series sucks you right in from the beginning and doesn't let go.  I mean, you know Catherine of Aragon is set aside so Henry can marry Anne Boleyn, but just watching all that play out is exciting -- exact history or not.  This is a great series full of fine acting and a lot of entertainment.  You definitely get your money's worth.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|Many people have voted this movie down because they simply didn't get it. The entire point of the film was to be as ridiculously over the top as possible, and it's acknowledged throughout the film in a variety of ways (one-liners, ridiculous scenarios, signs, etc).<br /><br />This is by far one of my favorite films of all time. It's absolutely hilarious and over the top from start to finish (like it's supposed to be). When watching this film, view it with an open mind and try to get a sense of humor if you want to enjoy it.
B000XA5K48|1.0|I tried playing this on all three of my DVD players at home.  On all three, all I could get to play was a \\"New Line\\" animation.      Perhaps others will not experience the same problem I did--but I am using new technology players--and after doing a little reading, I realized this disc contains some sort of all-new copy protection that makes it unplayable on a large number of players.  What a PITA.  Had to return the thing--and still haven't seen this movie.    Ridiculous.  I really don't think customers should support things like this.
0061142026|3.0|I have never been big on reading love stories, but how can you pass up an opportunity to read a love story deemed as one in a life time?<br /><br />Well, now that I read Stardust, I sort of feel like I could have waited a life time to read it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Stardust offers some wonderful descriptions and imagery of the very enticing journey through Faerie; but, the reason I picked up the book was not to journey through Faerie, but to journey through the growing love of Tristran and Yvaine.<br /><br />They spend so much time away from each other that when they finally confess their love, it seems awkward and hardly believable even in a world with fairies, witches, and hairy little men!  No offense, but who starts talking about having children even before you have your first kiss? Creepy....Even when they are together Yvaine is either sleeping, or Tristran is finding food.  The only dialogue we get between them is when they were stuck in a cloud.  It was rather unforuntate.<br /><br />I feel as if the book spent the whole time discussing everyone else in Faerie, but Tristran and Yvaine.<br />There were a lot of characters and fascinating ones too, but they were never fully written to develop their on page character.  Gaiman should have completely left out the lilim and focused his attention on Primus and Septimus.  Knowing Spetimus' character he would have cut out Yvaine's heart if he knew she was a star, so either way, she was definitely in danger.<br /><br />However, the ones Gaiman did focus on had some strange character shifts too (of course, in my opinion).  For example, Lady Una was intoxicating at the beginning of the book.  She portrayed the fairytale temptress, but pure at the same time, if that makes any sense.  By the end of the book, she was just plain annoying.  It didn't seem like the same \\"Una.\\"<br /><br />Even Mr. Tristan Thorn was disappointing.  Throughout the book, I can't recount how many times he mentioned how he looked forward to returning to Wall to become a farm boy, but when he finally learns who he is, which he even claims is \\"liberating\\" and \\"exhilarating\\" he doesn't want to honor his \\"responsibilities.\\"  Strange.<br /><br />I saw the movie too, and I'm not one to say movies are ever better than their \\"makers,\\" but I believe that the movie STARDUST exceeds the book.

B0000011P7|5.0|This was Ian Anderson's first official solo album (Anderson did record a solo album a few years before this, but it was officially released as a Tull album at the insistence of Chrysalis Records.  The record was Jethro Tull's A), and it was enormously controversial amongst Tull fans (and still is).  It is not acoustic at all (which is what people were expecting), but a completely electronic album.  It's really a colloboration between Peter-John Vettesse, the keyboardist in Tull at the time, and Ian Anderson.  Vettesse co-wrote 5 of the songs, and him and Ian are the only 2 musicians on the album.  I have to confess that I really like this album.  It's better than Tull's Under Wraps (another album where Vettesse co-wrote most of the material).  The songs are very memorable, with special mention going to Fly by Night, a brooding, intense track that is still memorable today.  Toad in the Hole and Trains are excellent as well.  The sound of the album hasn't dated at all.  It doesn't come across as a cheesy, synthesizer album of the 1980's (it was recorded in 1983).  It still sounds fresh and vital today.  The arguments over whether it's a good release will probably go on for a while.  I think it's a great album, a worthy chapter in the Tull/Ian Anderson saga.
B000H2MTUA|4.0|This is a unique memoir that harkens back to the privations and hardships previously described in the novels of Charles Dickens. The author Frank McCourt began his reflections while preparing to return his mother's cremains to her native Ireland for burial. Hence, the title \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" The loss of his mother resulted in this award winning book.     Although McCourt was a native of New York, during the early years of the Great Depression his Irish immigrant parents made the fateful decision to leave the United States in the mistaken belief that their prospects would be better if they returned to Ireland. As McCourt wrote, they should never have left America. The grinding poverty that they experienced upon their return to Limerick proved to be far worse than the hard times that the impoverished family had known in New York. Ireland lacked the ability to provide any of the relief measures available to America's poor. Relations between the Irish Free State and Great Britain were bad throughout the period of McCourt's childhood and the economic sanctions imposed by the British on Irish exports made bad matters worse.       The entire family had to live in a tiny council home, which was little more than a hovel, opposite the communal lavatory which served the residents of an entire street. Every occupant of the block had to empty their slop buckets into the same filthy commode. Whenever the plumbing failed or heavy rains flooded their residence, the filthy sewage would back up into the McCourt's living quarters.     McCourt's alcoholic father was originally from Ulster. His in laws never fully accepted him nor did they stop criticizing his wife for having married a Northerner. He struggled to support his family, but he was an unreliable drunkard in a time when the most reliable men were hard pressed to remain employed. The family frequently tried to subsist on the minimal dole available from the Dublin government and forced to beg for charity from the St. Vincent DePaul Society. In order to obtain this meager assistance, applicants were subjected to humiliating inquiries.   The McCourts were oftentimes without the basic necessities of life and constantly poorly fed and clothed. Eventually, McCourt's father deserted his wife and children. Then things got appreciably worse. Frank McCourt counted himself lucky if he had a meal of potatoes. His mother's sole luxury was borrowing or finding a penny with which to buy a Woodbine cigarette.      There is much to recommend in this autobiography, but it is not easy to read. McCourt does not follow conventional rules of punctuation. He never uses quotation marks, so it is confusing for the reader to understand what words were spoken and what words represent internal thoughts. There is a good deal of repressed anger in the book. Under the political leadership of Eamon De Valera, the role of the Catholic Church was emphasized in Ireland's political and cultural institutions. McCourt was naturally embittered by his impoverished childhood and his residual resentment for the Church is obvious.     Ultimately, this book is a testament to the survival of the human spirit. McCourt is able to escape from Limerick and return to New York and begin a new life. There is some humor to be found amongst the buckets of salty tears, vomit, feces and spilt pints of Guinness, but this book is devoid of the Irish travel brochure romance that is so familiar to Irish-Americans. McCourt and his family (his brother is character actor Malachy McCourt) are to be admired and respected for their indominatable spirits. Lesser persons would have been broken and destroyed by such trials.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I originally saw this film on a field trip with all the kids from the neighboring schools.  Needless to say, it was not a particularly good screening.  The children (excluding me, of course) behaved rather poorly, making comments throughout the film, ranging from immaturity to childishness (like much modern comedy).  So, despite this, I was certainly intrigued by the film, so I went back 2 weeks later to see it again.  An older woman smiled at me at the 2nd screening because she seemed surprised that such a young person would see a film like this voluntarily.  I am really glad I went back.<br /><br />This film is still very good today.  It has a definite David Lean feel to it (Lean was interested in the project as well before it fell to Richard Attenborough).  It begins rather audaciously, with the asassination of Gandhi, then tells his story completely in flashback.  It has beautiful cinematography and magnificent performances.  Ben Kingsley, who was a complete unknown when he took this part, gives one of the greatest performances in his long career, and one of the best in film history.  He embodies Gandhi so well you start to think you're actually watching the man himself.  Martin Sheen, John Gielglud, and Ian Charleson lend excellent support to Kingsley, making this a rich and very satisfying film.  I think this may have been the first epic film I ever saw.  I don't know for sure, but if it was, it started me on a long path to loving epic films.  This film is still as good as I remember it.
1591396190|2.0|To quickly tell the quality of this book, note that the authors immediately discredit themselves by including two key words in their subtitle: \\"uncontested\\" and \\"irrelevant\\".  Social science research does not produce findings that justify such claims, so the authors are obviously extrapolating beyond any research they conducted and try to dupe non-academic popular book readers into thinking their research is solid.  While you might think that the publisher created such subtitle against the authors will, you will actually find that the authors are deeply committed to their \\"blue ocean\\" ideology by using these words throughout the book.    The authors' assertion that blue ocean strategy (strategy that creates previously non-existent products or services that the customers actually want) delivers higher profits is simply not true.  First of all, the authors are only studying successful businesses employing blue ocean strategy. For all we know, other businesses that used blue ocean strategy that the authors did not study failed, proving that blue ocean strategy had nothing to do with success of those businesses that the authors did study. Second of all, the authors miss the concept of \\"expected value\\". Competing in the red oceans (existing products that are commonplace) allows big companies to compute probability of success relatively easily, partly because the products' success and demand is already clearly observable in the marketplace. Therefore, contrary to the authors' claim, the red oceans have a big purpose that big companies should not ignore. Second of all, the authors claim that blue ocean products deliver higher profits is not substantiated. In many cases, new revolutionary products come with a higher cost of marketing, because the consumers may be confused by not being able to compare the new product against their existing choice set. However, the authors do not address this higher cost of \\"blue ocean strategies\\". Additionally, because blue ocean products are newer than existing \\"red ocean products\\", they probably have a higher rate of failure. Thus, while the maximum return from a \\"blue ocean strategy\\" might theoretically be higher vs. \\"red ocean strategy\\", on average, given higher failure rate and higher marketing costs, the EXPECTED VALUE to the organization from either blue or red ocean strategy might actually be the same.    If you want an unbiased, evidence-based overview of marketing strategy, you should buy Dr.Chernev's Strategic Marketing Analysis instead of this book.
B000X5KSWM|5.0|It's rare to find an artist that isn't afraid to be progressive. 98% of music today is processed pablum. Being a Nightwish fan I eagerly awaited both Dark Passion Play and Tarja's CD. I was majorly dissapointed with Dark Passion Play but not with this CD. Tarja was able to bring the emotion and mystery of the old Nightwish songs to life and she does the same here. She creates the imagery of mystic goddess no matter what she sings. I would not recommend this to someone who isn't willing to open their minds and ears to a different sound. It is unique. If this is about her experience with Nightwish - so be it - she carried the band to some great things and she is entitled to express is just as the band is entitled to express their feelings with Dark Passion Play. Great artists conjur great emotion, that's what makes the music enter your soul. Nightwish no longer touches my soul. Tarja's does. If you thinks she's lost the gothic goddess don't be fooled and check out Die Alive on YouTube. I recommend this for those who like progressive music. Buy the CD, put it on, sit back close your eyes and let the goddess take you on a journey.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|This has got to be one of the most powerful stories of forgiveness that I have ever seen. Richard Farnsworth was an amazing actor, and it is sad that the Academy pretty much never acknowledged his existance. Here, he becomes his character through and through.    This is the true story of Alvin Straight, who finds out that his brother isn't doing so well. The thing is, Alvin and his brother had a falling out years ago, and they haven't spoken since. So, being an old man who shouldn't exactly be behind the wheel of a car, he drives miles and miles to his brother's home on a riding lawnmower. Along the way, he meets many people from different walks of life.     This is a slow and meditative film, but it is one of the best that I have ever seen, and one of David Lynch's best. The man can do anything! I'd love to see Lynch do more drama.     All in all, this is a work of art, and a testament to Richard Farnsworth's tremendous acting abilities. He will be missed.
1932907009|5.0|Anytime someone can write a book and present ideas in a fresh way, then that book is helpful and worth a look.  This book is a fast read and entertaining.  There's a few ideas in here that I haven't seen expressed in the same way before.  The entire concept of saving the cat is not a very new one, but Synder makes a better point out of the concept here.  Your hero  needs to do something that tells us something about him, okay, got it.  Here, Synder gives that theory a name, the Save the Cat scene.  His theories are clearly and insightfully expressed and he has a direct friendly way of talking to the reader with a bit of comedy.  This all adds up to a quick and fun read.<br />Another thing to keep in mind is that some people are totally against any type of formula writing.  If you're one of those writers stay away from this book.  Remember that the formula is not to help structure the story itself, rather it's to structure the pacing.  Believe it or not movies have a very tried and true structure and if you want to break out of that mold you better just start ramming your head into a brick wall because you have a better chance of busting through that wall than the Hollywood wall with your spec.  I once asked a professor about a poem we were studying, how much of the poem was by chance and how much was by design.  He frowned and said \\"nothing, it's all his design.\\"<br />And another thing, remember that your goal as a spec screenplay writer is to get something sold!  That's it!  Why the hell are you worried about it getting made and people ruining your beautiful work of art?  You can do whatever you want to do with my 120 pages AFTER I get my check for half a mil!  Can any of you out there really say that M. Night is a good writer?  Hell no!  But for the millions of people that didn't see the end coming in the Sixth Sense (a movie that had about 6 plot lines, one of which didn't start until act 3!) those are the ones going to see his next opus of crap and that's why his stuff sales.  What about Akiva Goldsman?  Look up that one on IMDB and you'll be scratching your head.  How can anyone survive after Batman and Robin (it's because of what came before BTW)??!!

B000ZK4466|2.0|\\"What were they thinking?\\" is the question that continually comes to my mind while listening to this album.  At first listen, the album really didn't do much for me, but like most of my favorite albums, I decided to listen more before starting to form opinion.  Quite a few listens later, I'm pretty disappointed in this album.<br /><br />I think Omar needs to stop trying to be a producer.  Bring back Rick Rubin or something.  These guys need some outside ears.  What did they do to Cedric's voice?  I'm all for the crazy effects they've always used, but it sounds like they stuck a ring modulator and a chipmunk pitch shifter on his voice and simply left them on for most of the record.  Even the mix is suspect...  there are some odd inconsistent volume ramps and the vocal really kills the rest of the mix at random times throughout the album.<br /><br />There are moments where the vocal takes really fail on pitch, and I noticed a few parts where there were some relatively major drum mistakes.  Was this album rushed, perhaps?  Seems like there were some performances that needed fixing.<br /><br />Granted, there are some cool moments.  Cool riffs and excellent lyrics are to be found throughout the album.  No complaints at all about the new drummer (good stuff!).  The concept behind the album is great, too.<br /><br />While the song-through structure of the songs is appreciated, there is too much repetition inside the songs, and an awful lot of the album sounds too much the same.  There's not nearly as much variety in the songs as on previous albums.<br /><br />That said, the album is still more original than most stuff on TV/radio, so it's far from a 1-star.  But beyond the originality, I wouldn't give it much.<br /><br />If you're a hardcore TMV fan, I think this album will most likely rate as passable for you, so by all means, pick it up.  If you're someone who recognized that De-Loused in the Comatorium was one of the greatest and most innovative rock masterpieces ever made, and you are hoping for another work of that caliber to get your ears and mind addicted to, this album just isn't it.<br /><br />Not even close.ade, and you are hoping for another work of that caliber to get your ears and mind addicted to, this album just isn't it.<br /><br />Not even close.

It's popularity, however, got it into my library system.  Ugh, again!    I can tell that this book has an audience but, the audience that is impressed by this story of selfishness and \\"spiritual growth\\" is rather difficult for me to understand.  Spiritual growth in order to have a sexual interlude that lasts for several nights?  Did we need to know all that?     I couldn't shake this book out of my hand fast enough.  Hate to even take it back to the library where some other unsuspecting reader is required to read it for their bookclub.

B00004RF8J|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since I was a little girl. I was one of the Do Whop girls in my high school play. This movie is fun and hip, from Audrey to silly Seymour, to the sassy do wop girls, to the crazy dentist that rides a motorcyle. Steve Martin is a creative genius anyway.  I love him as an actor.  The songs are contagious, you can't help but sing along. I showed this movie to my kids and they loved it.  You have to own this movie.

B00005JPXY|4.0|I was very skeptical about Cloverfield. I'm extremely critical of anything new that comes out of Hollywood, especially when it's a story of destruction taking place in New York (Plenty of originality there, eh) I even walked out of 'I am Legend' and got a refund because I've had enough of paying for movies that are worse than popular TV, but I'm glad to say that Cloverfield delivered on its hype. There was a time when movies used to do this often, partly because no CG meant more effort on the script and story, partly because I was about 8 years old, but either way, blockbusters do tend to disappoint. When Cloverfield began I was thinking 'Oh no, this is obviously scripted which takes away from the realism, the editing is far too  precise for it to be be just a guy with a camera and it looks like it's shot on film rather than video' which also bothered me, but none of that matters. There are still things that niggle at me in places, but overall the film eases you in well and when everything kicks off, it's one of the most exciting rides I've experienced in the cinema. I can imagine Cloverfield theme park rides opening up in Universal studios much like the amazing Alien Wars experiences that are apparently still scattered around. There's plenty of imagination and it stuck to the widely known but frequently avoided rule that what you don't see is more interesting than what you do see. See it in the cinema, it's a thrill ride, however the film suffers from a tacked on final few minutes which feels like an alternative/extra ending, and it brings the believability of the film down completely, and left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth because it was just so pointless. But aside from that, very well planned and directed and I recommend it. And I hated the camera shaking in the Bourne Films because it's just as easy to hold the camera still. In this however it didn't bother me in the slightest. Added to the claustrophobia of the film. Not a great masterpiece (Althoughthere are masterful moments) but it is what it says it is and that's very rare nowadays, so check it out.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I saw one of the 3 shows in Chicago, and as people have said, it's a very good representation of the show.  Yes, there are some key changes, but they really don't affect the feeling of the songs much at all.  Yes, there are some shortened and 'medley-ed' versions of some things, but the band has been doing this ever since Seconds Out.  Compared to 3 Sides Live, this tour and recording is gigantically superior.  You're never going to hear a lamer version of 'Turn It On', for instance, than on that record.  I feel they've really finally corrected some blatant injustices to a number of their great songs that they had committed numerous times from the 80's on through in live performances.  I got the feeling, listening to the CD, that they finally 'got it'- that they need to represent in some way what was great about the original song, even if it is done in a slightly different way, instead of a caricature of it.  There is a power, energy, and beauty in a lot of the performances that in the past has been lacking.
B00005LMBK|4.0|While I think that Gorillaz' second album, Demon Days, is their best, I also enjoy their self-titled debut. It's definitely a different beast Demon Days, a dense, dark, swirling concoction. The production here is much looser and stripped down. And it reaches higher heights than its successor, including my two favorite Gorillaz songs: the trip-hop experiment \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and the funky, screwed-up \\"Rock the House\\", both featuring Del the Funkee Homo Sapien's memorable raps.<br />The interesting thing about this album is that it's like a pop album made by someone who's just the slightest bit insane. Not in the totally lost, Syd Barrett sense, but you know, just a bit out there. See, the tunes are hummable, but there's an aura of weird about each of them. Some, such as \\"Rock the House\\" and \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\", have weird instrumentation. Others, like \\"Re-Hash\\", \\"5/4\\" (with a refrain of \\"SHE TURNED MY DAD ON!\\" that you might find yourself singing under your breath without noticing it... until the people start staring, of course), and \\"19/2000\\", have odd lyrics. While \\"Rock the House\\", \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\", \\"Re-Hash\\" and \\"5/4\\" are definitely highlights, I'm not a huge fan of the \\"album\\" take on \\"19/2000\\". I love the frenzied Soulchild remix, though. If you ask me, that should've been the album mix. The \\"album\\" take is all right, but doesn't convey the party atmosphere as well as the up-tempo take does.<br />There are other good songs, too: the trip-hoppin' \\"New Genious (Brother)\\" (sic), the house-influenced \\"Sound Check (Gravity)\\", and the bass solo \\"Double Bass\\", as well as the eerie regional bonus track \\"Dracula\\" (with bizarre lyrics like \\"Santa Claus told a lie\\") and the off-kilter \\"Left Hand Suzuki Method\\". But after \\"19/2000\\", the album turns crap and stays there for the last four tracks. For a first, \\"Latin Simone (Que Pasa Cognito)\\" sucks. Gorillaz try to reinvent themselves as a mariachi band there. Needless to say, it doesn't work out, and it might be the worst song they ever made. \\"Starshine\\" and \\"Slow Country\\" are awful as well, and the experimental metal \\"M1 A1\\" needs to go too. I'm also not big on the \\"weird-for-weird's-sake\\" \\"Man Research (Clapper)\\", and I don't care if \\"Punk\\" is only a minute and a half long, it sucks.<br />This is an interesting album, even if Gorillaz would do better on Demon Days. It's very creative, and like I said in my Demon Days review, I love how much effort Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett (the masterminds behind the project - Damon plays most the instruments, and Jamie designed the four \\"band members\\") put into fleshing out the four virtual members of Gorillaz, vocalist 2D, guitarist Noodle, bassist Murdoc, and drummer Russell.

Before, the guitars had no edge to them but instead sounded like someone just turned up the gain too high on their guitar and wanted to piss people off, on this album though the guitar sounds great and I see the talent.    There are great melodies here, and the album is primarily driven by a combination of riffs and beats that far exceed any Garbage record, and the Bowie influence is clear here.  I was completely surprised to hear \\"The Speed of Pain\\" start with an acoustic guitar, shattering any preconceptions I had of Manson before.  I was told this is the best place to start and now I completely agree, rather than just trying to offend people there is actual substance here, which is always a plus.  There's no denying there is great music here, at times I forget completely that I'm listening to Marily Manson, whatever that image is anyway.    While some tracks are obviously not as good others, particularly the overlong industrial \\"The Last Day On Earth\\", anthemic choruses througout rock hard.  This album comes recommended from a new convert, and if you listen to it I'm almost sure you'll be converted too.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I believe Jim Cameron's ALIENS to be the best sci-fi film since the original ALIEN and the result of a well thought out script and a demanding eye by a director who knew precisely what he wanted and seldom settled for anything less.<br /><br />ALIEN and ALIENS can be watched serially with perhaps a short break for die hard fans to refresh themselves and get ready for the next show. Although there is much memorable about subsequent ALIEN films, this one is probably the best overall.<br /><br />It had a great action story, good cast, costumes, creative mechanical props, creature effects, artistically designed sets and a sweeping musical score. I can't think of more positive things to say or any particular I might comment against. I also enjoyed the longer editors cut and the additional footage and wouldn't have minded the extra time in the theater had they included it.<br /><br />I agree with the director that the film should have included the additional 30 minutes or so of footage. Among other things it would have explained Ripley's counterproductive behavior during her legal hearing after learning of her daughter's death, and her instant taking to and wonderful mothering of Newt under fire (besides the fact that she was a woman outfitted with those maternal instincts). During all of her action shots she always considered and treated Newt like a daughter, telling her to shield her eyes during welding work, to go forward in the military vehicle when horrible images were coming in, and promising never to leave her unprotected. In addition, the extra footage of the depletion of ammunition and overheating of the robot sentry gunners in the tunnels should not have been edited from the theater version as this only underlined how desperate their situation was, and worked for me.<br /><br />The Alien Queen deserves a \\"well done\\" for being original, very frightening and a plausible mother for the original film creature. Gigor's Alien design still stands for me as the most frightening vision in sci-fi movie history containing elements of everything we find threatening. It was indeed a very hard act to follow.<br /><br />The voice of the Terraforming  facility computer that counted down the time remaining until the impending nuclear explosion appeared to be based on MOTHER from the original film.

B000YA9R3C|5.0|When I sat in the theatre before the movie began I had no idea what to expect. Though there have been movies about oil in the past, they usually end up being political thrillers of the espionage variety, which I do not care for. To be honest, I have no interest in oil outside of filling my tank at the gas pump. My real anticipation was to see what Paul Thomas Anderson could do with such a rich vehicle as Daniel Day Lewis, an actor far beyond the talent of any that P T anderson has worked with in his career. P T Anderson has a remarkable gift for placing his actors into spectacular cinematic situations and bringing viscerally striking performances out of them. In the same way that Malcolm McDowell will allways be Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange, so to that despite anything Mark Wahlberg may do in his career, he will always be Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights. Also, it is no small wonder that Burt Reynolds gave his most memorable performance since he played Luis in John Boorman's Deliverance a quarter of a century befor Boogie Nights, and that Tom Cruise gave perhapes the best performance of his career in Magnolia. To point to all this is to show that this heightened acting performance is due entirely to P T Anderson's eye for situations, visuals, detail, and dialog.    Since I have no desire to be around an oil well or to be pasted with the goop in some unforgiving desolate landscape,I unknowingly put myself into the perfect mindset for an Earth shattering experience. My lack of thought on the subject of oil had turned me into a completely open and receptive vessel. This was perfect because of what this film is. This film is an experience, it is a powerful beast that grabs you by your shirt collar and pulls you by force taking you along for the ride. Now , there are going to be people who will not get the point of this film. They will not understand why it is that they are watching a huge epic about a monstously unlikable anti-hero. They will be unable to grasp the lack of conventional plot devices, and thus have their expectations for what they have come to feel all films should be like, dashed. There Will Be Blood, makes demands on their attention span, and forces them to participate by thinking and feeling, rather then doing the usual method of explaining everything to them like they don't have brains. There Will Be Blood is a singular unflinching cautionary tale of how the unrelenting greed that founded industrial capitalism in America can turn the most predatorily ambitious person into a tycoon, and yet leave their lives devoid of all meaning. It shows the dangers of having the exploitations of Earths natural resources as a person's only goal, rather then a desire for humanity. It is truly a gutsy move on P T Anderson's part because the films ability to work hinges entirely on the magnetism of his leading character Daniel Plainview. Luckily for P T Anderson, he had Daniel Day Lewis's lofty shoulders to rest the overall success of this visionary work upon. In There Will Be Blood, both Anderson's craft and Daniel Day Lewis's powerful acting meet together at the high water mark, making this P T Anderson's greatest movie, and the finest performance of Daniel Day Lewis's career. Furthermore, There Will Be Blood is quite possibly the best film of this decade, and Daniel Day Lewis's explosive tour de force performance is the best acting job I have seen since David Thewlis erupted on screen as the corrosive Johnny in Mike Leigh's 1993 shocker Naked.    An example of P T Anderson's brillant directing is exemplified by the scene in which the oil rig catches on fire. This amazing sequence is for-shadowed by both the visual depiction of the awesome power of what a geyser can do to wooden planks and nails in an earlier eruption, and by the implications involved in Daniel Plainview's snubbing of the community preacher Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. That scene was a public snubbing in front of the entire community, for Plainview blessed the oil well himself, and threw salt in Eli Sunday's wounds by using the very introduction words that Eli Sunday came up with for himself, to instead introduce Eli Sunday's ten year old sister whom Plainview named the well after. The scene in which the oil rig bursts into flames starts off with a dreadful visual of Plainview's ten year old adopted son H W, played by Dillion Freasier, lazily laying on his stomach on the shabby built wooden scaffolding directly over the drilling hole, some 20 feet above the ground. Beneath him a man lanquidly works the elbow of the drilling piston in and out of the hellish hole in the ground. The idea of what would happen if a geyser were to blow right then causes the audience members to tighten their grips on their arm rests. But what really makes this moment so potent is in what is only implied. We can't help but imagine what it would be like to be an inhabitant of this tiny town as a horrible belching tower of fire and sooty sulfuric black smoke pours out in unstoppable fury with no end in sight. The only town member we see in this whole sequence is the shocked face of Eli Sunday, the obvious implication being that his holy blessing could of prevented all this from ever happening in the first place. Without the towns folk even being present in this series of scenes we feel their presence completely, and know that their lives and futures hang in the balance. P T Anderson does something here that few directors have the guts to do anymore, he lets us fill in the blanks ourselves, we get to use our own minds and be participants in the very fabric of the film.    Where the first reel of this amazing film was unlike anything I have ever seen before in my life, the last reel is like something unearthed from the very tomb of Stanley Kubrick. It was like all the past drilling in the film had somehow returned the viewer back to the heyday of American cinema in the mid 70's, to a time in which literally, Marathon Man, Taxi Driver, All The Presidents Men, and Network were released into theatre's on the same day. The way that the interior of Plainviews mansion was shot gives it the same ominous presence as the Overlook Hotel from The Shining. It is in the final act that Daniel Day Lewis takes what is already the acting performance of the year and stretches it into truly epically legendary proportions. After a lifetime of being a predatory capitalist with a slothful lust for red meat, cigarettes, and hard drink, Daniel Plainview has turned into something more lycantrhope then man. His once measured snake oil salesman voice is now a surely growl, that is as gravely and abrassive as his scruffy chin stubble. Everytime he inhales and exhales he sounds like a growling beast. It is in the final act that he unleashes a lifetime of twisted resentment upon the two pour souls who had the misfortune of being closest to him in life. The first is H W who's deafness he insults while he chain smokes cigarettes, H W walks out of Plainview's life as Plainview screams at him over and over \\" You're a bastard from a basket!\\" Then in the final barbaric scene of pure psychoticness, Daniel Plainview wakes up next to last nights meal of steak and wisky on one of the bowling lanes in his game room using the gutter as a makeshift pillow. Eli Sunday comes over to ask for money and is forced to shout out that he is a false profit and that God is a superstition. Worse still Plainview then rubs his nose in the fact that the land Eli wanted to sale him has been bled dry by surrounding oil wells. Plainview goes so far as to call Eli an afterbirth that should never have existed. The whole time that Plainview is saying all of these things he is gnawing on last nights steak. During the decline of Plainview's humanity his body even starts to take on the phisical characteristics of his twisted soul. His very gait is bent forward at the waist, and his eyes glair suspiciously, one is a slit the other a glint. I will not give away any more of the ending except to say that it has to be seen to be believed.     I can only conclude by saying that this film is timeless, and will last forever as a masterwork of American cinema. For those of you that don't like to be challenged, all I can tell you is that you either need to work on developing the propensity to appreciate a visceral visionary masterpiece, or stick to getting your movie media from the fast food drive through window, served to you like a happy meal with curly fries.    Lastly as a funny side note, I bought my ticket to my first showing of There Will Be Blood, by taking six months worth of saved pennies to the supermarket change counter. If only all films were this awesome, I would of started a swear jar long ago.

B000ZK4466|4.0|Personally, I've been moderately obsessed with the Mars Volta since I first heard their masterpiece, Deloused in the Comatorium. But I understand there are those out there who just couldn't go along with the band's tone and method as they moved into less-restrained, dizzying ruckus of Frances the Mute. And for many who made it past the drifting, mind-warping narrative of Frances, the raw and chaotic feel of Amputechture, without the help of a single overarching narrative, was just too much.  Well, I loved them all. If you're one of those listeners who is still on board after all of the stylistic changes the Mars Volta has gone through, The Bedlam in Goliath will not disappoint. The Album NEVER calms down. Even on Amputechture, there were a few tracks (\\"Asilos Magdalena\\", & \\"El Ciervo Vulnerado\\") that contrasted with the blistering pace and vocal urgency of the rest of the album. The Bedlam in Goliath is a full-length album that gets even harder than Amputechture at times (see \\"Ouruborous\\" in particular) and never lets up.   Frances the Mute introduced the band as an orchestra whose sound you just can't wrap your ears all the way around on the first listen; Amputechture took that sound and added pockets of intense instrumental and vocal distortion. The Bedlam in Goliath is a full-bodied combination of the full aural depth of Frances and the real weirdness of Amputechture. The darkest, most challenging album they've released so far. IMHO.
0805066691|5.0|BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE: AN INDIAN HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN WEST by Dee Brown is a relentless, fact-after-fact-after-fact major work documenting the systematic genocide of a culture and a race by the U.S. government during the 19th century.<br /><br />Brown, a graduate of the University of Central Arkansas, does indeed provide an Indian history, which is record of the systematic and sordid, needlessly cruel policy of the U.S. government toward Native American tribes as the insatiable land hunger spread westward.<br /><br />Brown begins the book with a brief overview of the Native American situation since the time of Columbus, but the main focus of the book is the U.S. government's policy and behavior toward Indians in the 1800s. Brown takes seriously the phrase \\"an Indian history\\" and writes expressly from a native point of view (dating events by year and moons, such as \\"During the Moon of the Red Cherries\\" (p. 264) and calling American military personalities by the names the Indians gave them. The book's chapters are built around specific tribes and the means by which the U.S. government treated with them, violated the treaties, gunned down their people (including in several instances in which whole villages were slaughtered including women and children, with possessions burned and ponies butchered as well), and stole their land.<br /><br />But the U.S. government wasn't just making a land grab. The military and, often, the Great Father (the U.S. president) were also trying to obliterate Indian culture, and could not stand the thought of American Indians free in either Canada or Mexico, and would not rest until they could lure them back and imprison and/or kill them. Brown gives complete accounts of Indian speeches at councils and meetings, as well as blow-by-blow accounts of the deaths of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, for example.<br /><br />Brown's chapters recount the individual histories of the Navahos, the Cheyennes, the Apaches, the Nez Perces, the Utes and the Sioux, to name a few. He also follows the \\"careers\\" of many well-known Indians in the struggle to preserve the cultures and lives of their people, and the book ends with the slaughter at Wounded Knee on Dec. 28, 1890. This incident represents the apotheosis of the the government's inexorable need to turn Indians into little white men -- or into dead Indians. (All men created equal, again, means all white, Christian men.)<br /><br />The story is not complex; it has one theme, and Brown tirelessly supports that theme with evidence of the means by which the Indians were tricked, tortured and targeted by a force bigger than themselves.<br /><br />A satisfying anecdote comes in the chapter, \\"Dance of the Ghosts.\\" Sitting Bull has been asked to make a speech at Bismarck when the Northern Pacific Railroad celebrated the driving of the final spike into its cross-country line (which bifurcated Sioux lands). Sitting Bull had worked with a young government soldier who spoke Lakota on a speech to commemorate the moment. But when the time came to give the speech, Sitting Bull stood and said in Lakota, \\"I hate all the white people. ... You are thieves and liars. You have taken our land, and made us outcasts\\" (p. 401). Only the army officer knew what the words meant, and everyone at the ceremony applauded the famous Sioux chief, who smiled and bowed. The army officer stood for his \\"translation\\" and spoke from the script, elaborating on the ideas in well-worn Lakota cliches to a standing ovation. Hunkpapa Sitting Bull was so popular, he was taken to St. Paul, Minn., for another ceremony!

It is a dark look at the horrible machinations of the KGB and MI6 at the height of the cold war, and the price that a number of foot soldiers in that war paid.

055357342X|5.0|I am no expert on fantasy literature, but for my dollar, no one is better that George R.R. Martin. This is the third volume in his project seven volume series a Song of Ice and Fire. If you're going to read these, you are definitely going to want to start with the first volume, [[ASIN:0553381687 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]]    A Storm of Swords is less of an action book than the two previous installment, and spend more time developing characters and advancing the plot. That's fine with me. I often find battle scenes boring, and would rather follow the machinations happening in the Castles.     All the reviews on here are raving about Martin's ability to build characters and plot. I agree with that, Martin has built a complex world full of very human characters with flaws and desires just like the rest of us. These are not books that rely on battles or sorcery to keep our interest; they are character driven novels where you care very much what happens to everyone.     But, in addition to his grasp of excellent character development and plot construction, what puts Martin at the top of the pile is his attention to detail, both in the structure of the books, and in the descriptions of the world. No detail is unimportant, and clues to future events are peppered through this, and every one of his books. Also, Martin's descriptions of setting, clothing, and especially food, make Martin comparable to Dickens in his ability to create and shape a world.     All that is to say, that if you're interested in a good story, whether you are usually a fan of fantasy or not, then Martin is a great writer to get interested in.    - S.T. Sullivan
B000YPUFAG|1.0|I have to go one star on this.    First off, there was no story whatsoever. And consider - Im a fan of the previous two movies. I know sometimes people say the plot sucked, or was virtually nonexistent in a movie. But in this movie, the plot wasnt virtually nonexistent, there absolutely was no plot at all. The movie was just a series of scenes loosely connected together.    Speaking of which, I counted at least 5 scenes that were direct rip offs of much better movies. Did they think no one would notice they just pulled the \\"bob\\" scene directly out of Romero's film? Its like the movie was written by committee - or a 12 year old. Maybe a committee of 12 year olds?    Oh, and lastly, what in the world did they do to Milla's face? She was CGI'd the whole movie - and it looked ridiculous. They had one of the most beautiful women on film, and then turn her face into a bizarre photochop experiment? I really really hope this isnt the future of films, she looked like a freak.    In a word. Awful.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|What a disappointment this was! As a matter of fact, I won't even spend a lot of time reviewing it because the wounds are still too fresh!  The movie starts off beautifully-- a space crew has to re-start the sun by detonating a nuclear bomb into it.  The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting good, the cast interesting, and the music beautiful.<br /><br />We watch the crew interact with eachother, face obstacles, etc.  All is well for the viewer.  AND THEN. . . gosh. . . (spoiler alert!). . . a crewmember from the other ship (failed mission) impossibly shows up in this ship.  And, he is now insane, homicidal, and seemingly supernatural.<br /><br />So, this becomes Friday the 13th in Space.  Freddy Kreuger (definite resemblance) in Space.<br /><br />Before the monsterman showed up, I thought this was a great movie and thought that this one would be one I kept.  Not anymore.  Truly a letdown.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy was wonderful. As always.

A Feast for Crows was orginally suppossed to be a larger book incorporating all the characters we have come to know. But because of space and time considerations, Martin split this book up into two. So we have to await the publication fo A Dance with Dragons to get caught up with some of our favorite characters. I like a lot of other fans, think this was a mistake. This turned out to be my least favorite book in the series, and I hope Martin can turn around the next three and give us a consistently excellent series.     But, if you're new to the series, you should know that these books are quite dark. Heroes die, and villains become sympathetic.

B000F39M9W|4.0|Let me begin by saying that the sonics on this disc are absolute benchmark level. I don't know if it's the new Disney Concert Hall or DG's characteristically excellent recording techniques, or both, but as recording quality goes this is FABULOUS.   The recording itself is made up of modern works. In summation, the Stravisky is great. This highly percussion driven piece is great. All of the bass drum and timpani hits have delicious impact, and the playing is, as expected immaculate. Bartok is good as well.  What I have issue is with the speed of Night on Bald Mountain. Maestro Salonen, where's the fire? I know this piece is supposed to sound driving but in my estimation a comfortable exceeding of the speed limit would suffice rather than the frenetic race to the end he achieves.

Unfortunately the details aren't enough to disguise the fact that the plot for this story is dull, predictable, and ultimately unsatisfactory.    This story takes place 200 years after the events of \\"Pillars\\" in the same English town of Kingsbridge.  Whereas \\"Pillars\\" was centered around the construction of a cathedral and the politics around it, there is no central focus to this book.  At first it's a new bridge, then a new steeple for the cathedral, and neither are a satisfactory cement for the story.  It centers around four characters -- Merthin, Caris, Ralph, and Gwenda -- and their lives after they witness a knight who nearly gets killed for a secret he has about the current monarch.  Merthin longs to be a knight himself but becomes a carpenter; his younger brother, Ralph, who has no moral problems with rape, pillage, and murder becomes the knight instead; Caris wants to be a doctor but, alas, in 13th century England that isn't possible, and Gwenda just wants to survive from year to year.  Merthin and Caris go through a rollercoaster of a relationship, Ralph becomes a horrific earl, and Gwenda seems lost in the shuffle as she marries and raises a family admist feudal English life.    As with \\"Pillars\\" there is a great deal of politics going on, particularly with the new prior of the church, Godwyn, his scheming witch of a mother, and his toady, Philemon.    Here are the problems that I have with the book.  The characters are ultimately stock characters, even cartoonish, without any real redeeming qualities.  Merthin is a wimp who doesn't stand up for himself.  Caris is too 21st century in her attitudes about what she wants in life.  Ralph is a typical bully who doesn't learn anything in the end.  Poor Gwenda just lurches from side to side in an aimless meander through life.  It's easy for the reader of \\"Pillars\\" to predict which characters will have which characteristics and actions.    Another problem is Follett telegraphs every plot point in advance.  Example: when any of the characters have sex and the woman \\"worries about becoming pregnant\\", you know that she ultimately will.  This isn't forshadowing; forshadowing, as I've told my students, is supposed to be subtle and not be bludgeoned.  It makes the story uninteresting simply because there's no real surprise.    Speaking of sex, his sex scenes in the beginning are very explicit when the characters are young, but as they grow older the sex just seems to stop.  Don't older people have sex?      Characters are mentioned briefly then disappear.  For instance, Merthin runs away for Florence and gets married, but his wife dies in the plague.  She is never really mentioned and seems to be an after thought.  Even the daughter they create seems to be thrown into the story just to mix things up but has no dramatic purpose.    He also makes the assumption that we've forgotten something and will paraphrase it, such as \\"That's Philemon, the monk, Gwenda's brother.\\"  Times like those make me feel like he's writing down to the reader.      Finally, the secret that is supposed to be the motivator of the story in the beginning simply vanishes.  Every now and then a character would remind us it is there, and when it's revealed in the end it's more of a \\"That's it?\\" reaction rather than \\"Wow!  That's fantastic!\\"    In the end, this story really is much ado about nothing.  I wasn't left with the desire to re-read it to understand it.  I felt it had jumped the shark within the first hundred pages, and I only kept going to find out if it would get any better.  Like I said, he's great at the details and painting a picture.  In the end it wasn't worth the journey.
1594489505|2.0|It is a must read because one would learn a lot about the plight of women in Afganistan.  However, the author is not a good writer and the plot and the sub plots and many parts of books are written rather clumsly.   Also, the author is heavily biased.

Absolutely amazing performance! Worth every penny I spent!

And the guy's cyber buddy who also runs the site is telling Moore to \\"Go home and die.\\"<br /><br />Real nice guys.<br /><br />I'm betting Moore knew the Republican response this movie would get. Socialized health care will destroy life on earth. But to everybody else, this film was a way we could all relate to each other because we know the pain that comes with the American system. We either don't have health care or we do but we never seem be covered for the procedure that we need at the time.<br /><br />This film calls for a change. The Republican system of throwing cash at corporations and hoping for the best is not working. It never has. It's time to do the American thing, the Christian thing, the human thing and make sure that every person in this country has access to health care at any point in their life and whenever they need it.
B0000669JL|5.0|\\"Legend\\" features some of the very greatest hits of Bob Marley and the Wailers--and what a compilation it is! As always, one could have hoped that other items be included (for example, only one cut from \\"Natty Dread\\"?).  Nonetheless, this is a dazzling collection.<br /><br />Some of the hits are compelling to include, such as \\"No Woman No Cry,\\" \\"Buffalo Soldier,\\" \\"Get Up Stand Up,\\" \\"Stir it Up,\\" \\"I Shot the Sheriff,\\" \\"Redemption Song,\\" \\"Jamming,\\" and a nice bonus cut, \\"Funky Reggae Party.\\" One thought: Quite a few of these songs appear to be love songs or whatever, but--in fact--have political content to them.<br /><br />Let's consider a few of the pieces in more detail:<br /><br />\\"No Woman No Cry\\":<br /><br />\\"In this great future<br />You can't forget your past<br />So dry your tears, I say.\\"<br /><br />This song has a softer sound to it. The band plays well and Marley is in peak form.  Since this is a live version (over seven minutes long), it is fun to hear the audience's responses throughout. The upbeat line, repeated several times, \\"Everything's gonna be alright,\\" sets a tone for the song.<br /><br />\\"Stir It Up\\": This song was a hit for Johnny Nash, representing one of the first reggae songs to break out to a wider audience (but not the first).  Marley's version is great!  The I-Threes provide strong backing vocals; the band plays well. This is an infectious version of the song and genuinely rates as one of Bob Marley and the Wailers' greatest hits.<br /><br />\\"I Shot the Sheriff\\": This was a worldwide hit for Eric Clapton (it seems weird that others had great hits with Marley's work, without him having the same success).  Marley's version is very different from Clapton's (although both work).  As liner notes point out, there is more of a political edge to Marley's version. Band, backing vocals, and Marley are all in fine form on this work.<br /><br />The bonus track--\\"Punky Reggae Party\\": The song is about getting ready for a punky reggae party, but there are all manner of observations scattered throughout this song, some with political overtones.  One interesting set of lyrics that caught my attention:<br /><br />\\"Rejected by society<br />Treated with impunity<br />Protected by my dignity<br />I search for reality.\\"<br /><br />The musical line from the band is almost hypnotic and the I-Threes, as typically done, provide fine backing vocals.  Marley sings with pizzazz and spills out through after thought at a quick pace.  What a nice bonus track!<br /><br />In short, a truly wonderful greatest hits CD.  If interested in the range of Marley's work, this is a good place to start.political overtones.

0060763892|4.0|The Judas Strain is a good read.  Full of action and intrigue, it keeps you on edge from start to finish.  My only complaint is that the good guys are not potent enough.  The bad guys (Nasser, Serena and even Seichan) are all lethal in every respect.  The good guys however, act as if they are somewhat reluctant to use force.  The US spends billions training special forces, Rollins needs to do a better job of making his characters more inclined to seek vengeance and retribution.  He actually needs to tear a page out of Vince Flynn's \\"Consent to Kill\\" or Lee Child's \\"Bad Luck and Trouble.\\"  I'm sure Mitch Rapp and Jack Reacher would have gotten a little more carried away than Gray Pierce did if their parents were kidnapped.  I can tell you this, Nasser would have really gotten his rear kicked for sure.    It seems to be an ongoing theme in western literature to have your audience tormented by some villain for 90% of the novel, then the villain gets a quick 2 seconds death.  No, he should at least suffer some emotional pain before he's disposed of.  It only seems fair.  Instead, these bad guys in the novel torment you 3/4 of the way through the story and then die in 2 seconds (i.e. Dr. Potenjelli).  Not enough!!    Rollins seems to have discovered a successful formula for writing and he's getting better at it with each novel.  I didn't think he could top the Black Order but he comes close.  Gray Pierce and Painter Crow however need to be hardened just a bit more before we come to believe that they can really occupy the positions they hold in these stories.
0525950079|4.0|Remember, dear readers, that this book is a novel, a work of fiction. It need not be historically accurate. WWE is truly a soap opera, a grand \\"As the World Turns\\" story of rather vast proportions. It did go on a bit and probably could have for another 500 pages. I am happy it did not. In fact, I wanted Caris, the main heroine, to commit suicide the one time she thought of it, as she wobbled over the edge of Merthin's excavation site of the tower he was building.<br /><br />Follett may not be Gustave Flaubert or Leo Tolstoy and this work of fiction may not be in the same league as the apparent and greatly over-rated \\"classics\\" that \\"Madam Bovary\\" and \\"Anna Karenina\\" are, but you know something? WWE is actually more interesting and a lot more fun to read! I never got past page 650 of \\"Anna\\" and I hated everyone and the story in \\"Bovary\\".<br /><br />Two main things to mention.  1) WWE is a fantastic addition to the spate of anti-religious books (all non-fiction until WWE) to emerge on the literary scene in the past 3 or 4 years.  It actually is more effective in generating distaste and disgust at the idiocy and stupidity of the Church (and all Christianity) than Hitchens' \\"God Is Not Great,\\" or Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion.\\" It even relegates the brilliant Sam Harris to second place status.  While Follett may not have MEANT his book to arouse and reinforce all our latent disgust with Christianity, he nonetheless accomplishes that feat easily and forcefully. He's at his best when indirectly condemning the Church and everything about it by merely describing the conduct of its leaders and followers. WWE is about as anti-Christianity as any novel could be. For that reason alone, I loved it.<br /><br />2. Is Follett homophobic?  While he revels in a kind of teen-age superficiality about love and sex with straight people, going into some detail about heterosexual intercourse in astonishing locations and between the most unlikely of couples, he seems embarrassed or downright fearful of equally vivid descriptions of lesbian or gay male love-making.  Everyone knows, and everyone back then knew, that homosexuality was as common as it is today, and that homosexuality was a REASON to be a nun, monk or official of the Church. One's conduct was reasonably safe. But Follett, while he alludes repeatedly to homosexuality, just cannot or will not deal with it in any sensible way.  What a disappointment. As a gay man, if I have to endure explicit heterosexual sex act descriptions, I expect at the least equal treatment for homosexuals!!! If your female characters often sound and behave like Gloria Steinem, then.........maybe some equal print time for gays?  Hmmmmm?<br /><br />I whole-heartedly recommend the book for point #1 above and ask your indulgence for point #2 above.  Beyond that, the story, as many of the 200+ reviewers here have stated, really has no point (like the TV soap operas), because the characters create and endure or resolve one after the other of various catastrophes and minor triumphs in their lives. They are trapped into an episodic existence, and Follet passes on that fate to the reader. The minor characters are often more interesting and more complex than the 4 heroes, children you meet on page 1 and whose lives you follow for the remainder of the 1,011 pages.  I would give \\"supporting actor\\" awards to many of the minor characters such as Philippa, while at the same time not nominating any of the principal characters for anything. And yet, their lives command your attention. I was drawn to the utter desolation in their lives, the poverty, disease and their demoralizingly pitiful existence -- yes, even those of high rank -- in or out of the Church.<br /><br />Follett is a master at describing in understandable terms the details of construction and engineering. Overall, There is way too much narrative and way too little dialogue. He gets preachy and repetitive far too often.  The town's fate is and growth (as a reflection of civilization) is a better theme to follow than the lives of the main characters. The book was poorly edited. Most of the characters are unlikeable if not disgusting. Few of them learn from experience. Violance and abuse of women is perhaps accurately portrayed for the time. The women, for the most part, are more appealing than the men. But none of the main characters would ever be invited to my home -- in 1342 or 2008. Perhaps the story is an accurate description of life in the 1300s. Perhaps not. It doesn't matter. It is a great, epic soap opera (but not a sequel in power or literary value to \\"Pillars\\"). But it's a fun, if rather never-ending, read.  I read it in a week. Follett remains as one of my favorite authors.  But, make no mistake, WWE is not his best work, just as \\"Da Vinci Code\\" was inferior to Dan Browns better book, \\"Angels and Demons.\\" Read it and revel in it, as I did, as a beautiful condemnation of the Church and Christianity!than the lives of the main characters.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|After owning and using the Swivel Sweeper for just over 12 months, it is still running, albeit a bit noiser,  and the battery life with proper charging is still good. Early on, I did have problems with the tabs to release the cover, but a little careful use of sandpaper cured this problem, immediately.    Please, do NOT expect this to be a vacuum. It does a reputable job of  sweeping up most things, even sloppy dropped food around the table. As it has aged, it is however, more challenged with fine hair or lint, and likes to spit it out, likely due to wear. I should note, I have no pets, but use this sweeper at least TWICE per day.    I have not had occasion to contact the company, so I cannot speak to negative feedback on that topic. Compared to the Shark and its competitors, and the Bissell Cordless, I believe that despite its kind of cheap construction, it is a better product at actually sweeping than those units, and in many areas, can be purchased cheaper.    Battery maintenance is critical, and it is imperative that it be run down to a virtual stop, before recharging.  Again, no problems here, either, with a solid 6 hour recharge.    I paid $35.00 at Target for mine, and provided your expectations are moderate, this thing is pretty amazing for what it is. I suggest trying one out from a place like Target, saving your box and receipt. Stores like them  have a no questions asked return policy. Not much to lose to try it, other than a little time, and GASOLINE.  GASOLINE PRICES are another subject.
0763617105|5.0|I read this book to my toddler class (one-year-olds)and they absolutely love it.  This is the one book that is always requested at story time and I often have demands to read it three or four times in a row.  Everyone laughs with relief when the mother owl finally comes home.  The children quote from the book during free play.  Many of them look at the book on their own, making different voices for the different owls and crying, \\"I want my mommy!\\" at every page.      The repetition is perfect for this age group, as it helps the children memorize the story line.  The illustrations are also beautiful.  The owls are realistic-looking, but also manage to convey a variety of emotions in their faces and body language.      I use the book as a springboard for simple discussions with the children on coping with separation anxiety.  I also use it to teach recognition of different emotions - worry, sadness, hope, doubt and happiness.  The repetition of the highly salient \\"I want my mommy!\\" on every page makes it a good book for toddlers to practice language skills.  And because this book addresses a very relevant topic for babies this age, it makes literacy appealing to them.  I highly recommend it both for teachers and for parents of babies in the one- to two-year-old range.

B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Those who believe they don't make Bad Movies We Love the way they used to have yet to witness Shekhar Kapur's \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\\" (the title makes it sound like her Nelson Riddle period). An unholy mixture of the banal and the bombastic, this 2007 film once again stars Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I, who spends much of her time flouncing around in outr&eacute; outfits that seem more Kabuki than England circa 1585. (No doubt they are historically accurate. Who would have the nerve to invent them?)<br /><br />Blanchett, miraculously gives a good performance, even when saddled with lines like this one, to Clive Owen's Sir Walter Raleigh: \\"In another world, could you have loved me?\\" Maybe, but in the world of this film, with a score that's positively deafening, it's amazing that she could even hear herself.<br /><br />This handsomely mounted film, in its cute ADD way, quickly forgets its half-hearted early attempts to make History Relevant to What Is Going On in the World Today and soon morphs into a sort of Classic Comics on acid, or the longest Eurythmics video ever made. This time around, the Virgin Queen is up to her ruffled collars in romantic and political intrigues, mostly revolving around the dashing Raleigh and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), respectively. History tells us that when the film opens in 1585, Elizabeth, who has been on the throne for 27 years, is 52 years old, and that Raleigh is 19 years her junior. Blanchett, if anything, looks younger than her 38 years - and Owen, in real life, is five years older than Blanchett. But they're both so good-looking that you can accept the queen making goo-goo eyes over the poetry-spouting Sir Walter, who returns from the New World just after she's endured a bad-date montage of potential suitors.<br /><br />Or is Liz actually smitten with her lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton (played by Abbie Cornish), who infuriates the queen by getting pregnant by Walt? This triangle appears to be inspired less by any historical evidence than by THE VIRGIN QUEEN, a 1955 Hollywood travesty wherein Liz, Walt and Bess were played by the more-age appropriate Bette Davis, Richard Todd and Joan Collins.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spanish Queen, er, King Philip II (a mincing Jordi Molla) is plotting to restore England to Catholicism by encouraging the Sceptr'd Isle's Catholics to revolt and install Mary on the throne. Phil's agents trick Elizabeth's spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), into thinking Mary is part of the conspiracy - providing Morton with a nifty execution scene and the Spanish an excuse to launch the Armada. Sir Walt gets sprung and named director of Homeland Security. Damn history and full speed ahead! Somehow he ends up leading the British fleet in some obviously CGI'd sea battles, even swinging from the masthead and diving off a burning ship.<br /><br />At the same time, our girl Liz - who has modeled a succession of costumes that make those in the far less entertaining MARIE ANTOINETTE look positively dowdy - is gotten up in armor and delivers what appears to be an advance draft of the St. Crispin's Day speech from Henry IV. (If there are any history majors left in the audience by the time this scene comes up, the sound you will hear will be all of them screaming \\"uncle.\\")<br /><br />Presumably she, Shakespeare and Lord Essex will be heading off to explore America in Kapur's threatened third installment. Can't wait.rical evidence than by THE VIRGIN QUEEN, a 1955 Hollywood travesty wherein Liz, Walt and Bess were played by the more-age appropriate Bette Davis, Richard Todd and Joan Collins.

I thought that was a wonderfully well done story, very moving.<br /><br />I certainly would encourage you to get a copy of Hugo Cabret and see what you think of it.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|This film works on a lot of levels. It's witty enough to appeal to adults, it's got the sort of sentimental romance that grannies and teenagers love and there's some cool spells and special effects for the kids. It's got all the usual trappings of a fairy tale - handsome princes, beautiful princesses, evil kings, wicked witches and some terrific transformations - plus some extras like Robert de Niro as a camp pirate and Michelle Pfieffer being a real sport in a very unflattering latex mask. As you would expect all turns out well in the end with true love triumphing, goodness rewarded and wickedness punished but there are plenty of twists, turns and laughs along the way.

That's probably the soonest that the TV companies can afford to give us this particular treat. At last, a realistic Bond who bruises when he gets hit and whose hair isn't magically dry when he emerges from the sea. Daniel Craig is great in the part, and is also his own best Bond girl. He looks every bit as good in his swimmers as Ursula Andress did in hers.<br />The plot is, of course, ludicrous but who cares? The action is less cartoonish than usual and the locations are fantastic. Gadgets are replaced in the main by quick thinking and martial arts, although I think there might be a case for every Aston Martin to be equipped with a defibrillator. We also find out exactly why Bond is so horrible to the women in his life. This is a fantastically entertaining piece of cinema which delivers exactly what it promises on the tin: action, adventure and some serious style.[[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)]]

1594489505|5.0|It's probably otiose to submit yet another glowing review of this book, but having stayed up all night unable to stop reading it I felt moved to express myself. The recent troubled history of Afghanistan is a difficult topic to portray and it takes a writer of Mr Hosseini's towering talent to portray it with this degree of insight, empathy and believability. The story is told through the eyes of two women, both wives to the same violent and unhappy husband, suffering under the stifling regime of the Taliban. Almost unbelievably Mr Hosseini manages to craft a story which describes their tribulations without ever descending into melodrama, and concludes with an ending distinguished with a sense of justice and real love. This would be a compelling read even it were entirely a work of fiction, but the fact that there must have been many women who lived through this situation while we western women enjoyed emancipation, education and freedom of choice in our careers and relationships certainly gave me pause. This book is an eye-opener: you will see things differently once you've read it.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I'm giving this album 4 stars not because it has \\"killer\\" songs-though it does have good ones-but for the fact that it is very easy on the ear. Moby has a very mellow, rhythmic, black sounding album here. I don't really have the vocabulary to describe his musical influences...maybe you could list them as blues, soul and perhaps gospel. Some of his songs sound sort of school-girly...like maybe the kind of stuff you'd hear black girls skipping along to in America.       Moby melds these African American musical influences with elements of hip-hop and dance music. He also seems to sample material from the source-black men and women. I really can't say whether Moby is doing the originals justice but I can say that I like what he's done with the source material. This is another way of saying that if you are familiar with the source material you may find Moby's treatment annoying. Personally, sometimes I feel the same way about people messing with the originals. One case which changed my mind was Muddy Waters' own revisiting of his blues songs, but with a harder, rock sound [I've reviewed Waters' \\"Hard again\\" here. Found it superior to his more \\"classic\\" approach, as in \\"Anthology\\"].    Anyway, some of my favourite tracks on the album are: \\"Honey\\", \\"Body rock\\", \\"Natural blues\\", \\"Run on\\" and \\"If things were perfect\\".     \\"Body rock\\" might be the most well known song from this album and is the least \\"black\\" sounding-well, to my ears at least. It's more of a funk/rock song and thus stands out from the mood of the other songs.    There are some instrumentals on this album-around three. Also, a highlight of the album are the wonderfully poetic, spoken voice songs of \\"If things were perfect\\" and \\"The sky is broken\\". These tracks are sparse, sensual and soothing.    Overall, the tone of the album is pretty consistent: \\"black\\" music but with some modern treatment. You'll hear accoustic guitar, piano and violin, on occasion, along with electronic music-be that synthesiser,or techno beats.     Overall, this album does not overstay its welcome. 18 tracks is quite a lot for a non compilation cd, but it never really palls. Some albums I mark down for having too much padding [e.g. The Red Hot Chilli Peppers' \\"Blood, sugar, sex, magik\\"] despite having quality songs on them. This is the perfect cd to \\"chill out\\" too, as well as to bop along to, sometimes, with his catchy songs.    P.S. for some reason the rap star Eminem had a go at Moby. In one of his songs he has a lyric along the lines of \\"Moby you don't know me. Blow me\\". Not really sure what that is all about! Who started that little tiff?
B00009MGR6|3.0|AC/DC's 1988 release, \\"Blow up Your Video\\" is a bit better then \\"Fly on the Wall\\" but its not much of an improvement, as half of the songs 10tracks and good, and half are just plain bad. Even though some fans might bash the album as a \\"Sellout\\" and crossing over more to a hair-metal sound, I dont find that the case with this album, but the problem that I have with some of the songs on this album, is they lack any pure AC/DC energy (of the Brain Johnson era, which started off very strong with the first three releases with him) only to flutter and start losing some steam as the mid 1980's hit. There are some keepers here  that no AC/DC fan should be without. \\"Thats the way I wanna Rock N Roll\\", \\"Go Zone\\", \\"Nick of Time\\", \\"Some sin for Nutin'\\" and \\"This Means War\\" are great AC/DC tunes with plenty of energy and rock, but its a shame that the album couldn't have been more balanced. A average album, but nothing to write home about considering all the filler.
B00004LN16|3.0|OK, to say that AC/DC has an huge amount of change on their style of music is really going out on a limb. Everyone pretty much knows that AC/DC's style has been taking basic rock and blues beats, and putting them with Brian Johnson's raspy vocals. (of course the band seemed to have a bit more variety with Bon Scott, but I believe that he just fit a bit better with AC/DC then Johnson has)Of course this doesnt mean that AC/DC's material sucks with Brian, nor does it mean I dont enjoy their style of rock music, and even though 2000's \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" is better then \\"Fly on the Wall\\" & \\"Blow up your Video\\" I was hoping of an album with more of a heavy metal feel to it such as the great \\"The Razors Edge\\" which was released as Hair Metal was ruling the airwaves, Yet the band took a diffrent approach and released a pure Heavy Metal album (with no ties of Hair Metal at all) with \\"The Razors Edge\\" So we fast foward a few years to 2000, where Nu Metal and Metalcore are ruling the airwaves (in the rock world) and what does AC/DC do? They take things back to basics and pretty much re-live their blues sound that we really havent heard since the days of Bon Scott. Some of this really works. There are some  good songs here such as House of Jazz, Hold Me Back, and Safe in NYC, Meltdown, Satellite Blues, COme and Get it, All Screwed, and Give it up. So thats 8 out of 12 tracks that are pretty solid. But even though these songs are good, there arent really outstanding. They also suffer from sounding to much alike (I dont mean the AC/DC sound) but some of it is almost like listening to the exact same song just with different lyrics. So I give the band a break. This is an album released twenty five years since the debut album (which was released in 1975, yet didnt make it to the states til 1981) and of course the band has been together (minus a few members, for longer) and to still put out an album that is listenable, is impressive, yet it still doesnt manage to grab you like the albums of old, but still above average. 3 1/2 stars. ENJOY
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This is Enya's best album since the 1980's Watermark, and a much better effort than A Day Without Rain. Every one of her songs in the album adds something unique and special to the overall musical experience. A listener can easily tell that Enya, Roma Ryan and Nicky Ryan spent a lot of time and energy writing the music and lyrics. It wasn't just produced overnight like some albums out today. Although it doesn't really have a breakout song like Only Time, every song is very strong on its own, and much stronger than of those on her last album. A great, great buy!!
B0000073NC|5.0|When People think Scorpions they think \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\", they think \\"No One Like You\\", they think that german band that helped make the Berlin Wall collapse. They think of the MTV party rock they made in the 80s. Well forget about all of that and lets go back to 1974.<br /><br />Most people don't even realize that Scorpions existed long before the 1980s, way before MTV and all of that hair metal garbage they have been oh so inaccuratly accused of spearheading. Infact the good ol' Scorps have been around since 65'. \\"Fly To The Rainbow\\" was their second LP that was released in 1974 and featured new axe wizard Uli Jon Roth and future prog rock drummer Jurgen Rothensal. This might just be the weirdest, freakiest and downright most bizzare music Scorpions have ever commited to wax, and wouldn't you know this prehaps is the most mindblowingly creative effort of the band and prehaps of the early 70s. This is nothing like the Scorpions that would gain fame post 79, with big hooks and lyrics paying ode to sex, no, this is Scorpions in a full-blown psychedelic prog-fest. \\"Fly To The Rainbow\\", much like the first record \\"Lonesome Crow\\", has much in common with the burgeoning ambient Kraut Rock genre, with element of Hendrix-like psychedelia mixed in. And to top it all off, the record is concept, with all 7 tracks laying out one's struggle to \\"fly over the rainbow to freedom\\", which is an allegory of escaping into West Germany. Lets look at the tracks....<br /><br />SPEEDY'S COMING<br />It all kicks off with this cool early Scorpions rocker about a female rock fan. Lyrics like \\"She likes Alice Cooper, She likes Ringo Star, She likes David Bowie & Freinds..\\" are a hoot.<br /><br />THEY NEED A MILLION<br />A lovely song. Starts off with some beautiful classical guitar melodies and then out of no where punches the listener with a churning electric guitar from Rudy. Rudolf Schenker also sings lead on this one.<br /><br />DRIFTING SUN<br />The most psychedelic sounding song right here. It is a Roth penned tune, and he also sings lead. People slag his voice but I think it's great for this music. Klause sings back up on the chorus. The strange voices in the middle are Rudolf talking through a Leslie speaker cabinet. Awesome solo by Roth.<br /><br />FLY PEOPLE FLY<br />A slow, mellow burner. Very peaceful with sweet vocals from Klause, and more of Roth's Hendrix styled guitar solos.<br /><br />THIS IS MY SONG<br />This is another rocker, albiet with a strong progressive edge to it simular to old school Rush. The bass and drum playing from Bucholz and Rothensal is phenomenal.<br /><br />FAR AWAY<br />Another peaceful song. I don't like it as much as the rest of the album but it is still a very well crafted song with nice vocal melodies from Klausie.<br /><br />FLY TO THE RAINBOW<br />Here it is, the title track and best song on the album. This song is the mother of all Scorpions songs. It's a 9 minute epic on par with anything by bands like YES, GENESIS or ELP have ever done. It begins with a Dlyan-esque type folk deal, with Roth singing like one of Robin Hood's merry men. It then morphs into a monster, with daul harmonized guitars and galloping bass strait from h%ll, and you can see where Iron Maiden ripped it's entire sound off-of. Then it changes too slow,psychedelic introspection with Roth seducing the listener. Jon Uli Roth is the greatest lead guitarist on the planet, and he shows you why on this song. Amazing!<br /><br />This is great. If you are wondering what this sounds like, don't wonder, just go out and get this. If you enjoy alot of Woodstock-era music, you will like this. If you like Scorpions, you will like this. If you enjoy anything with even an ounce of creativity poured into it you will like this. I love \\"Fly To The Rainbow\\", and it is my favorite Scorpions record by far. Future Scorpions is great aswell, but they were never this artistic ever again. Highly recommended!d he also sings lead. People slag his voice but I think it's great for this music. Klause sings back up on the chorus.

055357342X|5.0|To get to my review, you probably skimmed over more than a few that beg you to read Martin's series, perhaps just to get to this third book, his masterpiece.  They're all correct.  I've read hundreds, if not a thousand, science fiction and fantasy novels and this is the single best piece of fiction I have ever read.    If you need stereotypical good and bad characters immersed in a constant series of black and white scenarios, such as those created by David Eddings or those hacks who write the Dragonlance stuff churn out month after month, this is not your author.  Martin's material is deep.  His books read like historical fiction, with just enough fantasy thrown in to keep you on your toes.  His characters are second to none and the world and specific locations he has created are simply breathtaking.  I've turned on over a dozen people to these books personally and have never had anyone less than thrilled with the material.  Please, please give A Game of Thrones a try.  The second book is even better, and A Storm of Swords is pure genius that will leave you exhausted yet desperate for more (maybe don't start it until a publication date is announced for book 5....).  It's unlike anything else out there and will ruin you for other fantasy writers, but the pleasure is just too great to resist.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|David Fincher's recounting of the search for the Bay area serial killer in the 60s and 70s is presented here in a director's cut that easily stands as the best film of 2007.  Unlike many director's cut the adds here are seamless.  Everything seems essential and adds to the power of this epic, brilliantly detailed procedural.<br /><br />The picture falls into three neatly constructed acts, the first of which chillingly reconstructs the crimes.  These scenes are like the beach landing in Private Ryan.  We've seen it before, but never like this.  The filmakers force us to confront what happened in all its terror and banaility.  It isn't exploitative, it's unforgetable.  Next we get the cops working the case (and the phones) and zeroing in on a prime suspect and by the last act the case becomes an obsession consuming the cartoonist Robert Graysmith.  Each section succeeds powerfully, and nothing is lost by not imposing a fictionalized ending.  In fact, the omission of the kind of closure found in The Black Dahlia or From Hell is what makes this a masterpiece.  You're haunted by the uncertainties.  You get a taste of Graysmith obsession.<br /><br />For a film with maybe a hundred speaking parts or more there isn't a single false note sounded anywhere. What worked least for me in the theater was Jake as Graysmith, but after watching the real Graysmith in the accompanying documentaries you realize he 's doing a canny imitation.  He also has some deadpan line readings that are the film's funniest.  Downey is sensational as always, but if the film has a standout it's Ruffalo who is brilliant.<br /><br />The score of the film is great and Fincher's use of music from the period will transport you without distracting you.<br /><br />The full-length documentaries on the case are low-key, but devastating as we meet Zodiac's survivors and some of the cops on the case.<br /><br />Great commentary track with film's writer and James Ellroy who gives his endorsement of this masterwork.
075640407X|3.0|Like many others, I'd grown sick of waiting for GRR Martin to finish his next book and started looking for something else to fill the time.  I checked Martin's website and wrote down about 5 different books he had recommended, then was referred to Name of the Wind by a friend, and decided to give it a shot instead.    Perhaps I've simply accustomed to the complexity and characterization of Martin's work, or perhaps, as a character in Kurt Vonnegut's Bluebeard says \\"Once you've seen 10,000 paintings, you know what's good\\", I've read too much to really enjoy a book like this, but I was very disappointed.    The novel has some great stuff in it.  The interactions with the guys who run the University, the brief appearance of the Chandrian, and everything related to Kvothe's performance to earn his \\"pipes\\" was really well done, but so much of the book just feels overwritten, stereotypical and simplistic.  All the Harry Potter stereotypes from Hogwarts are there (the masters who cut him breaks despite his offences because they know he has potential, the rich evil kid who comes from a powerful family who hates him just because he's poor).  But most of all, the story is told from a tavern as a \\"chronciler\\" writes it all down.  That perspective is just really boring.  You never feel like you really get to know any of the characters in the book, and you're left without much incentive to read the 2nd book.    Just before Name of the Wind, I had picked up the three original Farseer books by Robin Hobb.  The first book was decent, but the second one was really good and I can't wait to go back to the series and start the third one.  Her main character story arc is remarkably similar to Rothfuss', but better written.  I would recommend you give her stuff a shot if you're looking to pass the time - it's got everything you'll find here, but richer characters, plotting, and a more complex world to read through.    I'll probably check out Rothfuss' second book in the series if the reviews are good, but this one just didn't live up to the hype.  [[ASIN:055357339X Assassin's Apprentice (The Farseer Trilogy, Book 1)]]
B00005K3OT|5.0|Can there ever be a true balance between Reason and Passion? Is it even worth the time generations of philosophers and thinkers have devoted to the subject? Lasse Hällstrom makes a beautiful  cinematic fable out of this endless human dilemma in \\"Chocolat\\". A wonderful, moving (and surprisingly fun) movie to watch. Not only it features a great and magnificently-ensembled multinational cast which includes Johnny Depp, Carrie-Ann Moss, Lena Olin and even divine Judi Dench. It is the subtle, heart-felt approach the director manages to convey to such a deep and thick story line. It makes us think and reflect on how Humanity deals with changes and innovation as opposed to rigidness and prejudice-filled attitudes within the often stiff and unmovable boundaries of wrongfully implemented morality schemes. Vianne Rocher (beautifully portrayed by Juliette Binoche) is a sort of  magic-embedded \\"Mary-Poppins\\" with exotic roots, who travels along towns establishing impromptu chocolat stores, along with her young daughter Anouk. This time the cool northern wind brings her to the little French villa of Lansquenet, where life appears to have not changed a bit in a hundred years. She opens a chocolate store much to the dismay of the self-procclaimed town's moral police (Count de Renaud, played by Alfred Molina). But rather than challenging the rigid and linear morality parameters in town by way of sensuous and forbidden pleasures, Vianne and her tiny little chocolate place in reality will slowly (but fiercely) establish a much needed paradise of simple and plain tolerance for the villagers. She will start winning the town over not only with her magic recipes for the most delicious chocolate treats, but also with her honest and sincere ways for dealing with the everydays of human nature and understanding of real people. This movie is just a treat. Indulge yourself in some rich chocolate. I bet you'll like it.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|Yup, we've all seen it, and some of us are a tad ashamed to admit that we like it.  After all, if you liked Conan and the Beastmaster, it's only natural that you would have checked this out as well.  Brigitte Nielsen makes her debut as the fiery haired valkyrie warrior who's out on a mission for revenge.  In the Conan tradition, some evil queen killed her family and had her soldiers violate her.  So now she hates and distrusts men, but we all know she'll get over that within the course of the film coz she has to team up with three male warriors.  The evil queen has also stolen some glo-stick type talisman that is going to destroy the world in a few days.  So now Sonja is not only gonna avenge herself, but save the world!!  A real Two for One deal if I ever saw one.  This movie definitely comes across as a bit more cornball than the Conan films.  It looks rather low budget(not quite Deathstalker low budget, but low), and the actors seem to be taking all of this silliness rather seriously.  Arnold seems a bit bored by this barbarian stuff by now and pretty much plays second fiddle to Nielsen.  Nielsen may be a cutie, but she's not gonna win any awards for acting.  Sandahl Bergman is a rather hammy and cliched villain.  Probably the biggest flaw of this movie is that damnable kiss of death of casting an irritating loud mouthed child as one of the lead characters.  This would be Ernie Reyes, jr(he was also in The Last Dragon) who you'll be wishing a slow death on from the moment you meet him.  Why do so many films do this?  Do they think it's cute?  But in the end, those who have grown up with this movie can't help but enjoy it in all of it's cheesy glory.  Your average Harry Potter fan will probably just scoff.  Oh, well.  It's still a fun addition to Manly Barbarian Movie Night.  Here's a big shock:  They're remaking it!
B000B8QEZG|2.0|This album has over one thousand reviews and the vast majority of them are five-star ratings.  I had to see what all the fuss was about!  I have seen much discussion about \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" in forums and message boards, however, their reactions to the album were more critical.  So, what do I think of the album as a whole?  Well, I see what Madonna tried to do: She wanted to create a dance album while giving nods to Techno and Disco music.  I always applaud an artist for coming outside of their box and doing something different, and the finished product was OK, but I didn't really enjoy it.  Some of the production was very cutting edge and easy to dance to, and her voice is still as good as it has always been, but this type of music isn't best befitting for the Madonna we know and love.  She didn't do a horrible job, but, comparing this music to some of her earlier music, this is definitely not her best.<br /><br /> \\"Time goes by so slowly\\" was repeated one too many times in \\"Hung Up.\\"  This is one of the weakest songs on the album.  It's very Techno and Disco influenced.  The melody sounds like something she has already done in the late 1980s.  Madonna doesn't like every city, but she profusely expresses her love for New York in \\"I Love New York.\\"  The lyrics are corny, but, again, I see what she tried to do.  There is lots of guitar on this track, and the beat is pretty infectious; it will probably make you want to get up and dance.  Lyrically, \\"Like It or Not\\" reminds me of Mary J. Blige's \\"Take Me As I Am\\" because both songs are about appreciating people for who they are.  \\"Like It or Not\\" is one of the better songs on the album, definitely the most grand lyrically speaking.  \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"How High\\" were both sub-par offerings; she tried to incorporate too much in these songs.  Also, the choruses are lackluster.  \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\" are very decent songs.  She does a nice job with vocal delivery and the production on both tracks are good, too.<br /><br /> Madonna fanatics and lovers of Disco and Techno music, pick this album up.  Others?  Either borrow it or download it to see if you enjoy it before making a purchase.  There are no slow songs here, hence, the title, \\"Confessions of a DANCE FLOOR.\\"  OK offering, overall, but definitely won't get many more spins in my CD player.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Like It or Not\\"<br />2. \\"Sorry\\"<br />3. \\"Future Lovers\\"<br />4. \\"Push\\"<br />5. \\"Jump\\"Madonna fanatics and lovers of Disco and Techno music, pick this album up.

B00005R2IS|5.0|Mel Gibson is so young looking in this film, and so handsome!  Wow this film is so full of action and even on a low budget you can't beat Mad Max!      WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!     The film is about Austraila in the outback perhaps.  It's in the Post-Nuclear future, a town is being threatened by a ruthless bicker gang lead by the infamous Toecutter.  It's up to what's left of the police to stop them!      Our hero Max Rockatansky (Played brilliently by Mel Gibson), pursues the Nightrider, a member of Toecutter's gang, on a high speed chase.  When Nightcutter dies, the outraged Toecutter plans his revenge on Max and the entire police elite.  He starts off by picking off Jim Goose, a fellow officer and friend of Max's.  Johnny, a young lacky of Toecutter's, sets a trap for Jim.  Jim gets very wounded when they set him on fire.  Max visits Jim in the hospital and is angered and horrified at what the evil biker gang has done to his friend.  Max then does the wrong thing by resigning from the force and decides to spend some time with his wife and young son where the bikers are nowhere to be found.      But no, that doesn't stop Toecutter from wanting revenge, it wasn't enough to burn Jim, he had to pick on Max too!  But this time he does something almost worst then the last time.  This time these victims were innocent.  He runs down Max's wife and infent son, and kills his son while his wife suffers massive injuries to her internal organs and has to have both of her legs and arms amputated.  God hasn't Max suffered enough already?!     Now Max is clearly pissed off and gets out his police uniform and starts his vengence spree.      SPOILERS END HERE    This is a very good low budget movie.  I love the hair styles, enough though it was made in the late 70s, the hairstyles looked 80s. Cool.  If you want to see a very young Mel Gibson, then buy this movie or rent it!  Mad Max is so awsome!

0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a voice of reason in the cultural relativism wars going on in modern democracies. She exposes the double standards and cowardice that 'Westerners' have retreated to in dealing with immigration/integration issues. She is leading the fight in keeping universial human rights as the moral center in Europe's political debates. The writing is clear, fluid, and always interesting. This book ignited fierce discussion amongst my friends. Truly, she is an inspiration to people everywhere fighting for justice, equality, and happiness.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Danes, De Niro, Pfeiffer...with an all star cast like this I had high hopes for this movie.  It definitely delivered!  Not since Disney's Narnia have I seen a fun \\"fairy tale\\" movie like this one.  Heck, I even thought this was better than the last Harry Potter movie.<br /><br />Bumbling ghosts, aging witches, pirates who sail the sky in search of lightning, fallen stars, and princes destined to be king.  This movie has something for everyone. Definitely a movie to be enjoyed by young and old!<br /><br />I was in awe of the brilliant landscapes and kept thinking to myself how beautiful this movie really was. Watch it a second time and keep your eyes on the background.  The scenery is amazing!<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice simple tale not too cluttered with Hollywood hype.  Great cast! Great story!  Great effects!  And a great addition to your DVD collection that won't be a one time buy.  Like myself, your kids will want to watch this one again and again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We didn't catch Firefly when it was broadcast in 2002-03.  It wasn't until we got the  Complete Series DVD as a Christmas present that we've had a chance to watch this work of cinematic genius.    What is so painful about the too-early termination of the series is that one can easily imagine such a future: a strange but entirely believable fusion of American independence and Chinese culture and Soviet-style central government.    It's been called a \\"sci-fi western,\\" but that is only because horses and revolvers are featured.  Yes, it does show a frontier pitted against the \\"core.\\"  But it's truly about rugged individualism against a mix of corporate, criminal, and government evil.    While it is also about honor among those the central government considers to be thieves, Firefly's crew are anything but perfect heroes.  And this also contributes to the sense that, \\"hey, this could really happen this way.\\"      Buy or rent this DVD; see it all.  It puts the other sci-fi shows, including the over-rated Battlestar Galactica, to shame.    This is Joss Whedon's best work.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|After such a long wait this is an excellent package. The quality of the remastering and the colour and sound are amazing. The extras worthwhile. It is good, at last, to have a complete copy of such a very fine film, arguably one of the better epics from the 60s. One minor quibble. It would have been good to have the entr'acte on disc 2 before the start of the second part rather than at the end of part one under the intermission card. However it is a very minor criticism of such a well presented package.
B0007O38XU|3.0|\\"High Anxiety,\\" \\"Blazing Saddles,\\" and \\"History of the World:  Part I\\" were classics.  \\"Spaceballs,\\" though lathers the corn on too thick and it loses appeal.  The good news is that the handsome star finds out he is a prince, gets the once-stuffy princess, and Planet Spaceball does not get Planet Druidia's air.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|I bought it through Amazon.com (US) even I can't watch the DVDs as they work only for \\"Region 1\\", in Europe we use \\"Region 2\\".    Anyway I have the \\"standard\\" remastered edition for \\"Region 2\\" and this is not a big issue.    I don't know if this \\"Collector's Edition\\" will become available also for other markets, but I couldn't find any news about it...    Historically Led Zeppelin preferred the U.S. market instead of the \\"ancient\\" Europe, and this could be a reason why this package is available for the U.S. market only! Every time I was in the U.S. I found lot of radio station broadcasting Led Zeppelin music, this doesn't happen in Italy...    Anyway, despite the taxes, duties expenses I found it not really expensive as the Euro is stronger than the USD in this period.    Led Zeppelin are my favorite rock band, I am still crying because I didn't win the ticket for the O2 Concert in London about two months ago.
0425180638|5.0|Like the last book in the series, this one seems to get a lot of criticism. I don't understand. This book starts to tie some things together from the previous two books. Kay, and the other characters as well are not one dimensional, they have many layers. This book shows us that losing a loved one is not something that just happens and you get over it. It continues to touch every part of our lives, as Benton's death does for Kay, Lucy, Marino and even the staff of the morgue. This book moves at a slower pace and is more in depth than the previous ones. To me, that is a good thing. Some say the book is dark. Well, yeah, a book about a medical examiner and what she sees can be that way, not to mention how difficult the job has to become once you have lost someone dear to you through a violent death.     This isn't a book to begin the series with, that's for sure. It picks up a few hours after Black Notice ends. Point of Origin should be read first as well. I look forward to the next book in the series, this one obviously is about change in Kay's life, beliefs and career.
0793509602|5.0|Great book to become an intermediate lead guitar player. It starts from the very beginning and covers scales (Minor pentatonic, blues, minor natural and dorian), speed exercises, intermediate techniques (natural harmonics, vibrato bar, tapping), timing up to sixteenth note triplets, basic theory and introduction to improvisation. It has good explanations, 171 exercises and 6 songs with full backing band to solo over that make you enjoy as you learn. Exercises and songs are demonstrated on the included CD.  It uses TAB with standard rhythm notation to make learning easier.  This book will be hard for absolute beginners because, although basic techniques (hammer-on & pull-off, bending, finger vibrato, palm muting, artificial harmonics) are explained clearly, the book includes only a few exercises for every basic technique and focuses on more advanced matters. They'd better start with a basic book as [[ASIN:079351097X Metal Lead Guitar Primer]] to learn the basics.  Remember Troy Stetina is acclaimed as one of the best instructors world wide.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of my favorite books, and I am an avid reader.  I tend to keep a couple of copies on hand to share with my high school students that like to read.  All my copies have wandered off with absent minded teenagers with their noses stuck in them, so I need to buy myself another copy or two.  Ender's Game is just a good all around story. At bit of military science and action for the boys and excellent character development and depth for the girls. You get caught up in the battles and in the characters and can't put the book down until sadly you are done.  I have read the sequels, but none have the same appeal for me as Ender's Game.
1594481717|4.0|Keeping a usually uninterested college student intrigued is a feat that many books do not overcome. But Daniel Pink's \\"A Whole New World\\" is chock full of stories and tips that keep even the most inattentive on their toes. With complex ideas put in easy to understand terms, Pink's book offers a new way of thinking and acting in order to achieve success.     By embracing the six \\"money-making\\" senses Pink provides, any individual can pursue a successful future. Design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning make up these characteristics. If these new \\"right brain\\" ways are not taken and incorporated into your everyday life, your job may suffer. According to Pink, Abundance, Asia and Automation are three additional threats to your job security. Can your job can be done cheaper overseas? Can it be done faster by a computer? Is your job one of many providing the same service or product? If yes is the answer to any of the three questions, you might be in danger.    Although I believe that Pink's six aptitudes can be applied in order to achieve success, it is not true in all circumstances. Some of them are more socially and culturally directed. For example, story can impact the way of life in a more primitive and traditional culture than our own. In a particular African culture, a story may tell how the wind and sand came together to create mankind. To us, their stories may sound ridiculous and would not have a profound effect on our everyday lives. Another example would be design. A design that we find delightful and aesthetically pleasing might offend another culture.     Pink wisely crafted \\"A Whole New Mind\\" to cater to the younger population as well as making it pleasurable and hard-hitting for the older generations as well. It will be interesting to see if Pink's predictions are correct in the time to come.
B00092QTZO|3.0|When it comes to discussions about metal bands, Judas Priest is a name that is rarely left out.  They have certainly added to the whole genre over the many years that they have been playing and perhaps if you had to choose just one album to call their best, this would be it.  It certainly is their breakthrough album into the mainstream of the U.S. market helped in great part by the hit single \\"You Got Another Thing Coming.\\"<br /><br />This version of the album comes in a pretty well designed mini-lp replica sleeve which faithfully resembles the original vinyl design and includes an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Most importantly the sound quality is quite good reflecting a good remastering job.  The album overall has some decent representatives of the metal genre but I can't help but feel that this album is to Judas Priest what 1987 was to Whitesnake.  In any case, neither band comes close to Iron Maiden who with their third to fifth albums played the best 80's metal ever.  Judas Priest and Whitesnake make up that second tier of metal bands that still managed to inspire metalheads the world over and are responsible for the state of the genre today.  But if you want to hear good 80s metal, nobody played more interesting and challenging tracks than Iron Maiden.  Just check out \\"Number of the Beast\\", \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Piece of Mind\\" and compare these to anything Judas Priest have ever done and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Rock On!
B0013527I4|5.0|\\"My six-year-old loves the jokes, and runs around the house singing the songs!\\"<br /><br />In line at Best Buy, that's what the mom behind me was saying this morning, still half in disbelief that she was buying yet another season of these 30-year-old TV programs. And to me, that one sentence sums it all up. \\"The Muppet Show\\" offers comedy that appeals to all ages -- most episodes include MuppetLabs, Pigs in Space, Swedish Chef or other recurring skits -- as well as wonderful old ditties and show tunes that are themselves often staged with a sly sense of humor.<br /><br />This third season is perhaps the best of all. Digitally remastered like those on the earlier [[ASIN:B0009ULBGS Season One]] and [[ASIN:B000Q6774K Season Two]] sets, these 24 shows from 1978-1979 are the Muppets at their peak. Hosts include a broad range of personalities, from rocker Alice Cooper to Irish comedian Spike Milligan.<br /><br />And good news for music lovers: unlike Season Two, this set includes its song lyrics in its captioning!<br /><br />Here's the complete line-up:<br /><br />EPISODE 1: Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge. Nothing dated here except the blow-dried hair of Kristofferson, who can't keep a straight face as he serenades Miss Piggy with \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night.\\" Coolidge sings \\"We're All Alone.\\" When Sam the Eagle adds commentary to Rowlf's \\"A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go,\\" his insights include \\"This shows us that there was indeed a time when frogs went 'woo.'\\" Fozzie and Rowlf do a rousing version of \\"Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee (An Actor's Life for Me).\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 2: Leo Sayer. Has Kermit got a new girlfriend? Piggy thinks so, after starlet pig Annie Sue shows up. Meanwhile, the very-70s Sayer boogies down with a human-sized peacock as he sings \\"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing.\\" Other songs: \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" \\"When I Need You.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 3: Roy Clark. With silk shirts and very wide lapels, the country star declares he feels like he's \\"back on the farm.\\" Ah, the 70s. Songs include the bouncy \\"Sally Was a Good Ol' Girl\\" and the oh-so-serious \\"Yesterday When I Was Young.\\" In skits, the Swedish Chef gets attacked by a pile of living dough, while the Pigs in Space helplessly bounce up and down after Dr. Strangepork fixes the Swinetrek with toaster parts.<br /><br />EPISODE 4: Gilda Radner. Terrific! A 7-foot-tall talking carrot (with an attitude!) joins Radner in a medley of \\"I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General\\" and other selections from \\"The Pirates of Penzance.\\" Stuck to Beaker with MuppetLabs super glue, Radner attempts \\"Tap Your Troubles Away\\" from \\"Mack & Mabel.\\" Muppet numbers include a terrific version of \\"Lullaby of Broadway.\\" Confusing the word \\"Muppets\\" with \\"muffins,\\" Emily Litella opens the show.<br /><br />EPISODE 5: Pearl Bailey. The host does a great job with \\"In the Good Old Summertime\\" and a medley of show tunes including \\"Hello, Dolly!,\\" \\"Anything You Can Do\\" and \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses.\\" In skits, Dr. Honeydew invents Edible Paperclips, while the Pigs in Space turn into food when their Swinetrek passes through a field of Snacko Waves.<br /><br />EPISODE 6: Jean Stapleton. Annie Sue leads the pigs in the rowdy 1917 Brazilian classic \\"Tico-Tico no Fub&aacute;\\" (\\"tico tico tico clock!\\") and joins Rowlf for the 19th-century ditty \\"Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow.\\" Best known as Edith from \\"All in the Family,\\" the host sings \\"I'm Just Wild About Harry,\\" joins Fozzie for Irving Berlin's 1914 standard, \\"Play a Simple Melody\\" and shocks Sam with the news that the Swedish Chef doesn't speak real Swedish.<br /><br />EPISODE 7: Alice Cooper. Cheesy effects, silly makeup and bad lip-synching mar the host's supposedly serious productions of \\"Welcome to My Nightmare,\\" \\"You and Me\\" and \\"School's Out.\\" The worst show of the season.<br /><br />EPISODE 8: Loretta Lynn. One of the few Muppet Shows that doesn't take place in the regular theater, this country-music show is set in a train station. Songsinclude \\"You're Lookin' at Country\\" (Loretta with Lubbock Lou and his Jughuggers) and \\"Sentimental Journey\\" (Gonzo).<br /><br />EPISODE 9: Liberace. Chaos reigns when Gonzo tries to get his tap-dancing chickens into a Liberace spectacular. Also included: a Swedish Chef sketch that turns into an episode of Pigs in Space.<br /><br />EPISODE 10: Marisa Berenson. The Swedish Chef makes the wedding cake as Miss Piggy and Kermit head to the altar. Of course things don't work out. A 1960s model turned actress (\\"Cabaret,\\" \\"Barry Lyndon\\"), Berenson sings two songs.<br /><br />EPISODE 11: Raquel Welch. Miss Piggy and Welch don identical low-cut gowns to perform \\"I Am Woman.\\" Also features a good Swedish Chef skit about chicken in a basket.<br /><br />EPISODE 12: James Coco. Not that memorable. The highlight: Coco sings Randy Newman's \\"Short People\\" with a group of tiny Muppets.<br /><br />EPISODE 13: Helen Reddy. Miss Piggy sings \\"Stayin' Alive.\\" Reddy and Kermit perform \\"You and Me Against the World.\\" Reddy and Sopwith the Camel do \\"We'll Sing in the Sunshine.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 14: Harry Belafonte. Of course there's \\"Day-O\\" (with a pig chorus), but Belafonte also performs a wonderful African song, \\"Turn the World Around,\\" accompanied by Muppets wearing African masks.<br /><br />EPISODE 15: Lesley Ann Warren. The Great Gonzo rides his motorcycle up a ramp into Statler and Waldorf's theater box. Warren performs a \\"Beasty and the Beaut\\" ballet with Doglion. Miss Piggy takes over the Swinetrek.<br /><br />EPISODE 16: Danny Kaye. Some strange sights: The Swedish Chef with a human partner (Kaye, who refers to the chef as \\"Tom\\") and Statler and Waldorf out of their box (disgusted with the show, they head out to the back alley).<br /><br />EPISODE 17: Spike Milligan. Note my byline and you'll understand why I love this one. It includes a group performance of \\"It's a Small World\\" on a set that bears a remarkable resemblance to a certain Disney attraction.<br /><br />EPISODE 18: Leslie Uggams. A great guest appearance from Big Bird from Sesame Street. In one skit, it's love at first sight for Gonzo when Big Bird wanders onstage. \\"Wow! Perfection incarnate!\\" the chicken lover exclaims as he spots the giant feathered fellow. \\"Statuesque, yet still poultry in every sense!\\" There's also a funny MuppetLabs skit about fireproof paper.<br /><br />EPISODE 19: Elke Sommer. One of the weaker episodes, this is another one that just doesn't age well. The one-time sex symbol performs \\"Animal Crackers in My Soup\\" and, dressed as Cleopatra, \\"Row, Row, Row.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 20: Sylvester Stallone. Again not my favorite, but there is one memorable skit: in a gladiator sketch, Stallone and a full-size lion perform \\"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 21: Roger Miller. Lots of music. Penguins on the Mayflower sing \\"Alabamy Bound,\\" Miller joins some watermelons for \\"In the Summertime,\\" Miller and a Whatnots trio do \\"Hat,\\" Muppets in a pub perform \\"Down at the Old Bull and Bush,\\" Rowlf plays \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" (and turns into a chicken) and Miller joins some Muppet chickens for a medley of \\"You Had a Do Wacka Do,\\" \\"Dang Me,\\" \\"My Uncle Used to Love Me But She Died\\" and \\"You Can't Rollerskate in a Buffalo Herd.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 22: Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. A herd of cows goes mad for Fozzie's cow jokes in this cowboy-themed episode (Fozzie: \\"You cows are an udder delight!). Prairie dogs sing \\"Blue Skies,\\" Roy and Dale perform \\"Skyball Paint,\\" \\"Deep in the Heart of Texas\\" and a medley of \\"Hazy Mountains,\\" \\"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\\" and \\"Happy Trails.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 23: Lynn Redgrave. Veering away from the variety-show format, this episode is a 25-minute Muppet production of \\"Robin Hood,\\" with Kermit as Robin, Redgrave as Maid Marian, Fozzie as Little John and Gonzo as the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Town Crier declares \\"Five o'clock and all's well! Except that Maid Marian has been kidnapped, the Sheriff's up to no good, that dog is stealingthe cheese, Kermit's mad at Piggy, and it's really only 4:30.\\"<br /><br />EPISODE 24: Cheryl Ladd. Skits include Miss Piggy and Ladd trashing their dressing room as they sing \\"I Enjoy Being a Girl.\\" In \\"Pigs in Space,\\" Dr. Strangepork invents a pill that makes pigs invisible.<br /><br />Bonus features include \\"The Muppets on Puppets,\\" a 60-minute documentary from 1968. Jim Henson, Rowlf the Dog and Muppet design chief Don Sahlin demonstrate how to build and operate a hand puppet and review the various types of puppets as well as the history of the art and its use of special effects. The DVD set also includes a new featurette, \\"The Making of The Muppets.\\"<br /><br />As before, the menu screens are live-action. On one, Miss Piggy advises you to \\"only watch the scenes with me. Trust me, some of the other stuff is just plain weird!\\"<br /><br />On the front of the box, Fozzie's fur is not only very orange (more so than indicated on the image above), it's fuzzy.\\" the chicken lover exclaims as he spots the giant feathered fellow. \\"Statuesque, yet still poultry in every sense!\\" There's also a funny MuppetLabs skit about fireproof paper.

B000VZE1S6|5.0|Having left the successful early Genesis and embarking upon a solo career of his own, Peter Gabriel had a couple of interesting, competent releases but it wasn't until the release of this baby, his third, did he seem to have hit the right formula for a great overall album containing interesting but also consistently very good tracks.  \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" seemed to herald the onset of early 80's New Wave and in my mind it is still the definitive New Wave track which like any classic should still sounds very, very good today.<br /><br />Other brilliant tracks here include \\"I Don't Remember\\", \\"Family Snapshot\\" and the excellent \\"Biko\\" rank among the greatest work that Gabriel has ever done.  Yet all the other tracks are also very good and don't remotely resemble filler material.  This together with \\"So\\" are his two best ever albums to date and \\"Shaking the Tree\\" is one of the best ever compilation albums.<br /><br />This version is a real treat for fans as it comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve design which is rather well put together despite the thin cardboard and it very faithfully resembles the original lp design down to the inner sleeve.  Also included is an insert containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />Most important of all is that the remastering was very well done resulting in a very good sound quality making this album sound just as fresh today as it did way back then.  Who says New Wave is dead?  Not as long as a certain Mr. Gabriel is alive.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000C8Q97S|5.0|Weitz won an academy award for her portrail of the crusading wife of a British Diplomat stationed in Kenya.  Weitz won the Oscar, but it's the always fanstastic Fiennes who does the heavy lifting.  The story is at it's core a love story, a love story of Weitz and Fiennes and a love story of Africa.  What I found most shocking was that this is based on a true story!!, I'm just cynical enough to believe that company's do this sort of thing and world powers aquiese for the rich's these enterprises provide, in the case of Britain; much need jobs and for the pharm. company's untold riches.  I didnt find the film the least bit preachy; just straight forward and unblinking.  I must say, Bill Nightly stole the show in his supporting role of an upper level diplomat in Her Majestys foreign affairs office.  The cinemaphotography is breathtaking and the on location shooting was essential to the authenticity of the film.  After watching this, you won't look at your medicine cabinet quite the same way again.

B000TENE6Y|5.0|With OK Computer, Radiohead created something new--something different.  This is not a collection of catchy pop songs (except maybe Karma Police).  They started moving into a new direction.  Not just new for Radiohead--but new for mankind.  I buy new albums all the time, but rarely do I feel a new album is taking me into uncharted territory.    OK Computer to me was exciting because it stood apart from all the other music I knew at the time.    OK Computer is an experiment which I've enjoyed.  To me it is one of the most important albums of its time.  Not everyone will like it, thank god.  If you do like OK Computer, I suggest you next follow Radiohead further down this path with Kid A and Amnesiac.  Radiohead evolves from a straight forward rock band in The Bends to a twitchy, uneasy feeling surrounded by technology--out of place blips and beeps--with occasional moments of spiritual calm or convergance.  However you describe it, it works for me.
B000LZ6DM8|2.0|Although Talk Talk, aided by Tim Friese-Greene, were to radically alter the music world and make for music on unparalleled power on their last two albums [[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit of Eden]] and [[ASIN:B000001FZK Laughing Stock]], they began as a New Romantic pop band with a sound totally unsuited to the voice of singer Mark Hollis. In the process, it is true, they had one major hit in Australia with \\"Talk Talk\\", a grating, almost noisy dance-pop tune on which Hollis' voice was the worst kind of whine. Their first three albums made Talk Talk almost stars and even got them onto the Billboard Top 100, but already by this time [[ASIN:B000006UNG The Colour of Spring]] they had moved completely away from their [[ASIN:B000008L0E Spandau Ballet]]-like roots onto music that has stood the test of time much better.<br /><br />When I used to listen to the commercial music of the eighties - before [[ASIN:0634028618 Joe S. Harrington]] told me the truth about it with his brilliant Top 100 Albums - I had an earlier copy of \\"Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk\\" and to be quite frank never got into any stage of the band's work. The later work that I now recognise as passionate I thought slothly slow and in any case there is (due to the original albums issue date) nothing from their amazing final album and only an edited version of one of their finest songs, \\"Desire\\". Also missing from \\"The Colour of Spring\\" are \\"April 5th\\" and \\"Time It's Time.\\"<br /><br />All in all, \\"Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk\\" tells you nothing about what became - after a slow start - a wonderful and innovative band.
B000SX6JH2|5.0|This album, along with Amnesiac (which was produced around the same time) is not easy to like.  At first you probably won't get it.  Listen to the album a few times.  Let it sink in.      This is not the Radiohead of The Bends.  What started as an experimental direction in OK Computer gets more convoluted and further away from rock in this album.      It took some time to grow on me--but now I think this album is amazing.

0767836324|4.0|Sometimes I find that it is quite refreshing and fun to revisit movies that I enjoyed as a kid, although at times the end result isn't quite how I remembered it. Some of the time when I revisit a movie that I loved so long ago, I discover that I no longer understand what it was that appealed to me back then. For example, the movie \\"Big\\" starring Tom Hanks; as a kid I loved this movie, but when I watched it again a couple of years ago on DVD, I couldn't understand what it was about the movie that I had enjoyed so much, other than the scene with the giant piano on the floor. All the humor and fun of the movie escaped me, and maybe it was because I don't have a clear memory of the 80's that I didn't enjoy the movie as much. I grew up in that decade, so I was young when this movie was initially released, therefore certain comedic references don't mean anything to me. One thing is for sure, whenever I do rewatch movies from my past, it's always like a new experience, because since I'm older now, I catch things that I didn't as a child, and the movies make more sense to me and I am able to give them a much more objective look than I did back then. So, when I see a movie that I remember enjoying as a kid and still enjoy it to this day, that is a true treat for me, and one recent example would be the 1991 release of Steven Spielberg's \\"Hook\\" starring Robin Williams (\\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\") and Dustin Hoffman (\\"Rain Man\\").    \\"Hook\\" is the what-if story of what would happen if Peter Pan (Robin Williams) chose to leave Neverland behind, and live out his life as a normal person, therefore growing older and even starting a family. However, just because Peter Pan has grown up and forgotten his many adventures in Neverland, one man hasn't forgotten the boy who could fly, and is determined to exact his revenge once and for all, that man is Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). After Hook kidnaps Pan's children, Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) arrives to bring Peter back to Neverland and reintroducehim to the life he had left behind, and with the help of the Lost Boys, hopefully jog his memory so that Peter can once more remember how to fly, how to fight, how to crow, and ultimately how to be Peter Pan once again.    As a kid I remembered enjoying \\"Hook\\" when it arrived in theaters in 1991, so when I had the chance to watch it again recently on TV, I was curious to see whether the film would still hold the magic and wonder that it had for me back then. And I am happy to say that not only was it still as entertaining as it was back then, but I really enjoyed the story even more than I remembered previously. The reason was because I was able to appreciate what the extremely talented Steven Spielberg (\\"Jurassic Park\\") had created by examining the implications of what would happen to Peter if he chose to one day grow up and leave Neverland, and how the character would regain the heroic side of his life that he had forgotten. After I watched the movie again, I found myself wondering why some critics didn't like the film. Was it because they didn't like the 'what if' approach to Peter Pan growing up and forgetting his life in Neverland? Or was it that the somewhat more adult storyline didn't seem to jive with the original kid's story written by J.M. Barrie, at least it didn't in their opinions? Or did they think that for a Robin Williams movie, \\"Hook\\" just wasn't funny enough, and focused too much on drama and not enough on Robin Williams' obvious mastery of comedy? Whatever the reasons, I'll never understand why some disliked the movie, but I do know that I still enjoy it no matter what they may say.    I found the prospect of examining what would happen to Peter outside the realm of Neverland over an extended period of time was quite interesting, and was something that Spielberg and company dealt with in a very real, mature manner. Even though it was a kid's movie, the film contained many adult themes such as fear of losing one's family through selfishness, fearof the strange and unknown, and also rediscovering one's true self that had been buried for so long by the hardships faced in the real world. These elements were spread all over the storyline of the movie, but were done so in such a way that it wasn't overtly obvious, and therefore distracting and confusing to children. However, these elements weren't just treated in such a way that adults would find them insulting either, the mixture of this being a kid's movie, but also a drama with adult themes was handled surprisingly well.    The cast was extremely talented, and the two lead actors proved to be the ideal choices for their roles, even though at first glance they didn't necessarily appear to be. I for one wouldn't have thought of Robin Williams as a possibility to portray Peter Pan in any incarnation, but he handles him with just the right blend of drama and humor that made him into an intriguing, ultimately heroic, yet conflicted character. He is a man that wants desperately to save his children, but wants to hide from the possibility that he may have been the savior of Neverland known as Peter Pan, who had abandoned his heroic post so many years before, and that his actions in the past led to his current predicament in the present, and may ultimately change his future forever. Dustin Hoffman was more of an ideal choice to play Captain Hook, and one that frankly made more sense before I had even seen the movie. He gave audiences a Hook that was evil, scheming, and vengeful, but was also lonely and at times suicidal (a surprising aspect to the character, to say the least). To the film's credit, because it was by all accounts intended to be a kid's movie, the topic of suicide as contemplated by Hook, was only briefly touched upon and done so in a humorous way that would not offend or disturb any of the audience. The supporting cast was equally talented, creating characters that were just as memorable as the primary players. Julia Roberts (\\"Pretty Woman\\") as Tinkerbell and Bob Hoskins (\\"Michael\\") as Smee were both incredibly fun to watch, and their interactions with their respective counterparts (Peter Pan and Captain Hook) were some of the most engaging dramatic, and at times humorous, moments in the film. The cast members that comprised the Lost Boys were surprisingly very good for being so young. They played each of their characters as fun loving kids, who knew how to have a good time, but were also aware that theirs was a life full of danger and that one wrong move could mean their end. And rounding out the cast was Maggie Smith ('Harry Potter' series) as the grown up Wendy, who has devoted her life to providing a solid home for orphans and is the person that reintroduces Peter to his heroic past, and puts him on the path to rediscovery and hopefully the safe return of his children.    \\"Hook\\" is an extremely fun and interesting film to watch, as it deals with the prospect of what if Peter Pan actually grew up, and what would happen if his past came back to haunt him in a very real and unique way. It's a movie experience that is fun for the whole family, and is full of high-flying action, special effects that were cutting edge in 1991 (surprisingly they still hold up rather well to this day), and an engaging story that brings out the inner child in all of us.    \\"Hook\\" is rated PG for violence.

However, the plot line was cute - a group of friends get together over lunch to put together their list of \\"mr. perfect\\" and suddenly... they begin to drop like flies. Jaine is the heroine, she is sassy and spunky and utterly likeable...not to mention her hunky next door agent neighbor Sam who makes it his business to protect her once her friends start dying... simply adorable! Definitely recommended!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Disney animated movies have always been a mixture in terms of quality artwork and storytelling, but no matter what they've always managed to capture the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide. In the early days, their animated features were rougher looking (\\"101 Dalmatians\\"), most likely because of being rushed to meet deadlines or what not, but no matter how rough the art looked the stories remained timeless to audiences. Jump forward in time to the 2000's and the current crop of Disney animated films tend to feature clunky feeling artwork (\\"Home on the Range\\") that doesn't have any of the beauty and grace of their previous, some would say higher quality efforts, and the stories, though still entertaining, have even lost some of the magic and wonder of their films from so many years ago. Rewind time just a little bit, back to the 1990's, and Disney's art seemed to have never been better and the stories they told seemed even more refined and classic than all the great ones that had come before. With critical and box office successes, such as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Aladdin\\" (both of which were great movies), Disney's creative teams seemed to be on top of their game; however, no one expected the sheer excellence that they achieved with their box office smash hit \\"The Lion King\\".    \\"The Lion King\\" is the story of Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) who is a young lion cub, and the son of the great leader Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones), and destined to be the future king of Pride Rock. However, fate is not meant to be so kind to young Simba, as his jealous uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) schemes to eliminate both the king and his sole heir, therefore allowing him to obtain the throne. When Scar's plans don't go exactly as planned, Simba is forced to flee his home to wander the wilderness alone. Scared and desperate, all hope seemed lost for Simba, until an odd couple of sorts named Timon and Pumbaa find the young cub and raise him in the ways of 'Hakuna Matata', it means no worries (for those of you that haven't seen the film). Now, matured into an adult lion, Simba (now voiced by Matthew Broderick) is living a carefree life until his childhood friend Nala discovers him and begs him to return to Pride Rock and reclaim his birthright. At first Simba declines, but with a little persuasion, Simba returns for the final showdown with the uncle that destroyed his life so many years ago.    I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Lion King\\" as a child, and even now as an adult the movie still excites me from start to finish. What is so surprising about this movie is just how strong the story is, and for a kid's movie it is much more adult oriented than one might expect. The themes that are dealt with in \\"The Lion King\\" are still relatively new to animated features, with a focus on loss, the meaning of life, destiny, and betrayal, which are all very adult concepts, and sure they've been featured in animated films before, but not to this extent where each of those elements are the prominent aspects of the story. Kudos to the writers for dealing with each of those themes in such a way to not make light of them, but also to not bog the movie down to be so dramatically heavy that kids wouldn't enjoy it. Don't get me wrong; though the story does deal with some heavy topics and intense drama, it isn't short on humor either. The comedy in this movie is some of the best Disney has ever delivered, aimed at both children and adults this movie simply works on every level.    Another aspect to the storytelling, and is the part that surprised me the most, is just how much I enjoyed the songs of the film. Disney is famous for including songs in almost every one of their animated films, generally I like one or two, but the rest kind of bore me (though not enough to detract from the movie experience); however, in the case of \\"The Lion King\\" the songs are so well-written and catchy, and perfectly resonate each of the various tones and themes of themovie, that I can't help but enjoy all them. From the epic opening song \\"The Circle of Life\\" to the robust, fun-loving \\"Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" to the heartwarming \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\", each and every song is memorable, and serves to elevate each of the scenes they correspond with, making them some of the most beloved scenes within the entire movie.    The vocal performances in the movie continue the tradition of excellence that Disney has always managed when it came to the voice actors. Each actor/actress that voiced one of the many heroes of the film, from James Earl Jones (Darth Vader in the 'Star Wars' films) to Jonathan Taylor Thomas (TV's \\"Home Improvement\\") to Nathan Lane (\\"The Producers\\"), and Matthew Broderick (\\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\"), all bring an individuality, heart, kindness, and strength to their roles. For those characters on the side of villainy, the talented cast members, led by Jeremy Irons (\\"Die Hard With a Vengeance\\") and Whoopi Goldberg (\\"Sister Act\\"), deliver each and every one of their lines with an obvious malice that makes their characters so deliciously evil, yet impossible to resist. Each of the cast members brings such depth to their roles making each character seem so rich and vivid in their portrayal, therefore providing us in the audience with some of the most memorable Disney characters of all time.    \\"The Lion King\\" is quite possibly my favorite Disney animated feature film. From the terrific story that is packed full of humor, drama, tragedy, and triumph, to the expertly crafted artwork that has never been better in any of Disney's previous movies, to the wonderful vocal talents. Everything about \\"The Lion King\\" screams excellence, and the box office returns, critical response, and audiences everywhere agreed that this film is indeed 'King' in every way.    \\"The Lion King\\" is rated G and contains violence.
0060594896|5.0|I stumbled across this title and Jack Canfield after watching The Secret on DVD. Wow! No wonder he has sold so many books. His advice is right on. All you have to do is implement it. It takes time and work, but is certainly well worth the effort.<br /><br />This book is a great guide for anyone who wants to live a fuller, richer, more meaningful and successful life. It's one to leave behind for future generations of your family. Better yet, teach your children and grandchildren these principles while you are still alive - so that you have the pleasure of seeing them reap the benefits.
B000ZK4466|4.0|\\"Frances The Mute\\" will continue to my favorite from this band, nothing comes close. I read on here people complain about them using \\"too much random noise\\" or \\"background sounds\\" but I feel that adds to what made that album so great. This album's positives outweight the negatives most defiently, it'll probably grow on me once it sinks in with each listen. A huge step over their last release.

But what Cliff Robertson's character says to Redford's character at the very end gives me the chills....

1400049628|2.0|'The Zombie Survival Guide' by Max Brooks is a very creative and funny idea. It presents what a person needs to know, do , and have if they are unfortunately placed within a zombie attack/crisis.    I would not call myself a zombie fanatic, but I have seen a bunch of movies over the years. Some good and some really bad. This books is laid out like your typical survival guide. It discusses what tools are needed, how to prepare, choosing your safe house, etc. It also goes into great detail what a zombie is, and how to dispatch them.     Unfortunately, this middle section of the book got too repetitive for me. After reading about the zombies in detail. The book describes how to survive an attack, how to escape and attack, and then how to attack. Each of these sections repeats the same basic information.    The book did pick up a bit in the final section. The section presents a breif 'history' on zombie attacks through the ages. It was interesting and entertaining.    While I enjoyed this book at times, I would only recommend it to true zombie fans. You will enjoy it. Sharpen that machette!
B0000029AL|3.0|Firstly Aerosmith is no classic debut and it is not the best Aerosmith album to start off your collection with. The production is thin, the band are uptight (especially noticable in Tyler's vocals).     However, there are nuggets which give us a taste of what a terrific band Aerosmith are to become. There is the rocking classic; Mama Kin and the still golden Dream On. The excellent Somebody rocks your socks off and the Yardbirds influenced One Way Street is first class and you can't stop tapping your foot to Movin Out.      This is not a great album, but is a good one and well worth a listen.

0465092764|1.0|I am not a PhD in theoretical physics or advanced mathematics, but I have read enough about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology to be very interested in the subject of String theory.  I was particularly drawn to Woit's subject matter because -- based on what I had read by Greene and others -- I felt that there was certainly more to the story.  I had hoped that Woit would provide an interesting, accessible alternate perspective.    Unfortunately, Woit's book ranks among the most inaccessible popular science books I have ever read.  He seems to make little or no effort to help the layman through what is (undoubtedly) an extremely complicated subject.  And while Woit does warn the reader that \\"this next bit could be a bit tricky\\", the caveats do little to diminish the disappointment.  He would have been better served to represent the dynamics of the conflict in modern String theory than the details of its mathematical (and physical) limitations.    A much better book on a similar subject, is Lee Smolin's \\"The Trouble With Physics.\\"  Not only does Smolin write for the true layman, his style is much more even-handed and engaging.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|When I first heard that there was a new movie musical based on classic Beatle songs, the trauma of watching \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" back in the 70s came back to haunt me (and let's pretend that \\"All This and World War II\\" never even happened, mmmkay?)    However, when I found out that the gifted film and stage director Julie Taymor (\\"Titus\\") was at the helm, I decided to, er, give her new piece a chance; and to my pleasant surprise I was treated to the most imaginative, eye-popping screen musical since Baz Luhrmann's \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" breathed new life into the genre back in 2001.    \\"Across the Universe\\" is fundamentally a collection of slickly choreographed production numbers, all propelled by Beatles covers and loosely connected by the requisite \\"boy meets girl\\" motif. Toss in a sprinkling of iconic 60s counterculture references(Vietnam, Leary, Kesey, Owsley, the Weathermen, Hendrix, Joplin, etc.)and voila! Admittedly, the plot is a bit thin; this will likely be a sticking point for those looking for a deeper meditation on the peace love and dope generation.    The story's central character is Jude (Jim Sturgess), a young working class Liverpudlian who stows away illegally to the States in search of his father, an American GI who had a brief wartime fling with his mother. He ends up at Princeton University, where he finds out his father now works as a janitor. Jude soon falls in with Max (Joe Anderson), a free-spirited Ivy League slacker, through whom he meets the love of his life, Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Eventually, the trio decides to \\"drop out\\" and move to Manhattan, where they find an apartment managed by the (sexy!) Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a hippie earth mother archetype who also is an up and coming rock singer (replete with a bluesy Janis Joplin wail). The three roommates are soon sucked into the vortex of 60's turbulence. Max is drafted and shipped to Vietnam;  Lucy throws herself into political activism and the mercurial Jude,stilltrying to find himself, flirts with becoming an artist.    There are some memorable cameos. Joe Cocker belts out a great version of \\"Come Together\\", U-2's Bono dispenses hallucinogens and hams it up as the day tripping Dr. Robert, crooning \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and Eddie Izzard (bearing an eerie resemblance to the late Oliver Reed as he appeared in \\"Tommy\\") cavorts with a chorus line comprised of Pixar-worthy Blue Meanies, to the strains of \\"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\".    Inevitably, a few of the more exuberant numbers recall Milos Forman's 1979 film version of \\"Hair\\". In fact, one could say that some elements of the storyline in \\"Across the Universe\\" recall \\"Hair\\" as well; but I think Taymor is sharp enough to navigate that fine line between \\"inspiration\\" and \\"plagiarism\\" (or as film makers are fond of calling it: \\"paying homage\\"). I also gleaned references to \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Alice's Restaurant\\".    If the film has a weakness, it lies in the casting of the two leads. The character of Jude, as written, holds many obvious parallels to the life of John Lennon; the Liverpool roots, the estranged father, the creative angst and inherent cynicism. Jude's NYC apartment and his eventual deportation is undoubtedly a reference to Lennon's later visa issues. Sturgess doesn't quite have the depth that a more seasoned actor might have put into those particular elements of the Jude character. Wood sleepwalks through the film as well; it's a disappointing follow-up to her acclaimed performance in \\"Thirteen\\".    At the end of the day, however, we must keep in mind that this is, after all, a musical. Audiences seem to be much more forgiving about rote line readings when there's lots of good singin' and dancin'. Even a genuine genre classic like \\"West Side Story \\" had weaknesses on that front; Richard Beymer was no Brando, and Natalie Wood could have used a better  dialect coach. But what do people remember most about that film? The fantastic choreography and the incredible musicscore. And do you want to know the best part about \\"Across the Universe\\"? The Bee Gees are nowhere to be seen.
B000ZM1MGE|4.0|Midnight Express - coming out in '78 - gave us a cinematic view into the Middle East that the three-network evening news at the time didn't provide. The clash of cultures and values in this movie really stood in contrast to the \\"malaise\\" period in America (as Jimmy Carter put it). The film became more relevant when it was on television a few years later during the Iranian hostage crisis, with the clash of cultures playing out in real life. The idea of hell being a \\"Turkish prison\\" was popularized with this movie. Also the idea that America's post 60's values had become trivial compared to a world much older than it's just celebrated bicentennial. I think Alan Parker really made his mark with his direction of this movie. I followed many of his later efforts on the strength of this film. It's both brutally real and hallucinatory at the same time. There's a feeling of relief at the end of this movie like no other \\"prison escape\\" movie. The film is also notable as being one of Oliver Stone's early efforts as a screenwriter. This new dvd effort should improve on the 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, which came out in the \\"early authored\\" dvd days of 1998. There are few more extras on this edition so it's a worthy upgrade and a definite must have if one is looking for a film that's an insight to the time, the cultures and even some perspective on where we are now.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you lived during the 60's or just love that time in history, this is the movie for you. Having lived in Ohio, Washington DC and New York City during this time, I never thought about how the Beatles music touched my life and experiences because there was so much going on. When you're watching the movie it is a perfect marriage of history and music. The music, colors, news reels, Vietnam clips smack you in the face with the smell feel and taste of that era. It's a beautifully done move, the first time it got me on an emotional level and the second time it captured my mind, spirit and heart. Awesome is an over used word, but it fits the scope of this fabulous film.

B000001FFJ|5.0|One thing you need to know about Tom Waits is that you can't have just one of his albums.  Not because at so many of his records on this site are labeled Essential Recording (those don't mean ______ remember?).  It's true, if you get hooked on this guy, you will need more of Tom Waits.  Chances are, if you really like albums like Rain Dogs and Bone Machine, don't hesitate to dig deeper into the library of Tom Waits, he's got quite a bit. True, all of his albums may not be winners for you (or me), but that's what sound samples are for (as well as listener reviews, but they shouldn't be your main source for wanting to buy albums).<br /><br />Regardless if you like Tom Waits or not, you got to give the man props for getting such a rabid fanbase and a voice that no one else can match.  Indeed, there will never be a singer like Tom Waits.  And he's on top form during the 80's.<br /><br />The term Rain Dogs refers to a dog who has lost all scents from the rain and can't get home, and the whole album are about those people like those dogs.  Signapore, Cemetary Polka, Anywhere I lay My Head, Downtown Train, and Rain Dogs are all about the following. Indeed, the lyrics on here are fantastic as usual, he creates a character that you can't help but like.  It's another one of those albums that don't have lyrics about one certain thing that's so obvious.  Some will open your imagination, while some are quite unexplainable.  But those characters are all rain dogs.  It's got imagery that will conjure up as well.  Really, how could you go wrong?<br /><br />The best thing is the music, of course.  It's got the signature Tom Waits blues and country, but some of the songs are more than that.  Clap Hands, Cemetary Polka, Midtown, Signapore.  Talk about unconvential.  I do love the way Cemetary Polka sounds like a carnival song, Signapore's Sea Shanty.  Indeed, there's a perfect balance of totally listenable and cryptic music.  No matter what his band does, it works.  I tip my hat off to Marc Ribot's guitar playing.  Love his playing.<br /><br />Oh, and you got Tom's voice, as emotional and ruff as you want it.  I think that goes without saying, his voice is incredible.  Eat your heat out, disney.  You'll never touch the way real singers do.<br /><br />I'll say one thing bad, Downtown Train is a musical disaster.  Not only is the song rather weak (Wait's version), Rod Steward killed it.  Thankfully, all the other tracks make up for it.  It's nearly an hour, anyway.<br /><br />It's common these days that the word singer/songwriter ain't exactly that powerful.

B000ZOXDFA|2.0|Alas and anon...just when you thought it was safe to assemble an armada and go back into the water, someone goes and produces another costumer concerning a certain virgin queen. Bollywood director Shekhar Kapur has re-enlisted co-conspirators Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush for one more go at the old girl in \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\".    Picking up a few decades hence from where he left off in his outstanding 1998 film \\"Elizabeth\\", which depicted the ascendancy of the title character, Kapur cheekily condenses a turbulent and historically significant 4-year period (1585-1588) during the reign of Elizabeth I into what appears to be a rather eventful week in the life of HRM.    As the film opens, we are introduced to a much more wary and care-worn monarch (an alarmingly thin Blanchett) holding court over England's destiny. Gone is the radiant, rosy-cheeked and free-spirited \\"Bess\\" who lit up the screen in the previous film; she has been replaced by a mercurial, slightly paranoid monarch who is constantly on guard against duplicitous well-wishers and sycophants. Even her closest confidants are kept at arm's length, especially her Machiavellian \\"spymaster\\", Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).     The Queen has two big headaches keeping her on edge. The first is her cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland (Samantha Morton, in a fiercely intense performance) who feels she is the rightful heir to the English throne, not the childless [...]  Elizabeth (who is a Protestant to boot). Mary has some influential Catholic sympathizers at home and abroad, including the other royal pain in Elizabeth's derriere, King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla), who gets his jollies jeering at the English queen and rattling his saber.    Elizabeth finds a temporary distraction from all her political woes when the dashing adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, in all his rangy glory) strolls into her court, full of tales and loaded with booty from his latest excursion to the New World. Elizabethis obviously charmed, but has to suppress her schoolgirl crush for sake of appearances. However, when she learns that Raleigh has fathered a child and secretly eloped with her favorite chambermaid, Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish) she is not so amused, and gives him a nice cozy jail cell to explore for a few years. Not to worry, however-history intervenes and the Queen pardons Raleigh in time to put him in charge of naval defenses in the year of the Armada (1588), which fuels the film's climatic battle scenes.    I have to warn you, this is one of those \\"historical\\" epics where you have to make a decision going in whether you are going to nitpick and get cranky and argumentative over factual inaccuracies and behavioral anachronisms, or just sit back for two hours and enjoy the opulent pageantry and bodice-ripping court intrigue with a $#!+-eating  grin on your face. Keep in mind that the screenplay was authored by William Nicholson, who scripted the (very) loose re-interpretation of the Camelot legend, \\"First Knight\\" and Michael Hirst, who wrote several episodes of Showtime's recent mini-series about Henry VIII, \\"The Tudors\\". In other words, this ain't \\"Masterpiece Theater\\", folks.    Kapur does seem indecisive at times; it's as if he wasn't sure whether he wanted to make an updated version of \\"Fire Over England\\" (which depicted Elizabeth and Raleigh embroiled in court intrigue in the year of the Armada) or pay homage to \\"The Sea Hawk\\" (the swashbuckling action scenes featuring Owens in full Errol Flynn mode will definitely make history majors twitch). Nicholson and Hirst's dialogue fuels some spirited exchanges between Blanchett and Owen in the first half of the film that reminded me of the clever repartee from \\"Shakespeare in Love \\", but it ultimately clashes with some of the heavier moments later on (Samantha Morton nearly steals the movie in her execution scene, but it seems to belong in a completely different and darker-toned film).    If you are a fan of thegenre, you will likely be pleased. Blanchett is   excellent in the lead role, and Owen is charismatic as always. Rush is good, although his character is a bit one-dimensional (not his fault). One thing for sure-this should be the last of Liz the First for a while. Right? Tell me there isn't another one in pre-production. Prithee, tell me.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album is unlike any Linkin Park album to date.  With less rap and heavy metal rifts, and more meloncholy, sophistocated lyrics, melodies, and messages.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Set against the heady turbulence of the late 60s, when flower power met the thwack of police billy clubs, when the Vietnam War raged and inner cities burned, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is an miraculous marriage of cutting-edge visuals, heart-warming performances, 1960s history and the Beatles songbook. And most remarkably, it's not dated; the stories could be happening now, (and in fact, they are.)<br /><br />For a film that is almost wall to wall music, it has a full-bodied plot. The characters, (mostly named after Beatles songs), include Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), who moves from middle America to New York; Jude (Jim Sturgess), a Liverpool ship welder who works his way to New York on a ship, and Lucy's brother, Max (Joe Anderson), a college student who apparently has dropped out. They now all share a pad in Greenwich Village with their musician friends, the Jimi Hendrix-like Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy), the Joplinesque Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and the lovelorn Prudence (T.V. Carpio), who loves women but doesn't feel free to express her true feelings.<br /><br /> And then there are trippy little guest turns from Joe Cocker, Bono, Eddie Izzard, Salma Hayek to name a few. Not to mention the ghosts of Timothy Leary and Neal Cassady, whooshing about in tinted glasses and paisley hankies, their names changed to protect the brain-fried.<br /><br />Jude and Lucy fall in love, and they all go through a hippie period on Dr. Robert's (Bono) Magic Bus. They also receive guidance from Mr. Kite (Izzard). But things turn serious as Max goes off to Vietnam and the story gets swept up in the anti-war movement.<br /><br />While almost everything happens as an illustration to a Beatles song, the arrangements are sometimes radically altered, and often the actors brilliantly find a mood in a song that we never realized was even there before. Director Julie Taymor, (Broadway's THE LION KING), is a generously inventive choreographer, such as in a basic-training scene where all the drill sergeants look like G.I. Joe; a sequence where inductees in Jockey shorts carry the Statue of Liberty through a Vietnam field, and cross-cutting between dancing to Beatles clone bands at an American high school prom and in a Liverpool dive bar. There are underwater sequences which approach ballet, a stage performance that turns into musical warfare, strawberries that bleed, rooftop concerts and a montage combining crashing waves with the Detroit riots.<br /><br />But there's beauty in the execution. and the experience of the movie is joyous. Some of these songs (now more than 40 years old) are absolutely timeless, and hearing these unexpected talented actors singing them only underlines their astonishing quality.<br /><br />You'll want to watch ACROSS THE UNIVERSE again and again.re inductees in Jockey shorts carry the Statue of Liberty through a Vietnam field, and cross-cutting between dancing to Beatles clone bands at an American high school prom and in a Liverpool dive bar.

B00005JMJG|5.0|This was probably the most enjoyable Jim Carrey movie I've ever seen, despite the fact that it's much more down to Earth than many of his other roles. Yes, it's still got comedy, but it's a lot different than what most people have come to expect from Carrey, and I think that's a major strength of the film. This was a semi-serious role and I feel it was executed beautifully. Jim Carrey really is a magnificent actor (as some of his more recent works have shown) and I think a lot of that began to shine through in this film.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film to Carrey fans or anyone that's into the whole romantic comedy genre. While not strictly a comedy, this film is still going to appeal to a wide audience and is definitely worth checking out, even if you don't typically like Jim Carrey films.
B00004YA66|4.0|I'll say this first off; I really like this movie a lot.  When I first saw it in the theater I was in awe with it.  Sure, I'm not in `awe' anymore, but after watching this movie again last night for like the twentieth time I can definitely say that it still warms my heart.  I still get that same feeling every time I hear that Garth Brooks song start to play in the closing of this film; the tears welling in the eyes and this overwhelming happiness comes over me.  That said I must admit that this movie has its detractors, they just aren't enough to make me forsake the entire experience.<br /><br />The concept behind `Frequency' is one we've seen done many times before and after.  The idea of changing the past is something that intrigues all of us I'm sure since there isn't one person on the face of the planet without regrets.  So here we have John Sullivan; a thirty-six year old man who lost his father thirty years ago in a fire.  His father Frank was a brave fireman who died saving a young girl from a burning warehouse.  This tragedy has destroyed John.  He walks around like a zombie with no cares in life whatsoever.  He still lives in his father's house, the house he grew up in, the house he never left.  It's interesting to me that his mother has since moved out but John stays behind, maybe further addressing the fact that John is the only one who has never moved on or recovered from his fathers death.  He stays in the past in everyway possible.  One night his best friend's son finds Frank's old ham radio and after tinkering with it John finds that he is able to contact a familiar voice from the past, his father.  He soon realizes that he has the opportunity to save his father, to rewrite the past but when he does his future is also rewritten.<br /><br />One thing that I love about `Frequency' is that it works at being a better film than it could have been.  It could have merely been a film about a son contacting his dead father and working to save his life, but it does more than that.  With an intricately woven sub-plot involving a serial killer from the past who was never caught `Frequency' manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats throughout the running time.  That is a huge plus.  It adds layers of intensity that would not have been there otherwise.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, Quaid steals the show.  I've always been a fan of this man.  He's a very talented actor who never gets the credit or the film roles he deserves.  He grabs a hold of Frank Sullivan with all he has and delivers the standout performance here.  He masters his accent beautifully, which is essential in this type of role.  Elizabeth Mitchell likewise delivers a beautiful performance.  She shows a lot of depth even though she has limited screen time and is obviously taking a backseat to the two leading men.  Shawn Doyle also delivers, sending shivers down my spine as the suspected killer, and Andre Braugher pulls off an impressive supporting performance as Satch DeLeon, Frank's close friend and John's eventual boss.<br /><br />The biggest detractor for me though is James Caviezel.  I've never been too impressed with this actor but here he manages to bore me to tears.  I feel nothing from him.  His `depressed' John is so overly dramatized that he comes across irritating and unsympathetic.  I don't understand why anyone would want to be around him.  He's gloomy and moody and whiney and just a complete and utter mess.  James could have played him differently, could have played him better.  Sure, after he rescues his father he changes his demeanor a bit but it's too little too late for me.  The second half of his performance is far better than the first, I will say that.<br /><br />`Frequency' manages though to still hold merit with me.  It's a much deeper film than it lets on to be and has the ability to touch the heart and warm the soul.  The final moments of the film, filled with this heart racing intensity are flawlessly performed and only add weight to the emotionally uplifting baseball game that closes this touching family film.  `Frequency' is a film about love and loss and that desired reconnection with loved ones; a chance to right wrongs and make better decision; a film about getting the chance to live again the consequences and responsibilities that lie within that chance.  In that respect `Frequency' works on a much greater level than one might expect and deserves to be seen and admired and talked about.nally uplifting baseball game that closes this touching family film.  `Frequency' is a film about love and loss and that desired reconnection with loved ones; a chance to right wrongs and make better decision; a film about getting the chance to live again the consequences and responsibilities that lie within that chance.

B000002ADT|5.0|I think the main thing I have to say about Kind of Blue is that I'm an idiot for having taken  so long to buy this album. Yes it's probably one of the best selling jazz albums of all time and it is to Jazz what Bob Marley's Legend is to reggae meaning that your average layman will appreciate and enjoy this cd while someone who has a taste for jazz, Miles or just some great chill out music will be smiling around the third or fourth time in a row they listen to the album. If you've ever wanted to know what greatness is, feel free to just buy this album, otherwise, miss out on one of the greatest albums to ever grace your stereo and make you appreciate your sense of hearing all that much more.
0812975219|2.0|The book has some good points and interesting thoughts but it is difficult to get by how much the author clearly thinks he is better then anyone else. This book is a way for him to get on his soap box and proclaim his greatness.  Some of the points are thought provoking but all of value can be covered in many fewer pages.
630460291X|5.0|Ok, Kevin Costner is no Robin Hood. But I utterly adore this movie anyway. And its all thanks to the brilliant Alan Rickman. He made and saved this film. Without him, could you imagine what this movie would look like? I shudder to even think it...  The first time I saw this I was quite young so I never really understood why Costner didn't even attempt an English Accent. Now, I'm actually appaulled by that fact. However, I really really don't want a remake, because Alan most likely will not be in it, and hence, its utterly pointless. Still, even with Costner, the movie is quite enjoyable. It has enough action and romance to satisfy just about anyone.
1594481717|5.0|In \\"A Whole New Mind\\" Daniel Pink introduces a new way of thinking which will improve the future and help people be more productive in their professional work environment as well as in their personal lives.   Pink starts off by explaining the change from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age. Today, people still rely on their L-directed thinking. But as time goes by the world is changing more and more, including the major fields such as science, technology and arts. These changes bring higher demands, but the question is \\"Are there enough supplies?\\"      In his first three chapters, the author explains how nothing is really impossible if people think the right way and make the proper decisions. Asia, as the name itself says, is about the continent where all the work that is done in America can be performed for less time and money. Western world's biggest competitors will soon outsource many jobs because they can carry them out at a much cheaper cost and without expecting high salaries. Very few jobs require the usage of creativity in their process. People do the same work that a computer can perform without any extraordinary efforts and store the information forever.  This is the concept of the shift towards the Conceptual age which is also one of the author's main points. It does not necessarily mean that people who do not use their right brain skills as much as their left ones will fail. But it rather shows us the way to combine those skills in order to develop a \\"higher level\\" of thinking.     The answer to the phenomenon \\"Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future\\" lies in the second part of the book which addresses the approach to the new way of thinking. This includes 6 basic senses; Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning, which are basically aptitudes mostly related to the right brain. The author considers them to be the key to ones the success when combined to the functions of the left brain.   Design is the ability to do the best you can out of a task that you are given to perform, and still stay within the frame, meaning that the purpose and function of the product should clearly appeal to the others. Telling stories is sometimes the best way to express yourself and it is also the most efficient way to remember something. As weird as it may sound, the concept of telling stories is what people in the modern world are looking for. The next sense, Symphony, is all about relationships; see the big picture and think about the relation of the details. Empathy is a very \\"feeling-related\\" sense. It is basically about \\"being in ones shoes\\". It means to deeply understand someone and to be able to emphasize with what they are going through. Play is about being happy by not just achieving success in the work place, but also being spontaneous and to laugh as much as one can. Meaning is to know yourself, your abilities, your goals, and to believe in them with all your heart.     In a few words, Pink's message is that if these concepts are mixed together and also applied in combination with other L-directed thinking, a new social, political, and economic revolution is about to begin.  \\"A Whole New Mind\\" is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. If you want to know more about the future you can read about history or technology. If you look for something interesting and exciting, you might as well watch the discovery channel. Whenever you feel the need to relax you can find comfort in arts. But this book is the perfect combination of all of the qualities above. It is enjoyable as well as helpful because it opens up a new horizon; it directs the path to a new way of thinking which will rule the world in the future, whether we want it or not. \\"A Whole New Mind\\" helps one starting to shape his/her \\"whole new mind\\" by making a smooth shift in evaluating the skills which many of us do not know to be in possession of.
0061547832|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Donald Trump's enthusiasm for life leaps off the page and is infectious. This is a man who loves his job his family and friends.  His secrets for success are passion and integrity.   He lives his life fully, dreams big, and encourages his readers to go for life with gusto.  He believes that everything matters; from the huge real estate deals to the right shade of trim in a room, it all matters. This high-powered businessman writes of \\"riding the waves\\" of daily experiences and staying present for all life has to offer.     Living life with honesty and integrity reminds me of [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This powerful book is filled with   stories of wisdom and truth that are inspirational as well as practical.  It's possible to live fully in the brilliance of the moment and have a magical life, instantaneously! Both of these books move me to live fully and embrace the gifts life has to offer.
0689837380|4.0|The Grace kids and their mom are looking for a fresh start after the divorce.  At the invitation of realatives they move to the dilapidated country estate of a distant aunt who is in an insane asylum.  Mallory, Jered, and Simon quickly discover that they are surrounded by a world they never imagined exists and the legacy of the family compels them to delve deep into the secrets of their great-uncle, Arthur Spiderwick who has written a field guide to the world of fairies.  Adventure ensues and lots of fun is had.<br /><br />This book is just plain fun.  The story is simply written, but not dumbed down.  Young readers will keep up and be challenged with new vocabulary as well as issues they can discuss with their parents.  Parents should read this first as there are some less than ideal modes of communication between the kids (lots of \\"Shut up!\\" and one instance of \\"Crappy!\\").  The drawings are delightful and add to the \\"field guide\\" motif.  I look forward to adding the next book to our library!
B00005N5S5|4.0|This movie is thrilling and truly kicked off the Sci-Fi genre. You can say all you want about his acting skills, but Terminator would not be as awesome without Arnold Schwarzenegger. Its just a fact. He pretty much is the reason to see this film.
0345494997|3.0|Horan has published, at times, a stunning book.  A number of passages are well worth a second reading.  Unfortunately, this was, primarily, at the beginning of the novel, and her writing style did not sustain throughout her story.  I found the plight of Ms. Cheney, somewhat, compelling. [Interesting that a woman is currently running for President!] However, I could not empathize with her since she chose to leave her children.  Wright is not portrayed as lovable.  As a matter of fact, his rather severe mood swings offer a portrait, as it were, of perhaps someone with bi-polar problems.  Overall, I was disappointed with \\"Loving Frank\\" and would have difficulty recommending the purchase of this book.  Get thee to a library -- perhaps, less disappointing as a costless read.
B00005JPXY|4.0|I went to see this movie right after a visit of a modern art museum. This movie caught me still in a creative mode/mind so I give it 3.5.<br /><br />The scenario begins with a lost-and-found tape recording a party of the protagonist's friends as a spider-liked monster spawns its attack in NYC.<br /><br />The whole movie is presented by a video camera with an amazing battery life and features with a night vision?! Inevitably, you will experience some motion sickness while watching this flick as well as a mind-twist--a theme of this movie. Friendship? Romance? Or a 911 of a mutation monster?<br />At the end, it even leaves a clue for a sequel in the video tape, and I can't help but wonder what would that be? Another video taping story?<br /><br />The credit should give to this brave director who makes it fun to watch as if it's a virtual reality SciFi game and laugh about several lame actions and conversations.

The copyright protection on the disc is such that not only can you not rip the CD to your hard drive or an MP3 player, you can't even play it at all on a computer.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with a CD I can't return because the packaging is open.  I don't own a boom box (...who does anymore?), so essentially this a greatest hits coaster.<br /><br />Save your money and buy the tracks you like from a legal MP3 source and make your own greatest hits CD.
B00003CXDV|3.0|I am an Alan Rickman lover, and I do not watch Tim Allen anything. So Alan won over and I watched this film. It was kind of annoying at first, and well, any time Allen was on camera, but as soon as Sigourney Weaver and Mr. Rickman joined in, it was kinda fun. Sam rockwell had a great small part too. This is basically a spoof of Star Trek and science fiction films, which normally wouldn't interest me, but I must say, it definitley had its moments.
0765318741|3.0|Aside from I Am Legend which after watching both movies based on this book I deem \\"The Omega Man\\" to follow the book much closer then \\"I am Legend.\\"  Easy to read and enjoyable.  Good story.  Following I am Legend are 10 short stories.  Strange and interesting.  Some of the prose is rich and wordy, a huge difference in writing style then I am Legend.  Weird and creepy are some. Was dissapointed at first that half way through the book the story ended then there was this \\"other stuff\\" however I have found the reading of these other short stories to be quite entertaining.  Because of these I will pass this book to my daughter.

Co-starring Catherine Hicks and Michael Barryman (\\"The Original Hills Have Eyes\\"), this is one of the best movies of the popular Sci-fi movie series. The direction by Leonard Nimoy is very good and it has humor such as the memorable and hilarious scene where Spock confronts a punk using the Vulcan neck-pinch, excellent special effects, good acting and how the Enterprise crew are trying to get along well in the 80's especially good pacing. It's a wonderful finale to the Trilogy that started with Star Trek II and ended nicely with this one, i strongly recommend this movie for fans of ST, sci-fi and even the whole family for some intergalactic fun.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD Collector's Edition has excellent picture and sound with some great extras like an audio commentary from Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner, Text commentary from Michael and Denise Okuda co-authors of the Star Trek Encyclopedia. Featurettes, Tributes, Storyboards, Production Gallery, Interviews and Trailer.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|I am a big Tim Burton fan, but couldn't really get into this movie. It had spectacular imagery and the acting was wonderful, but story-wise, it didn't really grab my attention and turned out to be dissapointing. Some of the characters were interesting, some annoying and pointless. I definitely liked the 'stories' parts of the film more enjoyable than the present times scenes. I think those dragged the film down. Its sort of a depressing movie when you think about it. I guess you could categorize this as a fantastical drama. At least that is the closest thing that I could think of.

B000TM1CKQ|4.0|SPOILERS alert...especially IF you haven't seen the first season.<br /><br />So this is Season 2 of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, and, thank the almighty chewtoy, they haven't let up on the funny. For me, the first season snuck up, although it didn't take too long before it became my current top sitcom. What sold me was the combination of great character dynamics, the off-beat, sometimes snarky humor, and that whiff of romance (that dude Ted can carry a hell of a torch). This gang were folks I could relate to - yes, even Barney, the unapologetically self-absorbed misogynist who still somehow wormed into my good graces. And, actually, even Barney came thru for his buds when the chips were down.<br /><br />The premise of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER states that Ted, sometime in the future, will meet the woman of his dreams. In Season 2 Bob Saget returns to reprise his voice-over role of future Ted as he persists in regaling his kids with the convoluted story of how he met their mother. What the show tantalizingly fails to reveal is the mom's identity, and the how and the when. And Season 2 keeps us in suspense. Starting with last season's finale and leading into the Season 2 opener, things have changed some. Lily and likable goof Marshall are no longer engaged, and Marshall is extremely resentful. But Ted and Robin are now an item. Barney, though, is still a raging womanizer. This status quo would remain for several episodes. The show makes no bones about Robin not being the mother of future Ted's kids, so, it was a fun yet bittersweet time watching Robin and Ted go thru the ups and downs of their romance.<br /><br />In a very good sophomore season, most of the episodes are solid and several sparkle. \\"Slap Bet\\" (my favorite, and, it seems, everyone else's) dredges up something embarassing from Robin's past, as well as introduces a wagering system paid up in vicious slaps. \\"Ted Mosby, Architect\\" focuses on Robin's disdain for Ted's vocational small talk and on Barney handing Ted a great pick-up line, which he then runs away with. In \\"Swarley\\" Barney, to his dismay, is saddled with a nickname (for [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] fans, Morena Baccarin guest stars as Marshall's crazy-eyed date). Finally, \\"Showdown\\" has Barney competing in The Price Is Right and meeting his dad, Bob Barker.<br /><br />Pretty good special features here: The gag reel is definitely worth checking out; there's the 17-minute-long \\"How We Make Your Mother\\" segment in which key scenes are shown in read thrus, in rehearsal, and, finally, in the actual shooting (this one showcases a truly awesome moment for two of the extras); commentaries on 7 episodes (\\"Where Were We,\\" \\"Swarley,\\" \\"Slap Bet,\\" \\"Single Stamina,\\" \\"Arrivederci Fiero,\\" \\"Bachelor Party,\\" and \\"Showdown\\"); additional scenes for \\"Moving Day\\" (more of Barney's Top Ten list, hilarious!), \\"Showdown\\" (Barney's Best Man speech), and \\"Bachelor Party\\" (extra footage of the adult entertainer, but it's not all that); the wonderfully cheesy Robin Sparkles video in its entirety; and the weird \\"Hey Beautiful\\" video, which contains the show's hummable theme tune (I say \\"weird\\" because the video borrows clips from the show and then superimposes lips singing the song lyrics over the mouths of the show's characters).<br /><br />HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER is a well-constructed show and effortlessly navigates a spectrum of tones, from madcap to poignant, from romantic to subversive. The likable cast maintains its comfy chemistry, although the go-to guy for laughs remains the pitch perfect Neil Patrick Harris and his outrageously weasely character Barney. If nothing else, Barney's certainly introduced into the sitcom lexicon phrases such as \\"Suit up\\" and \\"Awesome!\\" Oh, and one more.

B00005JMFQ|3.0|Comedies are not my thing. And anything labeled a romantic comedy has me cringing. But the cast of this film had me curious. Its all actors I admire. And I must say, its a unique type of movie. Its not overly funny and its not really angsty. But it deals with so many different emotions and events, its just great to sit back and enjoy it as a whole. I know this will be one of those Christmas classics that people watch every year.
B000MQ54OY|3.0|Saw this movie originaly in theaters and I remember leaving not knowing if I had liked it or not.  The `real life yet cartoony' feel to the character's animation threw me off after being use to Disney's many reformed animals but it grew on me.    The story line was rather lacking.  I find myself wanting to watch the movie more for the music and dance than for the story itself.  I like to listen to music or have a movie playing in the background while I'm playing video games and this quickly became a `background movie' that I'd listen to or turn and watch for my few favorite dances while I'm playing or cleaning.    The music was well done.  They seamlessly meshed many different songs that still sounded great.  The singers' voices (except Mumble's) are amazing.  I often find myself singing along during the movie or carrying the songs around in my head during the work day.    The characters are believable.  Mumble is not `strong' in character as many protagonists are however I wouldn't be surprised to meet him down the street (provided he was human).  I love the interaction of Ramon and his crew.    The animation is amazing.  Characters and items have a `weight' (they do not float) they are detailed down to the feathers.  Everything moves.  The `background' penguins all have a personality of their own, singing moving or dancing.  The \\"real\\" film of people is seamless with the animation.  Overall the animation is very believable, I was impressed with the amount of detail they put into it.    For kids this is a great movie.  Singing and dancing penguins what more do you want!  I would suggest this to anyone who has kids under High School.      For adults it's a bit of a drag.  the only real drive to watch this is the music and the dance.
B000QUCNOK|2.0|I was sort of into this film at first. It had an interesting premise and I love Alan Rickman so I really wanted to see this. I had read that some people really dug it and some couldn't stand it. Well, now I know why. It gets very bizaar at the end where I sort of looked at my husband and we had equal looks of 'what the heck is going on here'. It was all just very odd in a disturbing and ridiculous way. I think that ruined the film for me. I mean, it had a few things going for it, but then what happens hits you like a ton a bricks and it all feels like a wasted effort.
B00005UW7G|3.0|Although the colors are a bid faded, this is a beautifully shot movie.  The scenery is very pleasing, and the acting is superb.  The real downfall of the film is the sound.  It's as if they were singing into tin cans to burn the sound onto records.  At times, it's almost acceptable, then something happens and it's horrible again.  This really is a pity, because with good sound this would truly be an excellent, cinematic opera production.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Its so rare for the sequel to be better or even as good as the original. But T2 certainly accomplishes that. Its just as powerful and entertaining as the first, and the effects are incredible for that time. I'm in awe of it today.

B000053VAF|5.0|This is my favorite comedy ever. Its ingenious and utterly hilarious, even if what we're all laughing at is completely immoral or innapropriate. Jay and Silent Bob alone are worth watching it. I cant even pinpoint one part of this film that isn't funny. And by funny, I don't mean your standard pornographic/vulgar type humour-this is a smart comedy that you actually have to listen to to truly understand its brilliance. There have been alot of objections to this film. I know people that will not watch it because of the subject matter. Those people are missing out-big time.

In the beginning the conversation is cleverly fawning but quickly evolves into something else - something more directly acquisitory.<br /><br />I think this is an important book for Americans to read since what we have is a conversation, although only one side is heard, between American culture and the elements within the moderate Islamic world that feel increasingly alienated from that world, and who for many complicated reasons find themselves drawn to the world of Islamic fundamentalism.<br /><br />Now more than ever we must abandon parochialism.

B000KX0IOK|4.0|In an interesting self-penned piece on the making of this film that appeared in IFC (the Independent Film Channel magazine) in 2006, director Ryan Fleck talks about the film's title, mentioning that half-nelson is a wrestling position that gives the grappler upon whom that position is imposed some hope for escape. This is the concept Fleck wanted to convey in this film, and he's done that, for sure.<br /><br />As schoolteacher Dan Dunne, Ryan Gosling is superb, playing a young man who simultaneously challenges his inner city history students with concepts no other teacher would even dare think of (Hegel's dialectics), yet at the same time addicted to freebase crack cocaine. When one of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), discovers his addiction, an unusual relationship develops between the two, made all the more powerful by the fact that Drey is not your usual inner city student, but really smart--both intellectually and streetwise.<br /><br />In many movies, it would be the male lead that carries the film; thus, in Half Nelson, the viewer is initially expecting that Gosling will be the primary focus and shoulder the burden of insuring that the scenes are as strong as they can be. But that's not the case here. While Gosling is indeed extremely good in his role, newcomer Shareeka Epps is brilliant, just as strong if not stronger than Gosling in screen presence, and carrying way more than her share of the responsibility for this being a four-star movie.<br /><br />The third wheel is Anthony Mackie who plays a friendly drug dealer in the movie's setting, south central Los Angeles, and while he's also very good, it's really Epps and Gosling who drive Half Nelson. Mackie's character helps out Drey because Drey's brother is in jail and is a good friend of the drug dealer. Ironically, Drey's mother is a security guard.<br /><br />Schoolteacher Dunne more than recognizes the irony of him teaching dialectics, one of whose central concepts is the synthesis of opposites, to a class of kids who are subjected to the temptations of weakness every day. The irony, of course, is that Dunne himself is a convergence of strength and weakness--great teacher and also drug addict. And, as we see, Drey herself embodies this convergence as well, although not to the same extent that Dan does. She's a tough kid, but also recognizes the good in people. She knows Dan is good, but at the same time sees his weakness. She herself knows what good is, but at the same time engages in behavior that she ultimately sees as bad.<br /><br />This is a superior film, a riveting character study in which the two leads know exactly who their characters are--know exactly what, in fact, the complexities of those characters are--and play them brilliantly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.to the temptations of weakness every day.

B000002KOG|5.0|Man I love this album. I own the original pressing of this one, and have it on CD. What strange magic Neil created on this one. Mood and warmth with a strange saddness. So many great tracks. It is almost forgotten in the shadow of everthing after \\"Nowhere\\". You have to go back and listen to the more subtle, truly solo offering from Neil right out of the Springfield era.
B000VT6FAO|4.0|As on Paper Monsters, Mr. Gahan's generally weak song writing is saved by production.  Every once in a while Dave manages to nail a good, catchy tune ('Kingdom' definitely being the highlight on this release), but it's the amazing production that really makes his two solo albums worth buying.  If lyrics and melodies are more important to you then sonic atmosphere, you'll probably want to skip this one, as Dave Gahan has given us more than another handful of slow, awkward songs.  I know many of us are very quick to forgive him, though, being the face and voice of our beloved Depeche Mode.  If you're on the fence, just listen to the song samples - pretty much what you hear is what you get.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I first have to state that I haven't yet read the novel. I own it - but haven't read it. I am however, a HUGE fan of Ms. Austen's works and the films based upon her works. And I'm a huge fan of the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.<br /><br />I LOVE this more recent version - and it may surpass the other in my heart. The main reason is that I believe that the choices made to give the viewer a clearer and deeper understanding of the backstory, past events, and other histories of other characters work tremendously well in emphasizing the pain that each of the leads is going through. For example, no matter how many times I'd seen the 1995 version I had NO idea that Anne had actually been engaged to Frederick and then broke it off. I merely thought that she'd let herself be courted and then refused him. It wasn't made clear. It is very clear in this newer version that guilt and pain that Anne carries is tied to her betrayal as well as why Frederick would try so desperately to ignore her and perhaps hurt her by courting [or giving the appearance of courting] for one for of the Musgrove girls.<br /><br />I also like seeing more of Frederick's side of things in conversations with his best friend Harvell. I like receiving a more descriptive insight just to the true character of William Elliot and his desire to be a baronet. I though that the 2 leads had fantastic chemistry and Anthony Head brought an interesting menace to his foppish role. Elizabeth Elliot was miscast - she was too old and not pretty enough. Why could they not find Rosamund Pike - who was so perfectly cast as Jane in the 2005 version of P&P? She would have been wonderful I believe!<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT!!****<br /><br />I know many have issues with the changes of the delivery of the letter, the conversation with Harvell and the constancy of men vs. women, as well as Anne desperately looking for Frederick. I however, do not. I loved the way they were handled in 1995 of course - but still enjoy and love how our lovers get together in the end. And while I understand that readers are shocked to see that they would show Anne - a lady of elegance - running down several streets; I think it only adds to the determination and passion that Anne is feeling for not letting her second chance at happiness slip away. In fact it added to their reconciliation for me - and brought me to tears. It is a huge moment for Anne. She is chasing after her future - freeing herself from the miserable life in which she thought she was due based upon her prior actions. She is showing the world that she completely willing to flaunt convention and follow her heart and mind rather than ever be led or persuaded against otherwise again. So bravo!<br /><br />Again - there are some changes. But I do not think the changes hurt the story - for me they do add to it. I am quite happy to have both versions ans love them both.get together in the end.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|It is almost impossible to distinguish yourself musically and get noticed when you are first starting out. Incredibly, Vampire Weekend has done just that in this blog-crazy, short-attention span culture. Forget the references to Graceland, afro-pop and preppy pop -- these guys have an original, unique sound. And it is not as if all the songs sound the same. They have a great variance to them but still fall under the same Vampire Weekend banner. The crisp, treble-ly guitar of Ezra Koenig and the solid original drumming of Chris Tomson anchor the songs that are truly enjoyable and a very easy listen. Looks like big things to come and this album is only the beginning
B000026OHN|4.0|While some of the criticisms made of this set are valid (the sound can be a bit distant here & there,)overall, this is one of the finest recordings of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier currently available. Richter is extraordinary in these pieces. I expected the precise virtuosity, but have been even more taken by the emotional depth the Russian master shows on this four cd set from RCA. Many perfomances of these works can be technically perfect, but quite dry, revealing  little feeling (Gould comes to mind for me.) Not so with Richter. This is a wonderful set to add to your cd library, even with the very minor imperfections in the sound quality. What an exceptional performance by one of the greatest pianists of the 20th Century!
0375842209|1.0|I'm writing this review so the other 2 or 3 people out there who didn't like this book will know they are not the only ones.  I was a little hesitant about reading this book in the first place (\\"ANOTHER book about WWII??\\"), however, friends, relatives, teachers, strangers in the grocery store, etc were all saying it was pretty much the best book they had ever read, so I figured it had to be at least decent.    Unfortunately (Sorry Mom, I still love you!), this was actually one of the least interesting, least engaging books I've read this year.  My biggest problem was with the language:  I found it to be empty, fruity, and ultra-pretentious.  I have a real problem with authors who throw a bunch of meaningless words together and consider themselves to be poetic geniuses.  The story itself, a modestly appealing if slightly hackneyed yarn about a little girl who loves to read, would have benefitted from a more straight-forward storytelling approach instead of being obscured with flowery language.    To the people who found this book to be earth-shattering:  I'm sorry.    To the people like me who found this book to be off-putting and banal:  You may never get back the 2 hours you wasted on this book, but take heart in the fact that you are not alone.
B000CRKW9A|5.0|Here is a visually stunning adaptation of Herbert Selby's unvarnished novel about street-wise losers in 1952 Brooklyn. This film includes graphic violence and sexual situations not for the \\"Romantic Comedy\\" crowd. Jennifer Jason Leigh as the hyper-sexual prostitute Tra-La-La steals almost every scene she's in.     Although the screenwriters had to re-do the ending as the true nature of the book's finale would have drawn an \\"X\\" rating, this is a must-see for those of us who can appreciate the realities of the street for those living the most marginal of an existance.     One other treat is an obese Ricky Lake as a dim-witted knocked-up teen whose family forces a wedding to the poor sap who sired her child as a way tho save their reputation (as if they ever had a good one to begin with).    The beating and \\"cruxafiction\\" of Stephen Lang as the latant homosexual is also an unforgetable cinematic moment.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I liked this series when I saw it on TV and wished to own the orginal BBC series. When I ordered at Amazon with free shipping, USPS took nearly 3 weeks beyond estimated delivery. After amazon sent replacement through UPS, USPS also delivered.     But 2 disks have some defects. The data must be currupted or some physical damage to disk. I saw lot of grainy screens every second (\\"off-and-on\\" flicker) in some episodes. I double checked my BD Player (Sony) and TV (Sony 52W3000) are working fine. Especially Angel's water fall scene is completely distorted. I returned this product and waiting to see if somebody else has experienced this kind of problems. When I saw it at a local warehouse store, I did not see any problems and suspecting that this release must be having some manufacturing defects. One month of waiting, printing labels, calling customer service....still could not own this product. I am tired and this time, I will try to buy at a local warehouse or bestbuy even if I have to pay few bucks and taxes more.    This production is my favorite with 5 star rating but I reduced it to 4 stars for BD-DVD authoring issues (seems happening to some of discs... Should be lucky to get good ones).
0064430227|5.0|My daughter (2) received this book as a gift for Christmas. At first she wasn't very interested in it because it didn't have many colors in the pages, but when we sat down to read it, she didn't want me to stop. She loved it and I enjoyed it too. It was the first time both of us read this book.  Now she likes to watch the cartoon version on the weekends. It's really a great story. Sparks the imagination!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The photography is truly astonishing!  The subject--fascinating.  If this set doesn't make you want to be as \\"green\\" as you possibly can be--something is wrong.  It makes you wonder what we have lost by our throw away society and our carelessness and even creulness in nature.  Should be shown in schools all over the country and world.  Something should make us want to all pull together to save this planet.  I can't think of anything better.  It should be in every home DVD library.
B000002J09|5.0|This is a masterpiece.  By far Led's best studio album.  \\"Stairway\\" is such a phenomenal record, it catapulted them to superstardom and just what rock music needed, a hard blues band to pick up where the beatles left off around 1970.  I'm a die hard Beatles fan and the only album that can compete with their best (sgt. pepper, abby road, revolver) in terms of song writing is this one, and that's saying a lot.  Besides \\"Stairway\\" which is in it's own category the 2 songs that absolutely make this album are \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and When the Levee Breaks.\\"  Page is a genious!!  If you don't have this album, you don't truly understand music.
B000002OAZ|4.0|This is great outing for one of the Blues senior citizens; a tribute by the devoted following of British Blues youngbloods who perform with due reverence for the master. Sure, its not full throttle Wolf, but the impro take of Little Red Rooster alone is worth the fare, as the compiler's recognised. This voice has left an indelible mark on the direction of Blues ever since. If you are into Beefheart or Tom Waits, trace them back to this immovable feast. Enjoy.

0743289684|4.0|Her writing style could be better, but I found the content to be quite enlightening. The book started out a little slow, delving into her grandmother's and mother's pasts, but it did end up giving a good background for the stuff as she started her childhood and then grew up into adulthood.   The perspective she brings from living in so many different countries is unique (Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Holland), and helped give me, especially as a Westerner, a great insight into areas that I know very little about, including Islamic fundamentalism (not terrorism, but fundamentalism) -- at least as viewed through her eyes, as someone who grew up in Muslim enclaves in Africa & Saudi Arabia, and as someone who later in her life had lots of interaction both with the Islamic/Muslim fundamentalist enclaves in Holland and the more secular Westerners in Holland.      I definitely recommend this book.
0143038419|3.0|This is the true story of one's woman's quest for self-discovery and happiness.  It is a travel narrative of sorts but I enjoyed her humourous tales along the way more so.<br /><br />Gilbert takes us along with her to Italy, Bali and India as she attempts to find out how to be happy, achieve self-fulfillment and find balance.  I enjoyed her friend Richard's comments and his way of looking at life as well.  He made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />I guess the whole purpose of this book is to help each person begin their own personal journey and to find what's right in their own life.
6305014140|5.0|Reviews are opinionated. If you are unsure of my opinions validity, read my other reviews (mostly anime) to see what I normally like.<br /><br />That being said, this is probably my favorite anime. 1st one I saw, really raised the bar.<br /><br />A traveling samuri/ninja accidentally gets caught up with 8 half human/half demon characters when rescuing a ninja girl.<br /><br />The animation is not of the highest quality, nor is the choreography anything complex. This doesn't count against the creativity and pace of any of the fight scenes.<br /><br />The gore is moderate and there are a few scenes too sexual for suggested minor viewing.<br /><br />the story is not incredibly deep, but far from shallow.

0142403873|5.0|This is the most clever children's story I've ever read, and I've read hundreds of books to my 17-month old! What an imaginative, original premise with a great message, too: You can outwit any scary or imposing creature -- no matter how small you are!     I completely adore everything written by Julia Donaldson. She is my favorite children's author. She is an incredibly talented \\"poet\\" of children's literature. Another MUST BUY is The Snail and The Whale. It's a wonderfully told tale with a truly heartfelt message (I actually cried for the whale!). She's just awesome.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|Yes, I know she runs around bath like Anne never really would , and I know the kiss is terrible. But ! this is still a lovely adaptation . Captain Wentworth is amazing , and Anne is wonderful. although some people complain about how they don't want to know ahead of time what C.W . is feeling - I loved it - it's great to see some emotion. The 1995 adaptation is true to the book, but it is so cold. In the book, Jane tells us in words things that the 1995 actors just don't carry through in actions. So it's nice to see a Captain Wentworth who loves Anne, the scene where Captain Wentworth confides in Captain Harville is awesome, and the scene where he lifts her onto the carriage is so touching. All in all, a lush and wonderful adaptation.
0783225903|1.0|I'm all for creative films, which I thought this was supposed to be. It isn't. It's such a simplistic and random retelling of \\"1984\\" it makes even videogames like Half Life 2 look sophisticated by comparison, and that's not saying much. I realize now when people call a film classic you have to ask if they mean a \\"nerd\\" classic like The Matrix, or Brazil, or something that's of genuine cultural value. This is definitely a nerd classic, and not the latter. Be warned, unless you have an uncommon love of mechanical things and little emotional resonance within you, this movie is just long, boring, and cheesy as hell.
0060512806|5.0|My biggest question before deciding to read this book was \\"Will I be one of the ones that like it or am I too old to be able to follow the sidelines and the more current buzz words\\".  Since reading this story is such a commitment of time, I want to make sure you all know my specs:  I'm over 50, not a techno-geek, but I do have experience in the world of computers and software, I majored in the sciences so I've had my share of mathematics and physics.  I hated math and physics but I loved this story.  I do have a great deal of interest in World War II and cryptography intrigues me.  I especially love a conspiracy.  This book has all of that.  Usually I do not like a book that rambles around tangentially to the plot line, but I went into this book knowing that with 1100 pages (PB) there would be some of that.  But in this book, there is a lot of it.  Most of the book takes trips into the mind of the characters away from the plot.  However, that is where the gems of this book are hidden.<br /><br />There has been a lot made of the Cap'n Crunch detour.  I have to tell you, I loved that section.  As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the book immensely.  The length was long; however, saying that is similar to Kramer on Seinfield, while in a sauna, saying that \\"it's like a sauna in here\\".  Of course it's long, it's over 1000 pages.  If you want a short book, read a graphic novel or comic book.  Many didn't like the wordiness and the off plot meandering.  If you want the instant gratification of finishing a book in two days, this is probably not the book for you.  Although, it only took me about 2 weeks to finish, it was never boring and I never dreaded reading any of it....  Okay, I lied a little; I skipped over the bicycle sprocket explanation.  But I read all of the rest.  And for the most part, there are many sections that if you do not have an interest in them, skipping will not hurt you.<br /><br />There were not many characters, so that part was easy to follow and the story line was interesting with more than a touch of fact.  It was nicely put together and I've given it the highest ranking.  I don't see where anyone could say that this book was missing character development.  Any more development and the book would have been 2000 pages.eresting with more than a touch of fact.  It was nicely put together and I've given it the highest ranking.

B000M341QE|4.0|If you are in the mood for one of the better crime/mob dramas that I have seen in a long time, then check out The Departed.  In the effort to destroy South Boston's Irish Mafia, the police send in an undercover agent.  Unbeknown to them the mob has infiltrated the police department.  This film, directed by Martin Scorsese was a multiple Oscar-winning crime thriller, and I would agree with them on this one.  Every member of the star-studded cast gives a faultless performance.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays the undercover cop at his best, the mob kingpin is Jack Nicholson, and Matt Damon plays a career mob member turned cop.  The plot sounds simple and done that before, but this is a surprising movie with more twists, and suspense than you would expect.

B00005JPKE|5.0|Letters From Iwo Jima, and its companion film, Flags of Our Fathers are two of the best World War II movies I have ever seen.  These two films need to be seen back to back.  They both clearly show how nasty war is, bringing the human faces of war to you in a manner too hard to ignore. And what makes them stand out from the rest, is that not only is the war seen from the very real human side of the tale, but even more importantly, from both sides of the conflict.  Watch Flags of Our Fathers first and Letters from Iwo Jima second.  Clint Eastwood directs both.  Flags of Our Fathers was developed from the nonfiction best seller that James Bradley wrote about his father, John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, the last survivor among the six soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima.  The politics and real story behind this very famous photo and statue are fascinating, and disturbing.  Letters from Iwo Jima tells the story of the attack on Iwo Jima as told by letters buried on Iwo Jima during the attack.  It give the Japanese soldiers a human face that generally is not seen in the typical war movies that just shows them as the enemy.  In this movie you will see the Japanese soldiers as they really were, young men with families, and loves just like our own soldiers.  If you like to see war movies filled with heroes, enemies, and glory, then these aren't the movies for you, or maybe they are, as these movie will show you war as it really is, destructive, with heart rending losses on both sides.
B00005JPXY|5.0|Because everyone and their dog has a cell phone with a camera--or a handheld video cam--there is no doubt the next horrific catastrophe will be captured on video for all the world to see (on YouTube).  Which is why CLOVERFIELD, despite its wacky premise (a Godzilla-like monster/demon destroying the Big Apple), struck me as so very real.  As soon as the \\"event\\" began to happen, I immediately and effortlessly suspended disbelief, and got into this movie, which fascinated through every frame.<br /><br />I've heard comparisons made to \\"Blair Witch Project\\"; yet Blair was laughable sophistry (we're supposed to be scared because the characters find little props in the woods).  CLOVERFIELD shows us the real deal--there's definitely a monster under the bed, and he's a force to be reckoned with.  We follow a group of friends (who ad lib superficial, melodramatic lines, but come on, people say stupid stuff when they're frightened) who don't run from the monster. . .they run towards all the terror to \\"rescue\\" an injured ex-girlfriend.  All the while, destruction and carnage reign supreme (the special effects are spellbinding), and our friends pay the ultimate price for all their dodging and weaving.  The climactic scene is a definite eye-opener.<br /><br />With its queasy, handheld camera motion, CLOVERFIELD looks and feels all too real.  Which makes for one very entertaining night at the cinema--motion sickness or not.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]

B000JNN0SM|4.0|17 years later, it is surprising how well Terminator 2: Judgment Day stands the test of time. The theatrical release (which is reviewed here) is better than the Director's Cut or Ultimate Edition because the movie flows better, inane dialogue and bad story elements that were better left out are still omitted.    The central theme of the movie is the value of human life; it sets itself up well and is an example of Director James Cameron's finest works (another being Titanic (1997)). The heroes and villains contrast well with each other, in a movie made before more modern yarns where you can't tell who belongs with which side.    The movie is rated R, so expect cursing, blood and violence.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel is a group of three separate stories, involving four separate familes, that are all interconnected.  The central story from which the others radiate involves an American couple vacationing in Morocco, who fall victim to a random act of violence.  This gut wrenching film demonstrates both the necessity and impossibility of human communication, as well as the tragedies that can happen due to accidental or unintended mistakes.  The acting was superb, the camera work excellent, transitioning from country to country and event to event with a seamless, understandable movement.  The film won a Golden Globe for Best Drama, which I consider well deserved.
B000H2MTUA|5.0|Angela's Ashes, is a compelling memoir written by Frank McCourt, that tells the story of what it is like to grow up in the \\"miserable Irish Catholic childhood,\\" and the adversities one faces on a daily basis. Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1930, Frank's family soon moves back to Limerick, Ireland where the McCourt's are plagued with even more hardships, such as the realities of poverty and the cruelties of dealing with an alcoholic father.    Frank describes his childhood as a time of great deprivation; however, he still manages to find time for adventure and humor as he copes with his troubles at home. Malachy, Frank's father, is usually the cause of his mother, Angela's, unhappiness as he shatters her dreams of raising a healthy family with a supportive husband by drinking away the families' money for food and clothing. Frank observes the sorrow that lingers through his home as another week goes by without support from Malachy: \\"Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.\\" Although Malachy's alcoholism is one of the most prominent setbacks for the McCourt family and their futures, Frank is still able to love his father as his exciting stories and folktales about Irish heroes not only entertain Frank, but give him a dream and hope for a better life. Because Malachy is unemployed and drinks away any money that he earns, the McCourt's are left with nothing and nowhere to turn but to public assistance and welfare, which Frank is deeply ashamed of. He explains that he would rather steal then beg to survive. This is because being able to pay for one's food brings Frank pride and self-respect as he states that, \\"There's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to someone.\\" Frank's concerns forhis family are also sparked by the other kids at school who tease and laugh at him for having odd-looking shoes as his have been repaired using rubber tires because his family could not afford to buy new ones. In addition to the financial problems, the impoverished neighborhoods of Limerick are home to many fatal diseases and when three McCourt children die, Angela is overwhelmed with agony and stress and she immediately falls into a state of depression, which affects the rest of the family as well, especially Frank. Within time and the onset World War II approaching, Frank begins working for a series of men in order to support his family when his father fails to do so. Frank's new sense of responsibility gives him the pride and confidence he needs to start a new life in a different world, breaking the cycle of his mother, father, and relatives in Ireland.   Angela's Ashes is the true recollection of a boy who starts out with nothing, but through sacrifice, determination, and a never-ending dream, is able to thrive, putting the past behind to make room for a new beginning. The lessons and realizations that are found throughout the story remain with you long after you close the book. I have come to appreciate all the little things in life that before I had always taken for granted. There are parts where Frank will make you laugh out loud through his wit and humor, however, there are also times where the struggles and accounts are so painfully devastating that the novel can sometimes become very difficult to read. Without Frank's way of finding humor in even the most tragic of times, I truthfully think I may have put the book down, but I'm glad I didn't. Frank's writing is vivid, impressionable, and certainly everlasting.
0792833279|1.0|I tried to watch this stinker as a means to relax after a long day.  After ten minutes I realized the movie was making me very tense as I was forced to grit my mind against it.  The movie takes obviousness to new levels.  There are developments which are completely implausible, characters which are completely unlikeable... I could go on, but why?  The movie comes off as a bunch of actors trying to seem like mobsters.  And Rene Russo trying to seem hardboiled, saying things like, \\"I know whatta vig is.\\" and scowling like she's from the bad part of Beverly Hills.  The movie insults your intelligence at every turn, causing you to become cretinized by the act of colluding in it by watching.  This is how a movie like this damages your mind: just to keep watching, you have to relinquish so much discernment that you end up a basket case.  For example, one of the first scenes, which was supposed to be in Miami, is CLEARLY filmed in Santa Monica, with the Esplanade as background.  I guess we should thank the filmmakers for cutting corners... only somehow all this money saved didn't affect the ticket prices.  Strange.
B0001I562I|5.0|We watched this for the first time the other day. I had seen reviews in the past and had the impression that this was not a happy story (and certainly, the beginning is difficult, but with a little parental presence and reassurance this is something even a 6-year-old can handle easily).    Yes, the beginning is sad, but it is also well-done; the boy is convincingly vulnerable, though the medical-research side (especially once he ends up in the hands of NASA) is somewhat far-fetched.     The last part of the move is a truly enjoyable romp that quickly overrode all the fear of the first half. The spaceship is well done, and the interactions between the boy and the ship's computer (voiced by Paul Reubens, who sounds quite Pee-Wee-esque toward the end) are wonderful.    My six-year-old says this is \\"favorite movie ever.\\"
B000WZB944|1.0|This review only addresses the remastered release and not the content of the album.    The original CD of this album was not the best example of mastering analog to digital in the earlier days of CDs.  With that in mind, this \\"remaster\\" is even worse.  I don't agrree with the assessment that the engineering of the original recordings is to blame because I have an original vinyl of the album and it is far better than ANY digital incarnation.  Sure CD tech has come a long way in 25+ years and most new albums and remasters sound far better than they ever used to, but what the heck happened here?  The instrumentation may be slightly more articulate in some tonal ranges (particularly the Edge's multiple guitar parts and overdubs) but that is about the only improvement over previous incarnations.  The vocals and the percussion are completely flat, two dimensional and lifeless far more so than previous CDs rendering this remaster almost unlistenable. I had to check my equipment to make sure something had not gone wrong because it sounded so poor.  Perhaps this remaster was intended to be carved up into mp3 or worse but I feel totally deceived by this release and very disapointed.
0786838655|5.0|New York Best-selling and multi-award winning author Rick Rioradn has out done himself with his is newest series Percy Jackson & The Olympians series.<br /><br />The first book, The Lightning Thief begins with a troubled youth named Percy Jackson, who is constantly being thrown out of schools. His mother is remarried to a man Percy calls, Smelly Gabe, because well the man smells of course. Percy has one friend who happens to be almost as odd as he is named, Grover. Together the boys try their best to stay out of trouble, but unfortunately for Percy that is easier said than done.<br /><br />You see Percy Jackson is a half blood. Not a half blood in the meaning of half muggle half wizard. No. Percy is half \\"God\\". His father is one of the Greek Gods from mythology, just he doesn't know it yet and when he does find out. Well let's say Percy has to run for his life. No really he has to run and make it to a place called, Camp Half-Blood.<br /><br />Things to settle down for Percy once he makes it to Camp Half-Blood. After only being in the camp for a few days, Percy finds out that the god Zeus thinks he has stolen his Lightning Bolt. Percy now must go on a quest with two of his friends to find the Lightning Bolt of Zeus to clear not only his name, but also the name of his father.<br /><br />I truly thought this book was going to be yet another Harry Potter type fantasy book, but I was deeply mistaken. Riordan has done such a wonderful job of taking mythology and bringing it into our world with The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is the first book in the Percy Jackson & The Olympians series.

B00000J7S8|5.0|This was the top-selling jazz c.d. of 1999.  I started writing Amazon.com reviews in January of 2004.  I had this one then and would have reviewed it and given it 4 stars at that time.  I'm glad I waited 4 years.  Here's why:<br /><br />By 1999, Diana Krall was well-installed in the jazz world as \\"The It Girl.\\"  On the heels of her best-selling and well-lauded \\"All For You\\" and \\"Love Scenes,\\" she was the beautiful pianist/chanteusse who evidently could do no wrong.<br /><br />Then, the critics started to turn on her.  I recall that one particularly mean-spirited critic called this c.d. a \\"J. Crew Catalogue.\\"  And after that, the brickbats got louder on \\"The Look of Love,\\" \\"Live in Paris,\\" and \\"The Girl in the Other Room.\\"<br /><br />Then, just as suddenly, the critics were kind to 2006's \\"From This Moment On.\\"  But through all of this, the fans kept buying and, for the most part, adoring.  I was among those, writing a 5-star review of the latter.<br /><br />And all of this caused me to re-visit this c.d., the fulcrum of all of this hoopla.  How good or bad is it, really?<br /><br />Verdict:  It's very, very good.  It's very definitely on par with \\"From This Moment On.\\"<br /><br />To begin with, Diana Krall remains the sexiest jazz singer ever.  Her take on the novelty song, Michael Franks' \\"Popsicle Toes,\\" will make you want to feel her warm Brazil and touch her Panama.  (Sorry, Elvis!)  But it's the sultry \\"Do It Again\\" of Gershwin, done as a slow-dance where she's so close to you that she's behind you, that gets you going.<br /><br />Besides that, she is one hell of a pianist.  Check out her soloing at the bridge of \\"Devil May Care.\\"  It is a solo with all of the internal logic and musicality of a Thelonious Monk solo.  Or check out her \\"traded 16's\\" with the great guitarist, Russell Malone, on \\"East of the Sun (And West of the Moon);\\" the idea of such an exchange is to make it all sound like one extended solo, which these two musicians accomplish.<br /><br />It might be that the critics didn't like the heavy-stringed arrangements on a few of the arrangements.  Frankly, the only cut which felt too heavy to me was the one added in later versions of the c.d., track #13 or \\"Why Should I Care?\\"  The rest didn't bother me:  in fact, the strings really enhance the approach to the set-opener, Berlin's \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance.\\"  And that cut also establishes Ms. Krall as a jazz singer, as she plays with the tempo throughout.<br /><br />Bottom line:  it's not that Diana Krall is overrated.  Not at all.  It's that so many other jazz singers are underrated, some ridiculously so.  Ms. Krall was lucky to come along at the right time.  But she has earned her accolades.

B000XA5K48|5.0|Totally brilliant! Nice to see the magnificent Clive Owen in a new role. The movie is hilariously absurd, the plot is nonexistent (who cares about a plot when there is Owen and Belucci on the screen?), the lines great and the movements are elegant. What I loved most was the very obvious pleasure the director himself and the  cast had while doing that movie - it was infectious. That one went straight to the \\"absolute favorites\\" shelf and is going to stay there. And as a PS - who was that miserable fool who preferred Daniel Craig over Owen for James Bond? Some people simply don't have any taste or even horse sense.
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp is just amazing in this film.  It shows, yet again his versality in his craft.
6305537321|4.0|It is a timeless story about a woman who was lost and then found (herself).  In fact, her apartment looked like a lost and found box, and her cat was lost then found!<br /><br />This review is about the movie only.  I believe there is a new release, but I do not know what extras are added.<br /><br />I read somewhere, when Capote wrote the novel, Holly/Lula Mae was modeled after Marilyn Monroe/Norma Gene.  That's a very important point to keep in mind in order to understand her character.<br /><br />Holly didn't like herself, at least her old self, so she transformed herself into someone else.  Admirable effort, but she lost her identity along the way.  She really wasn't escaping to a better place, except externally/materially she felt different.<br /><br />She was a mess, a real phony.  She cared no one, but herself.  She lacks of responsibility, but she was also everyone's inner desire....<br /><br />People commented on the acting.  I bet that was fashionable at the time.  Nowadays it's the naturalness that's in vogue, so it may be a problem for some people.  It was the period.<br /><br />I can't say I like the fake Japanese character though.  It's unrealistic.  Have you ever met a Japanese person like that?  I think the DVD should have an option to take that part out as deleted scenes.  They contribute nothing to the storyline, except as a comic relief (and it has plenty of wittier ones).  It was just very out of place.<br /><br />The costume design is very nice.  It's 1950's at its most glamorous.  Glamorous but not out of place.<br /><br />\\"Moon River\\" is just brilliant.  A simple song that delivers so much emotion!  Many of us are still drifters waiting for the right one.  That's the ultimate love song for me.<br /><br />I love the symbolism.  When she found her cat, she found herself.  Cat never had a real name, because she also had no identity.<br /><br />I was very concerned for the cat in many scenes he appeared.  He was dripping wet in the last scene.  And earlier on, when Holly smashed stuff all over the place (she must be an Aries), Cat was walking through the shards!!!  I wonder how much he was paid for the part....<br /><br />In any case, it's a fancy fun for guys and gals alike.  It's still relevant today (which is why I think it's good).  I bet we all know someone who is just like Holly.  Do they still give out prize in Cracker Jack?, Cat was walking through the shards!!!  I wonder how much he was paid for the part....

But it is also rewarding as you get a beautiful account of Briony's attempt to...well it will become more clear as you read it (even though the title gives a good hint). I'd recommend the movie as well. It captured many things like different views of the same scene quite well (for example the \\"fountain\\" scene).

Also, the end was so melancholy!! I can't think of any other way to describe it... Should be interesting to see the movie and see if it can live up to the novel. - this normally doesn't happen, but I'll have to watch it to satisfy my curiosity.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|The merits of this film have been covered repeatedly by others so I'm simply going to review this HD-DVD on how it stacks up to other HD-DVDs.  Quite simply- this is the disc you put in when you want to WOW your guests-period.  I own twelve other HD-DVDs and have rented a few more.  NOTHING else out there looks and sounds quite as good!  Quite simply a jaw-dropping picture that is rich and detailed.  The sound field is completely immersieve with the biplane fight especially good. Like the new Kong or hate it- this is THE HD-DVD experience the way it was meant to be.  Be sure an use an HDMI cable and not the component cables or you won't get the best this disc offers.

0765342294|3.0|If you like science fiction save the universe kind of literature than you will love this book. This novel is about a young boy named Ender Wiggin who is chosen to save the universe at the age of six and has to leave his family and go to Battle school to become the commanding general. Throughout the book it discusses how Ender copes with the molding of the teachers, with his peers, and with his own genius. What I disliked the most about Enders Game is that the soldiers in battle school were naked half the time, which was a little uncomfortable. Secondly, Orson Scott Card promotes violence and swearing a ton in this novel I was shocked at how much there was, even though that fits into the genre of this book it made me a little uncomfortable. It is a good length, there were maybe a few parts that were drug out but it is a young adult novel so it moves at a good pace. The one thing that I did enjoy was how even though Ender was affected by the manipulation of others his conscience, personality and values remained intact. So if you enjoy science fiction full of military tactics, naked swearing soldiers, and a war to save mankind you will love this book.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This series was the sole reason we kept HBO as part of our satellite programming.  A few days after the very last episode, I cancelled it.  Hubby got this set for me for this past Christmas and I LOVE it.  I don't understand the earlier whining here about them coming out with a full set of the whole series after people bought them individually; they almost ALWAYS come out with these kinds of sets when a series ends.  You can't be stupid enough to not KNOW that so either have the patience to wait or quit whining; it's a pointless and silly reason to rate this item so low.  Sell the individual seasons on eBay or elsewhere and buy this one if you are envious.  This series still sells quite well. And if someone has never seen the box these come in, then assuming it's a regular sized DVD box, to contain an entire 6+ seasons worth of DVDs is just ridiculous!  Quit the whining!!!  It's a GREAT set and I would assume the reason for buying it is to WATCH THE SHOW from time to time; not to show off expensive packaging! When you add up what all the seasons cost separately, this is still a bargain.

B0000025KI|3.0|Bruce Springsteen-The River *** 1/2<br /><br />Okay, I personaly am a person that almost always loves all double albums. The ones that people think are bad I usually love, however there are a couple that I can not stand. The White album by the Beatles should have been better, Srg. Pepper by the Beatles is the most self indulgent thing I have ever heard, I hate the Beach Boys and I will say anyday that Pet Sounds blows Pepper away, besides as much as I like the Beatles, I can't stand McCartney. And lastly, The Wall by Pink Floyd has to be the most overrated album of all time, give me a break. The River falls inbetween those albums and Exile On Main Street, Blonde On Blonde, and London Calling, which are all double albums that I love to death.<br /><br />This could have been a good double album if it weren't for a select few songs which I just won't name, or this could have been a GREAT single album had it not been for a couple more songs, which I still won't mention...I will just mention the high points. 'The Ties That Bind' starts the album off perfectly, still has that 'Badlands' feel left over from Darkness. 'Sherry Darling' was nice but should have been better. 'Jackson Cage' really depends on the day. 'Two Hearts' is a nice sappy number which Springsteen would soon be knwon for in the years to come as he would turn his back on his roots for a while. 'Independence Day' is fantastic, much like his previous work, but I still feel he could have done more with it. 'Hungry Heart' is a classic. 'Crush On You' is fun and one of my personal favorites from the album. Much along the lines of 'Pink Cadillac' and 'Darlington County' which he would do later. As you can see this album was essentialy a turning point in the career for Springsteen and The E. Street band, as he would soon faze them out and pursue more commercialy accesable music, not that it was a bad thing....all the time anyway. 'You Can Look' is great. 'The River' closes the first disc of the album and should have closed the album as it is depending on the day you ask me, I concider it to be Springsteen's finest hour and today just happens to be one of those days. It is the story of getting a girl pregnant and having to work really hard to make, you know the classic Springsteen tale.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the second best song on the entire album, 'Point Blank.' A little pretentious and over the top but still a great little song that would have been perfectly at home on Springsteens next album, Nebraska. 'Cadillac Ranch' and 'Im A Rocker' are simular and placed right next to each other it is sometimes hard to distinguish the two, but spperate, the are pretty decent songs. 'Fade Away' and 'Stolen Car' are once again more Nebraska then The River but still nice songs. 'Ramrod' fails to deliver where it should, the 'Drive All Night' and 'Wreck On The Highway' close this long album so they should be the most memorable and for some reason are the most forgetable, even the songs I don't enjoy stand out more then these tracks.<br /><br />Now I bet your saying well you listed so many songs that were good and only didn't mention a few so how is this not a great album. Well even the best of the songs are forgetable and it is even hard to describe them. Too much material for this album, the songs had the potential to be one of Springsteens best and most acclaimed album, but even with how stripped the production is, compared to his previous works and the amount filler this just seems to decadent for someone who is supposedly trying to be a working mans hero.album as it is depending on the day you ask me, I concider it to be Springsteen's finest hour and today just happens to be one of those days.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I just got back from SamAsh and tried all sort of headphones. I wanted something under $50. I found the 7506's to sound the best, and this was second best. I had my heart set on the Sennheiser hd280's but they were pale and have less bandwidth compared to the 7506 and are heavier too. Some how I wanted to own a Sennheiser product! But it would be 'those' headphones.<br /><br />The 7502 sound almost as good as the 7506, but they are not nearly as comfortable. The pads are a plastic vinyl like and will wear out, and can be replaced. They do no cover the full ear as the 7506 does. Other $49 headphone from Samsom had a phasing hollow sound, you dont notice it at first until comparing a few. But once you hear the $100 and up quality phones you know why people spend the extra dollars. These were the only good sounding, but not 100% comfortable headphone in the $50 range.<br /><br />High prices headphone also buy true leather, and wear very well.<br />Soundwise both the 7502 and 7506 sound very very good, it really come done to the comfort issue.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|\\"I thought all writers drank to excess and beat their wives. You know one time I secretly wanted to be a writer.\\"<br /><br />Tracy Samantha Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is getting married, and everyone is in a frenzy. Trazy is one of the elite rich, a woman who has experienced luxury and perfection in everything. She has been married before to CK Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), another member of the upper class. Their union was wrought with fights due to their conflicting personalities, but Dexter is still a strong presence in her life. In this her second marriage, Tracy wants something totally different. She has chosen a man who began as a lower class citizen but who has worked his way up to wealth (John Howard). Their union is the talk of the town, and although Tracy wants to keep thing private, Dexter can't help but throw a wrench her way by inviting the tabloid press. Macaulay Connor (Jimmy Stewart) and Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) spend their time snooping and rubbing elbows with thier subject. Everything culminates in<br />a fantastic drunken night where lovers are swapped, blows are delt, and general chaos sets in. However, all is done with class right down to the verbal assaults.<br /><br />This movie gets better each time I watch it. It is easy to breeze by the enchanting dialogue on the first go-round, but once the story is understood, each line reveals itself to add another level of sophistication to the film. The actors are perfect in their roles. Hepburn is appropriately regal, but later soft and vulnerable when Tracy has her epiphany. Grant is smart, sypathetic, and all around wonderful. He makes acting seem effortless. Stewart won an Oscar for his role, and it was well deserved. He embodies the jaded writer and makes the character incredibly dynamic. His drunken scene is the highlight of the film. He is both uproariously funny and disarmingly attractive in a short span of time. The little looks he shoots his costars throughout his scenes are so telling and add another level to this wonderful cast. Even Virginia Weidler turns in a fine performance as Tracy's young sister.<br /><br />Also included in this special edition DVD is a documentary about Hepburn called All About Me. Although brief and not totally in-depth, it is worth seeing because it is narrated by Hepburn herself. She is endearing in it, even though she was certainly a tough woman. We also have a documentary about George Cukor and a commentary by historian Jeanine Basinger.this wonderful cast. Even Virginia Weidler turns in a fine performance as Tracy's young sister.

0321544080|5.0|If I could choose a career in Photography, it would be the one Joe McNally has had. And since my Photography is more for creative purposes and an adjunct to my 3D work, rather than the primary part of my work, I feel that I can live vicariously through Joe thanks to \\"The Moment It Clicks.\\" When I first heard about this book, I was excited because Joe's work is outstanding, if not iconic. For Joe to do a book on his career, you can really get a sense of what drives him, what motivates him, and soon you get a complete understanding of how he got the shot. What I particularly like is that he discusses, in straight talk, the situation behind various images. Imagine sitting down with Joe McNally, looking through his portfolio, and asking him about the shot. Everything from using a fill flash, to making your pictures \\"shout\\", to finding your way into a lunch with the head of Disney, simply to get the shot you want.     When I started writing books for 3D animation, people often asked me why I would do such a thing. How could I \\"give away my secrets.\\" I told them that it's just software instruction, technique, and tips. I can't teach anyone to be a 3D artist, but only how to use their software and help guide them. So when I started reading Joe's book, I thought to myself \\"how can he give us all this valuable information...\\" Suddenly I caught myself. I realized that I was asking the same question people had asked me. Joe can't teach you to be an photographic artist. But it's his insight, experience, and outlook that can help you see better, and perhaps, become a better photographer - if you allow it.      This book is a welcomed addition to the arsenal of photo books on the market that continually talk about the same thing. Exposure, perspective, types of lighting, etc. Only a few books come along that you can refer to time and time again, once you know the basics. Joe's book is one of those books and it will remain on my bookshelf for years to come. I'm so glad I signed upfor Moose Peterson's Digital Landscape Photography Workshop next fall, as Joe is one of the instructors!
B000WTBMBU|5.0|Absolutely wonderful sophomore release by the mysterious Burial. Shrouded, dense, oblique, euphoric, downcast--just absolutely unforgettable.     If you're looking for quick hooks and easy accessibility, the reason for most of his detractors, you'll likely only find them with track two, Archangel. However, ease yourself into the repetition and you'll find yourself mesmerized and immensely rewarded by it.    Captivating like no other release during '07. Highly recommended.     Note: The vinyl release omits some of the beatless tracks found on the CD release, which is unfortunate.
B000066744|5.0|Arrived promptly, packaged well. I saw this movie a few years back and liked it, but couldn't remember the name of it. Interestingly, my piano instructor happened to mention this movie to me and said he'd never seen it; so I ordered one for my own library, and for him, too.

B000MV8ZD6|3.0|Sometimes I get in the mood for a good old fashioned blood bash. I don't mean something as pasturized as the latest \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" remakes. I don't want something loaded down with CGI effects like \\"300\\". I want good old latex and red-corn-syrup blood-letting. Something that could only have come out of Italy in the 1980's. Usually when I'm in this mood I will turn to Fulci's \\"Gates of Hell\\", (blood by the bucketful) but I've worn that flick out in recent years so I turned to \\"House by the Cemetery\\". The movie starts right out with a great splatter of the red stuff and we are off and runnin'! The first thing you will notice about this movie is the haunting score. It's fantastic, one of the best elements of the film. The second thing you will notice is the lousy vocal dub for \\"Bob\\"??? Not sure who or what is providing that voice....but it is pretty jarring when first heard to say the least. Finally you will notice that \\"House\\" actually serves up more suspense than oozing red stuff as it plays out. There are some pretty chilling scenes sprinkled throughout the film, and the final 15 minutes is fantastic! The blood does flow, don't get me wrong, there are several scenes to satisfy the gorehound, but the emphasis on suspense and the creepiness the underlies the entire film really make the gore secondary. If you can get past \\"Bob\\", then you will really enjoy this film.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This rereleased version of the Beatles' next-to-last album combines the genuis of the Beatles and the absence of Phil Spector.  I prefer this version of the album, but having said that, I must recognize I heard this one first (and, typically, you like the one you hear first the best) and the original album has sentimental value for those who got the vinyl.  I understand both of these things, but I still prefer the Naked version.  It's how the Beatles intended it to sound; they were playing what they liked and getting back to their roots, and the sound of the album reflects their aims.  My biggest problem with the original lies in the overlaying of orchestral scores on many of the songs.  Once in a while, if the arist so chooses, huge symphonies in the background is acceptable, but not when it detracts from the piece instead of adding to it.  The last straw on the original for me was during \\"I Me Mine,\\" one of my favorite George songs, where I couldn't hear his vocals due to the overwhelming number of stringed instruments cluttering up the background.  If you want to listen to the album the Beatles would have put out (and eventually did), then buy Let It Be. . .Naked.  If you want a Phil Spectored version, by all means, buy the original.  Just bear in mind that the heavenly choirs might actually drown out the Beatles.  I don't know about you, but I buy Beatles albums for the Beatles.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is a beautiful production of an interesting period in history. The story of Henry VIII and his quest for a male heir makes great drama. The actors are well cast, the set designs and costumes are breathtaking,....and then there's the sex. Lot's of sex.  BRAVO!
0743298039|4.0|after i finished with this novel, i found myself staring at the book itself with what i think was a bemused expression.<br /><br />to clarify: i immensely enjoyed this--as they called it--\\"story-within-a-story\\". true, the number of characters increased almost in regular intervals as vida winter laid down the history of the angelfields. but they were introductions that never muddled the story, and definitely it was quite easy to keep track of them and the sometimes prevalent, though, more often than not, subtle, threadbare connections each had on the other characters (certainly i had an easier time here than in Zafon's The Shadow of the Wind, easier, but no less enjoyed, mind). and the revelations were, indeed, just that. i often found myself pretending to one-up the author and presume: \\"aha! so she was actually the one who...\\", before i could read the actual revelation--but then the vida winter and the angelfields would prove my musings wrong. and the twists laid bare the grounds for the revelations of other twists.<br /><br />i guess that was one of the things that i really liked about this novel. i literally couldnt put it down. although setterfield did not deign to turn verbose as some \\"novels\\" are wont to do, nor steer her protagonist in lengthy bouts of self-contemplation to give it a heavy feeling of \\"personal emotional struggle\\", she nevertheless managed to keep my attention on the stories and the vividly rich characters that seem to shift in expression and behavior with each telling. it's a novel too intricate in essence to be haphazardly classified as a light read, and yet...AND YET it's easy to be lost in its narrative and find yourself with an inexplicable need to turn just one more page if only to find out what happens next.<br /><br />unexpectedly, i found that it impressed upon me mixed feelings of morbid fascination, surprise, sadness, and, in some cases, disbelief (i found the \\"twinness\\" of adeline & emmeline and margaret & moira a little too weird--[of course i really have no right to comment on what i obviously can't experience]). some, though, may feel entirely different, and be left skeptical. some may find it absurd and be dissatisfied. but for me, it was an enjoyable read. not on par with literature heavyweights, but deserving still, surely, of acclaim.ve no right to comment on what i obviously can't experience]). some, though, may feel entirely different, and be left skeptical. some may find it absurd and be dissatisfied. but for me, it was an enjoyable read. not on par with literature heavyweights, but deserving still, surely, of acclaim.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|In today's vastly uninteresting music world, it has become increasingly difficult to find an artist that is truly unique. Too many artists out there sound exactly like some other artist who excels , or has excelled in the same genre. Vampire Weekend is not one of those bands. Though there are several instances where one could say \\"Ooh that sounds like --insert artist--,\\" it's always a very small detail that never overrides their own unique style of music. To be honest, I've never heard a band that sounds quite like Vampire Weekend. That alone should be enough reason for you, the skeptical reader, to give them an open ear. If, however, you find yourself needing further convincing, keep reading.<br /><br />The album's first track \\"Mansard Roof\\" is one of my personal favorites. Ezra Koenig's smooth vocals really make this song what it is. His infecting melody rides weightlessly over some contrastingly harsher instrumentation (fast, simple drumming, manic, though simple electric guitars, and a prominent organ-synth). There are also some small flute appearances and a delicately played violin that adds some nice depth. It all sounds very Caribbean to me, though the genre that the band is often associated with, \\"afro-pop,\\" is also a very appropriate assessment. \\"Oxford Comma\\" takes similar instrumentation but has a more traditional indie rock sound, particularly in the chorus. Koenig sounds convincingly like Britt Daniels of Spoon when he questions, \\"Why would you lie 'bout something dumb like that? Why would you lie 'bout anything at all,\\" which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />\\"A-Punk\\" is perhaps the most appropriate title on Vampire Weekend, as it shamelessly wears its punk influence on its (imaginary) sleeve. When the band shouts, \\"Ay ay ay ay\\" over a sprinting bass line and frantic drumming, I had to remind myself that I wasn't listening to The Ramones. Really (not really...but almost). \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" sets aside the punk sound for what is my favorite song on the album, and the one that helped launch the band's career. Here is where the afro-pop label is most appropriate (the term \\"kwassa kwassa\\" actually refers to an African dance rhythm). Djimbes and congas take over most of the percussion work here, though shakers and a cymbal are also used periodically. Koenig swoons \\"As a young girl, Louis Vuitton with your mother on a sandy lawn. As a sophomore with reggaeton and the linens you're sitting on,\\" over a repetitive, yet completely endearing guitar riff. In the wordless bridge, some sweet falsetto harmonies are utilized brilliantly to create a truly African vibe. Very cool sounding.<br /><br />\\"Campus\\" has a very 60s pop sound to it at times, though it's also somewhat reminiscent of The Strokes. While that may not sound like it could ever possibly fit, it does. It is yet another favorite of mine. \\"One\\" returns to the afro-pop sound again, this time with the awesome one-line hook of \\"Blake's got a new face\\" sung in a style that I can imagine an African boys choir would be more familiar with. Everything is very tight and perfectly performed, and is one of the album's more unique tunes.<br /><br />\\"Bryn\\" is Vampire Weekend's most disappointing song (maybe its only one). If Coldplay were a lo-fi indie pop band, they would probably sound like this. It' s not bad by any means, just not entirely memorable and you may find yourself skipping it in favor of the next track, \\"Walcott.\\" In it, Koenig asks, \\"Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?\\" over perfectly composed Cello and Violin lines, while also managing to mix in some syncopating keyboards and the band's now-standard manic guitars. The song's conclusion is particularly surprising as the band \\"rocks out\\" for the first time, and while it's definitely not near as pleasant as when they're taking it easy, it is a nice change. The album's closer, \\"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance\\" has a very reggae feel to it, and I can imagine one of the Marley's proudly singing it before a sea of people. It is a touching and poignant ending to a remarkable debut album!<br /><br />The argument could be made that Vampire Weekend does a bit too much dabbling in traditional African music, especially for a bunch of \\"white boys\\" from New York. But as a huge fan of what I'm hearing, I can't help but applaud the band for their decision to not only inject the style of music into their own, but to delicately weave it into every second. If anything Vampire Weekend has paid tribute to a style that is too-often overlooked in pop music today by making it their own and blending it with their other numerous influences. The band's self-titled debut is far more than a gimmicky musical diversion, it is a unique, captivating work of art (Pop music as art? Go figure!). I highly recommend it to fans of indie rock, as well as anyone who may stumble upon this review. Like it or hate it, you won't be forgetting it any time soon.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Mansard Roof\\"<br />2. \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\"<br />3. \\"One (Blake's Got a New Face)\\"<br />4. \\"Campus\\"<br />5. \\"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance\\"<br /><br />8 out of 10 StarsIt is a touching and poignant ending to a remarkable debut album!

B000002JSJ|4.0|When it comes to Led Zepplin, and you are either a causal or die hard fan, its really hard to come up with an album that was horrid. The only album that I really didnt care for was Coda, but that was just a bunch of un-released material, so that really doesnt count. I happen to be a huge Zepplin fan, yet when it comes to rating their albums, I ask myself, which ones have I grown tired of, and which ones can I still listen to on a daily basis. My first favoite \\"Physical Graffti\\" is one of the best double albums ever made. It's hard to compare anything to that, but \\"Presence\\" is sure close. Sure, The first four Zepplin albums are all good, but I have grown tired of them. Maybe it because those are the albums that seem to get the most FM radio play, and between listeing to get the led out on most classic rock stations, & listening to CD's, its easy to get tired of songs (of course I speak for myself) When it comes to \\"Physical Graffti\\" \\"Presence\\" and \\"In through the Out door\\", they seem to get the least airplay. Why? I have no idea, even though \\"In Through the Out Door\\" gets \\"All of my Love\\" played to Death, I hardly hear the other songs. You ask, maybe \\"In through the out door\\" isnt that good. Well that is part of it, but with \\"Physical Graffti\\" and \\"Presence\\" I have no idea. \\"Presence\\" is a treat and I believe it is vastly under-rated. Even though the songs lack a bit of what is on Physical, once again, its hard to compare anything to that, because first, its a double album with lots of songs, and second, it is their best (in my opinion) The one thing that Presence does do, is give us more heavy Zepplin. Yes, those blues-rock songs are still there, but Zepplin finally gives us some progressive rock with my all time favorite Zep tune, \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" Its blistering guitar work and savage drumming scream heavy metal, along with the fact that it just seems so out of the ordinary for Zepplin for write progessive rock tunes (the last one I heard if we go in Chrnological order would be \\"No Quarter\\" from 1973's \\"Houses of the Holy\\" The rest of the cuts on this album are all pretty much solid to fantastic (I could do without Candy Store rock, thats why only 4 1/2 stars) and I suggest if you are new to the band and just getting into them, please add this to your collection quickly. Its a shame that Zep couldnt build on this some more, as 1979's \\"In through the Out door\\" expands a bit on this, but has some bad filler on it, and even the big hit from the album \\"All of my love\\" I could do without. Enjoy Presence, and you might be surprised of the type of Zep you are going to get here. Lilke I said, its a bit diffrent, still some blues type rock, but some of the progressive rock thrown in here is a treat.

His Prarie homes were organic in nature and designed to blend into the landscape rather than compete with it.<br /><br />Frank himself could hardly be considered as a man who \\"blended into the landscape\\" and his unconventional affair with Mamah Borthwick Cheney, a married woman with two children, resulted in tragedy both personal and professional<br /><br />Author Nancy Horan's historical novel takes you into the lives and minds of this unusual couple and explores their relationship and its effect the people who loved them as well as those on the periphery of their passion.<br /><br />We are drawn into the inner thoughts of Mameh, an accomplished woman in her own right.....college graduate, fluent in several languages.....and her attempt to \\"stop standing on the side of life watching it float by\\" and instead \\"swim in the river and feel it's current\\". In an era when women were expected to quash any desire for personal growth and \\"act happy\\", Mameh's personal conflict forced her to make choices that provided temporary satisfaction, but were ultimately disasterous.<br /><br />Could it be that you, like me, will become so consumed by Horan's vivid portrayal of this couple that you will find yourself searching the internet for more information about \\"what happened after\\" Horan's tale ends.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time this year.  Watched it with my wife and 3-year-old son who couldn't take his eyes off it.  The annimation is amazing.  If I'd watched it in 3-D, I would have fallen out of my chair.  I bought the video so we can watch it every year as a family... along with Wizard of Oz and It' a Wonderful Life.

B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is my all-time favorite album.  There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said, so I will just keep this brief and say that if you want to start listening to Rush, this is a great place to start.  Every song, every note is fantastic.  From the kick-assery of Tom Sawyer to the vivid imagery of The Camera Eye, this album is full of amazing music.

B000Z8GZYW|4.0|First, buy this Special 15th Anniversary Edition for the movie. There are so many reasons why this movie is special. Danny Rubin's creative genius. Harold Ramis's writing and directing skill. The cast of characters. The generous performances of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot. And the amazing performance by Bill Murray. Decades from now this movie will be a classic for good reason. It's an original, intelligent, funny, and uplifting film.    If that doesn't sell you, then buy this DVD because it has the extras. Harold Ramis provides much insight into the film by way of his audio commentary and his \\"A Different Day\\" interview. Ramis, Danny Rubin, Trevor Albert, Andie MacDowell, and Steven Tobolowski give further insights in \\"The Weight of Time\\" documentary. Finally, even the deleted scenes add a few laughs.    I wouldn't recommend it merely on the strength of \\"The Study of Groundhogs: A Real Life Look at Marmots\\" documentary. It is... a little too focused. And it sure would have been nice to get an interview or some commentary from Bill Murray. Still, this is a great film, with many extras.
B00003CWPL|5.0|David Lynchs Directorial debut, Eraserhead. You either get it or you don't. But one things for sure he makes normal scenes quake with terrifying fear at the sound of just the music. It's always very interesting to see where Directors began and what they started off with..(i am keeping up to date with some new indie/underground films)there's almost an innocence to say 'Here it is i made this what do think?' I wonder deeply what they (Film Companies) first thought when they saw this.It looks like nothing you have ever seen before, truly a surrealist piece shot in shades of black and white interwoven with normal lives currupt and interrupted by other means/forces in some way. It's not one of Lynchs best works, but i always think without a beginning there wouldn't be any of there great latter works.It may not be one of his best Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks Elephant man are better films but what a debut what truly and a original concept. His work still innovates and inspires today without bowing down to Hollywood happy endings or flinching a muscle to ease up atall.    Pros- Original, Scary, weird and bizzare and disturbing.    Cons- My DVD version didn't have many features just basic stuff :(    Film itself 5/5 Dvd Features 2/5    From the beginning you know its going to be a like a haunting nightmare if you can withstand enjoy...if you can.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I love just about everything Pixar puts out.  What's so refreshing about their approach is the male-centric perspective the movies bring, be it a single father searching for his son (Finding Nemo), a single male learning the responsibility of raising a child (Monsters, Inc.), or male bonding between friends (Toy Story).  And then there's Ratatouille.<br /><br />Our rat hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat who wants to be a chef.  Our human hero, Linguini (Lou Romano), is a garbage boy for the fine French restaurant Gusteau's with a mysterious past who just wants to get the girl (Colette, voiced by Jeanine Garofalo). These two eventually cross paths and struggle with the boundaries that separate man from rodent, the untalented from the prodigy.  Remy strikes out on his own and gets a job (of sorts), distancing himself from his family and friends. Linguini struggles to impress Colette in the kitchen under the devious watch of Skinner (Ian Holm). Throughout we hear the mantra: \\"Anyone can cook!\\" as espoused by the ghostly \\"figment of Remy's imagination,\\" August Gusteau (Brad Garrett).<br /><br />Unlike the other Pixar movies that are tightly focused on a single core message and convey it beautifully, Ratatouille is all over the place.  Will Remy convince his family that striking out on his own was a good idea?  Will he make it as a rat turned chef?  Can he keep up his façade as a puppet master of Linguini's cooking talent?  Speaking of Linguini, what is his mysterious background all about?  Will Linguini convince Colette of his love? Will Skinner figure out Linguini has no talent for cooking?  And what IS Linguini's talent anyway? Will Skinner get away with his plans to sully the reputation of Gusteau's restaurant through blatant commercialization?<br /><br />But that's not what Ratatouille is all about.  It's actually about the crypt-like critic known as Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole with creaky menace). He is a bitter, unlikable skeleton of a man, thin where Gusteau was fat.  Ego doesn't like food; he claims that he loves it, and if he doesn't love it, \\"I don't SWALLOW.\\" Somewhere in the course of Ego's career as a food critic, he lost track of what makes life enjoyable.  It's up to our dynamic duo to convince him otherwise.<br /><br />So the message isn't actually about whether or not anyone can cook.  It's about remembering what matters about food: not the taste so much as the feelings and memories associated with it.  Unfortunately, that message is muddled by all the other questions laid out in the film.<br /><br />As a result of all the other plotlines, some of the characters become one-dimensional.  The rats are more fleshed out than the humans.  In fact, Linguini seems like such a doofus with no actual skill that it's hard to care about his plight or what Colette sees in him.  It's implied that his true calling is as a roller-skating waiter, but that talent appears in the last few minutes of the film.<br /><br />Ratatouille wraps up with Ego's epiphany, another human who isn't fleshed out nearly as much as his counterparts.  The fairytale ending is a bit hard to swallow, but that probably depends on your opinion of rats in a kitchen.  Overall, Ratatouille has a lot of heart but not a lot of art, and the film's lack of focus prevents it from becoming a true Pixar classic.doesn't like food; he claims that he loves it, and if he doesn't love it, \\"I don't SWALLOW.\\" Somewhere in the course of Ego's career as a food critic, he lost track of what makes life enjoyable.

B00006G8K0|5.0|This is the quintessential Hammer Horror movie. And this is the greatest Dracula movie of the series, Christopher Lee is magnificent here and definitely Dracula's never looked so terrifying and gruesome! Recently hearing that Hammer Horror Productions have started up again i am exited to bits..but whether or not they could ever create something like this again is hard to imagine.Times have certainly changed and what you have here is a horror film from the golden age of British cinema.rarely does a film so much these days captivate a sheer undergoing of things that go bump in the night to such dramatic effect. As the steering protagonist and nemises of Christopher Lee's Dracula is 'Doctor Van Helsing' Played by none other than Peter Cushing. Who plays again in this role as a perfect counter part to Lee's shadowly stranger of the night.Peter embodies every bit into his role as the the opposition serving for the light in the darkness of this ungoing battle between good and evil. I picked this up recently, and thought to myself is this going to be as good as it was as a child? Had it lost it's lustre and worn with time? Not atall, surprisingly! The music and the two main leading men hold it togeather perfectly and still works in truly horrorfying effect. Thats why they call these classics.    Pros- Brilliant Acting, Scares, music on screen performances by counterparts.    Cons- ???! They should have been given oscars for this! Horror deserves more.

B000002O5L|5.0|Having listened to Tom Petty on the radio for many years, I could never break down and buy one of his CD's  This is the CD that changed all of this. Tom along with Jeff Lynne and former Beatle and fellow Willbury George Harrison contribute to this effort, and it makes it just that much sweeter. It's fun seeing Harrison and Lynn on the video as well.  This CD is pretty much a best of package in itself.  This CD contains, I won't back down, Runnin' down a dream, Freefallin' Love is a long road and several others.  Once I listened to this CD for a few months, I was able to buy much of his catalog with the Heartbreakers.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are now in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and are truely one of the great Rock and Roll bands ever.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Rock and Roll.........A true classic.................

B000XA5K48|5.0|This film is implausible, ridiculous, occasionally disgusting, and unique. I've never seen anything else like it, and all I can say now is that I would love to see more films of this flavour and calibre. Clive Owen is gritty, witty, and adorable. Monica Bellucci plays a beautiful, mysterious hooker. Paul Giamatti is a crass bad guy trying to be more of a harda$$ than he is. The performances they hand in make this film more than a cheesy action film; their commitment to their tongue-in-cheek roles elevates this to dark comedy. It's morbid and violent in the extreme, but if you have a twisted sense of humour and like action that just doesn't stop, this is the movie for you.

B00026WU3M|5.0|OUTSTANDING ALBUM!! A+++ I put this album in the stereo the very evening I got home and received it--I couldn't wait to hear it--but basically I was just curious (I didn't listen to the samples before I got it).  But the surprise I got was something like the following metaphoric comparison:  I was prepared to get a ride in a car and see new scenery on the next street, but instead I got into a supersonic jet and took off in a very rapid and steep ascent!!!! WHEEE!!  Up and away--WHAT A THRILL!!! Oh my God!!!  What an album!!  I had to grab tissues to wipe my moist eyes I was so moved and happy!  An almost 50 year old Bob Dylan executes an over the top super performance in this exceptionally rich and sophisticated mood evoking album--his voice is perfect.  Right away in Political World during the first stanza and during the crescendo, you can hear that he sings it to PERFECTION--going softly or delicately on some words and even his signature hillbilly twang that he invented long ago is evident on some words he sings that make this song among others a symphony of sound.  And listen to the AWESOME LYRICS to Political World!<br /><br />The tune itself to Political World is not complicated, but the arrangement, the lyrics and the way Bob sings it makes it complex and sophisticated--very much so.  The arrangements are so very sophisticated in the other songs AS WELL.  Everything is Broken is super (available in The Essential Bob Dylan).  Man in the Long Black Coat is drop-to-my-knees-I-surrender F A B U L O U S with Bob's deep voice in this one--it is a richly mysterious, somewhat meloncholic song,  the \\"heart stopping\\" What Was It You Wanted has a VERY STIRRING DYLAN HARMONICA and guitar, Ring Them Bells is very deep.  This man is so unbelievably talented, I can't get over it!!!  THIS ALBUM IS A MUST BUY!!!  So many times before I've said: \\"Bob, you are TOO good!!!!\\"  This is another album I was saying the same thing!!!--over and over and over.  The lyrics to the songs in this album are very good.  Altogether between the sound, the tunes, the arrangements, the lyrics and the way Bob sings them, most of these songs are absolutely over the top outstanding!!  Okay, you may always find some song that you just don't care for on any one album--that's almost a given, but I can't get over the quality of this album, and I can't wait to go home in the evening or wait till the weekend to play my favorites over and over again.  I will never get tired of this album.<br /><br />These songs are powerful, richly complex and VERY sophisticated starting with the super \\"Political World.\\"  I thought I had heard all Bob's best by now and I was absolutely amazed to hear all these superb songs.  I can't tell you how enthusiastic I am with this album.  Hey, my excuse for not having this album before is that I got stuck in Europe for much of the time after graduating (my choice), and I got tangled up with the locals, but if you were here all the time and knew Bob Dylan from the 60's, you surely have missed out on a real treasure of an album! He's come a long way baby!!!<br /><br />PS:  Hot Note:  After doing this review, I opened The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan that I have at home and in the section right before \\"Not Dark Yet\\" they mentioned that \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" was WRITTEN IN THE STUDIO AND EXECUTED all in ONE take.  Another book said he wrote it \\"QUICKLY\\" right in the studio.  I find that absolutely remarkable to say the least--absolutely mind blowing!

0375847227|5.0|I found it hard to put this book down, it was pretty good.  Some people might think this book is for children, but I don't think younger ones, maybe teenagers.  There's a lot of dark material (hence the name) and interesting twists. Some reviews said it was better than Harry Potter, but I think both are in the same league but totally different messages.  Read it for yourself, but if you do, read all three stories in the trilogy to get the full story.  Some people like to read just the first installment then see the movie.  I say you won't understand the Golden Compass until you finish the rest of the book.
0345440900|3.0|This book has some good points/tips in it. The most notable are:  1) Don't overstimulate your child  2) Get your child on an eat/play/sleep rotation  3) Respect babies  4) Talk to babies and tell them what you're doing as you're doing it  5) Give your baby cues before you do certain things  6) Catch your baby's nap signs before he/she becomes overtired    However, the book also doles out a lot of bad advice and unrealistic expectations. For example, I tried the sleeping methods in this book and they did not work for my baby at all! Just go to the babywhisperer website (full of believers in Tracy Hogg) to see all of the people who are also having trouble with pick-up/put-down and shhh/pat methods. These poor parents are staying up with their babies all night to try to get them to sleep in their own rooms/cribs and consequently not getting any sleep! My son would and still will only sleep in our bed and in my arms (He can be put down for up to 30 minutes, but then will wake up). After trying Hogg's methods out for a week, I decided it was making it impossible for me to get anything done and I decided to hold him for most of his naps. Talking to other parents, it seems that many of them have the same issue as I do. Tracy Hogg is very anti-co-sleeping and yet that is the only way I have been able to get any sleep for the past 4 months! After consulting with a child developmental psychologist, I was told that my baby would eventually outgrow this need, but for the time being, he needed bodily contact to feel secure, not an uncommon phenomenon. I seriously wonder about the effects of letting your baby cry and cry to go to sleep, even if you are staying with them, patting them on the back, while they cry. While this is not as cruel as traditional cry-it-out (leaving the baby to cry alone), it sends the same message: I'm not going to meet your needs so don't bother crying.    She also has this attitude that everything you decide to do, you should do from the moment your baby is born (\\"start out as you mean to go on\\"). Well I'm sorry, but a newborn and a 6-month-old are totally different creatures. The book does not address the types of changes that babies go through as they get older, such as not needing to nap in between every nursing, etc. It's ironic that she thinks consistency from birth onward is so important since she claims to be able to solve any problem in just 3 days.    This book also has an abysmal section on breastfeeding, in which the health benefits of breastfeeding are completely played down (if I didn't know better, I would think she owned stock in Enfamil). She also advocates timing feedings, and only nursing on one side per feeding. While I agree that you should empty one breast completely before going to the next one, most women aren't able to nurse only on one side per feeding. My breasts are very uneven with the amount of milk they produce (which is fairly common) and I was starving my poor baby for half of his feedings until I figured this out. He also wanted to nurse for an hour at a time for the first 2 months and I'm glad that I let him nurse for as long as he wanted.    Tracy Hogg justifies everything in her book by comparing babies to adults (you wouldn't want to sleep in the living room, neither does your baby, etc.) The notion that babies have the same wants and needs as adults is patently ridiculous. My son certainly didn't care what room he was sleeping in as long as I was in it, preferably holding him. She claims that when babies cry because you're putting them to sleep using her methods, it's only to tell you, \\"this isn't the way we normally do things.\\" Well how does she know what the baby is trying to tell you when he cries? The bottom line is that this book was written by someone who has a lot of experience with babies but no expertise. It has some good advice, but a lot of bad advice too, so be careful what you choose to follow.    Having ranted about the book for several paragraphs, I still thinkit was worth the read, but only to take from it what makes sense for your child. I recommend \\"No-Cry Sleep Solutions\\" by Elizabeth Pantley and \\"Your Child from birth to age five\\" by Penelope Leach. These two books give much more realistic expectations about baby behavior.
0307387151|5.0|This is my first McEwan novel and it most certainly will not be my last.  I'm glad the movie version got such rave reviews because I might not have read this book otherwise and that would have truly been a loss.  McEwan is such a gifted author who is capable or rendering deep emotions in such a way that I felt almost as though I was living through the characters.  This isn't a book packed with scenes of action; instead, it is an introspective and beautifully drawn character sketch that I found a pleasure to read.  That said, it's not for everyone though those who enjoy lyrical novels will certainly enjoy this one.    The character that was most interesting to me was Briony.  As a young girl, she is very self-centered and filled with ideas about her own importance and when others fails to notice her as she wants them to she strikes out in ways that are vindictive and have consequences that are much more far-reaching than she can imagine.  I didn't find her very sympathetic at this age though I think that McEwan did a wonderful job of capturing the psychology that is sometimes manifest in girls of her age.  While she doesn't fully grasp just how profoundly what she is doing will impact not only the lives of Cecilia and Robbie, but her own as well.  Still, as Briony ages and comes to a full understanding of what she has done she becomes far more sympathetic.  How many of us can say that we didn't do something stupid and spiteful in our youth that later came back to haunt us?  As Briony matures she comes to understand just how harmful her actions were and she also reaches one of the most unpleasant understandings possible upon becoming an adult--that remorse, no matter how deep, can not reverse the sins of the past.    Perhaps my only slight disappointment with the book was with Cecilia.  McEwan offers us a glimpse into her thoughts when she is still young and full of promise but we don't get a chance to witness how she thinks once life has given her many reasons to sink into bitterness.  She is a character that has far more wisdom than others give her credit for possessing, though, and what must have seemed to her family like a deranged act of love is, in reality, an act of justice in the face of great injustice.    Perhaps the most moving and vivid scenes in the book are those in which the reader sees World War II through the eyes of Robbie.  These passages in the book are so rich in detail and so chilling that I don't see how anyone could be unaffected by them.  Robbie's tale is ultimately one of survival and that is one of the book's true tragedies, that a young man who once held so much promise is reduced to a struggle merely to make it from one day to the next.  In many ways, the war is a metaphor for his internal struggle, in which the prospect of carrying on is so bleak that one must wonder why anyone would bother.    As rich as these three characters are, concentrating mostly on them only scratches a bit at the surface of this novel's subject.  It is, more than anything else, a novel about the human condition in which character motives are explored.  Sometimes their actions don't make any sense.  Their crimes result in nothing or in the destruction of the lives of others.  The reasons behind their actions are often obscure and, in the case of Lola, unthinkable.  Now that I've had the pleasure of reading this novel, I can hardly wait to see if the movie version even comes close to doing justice to McEwan's wondrous prose.
B000002I97|5.0|Illegal Smile, Hello In There, Sam Stone, Paradise, Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore, Angel From Montgomery, Donald And Lydia. These are some of John Prine's greatest songs, and they're all included on his 1971 self-titled debut. This is definitely the place to start your John Prine collection if you want more than a compilation.<br /><br />John Prine is a plain-spoken, and sometimes wry, American folk singer/songwriter. His songs are real-life, down-to-earth reflections that are intelligent, penetratingly insightful and genuine. A thoughtful working class troubadour, his songs can make you think, cry, laugh or seethe with anger.<br /><br />In Hello In There, John sings of an elderly couple trying to come to terms with a world that no longer seems to need them.<br /><br />We had an apartment in the city<br />Me and Loretta liked living there<br />Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown<br />A life of their own, left us alone<br />John and Linda live in Omaha<br />And Joe is somewhere on the road<br />We lost Davy in the Korean War<br />And I still don't know what for<br />...don't matter anymore<br /><br />A lot of these songs are performed folk-style on an acoustic guitar, and others are quietly country-folk with a competent band.<br /><br />John played the folk-music scene in Chicago after serving in the Army and working for the postal service. It was there that he was discovered by Kris Kristofferson, and hailed as \\"the next Bob Dylan\\". He is sort of a \\"workingman's Dylan\\", and has a personality that's somewhat more down home and accessible than Bob's.<br /><br />In other songs on this album, Sam Stone tells the haunting story of a Vietnam veteran's drug addiction and overdose, Donald And Lydia is a low-rent tale of two wandering fantasies of love that go bump in the night, Illegal Smile is a pleasantly stoned escape from reality, and Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore is a war protest.<br /><br />But Your flag decal won't get you<br />Into Heaven anymore<br />They're already overcrowded<br />From your dirty little war<br />Now Jesus don't like killin'<br />No matter what the reason's for<br />And your flag decal won't get you<br />Into Heaven anymorear  Now Jesus don't like killin'  No matter what the reason's for  And your flag decal won't get you  Into Heaven anymore
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have all the Rush albums, though I became a fan in the late nineties.  As with most albums, right off there were a couple of songs I really enjoyed.  For me, Armor and Sword is the best on the album.  The instrumentals are excellent as well, in addition to Far Cry and Workin them Angles.  Several songs I don't particularly like, but thats about every album that I own from any artist.  Overall though, I thoroughly enjoy the album and feel its their best overall since probably Power Windows.
B000H5V8DG|4.0|I am very happy with this collection.  It comes in a lovely keepsake storage box with a hidden DVD compartment.  The only problem I have encountered is that some of the DVDs were incompatible with my DVD player and I had to watch the episodes on my laptop.  Apart from that, it was a great value.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The set came in excellent condition, and I loved every minute of every film! I'm a huge Aliens and Predator fan so I was very excited when I finally got this. If you are into the Alien films like me, or just like Sci-Fi films, this is a MUST BUY!!!! As in RIGHT NOW........ GO AND BUY IT THIS INSTANT!!!!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is the best game I have played in a very long time. I bought this on a  recommendation from someone who was receiving cancer treatments in New York and needed something to stimulate his mind and occupy his time. This game does that and is an absolute blast to play with the family. Even our girls love it. We recently introduced it to some friends while we went camping together and they are now hooked. Very cool game...and good for the cranium (at least I hope)!
B000W1V5VU|2.0|Is it just me or has Warner Bros downgraded the quality of their DVDs? I started noticing this with such releases as OCEANS 13 and the newest HARRY POTTER. It appears they're compressing the video content on the discs more than ever making the quality almost unwatchable on a Plasma or LCD 32' or larger. Could they be doing this to push more people into buying BlueRay? That would be my only guess. This is strange considering that FOX and Paramount are making better quality/less compressed regular DVDs. I know the more extras you have on the disc the more compressed the image quality may be but this has never stopped Warner from making a decent product before (though their DVD quality has always been much lower than most other brands).
B000001ZS8|3.0|I bought it expecting to have that great cassette that my brother brought once directly from Europe a long ago when I was a kid, turned now into a high quality CD (that part is OK). But then I got (a little, or very?) disappointed because Zoolook and Zoolookologie, precisely the two titles that I like the most from this production, were \\"remixed\\". I know that it says that this was a \\"reissued\\" recording but I was not expecting it to be half-original, half-edited.    Whose great idea was that? Why didn't they keep the originals and then just added the remixes as extras in all that remaining space like many other artists do when they make compilations or stuff like that? If anyone has heard the original recording back from the 80's, they know what I'm talking about. Although the Zoolook remix is not so bad because it sounds practically identical to the original, with maybe just a couple of seconds more in length, Zoolookologie was altered in a way that downgraded it instead of keeping the magic of the original one. (Man, my favorite one...)    The music is the same. They didn't make another \\"version\\" like it happens in many of his later compilations where he has to make singles out of tracks that are part of a continuous chain of titles with no gap between them. That is understandable. But those new cuts in Zoolookologie where the bass fades away because whoever was mixing it (I pray to God it wasn't JMJ himself!) didn't do a good job, take a lot out of the PERFECT matched rythm of the original one.     The original is a real JMJ classic; this new \\"reissued\\" version was a flop from my point of view. It was unnecessarily altered just to make it longer. Maybe you can extend time, but not the perfect balance that the original had. It sounds incoherent, out of rythm in those altered parts. Someone like me, who plays the original over and over so much that remembers it note from note, instrument by instrument, can clearly and sadly hear the difference, not for the best really. They took out in its climax that nice catchy part where they pick the bass after the percussion solo to return to the main rythm before ending. One of the best parts of the original, gone forever, not even relocated somewhere else in the track. :-(    I wish they could make an \\"Original Remastered\\" version, and not a \\"Reissued\\" one with unnecessary mixes. Just put the mixes at the end as extras. I for sure would buy it again if I could get the version that I remember so much. If I am not wrong from what I recall, the original recording had a nice booklet explaining how he recorded and mixed the many different voice samplings that he used in all the tracks to create that unique \\"music\\". It was one of the highlights of his production, because it was like an \\"ethnological\\" music experiment (listen carefully to Ethnicolor, the first track, and you'll get the meaning of its name) combining the vocalizations from different languages, genders, cultures... This new one has mostly just musician and production credits repeated in different languages over and over, not much to say about its true production value...     But If you are a new JMJ fan, I recommend this one very much anyway. It is one of his best works, and out from the two remixes, the other tracks are the originals. Great ones all.
B000M341QE|5.0|I have been trying to stave off insanity these past few weeks, as I have watched America ignnore the urgent need to exile Dick Cheney, send the village idiot home, and \\"get a grip\\" (see ten recommendations below).<br /><br />I have watched this movie four times in the past year.  Each time it gets better<br /><br />First thought: Dicaprio is a world class actor, and the star in the Jason Borne series needs not explaining, except to note that he was a Southie and created the movie script for his first film as a Southie.<br /><br />This movie is super at three levels:<br /><br />Strategically: it shows how to penetrate organizations (crime ito police, police into crime) and how to reinforce and protect those penetrations with \\"back-ups.\\"  CIA and FBI are both penetrated by everyone on the planet (including Guyana), but they are in denial and lie to us by pretending to be some sort of mythical \\"super\\" power.  I deeply value my past as a spy beacuse it allows me to serve the public by saying IDIOCY AND DECEPTION.<br /><br />Operationally, this movie is a cut above the average in showing how gangs work, how gang leaders are extremely intelligence and running operations against the police (the movie does not cover this, but most police departments across America are constantly monitored by criminal gangs that have used the back door to the police voice and radio communications systems to route a complete copy of every transmission or conversation to a third site.  Cops are on the payroll and do not care about operational security.  Criminals understand the value of couter-intelligence and intelligence.<br /><br />At the tactical level, from wide beaches for executionn to marshes with the unexpect banker getting laid, the movie is fully satisfactory.<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion that governments and religions are a form of \\"legal\\" organized crime that We the People need to \\"shut down.\\"  ENOUGH.<br /><br />I have been an undercover officer, in a combat zone as well as more normal locations, I have felt the terror of being exposzed, helpless, and subject to immediate execution (in El Salvador, a direct threat to execute me from the Colonels in charge of the country), and I consider this movie to be, easily, in the top ten alltime great movies about law enforcement, honor, and so one.<br /><br />One nit: real spies, and the traitors they handle, do not use cell phones.

B000YA82F6|5.0|Imagine having a baby when you're sixteen. Can't? Neither could Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page, [[ASIN:B000GI3KGC Hard Candy]]), a sassy and intelligent young girl who finds herself having to deal with this very issue in the highly acclaimed film JUNO.<br /><br />Once the rabbit dies, Juno is forced to come to terms with what she must do. Telling and not telling various people becomes a challenge, as does deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy. Once she decides against abortion (after a hysterical scene in the clinic where tapping fingernails play an annoying part), Juno decides to tell those closest to her. This includes the would-be father Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, [[ASIN:B000WZEZGI Superbad]]), a geekish track and field teen who's shocked to learn that his first time sexual encounter has also resulted in first time potential fatherhood, and her father Mac (J.K. Simmons, [[ASIN:B00005JPLE The Astronaut Farmer]]) and stepmother Bren (Allison Janney, [[ASIN:B000W4KT6E Hairspray]]). Paulie seems equal parts embarrassed and elated (his seed has taken hold), while Juno's parents are dismayed, disappointed, but eventually supportive ...especially after they learn that she's decided to give up the baby to a couple that can't have kids (whom she finds advertising in the PennySaver).<br /><br />The unborn's future parents are the Lorings, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner, [[ASIN:B000Y7WGOW The Kingdom]]) and Mark (Jason Bateman, [[ASIN:B000O77SF4 Smokin' Aces]]). Vanessa is agog with the anticipation of motherhood, while her husband, Mark, is more pensive, unsure if he's ready to take the dive into daddydom.<br /><br />The mixture of characters works well for the film with the only exception being that it was tough to swallow someone of J.K. Simmons' and Allison Janney's age being parents to a sixteen year old; they're a bit too old for those roles. Even so, the dialogue is stupendous, often making one forget that visual distraction and making them strain to catch every last nuanced syllable. And there are plenty.<br /><br />Although there aren't many teens out there with the intellect that Juno possesses, that's exactly what makes this film so watchable. It touches on an unfortunately ordinary premise (teen pregnancy) but pulls it up to a whole new level by allowing us to see it through the eyes of someone (Juno) battling with self-recognition during an age-crucial time.<br /><br />If there was ever any doubt that Ellen Page is one of the finest young actresses working in film today, Juno should put further arguments to rest. It is her razor-sharp line delivery that makes this film what it is: a character study of unusually funny proportions.. And there are plenty.

B000Y7U98C|2.0|Trying to be too much at one time, SUNSHINE often fizzles and fades under the shadow of its own weight.<br /><br />The biggest letdown is the cast. Not necessarily the actors themselves but how little we're able to identify with any of them in any way. When characters began dying off, I felt nothing for them. It was also frequently confusing trying to figure out who had what job and why (\\"I thought he was the captain?\\"). Chris Evans ([[ASIN:B000ICLRIO Fantastic Four]]) plays more of a tough-guy \\"crewman 19\\" scenario than anything else. Cliff Curtis ([[ASIN:B000O7667K The Fountain]]) plays a psychologically unbalanced doctor who only likes to stare at the sun as much as possible. Michelle Yeoh ([[ASIN:B000EHRVMY Memoirs of a Geisha]]) I'm guessing was some sort of astro-botanist obsessed with her shipboard crops. Cillian Murphy ([[ASIN:B000EHRVOM Breakfast on Pluto]]) is the only character most viewers will come close to feeling anything toward. He plays resident physicist Robert Capa who's responsible for their ships precious cargo; one designed to reignite our dimming sun. His seemingly over-importance is hit on time and again since \\"he's the only one that knows how to ignite the payload.\\" For such an important mission, I would've thought that whatever space agency was involved in this mission would've sent at least a few other people along who knew his job in case something happened to him (credibility issue).<br /><br />But for all its lackluster character portrayals, Sunshine does have some stunning visuals. A space walk by two members of the ship (known as Icarus 2) is candy for the eyes, with wisps of solar energy licking around the dome-shaped ship and threatening them. A few dream sequences with Cillian Murphy's character falling into the sun are also fascinating and creepy.<br /><br />Much time in the film is given over to the discovery of their failed predecessor, the Icarus 1, and its discovery by the crew of Icarus 2. A connection is supposed to be made by the audience between these two ill-fated crews. The connection is supposed to be the fragile minds that begin fracturing as they approach the sun. Is it some sort of space/sun-spot dementia/psychosis? Or is there really a threat to the Icarus 2 via the Icarus 1? I'm not going to spoil that for you, so you'll have to check it out for yourself.<br /><br />The final problem with Sunshine is that it was directed by Danny Boyle. Boyle is more recognizable now as a successful director of horror since his acclaimed connection with [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]. Unfortunately, some horror aspects show up in Sunshine and this is where things really get messy for the film.

0739366408|5.0|I loved the book.  I think I read it close to 12 times.  The audio version is great as well.  While it doesn't have nearly as much is the book, it's a good way to get your WWZ goodness while on those long drives. Now with the movie (hopefully) coming out, there will be another medium to add to the collection.
1594489505|5.0|The writer goes so deep into the woman feelings that sometimes I forgot it was a man writing the story. Great book, really breathtaking story!
B00000064G|5.0|Sometimes I wish an artist could keep putting out great albums, or movies, or whatever, over and over and over. But it can't happen. If a singer puts out one GREAT album, I guess I should be happy. This is Nick Drake's GREAT album. You can get his other stuff, sure. But get this first. And know, if this is the only Nick Drake album you ever get, that you have his best. What a great album.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I just got this today, and it's really good. I always enjoy sunny sounding music in the dreary winter. These guys remind me a lot of Paul Simon/Ladysmith Black Mambazo (more Paul Simon, They ARE white WASPy kids)  I would say that if you like Talking Heads, Bob Marley, or other ska/rocksteady type music, you might like these guys. The vocals are in a similar vein to Peter Bjorn & John, or The Strokes/Hot Hot Heat with less distortion. They are a little goofy, and they may prove to be a one hit wonder gimmick, but I doubt it; most of the album is pretty good and catchy. I would recommend \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" \\"Blake's Got a New Face\\" and \\"Oxford Comma\\" as the better/best songs on here.   I like these guys today, however they may become annoying over time (I doubt it though, any band with such a niche or kitschy sound has that potential, if that makes sense)
0618918248|2.0|This book is a bit of a mess. In the book, Dawkins keeps saying  he is reaching out to religious people, and wants to convert  them. But then he frequently dismisses religious ideas with very  harsh words. He happily recalls a \\"Focus on your own damn family\\"  bumper sticker, and recommends movies like \\"Life of Brian\\". His  discussions often sound as if they are going to get to the heart  of important issues, but then slide off into superficial  rhetoric.  There are interesting nuggets of information here,  like the true story of how Muslim outrage was whipped up over the  Danish cartoons. But I don't think this book will help either  side of the theist/atheist divide to see where the other is  coming from.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|on a sad note, it is really tragic that heath ledger is dead.  he left a string of good and great movies since 2000.  i picked up \\"casanova\\" to complete some of my ledger collection: 10 things i have about you, ned kelly, brokeback mountain, the patriot, and now casanova. i am not really what you can call a fan of ledger, but he is definitely a great actor.  the movies i have mentioned all beong to differnt genres. while drwn to tears with brokeback, and learned something historically with ned kelly, i found casanova to be totally entertaining for someone in the caliber of heath ledger. sienna miller is also very beautiful and acted her part well.<br /><br />i thought the preview was funny - and after watching the whole movie, it was all worth it. it's like watching serious actors (ledger, irons, platt, miller) all caught up under funny situations! the musical score was great, reflecting the music of the movie's era.<br /><br />the story was so concise, there was no wasted moment. the opening credits are still rolling, and yet, so many things are already happening!<br /><br />i credit the writer, the director, and even the production design for coming up with a very taut comedy that's really funny yet touching!<br /><br />heath ledger - you will surely be missed!
B000VWYJ8Q|2.0|It took me almost the entire movie to try to ignore the style of camera shots on this movie, and not even then I got accustomed to the filming style.<br /><br />It remind me of typical first-time amateur home video movies where the camera never stays still.<br /><br />I understand that sometimes the camera needs to move fast to follow the action, but even then it should be done following a movement path with a panning that is not shaky and well calculated to stop accurately when it finds the target sitting still, without continuing the camera movement and then returning.<br /><br />Almost all the camera takes of still people and objects, were done with the camera moving up/down and left right in a constant motion, which was distracting and unnecessary because there is no need to fake action on a scene that is suppossed to be still.  Any action movie needs those kind of pause breaks, this was a non-stop style of camera work.<br /><br />I liked the movie, I feel sorry for the poor camera choice by the director.
B00006AW2P|4.0|Before they were \\"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\\", the Rolling Stones were the greatest rhythm and blues bar band in England.  Their first album showcases the myriad of influences that inspired them, but without being note for note covers.  The band takes these songs and makes them their own.  If not on par with their later releases, this album provides a glimpse of the Stones in their infancy.  There's no denying that the energy is here, if not the polish.  The Muddy Waters/Howling Wolf blues roots are clearly seen, as is the Chuck Berry/Buddy Holly early rock fascination.  We see that this is Brian Jones's band as it was before the Jagger/Richards/Andrew Loog Oldham triumvirate took over.  We also see the first steps in the eventual direction the Stones would take with the song \\"Tell Me\\", the first of many Jagger/Richards compositions.  The songs may be rough and ragged at times, but they are delivered with a youthful exuberance that far outweighs any flaws.  The remastering process has rendered the sound much clearer than the original CD release, making this a must have for any Stones fan.  People looking to purchase their first Stones album may want to look to Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main St., Let It Bleed, or Beggars Banquet, as those albums are more representative of the band at its creative peak.
B000WC3A0S|4.0|Have been a avid Rocky fan since I was a kid. My first Rocky film was Rocky 3 with Mr. T so of course I still list that as the best ( but i think the first is really the best, but of course sentimental values)<br /><br />The music is great for all, but I think Stallone is really pushing it with the last installment. Though it still ends it well and makes Rocky seem as though almost human and real.<br /><br />This is a great series. The only draw back as stated by many other people who have reviewed this is the lack of extras by MGM.<br /><br />All the MGM series are pretty good, but no extras.
B000YABV90|5.0|The movie was awesome!  It kept me interested from the beginning to the end.  A wonderful love story for the entire family.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|I CAN´T SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE IS AREA1 ONLY AND I´M FROM AREA 2 (SPAIN - EUROPE) SO IT´S INCREDIBLE THAT.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is such a talented vocalist and I am enjoying listening to this cd it is exactly what I wanted.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|What a great DVD! More a companion to The Kids Are All Right, than a replacement, this documentary covers the entire history of The Who, with footage never seen before. The insight of the surviving members, and those who were close to the band is unprecedented. Whether you're a casual fan, or a Who fanatic, this will not disappoint.     The bonus DVD is chock full of great stuff as well. You can't go wrong with this one.
B000VZE1T0|5.0|This together with his third album represent the best ever work that Peter Gabriel has done to date with this album coming up on top.  Every track here is a work of art starting with \\"Red Rain\\" and ending with my favourite track \\"In Your Eyes\\".  Even after all these years, this album sounds very good and with the very good remastering job done, still sounds very fresh today.<br /><br />The mlps design is also well done although I would have prefered it if better quality, thicker cardboard was used.  The design very faithfully resembles the original vinyl lp even down to the lyrics printed on the inner sleeve.  Also included is an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />The sound quality is what makes this a worthwhile purchase for me though and as they say the cream always rises to the top and despite this album being released over 20 years ago and like a true classic this stands out as one of the best albums ever made and is a personal favourite of mine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|This version of Blade Runner looks great, and the included documentary is terrific as well. If you want to learn about this movie, and enjoy it in a really great way, then buy this DVD. It is definitely worth it, and is the kind of movie that you can watch several times-- and still learn something new with each viewing.
B00008DDRX|3.0|The main reason to buy this movie is to have a credible car-movie collection.  There is probably only 40 lines of dialogue in the entire movie, and most of them are inconsequential.  The racing shots, however, are beautiful.  If you want a few hours of fast 1960s car porn, this is the movie.  If that doesn't interest you, you will be bored.  If it makes you salivate, make sure to buy Grand Prix as well.
B000UD08HW|3.0|I love David Gilmour and all that he brought to Pink Floyd. His solo work is stellar. The fact that this great performance and line up of guests is thwarted by a poor video source/capture/transfer is a real disappointment on BluRay. The grainy look on the distant camera angles is distracting when run through PS3>HDMI>Sony XBR4 LCDtv(true 1080p/120hz). Even the 'on stage' close ups lack the vivid feel you expect with high definition. If you have seen the Cream 2005 HD DVD shot at the Royal Albert Hall, you know a true high definition concert experience. The video is pristine. This Gilmour compilation has stupendous audio quality, but it just does not make up for the non-hi def looking vid.
B00013RC8O|2.0|I bought this for my dad, who always claimed it as his favorite movie.  The movie is one long car chase.  I won't spoil the end, but it ends in a way many drugged out 1970s movies end.  I don't think it's even that good of a car chase.  It might be a cult classic, but I think it's just another bad memory from the 70s.
B000VI70X6|3.0|Concert was good because it had Wyclef and Alejandro singing with Shakira. Of course Shakira is a great singer (she actually sings) and her concerts are awesome but I don't know why this DVD just didn't cut it for me. I guess because overtime Shakira's songs don't have the same appeal as the old ones had or if it's the way she now sings that makes it hard to understand what she is saying. Overall concert was good, but extras made the purchase a little more worthile. If you are a fan buy it otherwise it's not really worth it.
0393317552|5.0|Had to buy this book for my European Economic History class.  Liked it alot because it has a bit of a narrative and a lot of plausible theories rather than just stating the facts.  My girlfriend (who has no interest in economics) had heard of it and started reading it when I was done and she liked it too!
B00004RJ71|4.0|Saw this some time ago. So now it's in the library. A rather interesting couple of hours. Not a waste of time.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|This movie was before my time, but after hearing about it from other car guys, I had to get it.  As a car movie it's my favorite, but as a movie it's not that great.  The cinematography and how they made the movie is spectacular, with some of the best racing scenes in any movie, not just for its time.  I would give it 5 stars but some of the off the racetrack scenes are just terrible.  I don't know if it's the writing or the acting but, ugh.
B000URDEB0|4.0|My first Nightwish cd was \\"Once\\".  I really enjoyed it, but musically, \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is superior.  I like the new female vocal lead. She has a very 'listenable' voice.  My favorite track is \\"Amaranth\\". I could put that song on a loop and listen to it all day!In a time when most pop cd's barely have 40 minutes of tunes, this CD has 75 minutes of music, which is a bargain for the price.
6304698542|5.0|As my title says, this is not a review but a comment about one person in the movie.  Sigrid von Richthoven, nee Johansson, is one of the women who live in the boarding house where Sally (Liza) lives.  She is elderly and dances with one of the other women.  What you may not know is that she sang Marie in the world premiere of the Alban Berg opera Wozzeck.  She died not too long after Cabaret was made, but what a wonderful vignette from a major artist of the past.
B000WZAE0Y|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Stardust.  Saw it twice before I bought it.  Both grandaughters (ages 8 and 14) said it was their favorite movie of the year.  Pfeffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox did a fabulous job in their roles.  A truly wonderful magical adventure. Some very funny parts as well.[[ASIN:B000WZAE0Y Stardust (Full Screen Edition)]]
0525950079|5.0|I have waited a long time for this sequel and so far it has lived up to all my expections.  This book grabs you from the first word and keeps your interest.  It was great going back in Kingsbridge,  the cathedral and all the colorful characters.
B000K7UG34|5.0|WOW THIS MOVIE GAVE ME THE CHILLS............I WAS IN VIETNAM FROM 1965-1967............I WAS SPECIAL FORCES.............BUT I WAS NOT IN THESE BATTLES.............BUT THE AUTHENTICNESS OF THIS MOVIE.......REALLY BROUGHT ME BACK TO THOSE DAYS SO LONG AGO.........THIS IS A MOVIE I TRULY BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH.........IT WILL GIVE YOU A IDEA OF HOW ARE YOUNG PEOPLE GAVE  THEIR ALL  ..........GOD BLESS THOSE HEROS!!
076781214X|5.0|This is one of the very best things I have ever seen Kathleen Turner and Nicholas Cage in. Peggy Sue Got Married is a romantic time traveling twist on that point in all of our lives when we have one of those \\"if only I knew then what I know now\\"  moments. In Peggy Sue's case, that second chance happens at her high school reunion. Can she change things? Is her fate out of her hands? Watch this charming, funny and poignant little movie to find out. And the mucic is really good, too.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|Although hardcore fans of the Resident Evil video game have complained about this movie series from the beginning, I gave the first two (2) Resident Evil movies very high marks for being a good modernized variation on the whole Zombie genre.<br /><br />With this third installment, I must now say it looks like it is time to end the series.<br />This third movie seemed less like Resident Evil and more like a combined tribute or \\"homage\\" to ...<br /><br />Road Warrior<br />The Birds<br />Day of the Dead<br />Matrix<br />and The Sixth Day<br />.... all wrapped into one.<br /><br />This film seemed to have a hard time finding it's center and just seemed like a mish-mash of random elements tossed in to give Alice an excuse to overuse her two curved battle swords.<br /><br />I bought the first two Resident Evil movies on DVD for our collection, but we have no plans to order this 3rd film.<br />We would never care to watch it again.<br />It was pretty flat.
0465043577|1.0|the author claims that the book will not make you rich but would make you understand the market behaviour better and thus avoid loss, he's right on the first part and wrong on the second part, he may be a genious but if he does not improve his presentation 100 times, this book will achieve one thing only - waste your time and money
B000K15VSA|5.0|I can now finally retire my VHS copy of the original release. I remember that when I first saw the film that I had a little trouble figuring out what was going on and needed the narration to help me along, I might have been a little young maybe (12 or 13), but I imagined I'd have been lost without it. Fast forward to 1993 and I finally get to see it on the big screen but it felt hollow without the narration, I'd seen it many times by then and didn't need it, but I still missed it's charm. Then when the DVD came out, there were no plans for a narrated version, so I had to keep a hold of a VHS copy way longer than I ever kept a hold of a VCR. Finally we have the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition and was it worth the wait. A shiny new version of the film sans narration but fantastic (I'm still on the fence about the \\"I want more life father\\" line change; I'd agree it fits better, but I loved saying it the other way for the last 20+ years....) and for the old curmudgeon in me I've got the original release. If I had to show it to a new viewer, I'd give them the new version without hesitation and keep the old version, my version, for myself. Oh, and Decker is definitely not a replicant :)
0451196716|5.0|The problem that so many people have with this book is that they place too much importance on who wins the competition. This book, however, is not a tale about the beginnings and ends. It is a story about the actual journey of life. After all that is what life truly is about.   The fact that it is a story about the journies of a 100 kids, who all, to some small degree, know that they are going to die, makes this book so good.
0060920084|1.0|I was very disappointed in, and angered by, this book. Having lived in a couple of the small towns that Bryson skewers I was unpleasantly surprised at the arrogant, belittling tone he takes. If all you know about small towns is what you read in this book, you'd assume that all small-town residents fit the stereotype of being backward, country bumpkins who are a bit slow on the uptake and clearly can't match wits with such a pithy author. He insults both the towns and the residents. He mocked one town for being in his drive-thru view little more than a series of strip malls. Having lived in that particular town, it's obvious that he didn't venture a block or two off the main street, where beautiful scenery is plentiful. And I would also add that this town is the friendliest place I've ever lived. If Bryson's intention was to come off as a big city elitist he succeeded.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|I was a fan of the movie and that is why I bought this.   This box set has lots of extras, behind the scenes, stuff about the music, lots of commentary , the original manga (in English) and even a piece of film.
0143038419|5.0|All I can say is I find myself laughing out loud while reading this book. Gilbert has such a hillarious snese of humor and is very matter of fact to a point of laughter.I commute an hour each way to work via train and I cant wait to go home today so I can read some more despite the funny looks I am getting from my laughter outbursts. This book was reccomended  to me by a woman I happen to have sat next to on a flight home from Vegas in December 07. She going through a divorce and me being already divorced got Gilbets humor and need for self discovery from the start. I am so pleased I took this woman advice and will now get the rest of Gilberts books to read when im done with this one. I already have two friends waiting for me to finish so they can get their hands on it. I love that she is the main charachter, I love how she wants to indulge herself in Italy as Ive been there and it is condusive to both eating and romance. As menitoned I havent finished it yet, but I dont look forward to finishing since I just want to read it endlessly. If you do not have a good sense of humor you will find it shallow and trite..so the likeability remains with you.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This package is awesomely entertaining with some of the best photography that I have ever seen.
0740748475|5.0|I have followed and read Calvin and Hobbs since it started.  I have the individual compilations, actually, I lent them to my grandkids.  The bound collection is superb, excellent quality.  I even gave a set to our adult daughter for her birthday.  Buy it!    Randall Evans
B008Q0DAXK|5.0|A well done movie and the director's cut gives further insight and scenes not present in the theater version, a definite plus.
0439882826|5.0|I don't normally cuss, but there is no other way to describe this book.  You do have to enjoy Star Wars to enjoy this book I think that goes without saying.  Children AND adults love this book and can't believe the intricacy of the pop ups.  It is mesmerizing.  It's a book with which I don't think we'll ever tire.  Yes, it's put away for now, but it will get dragged out and enjoyed for years to come.
0812975219|1.0|Poor treatment of a good subject.  The previous negative reviews were on target for me.  The Preface, Prolog, Chapter Summaries, Review quotes and other fluff take up the first 50 pages!  Save your time and money for something more organized, less catty and self-preening.  The attitude that comes through loudly is, if you don't follow or agree with the rambling thoughts in the disjointed chapters it is because you aren't smart enough.  There are many interesting authors out there I would love to have a conversation with.  However this guy is one of those insufferable folks who can't stop talking about how brilliant they are and how dumb everyone else is.  He tries too hard and it really hurts his credibility.  Ironically, in the \\"About The Author\\" section it says \\"In addition to his scientific and literary interests, Taleb's hobby is poking fun at those who take themselves and the quality of their knowledge too seriously.\\" (!)  This book is just part of the media \\"noise\\" mentioned by the author I wish I had avoided.
0440238609|2.0|While the book definitely had some enjoyable elements, I didn't feel it was as \\"epic\\" or \\"grand\\" as it was built up to be.  I felt the author does beat you over the head a little with his distaste for organized religion and a couple of the characters aren't consistently written through each of the books.      It was enjoyable enough, but definitely not a \\"desert island\\" book.
