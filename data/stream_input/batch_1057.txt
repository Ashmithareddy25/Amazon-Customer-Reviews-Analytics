B003VS0CYC|2.0|I swear that some guy in his basement with a DVD copy of Robocop ran DVDDecrypter, a blu-Ray burner, and burned it.  Buy the  DVD set.  If you want to see something on blu-Ray in the Sci-Fi genre, forget MGM and get a good Universal Pictures movie or series.  The original Star Trek series remastered on Blu-Ray jumps out of the screen in vibrant colors and hyper-realism.
1603425381|3.0|I specifically ordered this book as I have this author's other book on crochet design and throughly enjoyed that book.  I was not aware until I received this book how small this book was, only 5x7\\" 7\\" being the width and 5\\" the height. It's hardly worth even putting in the bookcase, it'd get lost.  Maybe I will have to store it in a drawer. Were the publishers trying to cut costs or what? I knew it was a paperback, unlike her other books and I was willing to overlook that as I liked her other book. As to content it is good but you can imagine that it had to be shrunk to fit this small book so definately plan on wearing reading glasses or using a magnifying glass to read the symbols!  This author's book deserved better service from the publisher, story publishing!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this was a great book. i could not put it down. i definitely recommend this book
0345477618|5.0|This and The Secret History of STAR WARS are two great books to own together. They're perfect companion pieces. This book details the making of STAR WARS soley and it's great at doing that. It's not mucked up with befuddled second hand info that contradicts things said and heard before it, it is straight from the source. If there's one word that sums up this book, it would be: legit. (Same could be said for The Secret History of STAR WARS.) Also, besides its 'legit-ness', this book is especially great for the pictures. If anything, this makes a great picture book if you don't want to read all the other stuff in here. If you haven't already, pick it up.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I SAW IT ON THE HALLMARK CHANNEL AND CRIED FOR 2 DAYS. I HUGGED MY DOBERMAN. THEY LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY. I HAVE TOLD EVERYONE ABOUT THIS MOVIE, AND I HAVE LOANED MINE OUT. EVERYBODY THAT I LOANED MY MOVIE TOO, IS BUYING IT OR HAS BOUGHT IT.  AND IT CAME FROM BONITA'S BARGAINS. THIS COMPANY SHIPPED REALLY FAST. I WILL ORDER FROM THEM EVERY CHANCE I GET.  THEY WERE GREAT!!
1607886278|4.0|The book itself is a little disturbing but well written. Overall I really enjoyed the book.  I got it on an audio cd and the last several chapters were missing so I had to return the cd and purchase the book to finish it.
B003WTE886|5.0|I am a huge fan of Swift, and I was really looking forward to hearing some new stuff. Well, she didn't let me down! There were slow tracks, (Innocent, Back to december, Dear John, Never Grow up, last kiss) and the fast tracks that I loved. (Mine, Sparks Fly, Speak Now, Mean, The Story of Us, etc.)I felt like she really grew in this album, and the beats of the songs were really catchy and got stuck in my head right away. My favorite tracks: Sparks Fly, Mean, Speak Now, Better Than Revenge, Enchanted and Long Live. Definatley worth the money to buy it, if you are a fan. I loved it!!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|After having heard one of their songs on vh.1, I ordered the CD. This band's music is probably classified as folk rock but I wouldn't pigeonhole them. The lyrics and the instruments they've chosen in making their music is something you want to listen to over and over. They aren't mainstream and that's what makes them unique and a completely enjoyable listening experience!
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|As someone upgrading blu-ray collection and of course that means action films, the importance has always been first and foremost picture quality, then audio and any possible new featurettes. The transfer quality of this BD, compared to my version of DVD, shows a bit of improvement. The most improvement is in the on-screen text. I agree with the top reviewer that a DVD player/TV with quality upscaling engine should do just as good of a job on the DVD.    But regardless, at $8 it's well worth the purchase to round up the blu-ray collection.    UPDATE: Per comment posted I have gone back to compare my DVD version with the blu-ray again, but this time looking for more details. In some scenes (past the initial 2025AD opening) there are subtle details throughout such as wrinkles on the skin that comes through well on the blu-ray, and I don't believe it's possible with up-scaling/anti-aliasing technology today. So for me now buying this blu-ray is not just \\"nice-to-have\\" but \\"great buy\\" for collectors.
B0007TKNIS|2.0|The first part of the movie was OK.  I had seen the show at the Kennedy Center years before, and loved it.  I had the CD for about a year, and played it all the time when I was driving to and from work. And knew all the songs and music.  I also bought the music book.       I couldn't wait to see the show, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was great.  I watched it today on a DVD I'd had for a couple years; maybe because tomorrow is Halloween. I was greatly disappointed after the first half hour. Parts of it were like the show and parts of it looked like they were just stuck in.  Most of it was pretty bad.  I didn't watch it till the end.  I prefer to remember the real show.  The movie was somebody's interpretation, and his interpretation had little to do with Phantom.    I give it 2 stars because some of the vocals were OK.
0312370849|5.0|Once I began reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  Sarah's key is another book to add to my favorite historical fiction list.  It makes the reader aware of a little known event in France's history during World War II and it's role in another one of the atrocities committed during this period of time.  The author's talent of connecting the past with the present in weaving this story together draws the reader into the pages.
B001AQO3QA|1.0|I just received my copy and had nothting but problems with the discs playing.  I have two Blu-Ray players - LG and Sony and both up-to-date with software.  Disc 1 would get have way through then freeze, when I went to restart it stated that I need to updated by Blu-Ray players software, but I am up to the latest on both players.  Disc 2 (Aliens) will not load, keeps saying check disc - both players.  Same problem with all the other discs.  I tried this with two friends, one with an OPPOSP83 and Cambridge 650BD, they had the exact same problems and their players were up-to-date too.  I called the number 1-888-223-4369 supplied on the bottom of the box for this set, after a long wait I was told it was my Blu-Ray player.  I told them it was 4 different players and then they said the software was not up-to-date, but I told them it was.  They said it was my problem and that was it.  Don't waste your money until they fix the issues with this release.  I am going to try and return them to Amazon.  I contacted LG and they told me other customers were having the same problem with these discs.  They are trying to find out if they need to send out an update to support these discs, but they think it was just poor manufacturing.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|This version of the Sherwood Forest saga is a winner. My grown son and I watched it together and were both impressed. The history up to the what the movie calls the \\"beginning of the legend\\" was new ground for the Robin Hood myth. Very impressive casting and acting. Both Robin and Marion were portrayed as real people, not cartoon characters.

I've previously ordered from other dealers who responded within a very resonable time frame.  Had I had an incling that this dealer was not reliable I certainly wouldn't have gone ahead and ordered. It's extremely aggrevating to have to go through no response to at least 3 requests.

B00004XPPK|5.0|Gilda may be the best classic film noir ever for a number of reasons, I mean the best of the black and white classics of the 40's and 50's. The many reviewers on this site have done a good job describing the plot, the passion, and Rita's unequal performance.  But Gilda is much more than that.  It is the incarnation of the 40's film atmosphere of elegance and romance.  We are in post war 1945 and the American film noir genre is blossoming, and ironically where?  Not in L.A. or N.Y. but in Buenos Ayres where ex Nazis populate the countryside. Another way to look at Gilda is through nostalgic eyes. You have to be old enough to remember the post war years of the optimism turned pessimism.  And in the middle of it comes Gilda, a movie that nobody would dare remake and stay alive, that gave us the once in a lifetime gift of the love Godess.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I don't know what I expected to see from this film. Actually, a lot of good times, sex talk etc... The plot was more serious about relationships. How each couple defined their own, not by tradition necessarily.   A good example had to do with the Anthony and Stanford's wedding ceremony performed by Liza M. Love is love! Of course, we couldn't forget Samantha and her sex drive which took us to the middle east which was a contradiction with the tv series and first movie!   Especially as they stone women to death and hang individuals over their sexuality in those barbaric, strict countries... Interesting story, to say the least. This is a grown up movie since they grow up as we all should do.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Just excellent reading.  From the mind and eyes of a child..reviting.. The bravery...The mental puzzles and reasoning..so different..made me think of several real life stories and how much more there is to such a life experience.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Im working at the place where these \\"books\\" are being made for the discs and well they look nice and all but for my preference I would of liked something more solid. The cover is sturdy and the sleeves where the discs go are glossy but essentially cardboard. The thing I loved is that the pages aren't overlapped with discs meaning a \\"page\\" only gets discs on the front not the back so it doesn't feel to crammed with discs. The other reviews are right about the bonus disc- it's at the back with its own page detailing all the special features. Overall this is a good buy but thats all I know from the packing not the discs.

0316098337|2.0|I too purchased this book based on the raving reviews from the NYTimes, but I don't think it lived up to the review. It was a very slow start to the book and I also found the 5 year olds perceptiveness and baby language to be dis-jointed and therefore unbelievable. Eventually, it gets going and get's interesting. You reach the climax of the book and then it's all downhill again. I finished the book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Because of the ridiculous Kindle price, I refused to buy this book and waited to read it until I could borrow from a friend.  I'm sure glad I didn't waste my money!  I only got about halfway through the book and decided I was not going to waste anymore of my time either.  Such a disappointment after Pillars of the Earth!  BTW, my friend who paid for the book is not going to waste his money and time on the next two in the trilogy.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Have the paperback version of the book and it was a real drag carrying it around either in my briefcase or gym bag.  It was my first purchase for my Kindle.  I was happily surprised that the photos are included in addition to the maps.  Now all I have to do is stuff my almost weightless Kindle into my carry around items.    Goodwin's writing can be a bit cumbersome and repetitious but she creates a superb profile of this brilliant present.  Also, although we know the outcome, she creates a suspensal image of the Civil War.    Even with some minor reservations, the book is completely golden.  I can't wait to finish it and read her book about the Rooseevelts.
B001N1DPDE|2.0|I originally gave this knife three stars (bad sheath, fat handle, overly heavy knife), but as I spent the hunting season with much better knives on my belt, I just had to revise my original review downward for this cumbersome, clunky pry-bar of a knife.    I have several knives that are more practical for my purposes (hunting and back country hiking) than this overweight blunderbuss - the best of these for \\"survival\\" purposes is an ESEE-6, but other than for chopping wood, I also prefer my ESEE-4 or my Helle laminated blade hunting knife for general purposes in the back country.  Hell, my Leatherman multitool is a better more useful knife than the BK-2.   I'm a little surprised by all the positive reviews and honestly I think maybe they were written by Kabar employees or maybe the reviewers have never really hefted a good knife.    The only thing this BK-2 has only two things going for it - it's cheap, and it's thick.  Here's my original review:  The knife is so stout you can chop wood - which also means it is really heavy, but overall I like the knife.  The sheath is very poorly designed.  I used the knife on one hunting trip and two of the 4 screws that hold the belt loop to the sheath came out.  Also the rivet holding the securing strap tore loose.    The worst thing is that when it was brand new - before a week of carrying it in the back country, the huge belt loop on the thing makes it impossible to pull the knife with one hand - you need to hold the sheath with one hand and pull the knife out with the other - jeez - what if it was needed in an emergency?    Very poor sheath design - I guess that's why the knife is being sold so cheap.

0312370849|4.0|I have read so many books about the holocaust, and this is a new detail of history that I did not know. With that being said. the book did not grip me as many of the others about the same time frame have.  I did not gain the respect or even feel I got to know the victim.  The writing was flat for me.  The most important thing I got from this novel is the history lesson; beyond that it is not the best-written novel on the subject. Read \\"The Enemy's Cradle\\" or \\"Night\\".
081297381X|2.0|Mr. Taleb has some really great points about scalability, predictability and the behavior of \\"experts.\\" Unfortunately, he also feels a need to continually remind the reader how much smarter he (the author) is compared to the pedestrian fools in academia, banking and government.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|This film really puts the arguments of the political right in perspective.  They hate big government although from Ronald Reagan on, their party has made GOVERNMENT huge, ESP. THE MILITARY.   WHAT'S THE STAT?  NOW THERE'S MORE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS LIKE BLACKHAWK HAVING MORE MILITARY FOR HIRE than we have soldiers  and they're killing civilians and running their little private prositution rings, all at taxpapers expense...and now that we've found out that Iraq was manufactured to help elect the worst president in U.S. history his job, it's amazing that there are still many on the right at all...except that we have a black president...and that may trump everything.     The big money that has been being funnelled into the tea party people is ironic since it is a very tiny per cent of Americans who make over $200,000. a year so MOST of those tea party people don't even know which side their bread's buttered on, because that big money is behind the tea partiers.    Moore helps anyone see....who wants to    that yes, government could get smaller...and certainly taxes could do.......but the most important thing is where does our money go?   I don't want my money going to help the rich...they're doing pretty ok in this country...I don't want welfare for the haves, something that George Bush actually said in another one of Moore's films..  When GW was at a big bash in D.C. he said \\"you're my people.  There are the haves and the have nots and we're the haves\\".  Well, the Republicans and the turn coat blue dog white guys have given up America to the haves.... Those with money say they don't like welfare but their tax breaks are government welfare...when they commit crimes and get off easy, their dough is buying them a type of protective welfare.  When they DON'T SEND THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS off to fight in wars we don't need to be in because THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS GET JOBS A WHOLE BUNCH EASIER cause of who their daddies or daddies and mommies are, that's a kind of prejudicial welfare...  Those who hate the unions don't know how extremely necessary those unions were for so long.  If you trust management more than the union, you're foolish.  We're known for not remembering history and it's been said that when we don't remember the lessons of history, we're condemned to repeat the mistakes.  Well, too many of the same old-same old has been repeated over and over...and the poor and middle class.....most esp. on the political right are being manipulated by the big money interests, which are sure as hell not in the best interests of the low income and middle class.

B0041T52S6|5.0|Scott Pilgrim may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend that everyone should give it a look. I definitely haven't seen a movie like it before and totally loved it. It's a bit rushed, but it's understandable, since the movie crams about 7 volumes of a comic series into one movie. I enjoyed Scott Pilgrim so much that I actually went to see it three times in theaters. This was the only time I actually went to see a movie multiple times in theaters, since I'm way too cheap to pay $10 for a second viewing most of the time. Support Edgar Wright and see this film!

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|One of the reasons I loved Sex and the City is because it explored modern feminism- with a healthy balance of comedy and fantasy.  The show wasn't afraid to explore taboo subjects.  Carrie Bradshaw played the part of \\"Tour Guide\\" in both asking the tough questions and taking the audience on a fun journey to find answers.  That being said, this movie completely missed the mark.  First, as many other posters have pointed out, there is no plot.  There's no burning question that Carrie is searching to answer.  Second, the girls have an opportunity to visit a country that has a very different view of women...and what could have made for a prime writing opportunity for Carrie, was completely ignored.  In reality, the government of Abu Dhabi wouldn't even let them film in their country...How different and interesting would it have been for the four of them to enter this country whining about the \\"stress\\" of children, nannies and TVs in the bedroom...only to realize that in Abu Dhabi, basic freedoms enjoyed by women in the West are not available to them?  How might they have viewed their lives and husbands afterward? Instead, this movie insults the audience's intelligence and is a waste of time.
1846611938|5.0|HERE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CVAs.<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Be you a barrister, or solicitor, or for that matter, accountant or academic -you'll need this book if you practice or advise in the area of company voluntary arrangements.<br /><br />The necessity of producing a third edition reflects the seven years that have elapsed since the publication of the 2nd edition, during which time, much has changed in this area of insolvency.  As the authors point out, the scope of the new edition has been extended to include the related area of administration.  In their considered and expert opinion, `the CVA procedure should be an important part of the toolkit of each insolvency practitioner (IP) seeking to provide solutions to companies and their directors and shareholders.'<br /><br />In similar vein, Richard Fleming, KPMG's UK Head of Restructuring, is referred to as being of the opinion that `consensual CVAs, without moratoriums, and used outside administration, could provide a low-cost, effective restructuring tool.'  Administration, he says, is a process which, `should be viewed as the option of last resort due to the damaging effect it can have on a company's value.'<br /><br />Offering a practical alternative in many cases to taking the administration route, the CVA should come into its own as one of a range of restructuring processes available. However, its characteristics, advantages and disadvantages are, for a number of reasons, not entirely familiar to many insolvency practitioners.  This carefully researched work of reference should therefore address the pressing need, especially in straitened times, for practitioners to acquire a deeper understanding of voluntary arrangements as compared with administration, which conveniently is also dealt with in the new section which has been added to the book.<br /><br />We welcome this expert collaboration between a licensed insolvency practitioner, an academic and a barrister who practices in insolvency because the book offers readers a useful tri-partite perspective -- covering both theoretical and practical issues -- on the complexities of this often fraught and vexed area of law.<br /><br />New material in this second edition covers the implementation of relevant provisions of the Companies Act which came into effect in October 2009.  Indeed the book covers every aspect of CVAs, from procedures, costs and creditors, to implementation, supervision, default, taxation and more.<br /><br />As one would expect, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, abbreviations and a detailed index.  Of immense practical, not to mention time-saving value are the eleven appendices which provide, for example, sample engagement letters, reports, statements and forms.  The book is up to date as of March 2010 and has everything you need to know about modern CVAs.ster who practices in insolvency because the book offers readers a useful tri-partite perspective -- covering both theoretical and practical issues -- on the complexities of this often fraught and vexed area of law.

B003UYV08E|1.0|What a waste of money.  I bought this for my son, an Iron Man fan.  We both expected far more than was delivered.  This movie disappoints on many levels.  Very little action, the acting is so-so, and if all the CGI was cut out, there would be no movie at all.  It starts out by giving you a little hope that it will be more action-packed than the first one (which was a total dud) with a car race.  But that ends in an eye-blink and the remaining 95% is non-action, until the final show down.  In between these two events is Robert Downey Jr. talking.  That about sums it up.  I will not buy another Iron Man movie until it's done by different producers, directors, scriptwriters, screenwriters, and actors.<br /><br />This one is also a TOTAL DUD.<br /><br />Editing note---3-21-2012--I apologize to everyone who read my original review referring to Spiderman instead of Iron Man.  Too much coffee.  Or maybe not enough?
1439138311|5.0|Great service and the book was like new even though it wasn't labeled that way.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is a great documentary on an extremely important topic. It drags out a lot of hanky-panky dirty laundry and points out a lot of lies and stupidity -- and the tempers will flare of the ideologues who helped get us into the current economic crisis/mess, but so be it. It also can give the average intelligent person a foot in the door to understanding the world in which we live and the background for the financial crisis, that in my considered opinion is not yet over. In fact no end is in sight. Only the shape of the slippery slope is uncertain.     I have looked into this quite a bit, and at first I thought it was going to be simply a super sort of Frontline documentary with great photography of Iceland American cities, etc. that integrated well with the interviews and narration.     I think though, that in the end they did a very nice job and there was a freshness to bringing together even the many facts that have been published here and there over the last few years.     I especially appreciated their preciseness about the clear warnings of the impending economic \\"tsunami\\" from respected scholars and the International Monetary Fund and European Finance Ministers and how these were brushed aside by the old-boy network of Washington and Wall Street. As they sing  in the Opera Evita, \\"When the money keeps rolling in, you don't keep books.\\" There were more warnings than they presented in the film. I would have included those by Kevin Phillips for example. But the film had enough to make its points.     I also very much appreciated that they brought out the really terrible conflicts of interest among professional academic economists at universities. They did not go deep enough for my tastes, but at least they got into it. In fact they could also have gotten into the very selective use of mathematics in academic economics, by these economics professors that get fat checks from the finances industry, in building idealistic models that can have too little to do with the real world. Instead the film focused on the cozy relationships between professors of economics, universities, and Big Money. They left out that university administrators love to see cozy relationships with business because it brings in money and connections and fame.     It was very interesting to watch big faces on the big screen as they were caught in their evasions and lies. Very well practiced people!! Usually not a flicker of guilt. Though a few did at times show nervousness when they were being caught.     After the film some of us discussed how it was possible that some of these culpable executives could have agreed to go on camera when they were so vulnerable. My theory is that they have gotten to where they are because they are smooth talkers. And they are egotistically self-confident that they can answer or deflect any questions. Moreover they are not used to giving interviews with media that has done its homework. In this respect I give the film makers credit for doing their homework.     The film did a nice job of tracing the origins of the crisis to the deregulation policies of the Reagan administration  in the early 1980s and what became the permanent installation of Big Money ideologues and players into the highest levels of government. They could have said more about how difficult it would have been to reverse these policies and undo the networks that were brought into power. They could have said more about why banking interests were able to sell their ideologies to the American people. But one cannot include everything. There was already a lot to chew on.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Balls to the Wall would break Accept in the U.S. and is their most successful album to date. This is the second of three killer albums the band would release between 1982 and 1985. While their previous album, Restless and Wild, was heavier, the songs on Balls to the Wall are stronger with not one weak track to be found. The band's performance is hungry throughout and Udo Dirkschneider's vocals are in top form. When it comes to metal anthems, it doesn't get much better than the title track. This is Accept's coup de grace and its more recent inclusion in video games and the movie, The Wrestler, proves its endurance. But it doesn't stop here. \\"London Leatherboys\\" is killer and nearly as menacing as the title song with its vicious riffs and their trademark ganglike backing vocals. \\"Fight It Back\\", \\"Love Child\\", and \\"Winners Are Losers\\" are heavy and relentless while \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Losing More Than You Ever Had\\" have a strong sense of melody that would really blossom on their Metal Heart album. \\"Guardian of the Night\\" and \\"Turn Me On\\" are mid-paced anthems that also work very well. \\"Winterdreams\\" is a strong ballad that closes the original album. On the remastered version, which has excellent sound, there are great live versions of \\"Head over Heels\\" and \\"Love Child\\" that were originally on the Kaizoku-Ban EP. Arguably their best release, (I prefer Metal Heart but this is pretty darn close), Balls to the Wall is a must own for fans of real metal.
0316017922|5.0|There is so much you can learn about becoming great from this book. You find that people become successful through a combination of taking advantage of circumstances as they present themselves, not from some 10 second fable of a famous person we might be told.
B000002KDS|5.0|Killer, along with Love It to Death, is the best of the Alice Cooper Group. On Killer, the band focused on gritty rockers and even more drama than before. The album is clearly a Bob Ezrin `70s production with its occasional use of strings and horns for effect and its flair for building drama through both tempo and mood (he did this on Kiss' Destroyer and even more on Lou Reed's Berlin). The first two tracks are the singles and what great songs they were. \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Be My Lover\\" are loose, loud, and super catchy tunes that still sound great all these years later. The tracks \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" continue in this vein and are nearly as good. \\"Desperado\\" is an excellent song and an ode to Jim Morrison and with its strings and Alice's monotone vocals during the verses, sounds like an outtake from the Doors' Soft Parade album. The remaining three tracks are drama personified. \\"Halo of Flies\\" is fantastic and in my opinion, the best track they ever made from a musical perspective. With drummer Neal Smith as the anchor, the track is a tour de force with tons of mood changes before its sudden end. This had to be a b**** to play live. \\"Dead Babies\\" is eerie and spooky during the verses before going into a memorable chorus that is truly a hint of the sound that Alice would adapt when going solo. The title track speaks for itself. Dennis Dunaway's bass drives this one while Michael Bruce and Glen Buxton's guitar provide the theatrics. More momentum changes along with a church organ provide the color before ending the album in a plethora of noise.

B003EYVXUK|5.0|Let Me In is a movie with heart.  You care for and about the characters.  That doesn't sound unusual for a film, but this is a pre-teen vampire movie (rated R).  You would assume that this movie would have characters out of comic books.  Not so.  The main characters played exceptionally by Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee will tug at your heart strings even though they are far from flawless 12 year olds.  But they were both drew bad hands and they are trying to deal with their situations the best they can. What would you do?

I'd say it has been the most influential book I have read. If anyone is struggling with a sense of purpose, this is the book. It's not a cheesy self-help book that is trying to make bank with your money by publishing garbage; he has a genuine and brilliant philosophy/psychology to share.
0385333846|5.0|Vonnegut's mother committed suicide, and Vonnegut himself was prone to severe depression, but it was his experiences in World War II that had the most dramatic effect on American letters. Marching across occupied Germany in December 1944 -- six months after the Allied D-Day invasion -- Vonnegut's Infantry division was pressing the advance into German-held territory when he somehow became separated from his comrades. For several days he wandered alone behind enemy lines until he was discovered and captured by Nazi troops on December 14. They transported him to the ancient and beautiful German city of Dresden, where he was imprisoned in an underground meat locker -- Slaughterhouse Five -- with six other Americans.<br /><br />On February 13th, the 60th day of his captivity, Allied forces began the legendary fire-bombing of Dresden. Generally speaking, Allied bombing raids targeted German infrastructure -- especially anything having to do with manufacturing or transporting munitions. If they knew the geographic source of munitions, they would obliterate the entire area -- this being decades before satellite surveillance and \\"smart\\" bombs. The bombing of Dresden is something of an anomaly in the Allied efforts: there was no manufacturing to speak of in Dresden, so it was not really a \\"rich\\" military target.<br /><br />It was, however, in a little valley, and over the course of the bombing, which went on without pause for two days, the bombs and the fires they started changed the weather in the valley; it became a chimney of sorts, sucking fire through it, and the destruction of Dresden was nearly as complete as was the destruction of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the Japanese cities incenerated with atomic bombs the next year.<br /><br />Vonnegut witnessed the whole thing, and survived. After the bombing stopped, the Germans had their few remaining prisoners gather corpses until this proved futile; they then went in with flame throwers and reduced the civilian dead -- numbering in the tens of thousands -- to ashes. In disarray, the Germans fell to the Soviet Union's troops three months later, and Vonnegut was liberated.<br /><br />This series of experiences fed into all of Vonnegut's writing, mostly in the form of a grim appreciation for the way an idea, social or scientific, can take on a life of its own, and demand that it be completed, no matter what the consequences. Most of his novels involve events that hurl forward even when no one seems to know why; they just accept it and deal with it. Regarding the bombing itself, Vonnegut once wrote, \\"There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\"<br /><br />Vonnegut was prolific, writing essays and stories throughout his life. He was also a tormented soul who once tried to commit suicide, but after his death at 84, in 2007, his friends and family mostly remembered his warm humor.<br /><br />Considered a classic of twentieth century literature, and included in both Time Magazine's and Modern Review's list of Top 100 Books , Slaughterhouse-Five showcases the idiocy of war in an original and darkly humorous way -- a feat that few authors have ever been able to accomplish. The story seems funny because it has no linear time line, and thus no ending; Billy Pilgrim, the main character, has \\"come unstuck in time\\", and he experiences times of his life -- and death -- in random order.<br /><br />Pilgrim survived the WWII bombing of Dresden in a meat locker, of course, called \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\", and his experiences in the war are juxtaposed with his marriage to the obese daughter of the optometrist he works for and with his drunken, late night attempts to re-connect with people who long ago forgot about him. He has also been abducted by aliens from the distant planet Tralfamadore, where he is kept on display under a geodesic dome in a zoo, making love to his fellow captive, the movie star Montana Wildhack, as the aliens watch in fascination.<br /><br />Throughout much of the novel, Pilgrim isderanged, either from shock at the horrors he witnessed in the war, or from the disorienting effect of being unstuck in time. At the end of the book, as an old man, ruminating on the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and distressed by the carnage of war in Vietnam, the time comes for Pilgrim to go public with his \\"unstuck-ness\\".  He does so on the radio, which makes him out to be an old fool. But the reader knows better. We know what he's talking about; we know what's happened to him. Pilgrim is not un-stuck in time; his world is un-stuck from morality.war, or from the disorienting effect of being unstuck in time.

B0032Y8XH8|2.0|Always looking for something new, I got this after reading all of the great reviews. After listening to the CD a couple of times, I doubt that it will make it to the playlist rotation again. There was maybe one or two tracks that weren't bad but overall I don't get what the buzz is about. Disappointing.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|Saw the movie today, on Halloween appropriately.  I agree with the general consensus.  If you liked the first one you'll enjoy the second, which has elements of both a prequel and a sequel.  In fact, if you didn't see the first one then I strongly urge you to do so before watching PA2, else it will likely make little sense to you.    The lovely and talented Katie Featherston returns in a diminished but nevertheless essential role.  But the main story revolves around her character's sister and brother-in-law, who have recently been blessed with a healthy baby boy.  Problem is, there's some THING that has a strong interest in the new arrival and starts to raise some literal Hell regarding it.    Most of the elements that made the first movie distinctive are in place again.  Everything is shot from the perspective of well-placed camcorders and security cameras.  We get to see a little more action this time, as the Entity that haunts this unfortunate family shifts into high gear.  There are several \\"gotcha!\\" moments where eerie stuff happens just as things begin to calm down.    The infant isn't harmed in any way.  I was very glad for that; that would have been crossing the line.  I can't say the same for the adult cast members, but it is a horror movie after all.    Nothing really to complain about for me, as I thoroughly enjoyed the first film and found this one to be very much in the same vein.  I did find it a little slow to get going.  There were also some of the quintessential \\"god, these people are stupid!\\" moments when you find yourself shaking your head, thinking that folks this dumb deserve what they're getting.  But the script does an adequate job of tidying these up and making the climax   believable enough.    Note to my fellow males: we get to see Katie in a bathing suit this time, definitely a nice image.  Enjoy!
0345505387|2.0|First, I must say that I am not really familiar with the graphic novel genre.  I found myself trying to rememeber the details of Outlander while reading it.  The Exile came up short for me.  I honestly wish that I would have waited to check this one out of the library instead of buying it. The Exile was a disappointment for me.
0812550706|4.0|[Addendum] I persisted with the book despite my initial misgivings, and much to my surprise, found it to be a persuasive & compelling read.      As already stated, I did not care very much for the crudeness that interjects the dialogs from time to time.  Additionally, I found the peripheral \\"pursuits\\" of Ender's siblings to be insubstantial (and not the least amusing) distractions from the main story.    However, I really came to empathize with and care for Ender & the outcome of his endless struggles -- both within and without.  The redemptive ending was nice as well.    -----    Not sure if its intended demographic are youngsters who are comfortable with crude language, but barely after the first three chapters, the profuse profanity is getting to be a bit too much for me.  I am debating whether it would be worthwhile to persist for a few more chapters in hopes that the story may really shine or abandon it at this point...

Would not recommend wasting your time on this.

Look up CD Japan & search for SHM-CD...
0679720200|5.0|This little novella is peculiar and utterly exceptional.  The way the prose moves form the spare, stripped down sentences in part 1 to the deeper and more expressive language later on, mirroring the development of the story, is just perfect.  There is no wasted motion, no excess, just a finely constructed creation that works on all levels.      I also found it sad and disturbing.  Camus is probing pretty much the darkest places human beings can go.  But it's great nonetheless.  The only thing I had trouble with is believing that a person like Meursault could exist.  An enigma for sure.
1439133948|3.0|This book takes place 9 years after the memorable events in [[ASIN:0671578855 A Civil Campaign]] and Miles is well and truly a married man.  He is sent to Kibou-daini to investigate some possible cryo fraud that was being set up in Komarr by a Kibou-daini company.  Once there Miles finds himself kidnapped and things finally start to get interesting for him. In this book Mile's story is told from multiple view points.....and suffers for it.      The zany craziness of the earlier books in the series that was one of the great attractions of Mile's stories mostly seems to be missing. Nearly all the other books in the series make me laugh at reasonably regular intervals throughout, something that seems to be lacking in this book much to my disappointment. That alone makes this book, for me, one of the lesser books in the series. It's real sting, and best writing, comes at the end of the story. There's no denying that this book is another turning point in the series, but as an auditorial outing, Bujold has done better with earlier books. It's hard to decide if it should get 3 or 4 stars, but it's certinaly not a 5 star outing, but is nevertheless recommended reading for established fans of the series.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|Oh man was this a fun movie!    At one point I leaned over to one of my buddies and said, \\"Best.  Movie.  Ever.\\"  Really.  Actually, it probably isn't the best movie ever.  But it was a nice throwback to the good old days of 80's movies that I grew up watching with the cheesy Schwarzenegger one-liners and over the top violence where the good guy wins and the bad guy meets his maker in some ridiculous way.      There are some over the top visuals that make it worth seeing and hearing; the sound was pretty amazing.  And by amazing, I mean loud.  Explosions you can feel in your bowels and that's not just the beef and bean burrito from lunch talkin' either.  Better than they could do in the Eighties.    They missed out on a rematch w/ Lundgren and Stallone.  I kept waiting for Lundgren to say, \\"I will break you\\" to someone but it never happened.  The Schwarzenegger cameo was cool, but he should have thrown someone out of a window or something.  Not happening these days.  Same w/ Willis; he really has no part in this and didn't seem too menacing to me which was also disappointing.  However, the rest of the cast delivered cases of canned butt-whoopin' as if they were FedEx.    Here's a typical scene.  Statham kicks the tar out of a bunch of knuckleheads:  in front of his ex-girlfriend who is dating one of said knuckleheads who, predictably, smacks her around.  Too bad for Knucklehead that her ex has more than a passing interest in her and happens to be in a bad mood when he learns of the abuse.  Bam.  Pow.  Smack.  Insert one-liner, get the girl back, ride off unharmed w/ hottie on the motorcycle.  I think people actually cheered at the fight choreography.  I mean, the whole movie is like this.  It's brilliant.      There are some good comic bits but really, it is simply a throwback movie done with bigger, badder explosions and a lot of your favorite tough guys from the era when action actors were immensely rugged dudes.  Muscles ruled, brains, not so much.      5 stars because I can't imagine that they could have recaptured the fun from the Eighties in a better way than they did here.  Don't take it seriously and enjoy it for what it is.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is a film with truly inventive three dimensional animation and a creative storyline that is full of life lessons for young and old. I was told that KUNG FU PANDA was \\"very Zen,\\" and it is. It's also fun to watch. It's anthropomorphic animal cast is endearing.<br /><br />Po (voiced by Jack Black) is \\"a big, fat panda\\" from the Valley of Peace, who works in his Dad's noodle shop as a waiter. His Dad (voiced by James Hong) is a goose whose fondest wish is that his son follow him into the family business. Po's Dad is awaiting the glorious day when he can reveal to Po the secret ingredient in his Secret Ingredient Noodle Soup.<br /><br />Po, for his part, dreams of being a Kung Fu warrior, and idolizes the Furious Five, a group of highly trained warriors taught by Master Shifu, a Red Panda (voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu's own Master, Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) is a wise old tortoise who warns Shifu that his renegade student Tai Lung (a Snow Leopard voiced by Ian McShane) will be returning to the Valley to exact vengeance against Shifu for having been passed over as the greatest warrior of all time, The Dragon Warrior. Oogway prophesies that the true Dragon Warrior will appear to defeat Tai Lung. Shifu, for his part, has none of the equipoise of Oogway. He is short-tempered and judgemental.<br /><br />The Furious Five represent each of the major styles of Kung Fu. Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) is their leader. She is egotistical. Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) who round out the group, each have small roles.<br /><br />Comes the great day when Oogway is to name the Dragon Warrior, and the designate-presumptive, Tigress, is shocked to discover that Oogway picks the totally untrained, physically clumsy Po as The Dragon Warrior. The rest of the Furious Five are nonplussed. Shifu too, has great doubts about Oogway's choice. The group is rude to Po and mock him at every opportunity until Oogway commands Shifu to train Po. The secret to Po's training is contained in the mysterious Dragon Scroll, which only the Dragon Warrior may have, and which Tai Lung covets.<br /><br />The animated action sequences are complex and realistic, breaking new ground in animation. The film is very visually appealing and captures a sense of a stylized Classical China beautifully. It is the storyline that truly shines, though, as the characters learn not to judge one's skills, talent and abilities---whether ally or  opponent or oneself---by appearances alone.<br /><br />In the same vein as THE KARATE KID, KUNG FU PANDA is a great movie for everybody of any age.to Po's training is contained in the mysterious Dragon Scroll, which only the Dragon Warrior may have, and which Tai Lung covets.

B0000AYL17|5.0|I was a Steely Dan fan from way back when their first album \\"Can't Buy A Thrill\\" was released. What a classic!! Back then there seemed to be endless talent in the music industry pumping out hit after hit on our airwaves. Who would of known that twenty years down the track the pop music industry would completely collapse. What went wrong?   These days we are limited to buying remastered versions of albums we already own while the FM radio stations keep bashing into our heads hits of the eighties over and over and over ..........  This SACD version of Gaucho is definitley an improvement in sound and worth buying.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|My sister-in-law and I are big fans of \\"Modern Family.\\"  We call each other after each show to laugh all over again at the lines and situations, share our pleasure in the pace, the writing, the cast, etc..  So we decided to splurge on the first season DVD, to do it all over again.  We were not disappointed.  We started in the morning to watch Disc 1, took a break for lunch, watched Disc 2, took a break for dinner, watched Disc 3, slept through the night, and finished off Disc 4 over breakfast!  And we could watch them again! - (maybe next year ;o))  Hope this show maintains its high quality (so far in the 2nd season it has) and stays around for years and years.

B0032JTV6U|2.0|Television shows have really been dropping the ball these past two years. Several shows that once dominated primetime and consistently kept audiences captivated fell apart at the seams, falling victim to contrived plot devices, plot holes, or just flat out bad writing. Dramas like Heroes, True Blood, and Desperate Housewives, and even comedies like Saturday Night Live and Family Guy just couldn't seem to maintain their greatness in recent episodes/seasons. Glee, sadly, is no different. The pilot was genuinely promising, poising itself to be a High School Musical TV show of sorts, albeit with a much wittier, more grown up tone. It focused around a slew of very different high school students progressively coming together and joining the Glee Club, squeezing in just enough plot to make time for at least two musical numbers each episode.     The first handful of episodes had ups and downs, but was a mostly strong blend of good music, good performances and sharp dark humor. As with most shows, however, once Glee became self-aware of its hype and notoriety, it blew into a fiasco of overacting, lazy writing and cheap gimmicks. The entire second half of season one is a nauseating mixture of offensive stereotypes and smarmy, predictable cheesiness. For a show that seems to pride itself in advocating the underdog, Glee embodies what it pretends to speak out against. In the world of Glee, all jocks are idiots and bullies, all cheerleaders are sluts, all blacks are loud and overbearing, all Asians are quiet and understated, and all gays are fashion-obsessed, straight man-stalking women wannabes. Kurt is arguably the greatest representation of all this, easily one of the most unappealing, stereotypical homosexual characters in recent television history; he metaphorically affirms virtually every assumption, stereotype and paranoia garnered toward the gay community.     Given that Ryan Murphy is among the core creators, it's no surprise that the show's humor has a bite to it, butthe jokes become overly venomous in the latter half of the season, with far too much of a focus on weight, sexuality, and a surprisingly large amount of borderline misogynistic humor. Young girls have enough things surrounding them today to induce insecurity, but Glee, ironically, for all its love-yourself-unconditionally sugarcoating and pretense, sends several contradictory messages. One episode, for example, makes a coldly unfunny joke about a school `Old Maids' Club' and invites viewers to point and laugh at a group of overweight, pimply girls right along with the rest of the sadly misguided popular kids out there. In addition to this, how on earth the extremely attractive Lea Michele is supposed to represent an ugly, unpopular girl (as explicitly described in the show) in this or any universe is beyond me.     The series loses its sense of plot as the season comes to a close, relying almost entirely on self-contained gimmick episodes with frothy, contrived, and of course highly ironic `believe in yourself' themes. The music, meanwhile, stays fairly strong toward the beginning, but as the show unevenly balances a wonky mixture of very contemporary hits with age-old showtunes and classics, it becomes a too-desperate attempt to please everyone, which of course ordinarily ultimately pleases no one. Lea Michele, Chris Colfer and Amber Riley are all genuinely excellent vocalists, but a large majority of the remainder of the cast are terrible singers, particularly male lead Cory Monteith. Delightful as she usually is, even Jane Lynch can't save this disaster.            In spite of what the public has been led to believe, make no mistake, Glee is not the underdog. It is just another face in the crowd of angry, condescending, hypocritical popular kids.
0312600844|3.0|New to the Franzen world so I thought I would pick this book up.  I like a good novel like anyone else, but this one seems to need a stronger editor.  The book drags for long stretches - but does have good parts.<br /><br />The tragic family histories and stories of Patty and Walter are something to read - kind of like driving by the site of a car accident.  You can't help but look, but you feel bad while doing it.<br /><br />That is the way this book felt to me - Franzen is obviously a good writer, but again, seemed like the book dragged - but by the time I realized this I needed to finish reading the book all the way through.<br /><br />High point - he accurately describes life in Minnesota - well done.

This was my introduction to Billy Joel, and while other reviewers have pointed out some omissions, this album has gotten me interested enough in him to WANT to look into more albums.    It takes a little while to dive into this completely, because this is so massive, but what's also convenient is that most of these songs seem to be grouped together by album, so if you like certain sections you know which albums to go after.    Look, diehard fans won't need this.  To those who have never experienced the magic that is Billy Joel, START HERE!

B002ZG997C|5.0|There's enough here on the story and the acting, so I won't go into those much.  To me, the unheralded star of this film is the cinematographer--this film is an amazing collection of images that are stunning in their power.  From the opening scene with the cat until the end of the film, we're treated to a fascinating display of segments that help immensely to establish mood, move the story forward, and keep us looking forward to more.  Anyone studying filmmaking should watch this to learn a lot about potential techniques.<br /><br />I loved the story, and the twist at the end is as good as the wedding ring in \\"The Sixth Sense.\\"  To the filmmakers' credit, by the time we learn what we learn, it's actually believable in a literary sense.  Who cares about logic and the definition of \\"impossible\\" based on our limited knowledge--this story takes us past what we think we know and gets us to thinking about what may be.<br /><br />Denzel Washington does a great job bringing us Eli, and the supporting cast also hits their roles dead on.  The violence is never gratuitous, and they do a good job of not rubbing our faces in it to shock us into repulsion.<br /><br />In spite of the reviewers who will have you believe otherwise, this is not a \\"Christian\\" propaganda film--all of the Bible verses quoted are from the Old Testament (except a bit of the Lord's Prayer, I believe), and the Old Testament is not of Christian origin.  Rather, this is a tale of true faith, of putting trust in God and seeing the benefits of maintaining that trust.  And no matter what our religious beliefs, this is one of the themes that has occurred in all types of literature since people began writing.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended as a film that will make you think and feel about life in different ways, a film that points out what life could be like if we lose all that we have--so let's appreciate it all while we have it, instead of taking it for granted!

0312600844|1.0|Sorry to say, I gave up on it around page 200. Seeing all the negative Amazon reviews helped me decide not to continue (merely to justify buying the hardback, which I don't usually do). I enjoyed The Corrections, but this was very different: the characters were not easy to like--or to care about--and the setting was bleak and flatly described. The writing was repetitive and dense, with long wandering paragraphs that just seemed to go nowhere very slowly. I can't comment on the plot, because I didn't get that far. I could hear my dad's voice saying \\"Sometimes you just have to cut your losses,\\" as I put the book in the Goodwill box.

0316098337|5.0|Just for this one....do not read the reviews. The least you know about this extraordinary book before reading it the better. There are many spoilers here and it would be really sad to have this compelling experience ruined. I was a little reluctant when I read that the book was written in the voice of a 5 year old. But I absolutely could not put it down. This is a parenting story above all else. Picture \\"The Road\\" being told in  the voice of the little boy....brilliant.Just buy it...today.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|This is a great movie, I love it!  A zombie movie that was intended to be funny!  I hope they make more!
080214473X|5.0|This book is just great what can I say. Its perfect for people who read a lot and for those who want a great story or looking to find a book once in  a blue moon to read when on a trip or such. For most readers once you get past the setting you will not want to set this book down. I read it before the movie came out, not sure if this version has anything extra attached to it. The characters being based on real people just make it so much more entertaining. The only sad part is reading about real people dying, and the terrible things that befall some of them. The movie is close to the book but there are a few things it got wrong. I will not say which as they are called spoilers for a reason. So if you liked the movie , i think you will really like the book. If you have never seen the movie, read the book then watch the movie. I think you will appreciate even more.  Hollywood does not get that many right, but this one was close enough. There are some slow spots in the book, but once the action starts you wont want to miss whats on the next page.
0307592839|5.0|Jennifer Egan's latest proves that the critical success of previous novels like The Keep was no fluke:  A Visit From the Goon Squad is a very successful experiment with narrative, utilizing Pulp Fiction type time jumps to tell the stories of a group of people in and on the fringes of the music industry, spanning the course of several decades.  Egan has a very firm grasp of what makes her characters tick, illustrating their habits and foibles in a variety of ways, whether it be through their actions, or even in the very way they tell their stories.  The best example of this is the seventy five page Power Point presentation titled \\"Great Rock and Roll Pauses,\\" which appears near the end of the book.  It's both highly entertaining and illuminating, propelling the narrative forward in an amusing, unusual, and almost jarring, way.  In retrospect, however, it's  entirely appropriate and satisfying, making this novel one of the more memorable reads of 2010.<br /><br />(Self indulgent side note:  my nominee for one of the \\"Great Rock and Roll Pauses\\"  comes around the fifty second  mark in the Cake song \\"Short Skirt/Long Jacket.\\" Just perfect.)
0982743726|5.0|This was definitely one I could not put down, I stayed up late several nights so I could finish it. Malik, the main character, is a complex man who struggles with his inner conflict and attempts to redeem himself when he finds siblings in need of help. You won't regret reading this fantasy.
055358202X|4.0|I began reading this series last spring upon learning it would be an HBO series next year.  I've never been much of a fantasy fan, preferring sci-fi or alternate history but when I heard \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" was \\"fantasy for people who don't like fantasy\\" I had to give it a shot.  Fell in love, of course.  AFFC isn't my favorite of the series but it's far from the one or two stars most people here are giving it.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is it's limited scope (only a few POVs this time out).  However, I can appreciate GRRM's reasons for doing this... yeah, it stinks that it's taking this long for book 5 to arrive, but that's the artist's prerogative.  Would we rather he be like Stephen King and crank out one mediocre-at-best novel a year for the last 20 years?      Hope the wait is worth it, Mr. Martin!  :-)
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie! It is perfect for Halloween and perfect for all ages. This is a good movie to watch during a Halloween party for kids, the adults wont get bored and neither will the kids. The zombie, Billy is a little scary for really young kids (3 and below), but the character is often times the favorite of many children.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough. It has a great plot, funny jokes, and isn't too long.
B0038QGXHW|4.0|This is as much a review of the discussion I've read here as of the CD in question (which is very good). I just wanna say what a great and thoughtful discussion this has been. A couple of posters could have been more respectful, but even they added something. I'm on the side of those who say, hey, I try to get past the noises, but sometimes I can't. It's hard to separate Jarrett's noisemaking from his general insensitivity. (He's the classic example of what a friend of mine used to call the \\"insensitive sensitive guy.\\") I remind myself that a fair number of great artists have been less than admirable human beings (Picasso, anyone?), but I have to admit that I feel a special, extra layer of affection for those artists who manage to be great but also decent human beings. (My compromise with Jarrett is that I continue to buy many of his CDs, but I refuse to see him in concert, where his insensitivity seems to be at its worst. I know, many will say I'm just depriving myself of a potentially great pleasure, but it's all right; there are plenty of other pleasures of all kinds for me to enjoy.) By the way, a great piano player who deserves a much bigger audience (and is, by all accounts, a great guy), is Marc Copland. Check him out.

He comprado todos los cd's de Shakira tanto en inglés y en español esperando la Shakira de antes y cada vez la veía mas lejos.  Laundry Service no estuvo tan mal, pero Oral Fixation, Fijación Oral y She Wolf son un total desastre (sobre todo She Wolf, trata de ser demasiado comercial y nada de nada!

6305127689|2.0|Early in his career, Tom Cruise developed a cocky, in-your-face persona that he used in film after film.<br />He played the cocky unlikable fighter pilot, the cocky unlikable bartender, the cocky unlikable NASCAR driver and the cocky unlikable pool hustler in movies that were limited by his character. Even in films that were saved by the superior performances of others - such as Dustin Hoffman in \\"Rain Man\\", or Paul Newman in \\"The Color of Money\\"- Tom still played the cocky unlikable character.<br /><br />With a handful of bizarre public appearances, he developed a nearly universal reputation, Sloane Crosley wrote in Village Voice, as \\"one spoke behind Michael Jackson on the freak wheel.\\"<br /><br />This is his cocky fighter pilot movie.<br /><br />I see one five-star review after another on this page praising the blu-ray version of this film, in particular the audio.  I am not reviewing a blu-ray experience - only the film - and I have to say that no soundtrack could make a silk purse from this sow's ear.<br /><br />As in many Cruise films, supporting parts are excellently cast and performed: here by pre-bald Anthony Edwards as Goose and pre-famous Meg Ryan as Mrs. Goose and Kelly McGillis as Top Gun instructor and love interest and Tom Skerritt as a Navy Commander who looks and sounds like a real Navy Commander.  Val Kilmer is more sympathetic than Cruise's character as his competing fighter pilot, Iceman.<br /><br />Aside from the just plain tediousness of the umpteenth iteration of Cruise's cocky-unlikable personna, the film panders shamelessly to the lowest, most testosterone-driven machismo.  An attempt is made to humanize Cruise's \\"Maverick\\" as Skerritt's character confides in Maverick that he knew his father back when he heroically saved three other planes in a dogfight \\"on the wrong side of the line of some map.\\"  This make's Maverick's father heroic, perhaps, but doesn't for a moment justify Maverick repeatedly crossing the line as an I'm-too-cool-to-follow-the-rules Hot Shot.<br /><br />In a telling scene Iceman confronts Maverick after a flight:<br /><br />Iceman: You two really are cowboys.<br />Maverick: What's your problem, Kazanski?<br />Iceman: You're everyone's problem. That's because every time you go up in the air, you're unsafe. I don't like you because you're dangerous.<br />Maverick: That's right! Ice... man. I... AM... dangerous. (The two actors stare at each other a moment in classic high school \\"MINE is bigger than YOURS\\" posture.)<br /><br />At this moment by the normal structure of movies the audience is supposed to think (and millions of brainless testosterone-driven men DID think) \\"yeah! You tell him, Maverick!\\" and the structure of the film, I guess, is that you're supposed to view Iceman as the villain?  I put a question mark on what should be a statement, because the character of Maverick is WAY on the \\"wrong side of the line\\".  Heroism and bravery and the ability to think creatively outside the box are still desirable characteristics in the military and in the human race, but in the military I've known for nearly 30 years carelessly risking your life, the lives of others and millions of dollars of government property doesn't make you a hero - it makes you the subject of courts-martial.<br /><br />I almost recommend the film only to watch Skerritt and Edwards and Ryan - she made her mark in the minds of millions in scenes such as the one where she orders Goose \\"take me to bed, or lose me forever!\\"  It's just too bad that the leading character of the film is so cocky and unlikable.ene Iceman confronts Maverick after a flight:    Iceman: You two really are cowboys.

Elvis and Ray gave us the enjoyment of music. Without them life would be pretty boring.   Bob
081297381X|3.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb has coined the now-popular term Black Swan to designate the disproportionately high impact that certain improbable events have on an overall data set whose populations were theretofore represented by a normal, Gaussian distribution.  The latter, he asserts has no use outside of concave sets (i.e. those whose entire realm of possibilities are bounded by a finite set of rules, for example, gaming).  The real world, he declares as virtually infinite in possibilities and accordingly incalculable in risk, a trait only worsened by our pathetically limited set of data points.  While scientists may spend many entire lifetimes collecting what are to us, vast quantities of data, they are limited by the inability to know very much of the past, as it is inaccessible to most inquiry.  Thus the circumstances that gave rise to known events, along with the true nature of those events are lacking in context, owing to a prior darkness.  Bottom line is we don't know enough to predict anything other than the very short term, and the very routine.      The foregoing is intellectually acceptable and intuitively correct to any who consider it without bias towards statistical regimes.  The Black Swan is a meditation more than anything else about the nature of existence, given that we have a world inclusive of fairly punishing realities that arise from apparently benign circumstances, the latter of which give us little or no guidance in anticipating the former.  Disappointingly, however, Mr. Taleb does little to deliver on his promise to help us spot black swans beyond warning us to look for them.  He finds traditional statistical methods absolutely fraudulent, and Mandelbrotian mathematics unequal to the task.  Himself an autodidact, Taleb takes various excursions to the rarified airs of high erudition, as he puts it, holding conversations with those minds he finds most felicitous to his views, disdaining the many with whom he disagrees.  In this, he has done nothingdifferent than the norm, which he also disdains.  It's hard to glean from him how we might do better.      Another quirk I noticed, since I maintain completely unacceptable theories of my own on the matter, is Taleb's easy acceptance of the theory of evolution.  He airily dismisses the countless glaring gaps in the taxonomy of species as incomplete observation, all the while admonishing the reader against such hasty conclusions about economics or markets when we are demonstrably ignorant of a complete information set.  I'm afraid we cannot have it to both ways.  Popular though it might be, evolution cannot claim royal privilege among possible explanations of the living world.  The vituperation with which mainstream scientists defend it should be a strong counter indication of its intellectual validity.  If nothing else, The Black Swan tells us to beware of Greeks bearing theories.      From the standpoint of practical application, perhaps what can be concluded from The Black Swan is that we should center on and be particularly observant of what can be known in this moment, thereby identifying what falls outside of this and thus be chary of that which might lure us to presumption about the unknown.  I frequently come back to Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy when considering the prospects of predicting human behavior.  In volume 2, [[ASIN:0553382586 Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)]], a figure who called himself The Mule arose who totally upset the forecasts of Psychohistory, because he had affective powers that were unexpected.  So, Asimov anticipated Black Swan appearances even against the heroic notions of his imagined predictive system.   A class of old sayings gets basically at \\"what you don't know can kill you.\\"  Taleb has given wings to this notion.  But we still don't know where it will take us.
B00005JOA0|3.0|The story starts out quite mysteriously and there is heavy speculation surrounding a new neighbor. The story goes on to unfold via flashbacks and it is quite riveting. I feel that the story builds and builds and then never quite reaches a peak. It kind of just peters out. I also think the relationship between our hero and heroine isn't fully developed. You never really understand why this lovely man falls in love with this brusque, unfriendly, unsmiling young woman. Should have been more there to make the relationship understandable. All told, a good story.
1439133948|3.0|I was a little underwhelmed by this release. Let me explain why: Books in the series have been about over-the-top space adventure, or about growing up and personal relationships, or both. Cryoburn has some of the former, isn't well executed in the latter. It feels like Miles is too burdened by his responsibilities to allow for care-free adventures, but nearly all of the interesting characters from the universe aren't on-planet for this book and have no chance to act. They seem to live on the sidelines, viewed through vague references.    Bujold shows her usual skill of making characters real and dialog life-like. A solid read, but not as sparkling fun as some other books in the series. It almost seems as if the book serves as a filler and delivery vehicle for the cliffhanger.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|24 is one of my all-time favorite TV shows. To give you an idea about what I think about this season, this is how I'd rank the 24 seasons:    #1 Season 5  #2 Season 4  #3 Season 3  #4 Season 7  #5 Season 2  #6 Season 8  #7 Season 1  #8 Season 6    Keep in mind that I think season 1 is tremendous and I have that ranked 7 overall. Season 8 starts off good, then it goes into a tailspin in which it seems to be sinking to the unwatchable levels of season 6. At some point just before the mid point of the season, it slowly begins to turn around and ends up finishing very strongly.

0316067938|5.0|Breaking Dawn is the engrossing final chapter of the story of Bella Schwan and her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen. In this story, Edward and Bella take their relationship to a committing level and enter the world of marriage. The two couldn't be more in love as they take their honeymoon on a secluded island where, by no planning at all, Bella finds out she is pregnant with a half vampire-half human baby and becomes very ill. Saving Bella is everyone's main concern, even if it means sacrificing the life of the child she bares. But there is a way, the only way, for both of them to survive. As if this doesn't create enough for the character's to deal with, there comes some unforseen danger that threatens everyone in the story.<br /><br />Stephanie Meyer's Twilight Saga has been a life changing series for me, especially Breaking Dawn. Before Breaking Dawn, my husband and I together loved to go and see the Twilight movies because he is more into movies then he is books. The movies had him hooked, and he and I both couldn't wait to find out what happens to the characters Bella, Edward, Jacob, Charlie, the Cullens', and Jacob's family so we listened to the audio book together. The experience of listening to the audiobook together, instead of plopped down in front of the t.v., brought us closer than we have been in our 7 years of marriage. But even without my husband in the picture, the story Breaking Dawn always kept me wanting more with it's excitment and danger around every corner. The author is a genius in keeping the audience engrossed in caring about all the characters, even the not so nice ones.<br /><br />The only critique I would have for Mrs. Meyer's on this amazing tale of vampire and warewolves, would be the ending. I understand the author's goal would probably have been to let the audience decide what happens to Edward and Bella and their new life together after all that was said and done,even the rest of the characters, Jacob and Nessie, the Cullens'. I felt the very end left too many questions unanswered and not enough information to let us imagaine where the final ending went. I felt there was enough left unsaid that there could end up being a 5th book in this series, but who knows, maybe that was the point!eft too many questions unanswered and not enough information to let us imagaine where the final ending went.

0517543052|5.0|The experience of being human will be different for everyone.  Not everyone can be expected to like the material within.  In my younger days I absolutely loved the message and was very in to focusing my attention on this and similar works for personal development.  I no longer use it as a point of focus, but only because I have changed personally.  Maybe it will have importance that will bring it back in to focus later.    This book is highly illustrated.  The pictures inside help form the ideas that are being communicated.  They are very much in a style that would remind most of late-1960s hippie art; however, when you give the pictures some consideration you can also see that they are basically just natural recurring forms and symbols that have been in long use.    I still enjoy the winding prose contained in the pages.  It is fun to pick up on occasion and just pick a page to read.  At this point in my life I like it purely for its ability to give me a smile and a chuckle; although, I am certain there are still modern readers who would be able to get a more spiritual trip out of it if that is what they are looking for.

Only read this if you are post-modern sadist who enjoys reading unfinished stories about human suffering.<br /><br />Allegedly the fourth book was finished in 2005 but was split in two because it was too big to publish as a single volume, but five years on the supposedly completed  \\"second half\\" has yet to appear. Given the popularity of these books and the upcoming HBO series, you gotta assume at this point that Mr Martin is unable to finish it for some undisclosed personal reason - health issues, terminal writers block, unavailability of a secret co-writer - who knows? In any case I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this wretched thing.
B001UHOWXI|3.0|I love this movie and we watch it every holiday season a couple of times over. The only reason I give this three stars is because it's still in 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. With all the other older movies being released in 1.78:1 (16:9) blu-ray, why isn't this one?

B001NESPHC|4.0|I have been simply entranced by Gardot as a singer. I love her voice, a little quirky, but with great character and feeling. I love her sensibilities, too, her turn of a phrase, her ability to make something of nothing. After listening to this CD, though, I was left wanting a little more. As interesting and as atmospheric as it is, it was sometimes a little monotonous, too, and I have to confess I didn't like all the material quite as much as the performer and performance. The oldie standards worked best. That's not to say I disliked it--it's still fine. This s a relative comment, not a major critique. But I think there is some upside potential not fully realized. She is a terrific young talent. I can't wait for the next one.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|I've always loved this movie and finally decided it was time to get my own copy. Very strange, and sometimes makes you feel like you're on an acid trip while watching it.

B001DE29SS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. was robbed of an Oscar when the votes were tabulated. This is an extraordinary performance about an extraordinary man. This film is about someone who was the most popular film star in the world during the first part of the 20th century. Chock full of stars, this Richard Attenborough directed film shines in places and in other spots, tugs at your heart. This film portrays only certain parts of Chaplin's career and is an overview of his entire life as he wanted us to see it, not as we know it, now. Remember, if it wasn't for him, we probably wouldn't be watching the films we watch today and wouldn't be shopping on Amazon.com!
B002ZG9968|5.0|You will laugh out loud! I think women and men who are close to or thinking about having a family will really appreciate this too.
0066620996|5.0|Extensive research, simplicity of presentation and insight into so many Good to Great companies. A must read for all who want to understand lot about fundamentals of how business are run. I was skeptical when I saw Circuit City, Fannie Mae and Gillete, but as it is aptly conveyed by Jim and his team - principles are timeless and all of them are faced with testing moments of revolution.    Great book
B0031RAOW8|2.0|The dog's owner's daughter lets the dog take off on his own to live the next TEN YEARS of its life homeless, outdoors, by itself, doing one thing - obsessing about it's dead owner. The local people give it hot dogs and this and that and ostensibly look after it, but its life sucks - until finally it keels over, late one night, by itself, in the middle of winter. Fabulous! I think the owner would have preferred the dog to, uh., move on (!) and have the happy life it would have had with him, except with someone else. Am I taking this too seriously?! Not really, when you think how many idiots out there abandon animals, thinking they'll be just fine on their own. What kind of message is this? That absconding with one's responsibilities is okay?! They couldn't think of another way of showing him maintaining his loyal watch without having to have him live this crappy life? In someone's romantic, deluded head, that ultimate loyalty makes for a great story. It ruined the movie for me. The message I took from this movie (other than how clueless people can be - I'm thinking mainly of the writer here...) was the importance of moving on. And of not watching anything that might be on the Hallmark channel.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I've been a fan since I had to order the first album (Not of this Earth) from the local record store. A great variety of genres and rhythms on this album and I have to say it's one of my favs already! As always listening makes me want to run out and start guitar lessons!
B00003CXIY|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious. I watched it three times the first day I got it and endless times after that. It will have you laughing hysterically! Definitely worth the money!
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Worth your time, but no hurry. I have every Connelly book in hardcover, going all the way back to the first Harry Bosch. There are fine moments here, and the cast of characters (Bosch, Haller, Rachel Walling et. al.) are as familiar as relatives over the holidays at this point. There is nothing \\"wrong\\" with the novel, Connelly is too masterful a writer to allow that to happen, but sadly this doesn't rank with his best. The ending in particular felt like a letdown.
B000I9YLWG|5.0|You still don't know what it means for a movie to be Hitchcocky? Well, then I would want to suggest you to watch \\"Psycho.\\"   I recently watched this classic movie by Alfred Hitchcock in my Film Analysis class. Before watching it, I thought I wouldn't be entertained by it as it is black and white and made in 1960's. However, I was wrong. As I was watching the movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! Perhaps, I was more shocked while watching this movie than any other horror movies I've ever watched. The sound effect was very impressive and it doesn't mean that any other aspects of the movie weren't. They all just played a perfect role in making this movie a masterpiece.   I can't believe this was made in 50 years ago. \\"Psycho\\" is certainly the textbook of thrillers, and I think I will still be shocked if I watch it again 50 years later.
0061914177|4.0|Interesting, dynamic, entertaining and simple. Goes well down the throat as well as Gary's popular wine show. 140 and some pages are to be read in few hours and for price of 13,6 USD that I payed, it gives very good value for money. Content of the book offers very good insight to how mr.Vaynerchuk uses social media and internet in general to promote his business. Very informative for the beginners, but for all others who are more into it some new additional hints are possibly to be discovered and new inspiration will be given. Once again: inspiring, informative and entertaining. Sincere most of all. Since 5 stars are reserved for the masterpieces this one gets an excellent 4 stars!
B003W5C0VW|3.0|I would call the quality level of this disk \\"about bootleg.\\" I'm grateful to see ANY footage of live Stones from this era but the lighting and camerawork \\"are what they are.\\" Maybe this is why it wasn't released years ago. A bit disappointed that Keith is in the dark the whole song of \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" I would have liked to have seen at least a few clear seconds of Keith playing guitar on each song from a straight-on view. I realize after having watched it, though, that this was the early days of big concerts so things like lighting and filming concerts hadn't come together yet. And I still prefer this old bootleg look over the modern practice of strobing between multiple cameras every second and the overuse of big swooping pans and zooms until you get queasy.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|It looks like a dumb movie, but its simply one of the best movies i've seen since The Dark Knight. Loved it. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
1439181780|5.0|When Rhonda Byrne published THE SECRET, I saw extreme feelings about it. True, there were some middle of the road opinions, but most either loved it or hated it. I was in the love it group. I'd never heard of the Law of Attraction or maybe I had, but my mind continually deleted the information. After reading THE SECRET, it was like a whole new world opened for me. I stayed on that pink cloud for a year or two. The reason is I read other books too. I was busy with other books that it never dawned on me to check whether or not this author had a new book.<br /><br />Finding THE POWER has put me back on that pink cloud of happiness, but this time with more substance. This book gives more detail into how to make the Law of Attraction work for you. Yes, there are other books out there saying the same thing. Let's not pretend there isn't, but I just happened to love the way Rhonda Byrne explains this concept.  Even before I reached a quarter of the way through, I felt empowered. If I want things to be different, then I have to change my attitude. In other words, it begins with me.<br /><br />If you loved THE SECRET, I can't see how you wouldn't love THE POWER even more.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Noticed a review in the Guardian after the 1st episode appeared on Bravo.....as someone who likes epic movies, and remembers fondly the portrayal of Kirk Douglas in the 1960 film version, read the review and thought I'll tune in to the 2nd episode! The storylines are superb, fleshing out the characters as the series progresses. The cgi graphics, enhanced the gore effect, and the choreography of the gladiators is excellent! The participants are not only actors but well honed athletes!         Andy Whitfield, Manu Bennett as the 2 main protagonists, are well matched, and the acting by John Hannah, and Peter Mensah, is brilliant. Lucy Lawless, and Viva Bianca, are superb in 'supporting' roles, cranking up to the tension to the final episode.         The dvd contains the whole 13 episodes, and an additonial section which has speaking roles for the main actors who explain how the film was made, the director's thoughts, and their feelings as the screenplay progresses.     The scenes of nudity are extremely well done, without been pornographic, but convey the pecking order of Batiatus and Lucretia, the gladiatorial roles, enjoyed by Spartacus, Crixus, Barca, and Varro (a superb cameo) and the slaves that attend to the gladiator's needs.        This is the best series that I have watched since the days of 'The Wire' and 'Homicide Life on the Street' which were completely different genres.        It left me eagerly awaiting the prequel out in the New Year, where we learn of the origins of the main characters.......Buy this series, if you want to be entertained, a definite 'must have!'        Allan Dawkins
B003U0AHBO|4.0|Another Robin Hood ... you bet! Why ... because Russell Crowe had not yet played the role. Do I like it better than Errol Flynn's ... nope. Do I like Errol Flynn's better, nope. The various Robins are different. Crowe is terrific, the story good, the direction, etc, etc all good. No weaknesses with this film. Just watch it and enjoy it. I cannot wait for the sequel. And, maybe the best for last ... Cate Blanchette as Marian ... hubba, hubba. Cate is simply great. You don't want to miss this one.
1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot dialogues an amazing trip from her first hearing about HeLa and becoming fascinated about knowing more about the woman behind the cells.  As her fascination grows she takes her credit cards and student loans to fund her desire to learn more and in doing so meets the amazing family of Henrietta, including building a strong friendship with Henrietta's daughter, Deborah.<br /><br />I appreciate Rebecca's drive and her ten year commitment to this book that is not only a wonderful tribute to Henrietta, but to her family as well.<br /><br />I find as time goes on I become more and more engaged in reading memoirs and non fiction.  I have developed a strong thirst for knowledge.  I started listening to this on audio about a month ago and as the book progressed I started asking people I knew if they had ever heard of Henrietta Lacks.<br /><br />Nobody had.<br /><br />I am so thankful I had the opportunity to experience this read and I would highly recommend it others.  The writing is engaging, I never found it to lull, and it left me with a strong knowledge of cells as well as Henrietta Lacks.  HBO is planning to make a movie about Henrietta Lacks and her cells.  I for one will be anxious to see it.
1400067936|4.0|The book has many interesting tidbits and the subject is worth considering, but it is too unsystematic, and sometimes repetitive. The author doesn't make a point nor deliver a forceful case. Good read, not too much left to digest after reading.   I enjoyed the ending, the part where randomness is treated philosophically, the most - it provides a link between what you can call absurdism, and stoicism, something I didn't consider before.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This is the best season of Dexter I've seen so far. John Lithgow gives an unforgettable performance. I can't wait to watch Season 5.

1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath was a great book that analyzes the qualities of messages that generate staying power and conversely, those that can cause a message to go in one ear and out the other.  The book is in a way a tribute to the idea of \\"stickiness\\" that was discussed in Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point.  As he points out, the quality of a message doesn't determine its success, the way in which it is presented is the key to whether or not it will resonate with the intended audience.  While Gladwell illustrated the high level importance of stickiness, the brothers Heath take things a step further by providing concrete ways people can apply a stickiness blueprint to their communication efforts.  Overall, the tools in this book seem clear and easy to use, and when applied, can lead to more impactful and effective idea sharing.      The tenets of stickiness, as outlined in this book, are Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotional, Stories.  Each of these factors plays a different role in making a message more powerful and more memorable.  They seem to be common sense, but as each chapter took a deeper dive, more and more unique examples were discussed which helped make this book helpful and fun to read.  One of my greatest takeaways is to always be considerate of the \\"Curse of Knowledge.\\"  People can really get ahead of themselves by assuming that data will prove their message, but ultimately the more you put out there, the less effective the message will be.  Sticking to the \\"SUCCESs\\" template can really help amplify a message or idea and enable it to achieve the desired results.    I work in advertising and have heard of this book before, but I always figured that it would be just another way to generalize the messaging process that our team already goes through, so I never took the time to read it.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by what I was able to take away from it.  I'm excited to apply some of these ideas to mydaily work.     Overall, I thought Made to Stick was a great book that was easy to read and very helpful.  Many of the communications books I have come across in the past have been too generic and theoretical to apply to my daily work.  However, this book leverages one of its core tenets and truly makes things concrete.  The book was well organized and provides great templates that can easily be put to use.
B000000W6F|5.0|As is often the case with bands, Gish was their first and their best.  Prior to the first release a band might actually have many songs already written and they may have been written many years prior to the first release.  What is likely to happen is these songs have a chance to \\"marinate\\" and gradual improvements are made over time.  When it is time to record the first release a band might actually have several disks worth of material so the \\"greatest hits\\" make the cut on the first disk.  Subsequent releases use the material that may not have been as good and the other new songs have not had the chance to \\"marinate\\".    Gish is simply amazing and I am not surprised that it was never equaled.  The Pumpkins probably would have had to wait about 5 years until the next release before they had the material to equal Gish and a record company is not going to let that happen.  Ground breaking when it came out and a sound that has been copied by many bands.  Incredible depth and complexity.  My recommendation to those new to the Pumpkins is buy Gish and the greatest hits even though some Gish songs are on the greatest hits.  The fact is Gish should not be broken up but needs to be listened to in its entirety.  Mesmerizing!
0060855924|5.0|I read this book ages ago in Russian, now I finally got to re-reading the Discworld in English. This is one of my favorite books of the cycle, then and now. What can I say? It is funny! Pratchett has the best treatment of heroic fantasy there is.
0765326353|3.0|I've read the Mistborn books, Elantris and Warbreaker.  I've also read the one released Wheel of Time book authored by Brandon Sanderson.  Brandon Sanderson excels at clever and rational magic systems, complex world building and writing many words without being repetitive or seeming like he's being paid by the word. He also did an amazing thing with the Wheel of Time in that he told a great story and still managed to cut out the excessive ramblings favored by Robert Jordan and RJ's second rate editor.     The only issue with Brandon Sanderson is that I sometimes find his conversation awkward and his characters a little less than three-dimensional. Warbreaker especially was a little wooden in delivery, it seemed to me (although I thought the Warbreaker plot was fantastic).  So I went into the Way of Kings with some trepidation, but knowing that I'd probably like it regardless.  Unlike many, I had no feel for length or size of the book as I bought an ebook. I knew it was long as I'd read in his blog about how it would be epic in size and length.  It sounds like I made a good decision and that, when it comes out in paperback, no normal book glue will hold it together.    The book started out slow.  I didn't care for Shallan at first.  However, her development was interesting and I found myself interested despite her slightly difficult-to-believe motivations.  Kaladin also felt somewhat contrived at the beginning.  I made headway slowly.  I liked Szethe, despite his silly name.  I also found the Adolin/Dalinar characters difficult at first.  Everyone felt a little contrived.  I say this because I want you to know that the book gets better.  The characters do grow over time and become more interesting.  I suspect that my re-read when the next book comes out will show me liking the characters a lot more because I already know them.    The world building is complex and interesting. The evolution of the natural world, in reaction to the strong elemental storms is fascinating and I love that he comes up with this stuff.  Politically I was lost for some of the book.  Light eyes and dark eyes were ok, but there were some shifts between cities and people that I wasn't always following.  It did all come together in the end though.  Again, a re-read will probably bring me much satisfaction.    The hints of history revealed throughout the book offer increased depth.  I can see that this story will be long in the telling.  Some of the plot reveals at the end were unexpected (although I don't tend to over-analyze until after a book is finished)and made me excited for the next book.  The ending of Kaladin and Shallan's plot lines were interesting, satisfying and even a little heartwarming.  I found myself liking just about everyone at the end.  I admit to a preference for Dalinar which probably means he's going to die horribly in a book or two, knowing my luck.  I also liked Jasnah quite a bit.  Adolin might grow on me with time.  We'll see.  He has potential.    A few awkward moments that were really jarring for me: at two different points in the book, two different characters used the word, \\"Wow!\\"  I'm not a fan of modern slang in my fantasy novels and it took me a while to get over it.  There were a few different slangy spots in the book.  Those spots, along with Shallan's iffy plot motivations and some wooden characterizations at first are what contributed to my 3-star rating.  However, I went into the book with expectations very similar to what I found and was in no way disappointed by The Way of Kings.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to someone who likes dense books with complex world building and political situations, as long as they were willing to commit for the long haul as we wait each year for a book to come out.    It's very likely that this series of books could progress to a 4 or 5-star rating in my overall repertoire.  See my profile for how I rate books.  A 3 is very good and I'd go so far as to call it a 3.5.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|Saw #7, the supposed final chapter of ridiculously elaborate traps and gory redundancy. It does add up to some fairly awesome, sinister fun. Not much to really hack or slash this particular one away from the rest of the bloody pointless franchise, aside from the visual 3-D gimmicks. Don't be expecting some deep, revealing closure to give the entire story some greater meaning or purpose. But it does have a higher budget (17 million) and delivers plenty of blood and repulsive human carnage. Anything less would just be barbaric.<br /><br />You will see some familiar faces here, but the main new character is Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery). He achieved quasi-celebrity status by falsely claiming to have survived one of Jigsaw's traps. Bad idea to mock a homicidal lunatic, as Bob's lies will soon become a reality.<br /><br />In case you somehow don't know what's in store here, there is plenty of hacksaws ripping flesh, buzzsaws chopping off limbs, and circular saws viscerating all hope from sapless victims. There are some other deadly traps where survival is just not looking too promising. It's some good gooey pleasure for you morbid gorehounds, lots of graphic entrails removal and unpleasant disembowelment to make you wince in delight. You timid viewers should definitely avoid this deranged adventure, of course.<br /><br />As far as the 3D goes, it does look kinda cool I suppose but it doesn't add much to the overall experience. In fact, it detracts from the realism quite a bit.<br /><br />So overall it's more of the same here. This final Saw delivers exactly what you should expect. Not exactly an incredible way to close out the franchise, but there really isn't much more you can do here.<br /><br />Fun, but not much new. 3.5 stars

Excellent live recording, I normally dont buy live recordings cause the sound is'nt exactly pristine but this one is clean and crisp..

B003LWN8F8|5.0|I just love this record.  I am not really into bubblegum pop yet somehow Marina has me sold. She has the most beautiful, haunting, incredible voice and on top of that, her music is fun and catchy at times and other times deep and emotional. It is refreshing to see a young pop star actually write her own music and write about her obsession and motivation to succeed and not go on and on about sex, drugs and superficial relationships. This girl has attitude, a point of view and tremendous talent - I expect amazing music from her in the future. I hope she releases a live concert on DVD...I would love to watch her perform live.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I always liked the original Predator film, but I felt the sequel Predator 2 while an interesting idea, was too heavy on comic overtones and the film suffered severely for it. Predators returns to a more serious tone and almost seems more like a remake than a sequel. Other than some advances in the FX department and the jungle being on another planet it is essentially the same film. The good news is that is is every bit as good as the first film with a solid acting cast and quick paced action! The story is easy to follow and they waste zero time getting to the fun. Adrien Brody is no Arnold, but he makes his role as believable as possible.<br /><br />I could not find much wrong with this film as action films go, but it does seem like we've been here before. If you like fast paced action and looking at some of the coolest monsters ever created, Predators is a sure fire sci-fi blast and a fun Halloween flick! Happy Halloween from yours truly Dr. Shock! ;-E

B000ICLHIE|5.0|If you already love Tom Waits, you'll love this like I do. If you don't, find some kindly friend to introduce you to him slowly. Most of us have our preferred eras of Tom, and this sprawling compilation is a Frankenstein's monster of multiple Toms. There's an even split here I'd lump into 3 categories: a) songs I never knew before i couldn't live without, b) songs I leap across the room to skip past every time, and c) songs I could care less about.     i have to suspect that most other Tom Waits fans who purchased this have a similar breakdown. The thing is, probably none of them have the same songs in the same groups as each other. that's just the way of it, take it or leave it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I really get annoyed when the reviewers seem too lazy to do their homework. The \\"deerstalker\\" hat so commonly associated with sherlock holmes was never ever mentioned in any Conan Doyle novel (and yes, I have read them). The \\"public school\\" scarf is a much better affectation and much closer to the real character. All up a totally enjoyable (almost believable?) rendition (sorry for the bad word) of a timeless classic
B00006ZXSK|5.0|We loved this movie! This version of Cinderella is a sweet tale that adults will enjoy as well as younger kids. We used this in our homeschool history class as we studied the Middle Ages/Renaissance. The kids were captivated and wanted to watch it over and over. The scenery and costumes are great. It also shows a lot of history as far as studying the social classes and how divided they were even by law. I highly recommend it as a way to add some fun to your learning or just for a good movie night.
B003954I9C|5.0|A style different from the Backstreet Boys but just as AMAZING! Love his voice and all the songs, can't really choose a favorite cause they all stand out so wonderfully! By the way the description says it wrong when it says he's a former Backstreet Boy, he still is :) they are going strong.
B002C1BHJ8|5.0|Installed these cables to my tv and didn't notice a difference compare to the monster cables I have. If I need cables again, I will buy  amazon basics. Great price for the amount of cable you get.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has, especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco, a homely, white-haired, rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot, which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country, but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere, there are good and bad people in the country, just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie; not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie, you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair, even at 17.  And some dirt; she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness, cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a \\"must see\\" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times, as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example, \\"Teardrop\\", the brother-in-law of the main character, sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie, buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie; 5 stars for the soundtrack.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I love the reference to the earliest days of the motion picture when Dracula hides out in the darkened cinema.  Though, I believe not in Bram Stoker's novel -- I think this is historically accurate.  It was, toward the end of the 19th century,  that movies, having evolved out of other forms of entertainment such as the \\"magic lantern,\\" came in to being.  A nice touch, and a great new way of telling this story.
B001YV502C|1.0|In contrast with the huge amount of positive reviews on this movie, I have been very disappointed by it.     As regards the scenario: the first 20 minutes are unclear as to what the movie is about. Next, the movie varies from an action movie to a drama, and from a movie filmed as a standard movie to a participatory movie (like [Rec], Blair Witch Project...). This makes the viewing relatively annoying.    As regards the picture quality: the blu-ray edition offers a very good quality. However, on two points it fails surprisingly:  1. in a few scenes, when the camera moves around a circle, there are several jerks in the picture transfer.  2. in one scene, there are spatters on the camera lens. Instead of filming the scene again, the production has kept the few minutes filmed with a stained camera. This is unacceptable in a professional movie.    As another reviewer (K. Harris) wrote it:    \\"While not a blockbuster, by any standards, this unconventional film was all but abandoned by a studio that didn't know how to market it. Positioned for release during prime Oscar season, this is not a film that was backed as a potential nominee.\\"

0061122416|5.0|The last word I expected to use is \\"real\\" in describing a book about a search for buried treasure, yet that's the word that best defines The Alchemist.  Santiago's story is an allegory for how many of us live our lives here in the real world.  We assume wealth will bring happiness or at least comfort, but soon we learn to look for a more profound happiness - love, peace, and a purpose for living.    Coelho's style in delivering this tale is very simple, much like Hemingway's in [[ASIN:0684801221 The Old Man and The Sea]].  A more surprising and appropriate comparison might be with the parables of the New Testament.  Both seek to enlighten in terms their audiences can understand.    In the end, the book makes you think about your own life.  The questions it provokes may not be easy to answer, but the answers are worth seeking.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|The basic idea of this movie is that earth is in ecological ruin by pollution sometime in the future. So humanity decided that we needed to spread humanity to another habitable earth like planet to ensure humanities survival. A giant ship is built as humanities last great hope. The ship is stocked with thousands of people and every resource needed to found a colony on the new planet they are headed for. The colonist take the century long trip in cryosleep while the ships flight crews take 2 year stints piloting while alternate flight crews are in cryosleep.<br /><br />This movie starts with one of the flight crew members coming out of cryosleep to find a somewhat empty malfunctioning ship with carnivoristic creatures roaming the dark corridors. From here the main character must find out why the power core is dangerously malfunctioning and what happened to the people of the ship.<br /><br />I really like this movie. Its a futuristic sci-fi movie that strayed away from the bright CGI that modern sci-fi movies are notorious for.<br /><br />And having a darker element to the movie without it boiling down to a bug hunt was definitely a plus.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies of the year.

B000007XUQ|5.0|The second half of my teen years were listening to Karen & Richard. As poor as a teenager can be, I still managed to purchase six of their albums.  The Christmas album is one of my favorites.  No one can do Christmas as beautifully arranged as Karen and Richard did.  Karen's beautiful, melodic voice was made to sing Christmas songs.  I so miss her and hope by now she understands the incredible legacy she left to the music world and her devoted fans.
0399156577|5.0|Great read.  I have had working dogs for 35 years and this storyline runs pretty true to the love and training that they require.
075640407X|5.0|This is really an excellent book, the problem is the sequel was delayed forever (well, over a year).  The beginning is better than the end, but you gotta read it if you haven't.  It's quite intoxicating reading.  It has a great plot, and I like the way the author puts the story together.  The characters are very interesting, different, and there are some twists in it you may not expect.  There is adventure, bizarre creatures, and lots of action.  It's a good read.
B001QB5SFO|4.0|Much has been said over the years about the mutual hatred between Walter Matthau and Barbra Streisand during filming of HELLO DOLLY!, and some of it's juicy enough to include here. When Matthau, who was sick of Streisand's meddling in his acting and in the decisions of director Gene Kelly, confronted her about it, they quickly got into a huge fight. Barbra called Walter \\"old sewer mouth\\" and he said she \\"had no more talent than a butterfly's fart.\\" This continued until he sent her away crying with \\"Nobody in this company likes you!\\" Later, Matthau spoke to studio head Darryl Zanuck Jr. about Streisand's overbearing manner. Zanuck's dismissive reply was, 'I'd love to help you but this is not 'Hello, Walter' we're making.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, production wrapped in September '68. On screen, only Matthau shows occasional hints of the disgust he had for his co-star.<br /><br />In early scenes, Barbra, whose lower body was well-padded for the role of Dolly Levi, uses a modified Mae West impression for the matchmaking yente, but that is soon dropped in favor of her typical motor-mouthed Brooklynite schtick. She brings much talent to Jerry Herman's songs and is a fair dancer, as well.<br /><br />Choreography is top-notch. Crawford, Tune and Lockin** are wonderful actors and hoofers. None of the film's main cast were in the original Tony-winning stageplay, which was performed nearly 3,000 times between 1/16/64 and 12/27/70. Despite the troubles detailed above, the cinematic HELLO DOLLY! is marvelous and highly recommended to all musical comedy lovers.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.2) Hello Dolly (1969) - Barbra Streisand/Walter Matthau/Michael Crawford/Marianne McAndrew/Danny Lockin/E.J.

B0045NXMJE|5.0|this is simply everything I want in a movie. It's charming, it's whimsical, it's a win for the good guys, it's creating a family out of unrelated, odd people that works (much better than most families that are related work,) it's lovely - I felt good when I left the theater and this is the one movie from this year that I'm buying.    Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" - outstanding movies in every possible way - but I'm not going to buy them and watch them again. So, this is not a review by someone who has to have cute and sweet in her movies. But it is a review by a real movie buff, and a movie buff who has some standards - as in, if you can't entertain me, I won't watch your movie! Mic Mac's entertained, it entranced, and at the end I left feeling that the world is a place where decent, caring relationships can happen, and that sometimes, just sometimes, the bad guys get theirs. That's a perfectly reasonable, even desirable, way to leave the theater.     I refuse to accept that a requirement for a good movie is that it is full of sturm und drang - that's just baloney sixties thinking - and also \\"I'm too cool to like fun stuff that isn't obscene and/or stupid or both\\" thinking. As an adult I find that it's very difficult to find movies to enjoy. Usually movie makers can't find their way through the maze of amusing - bosoms and bottoms - or blowing up something every 10 minutes. This movie maker can make a movie. I am grateful whenever I find one who can. I strongly recommend it.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I have been a die hard sex fan since the first episode...when people didnt even know yet what is was or how great it was!!!.   I do agree that the first movie was fantastic and so was the movie book. But for me this movie hit home, due to the fact that carrie was right, who we were and the things we did at 25 and who we are now at (for me anyway)45 are worlds apart!!!....Im in a 10yr realtionship and it is any but traditional...believe me!!!plus it's only me and him..just us two.  I was (the girls) in my day....maybe not as extreme but my life like many of us girls we could relate to the show, because we had simular experiences,dated simular men...I may not have met my Mr.Big...but he's close....and my girl friends have married and have children and we still get together at least once a week and have our \\"girls only\\" nite out. So what I'm really trying to say is that I loved This movie and like life, things change so for the first time we got to see the girls dealing with \\"real life issues and concerns....yes maybe a little out there but hey...It's SEX AND THE CITY  after all...love it or leave it!!  It was like getting together with old friends and catching up...but like I said it hit home for me and carrie and the girls will always be my \\"friends in my head\\"....this movie may not have been a hit with many, but to us TRUE DIE HARD SEX AND THE CITY fans, these are our girls....and we love them with the good and bad...just like life and I hope there will be a third movie.

B003ZK58WM|5.0|This is a great novel with interesting characters.  As entertaining as Pillars of the Earth, better than World Without End, with the added advantage that it gives us a better understanding of what it must have been like living before, during and right after WWI.  After reading this novel I also understand  better what led to WWI and why it led to WWII, and to the rest of the 20th century for that matter.  I highly recommend  this novel to history buffs and to thriller fans alike, you will not be disappointed.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Joe just keeps getting better and better. This album is fantastic, an A++++ effort. Jeff Campitelli on drums.....awesome, bassist Allen Whitman.....awesome, and then to one of my faves......keyboardist Mike Keneally.............this guy is a TOP FLIGHT musician and can play guitar with the best of them too. If you don't believe me, watch him go lick for lick with Steve Vai, The Attitude Song, on the G3 Live in Concert DVD, it's mind blowing. I was so happy to see Keneally added to the lineup, his keyboard work is just incredible, I hope he makes many more albums with Joe.    Joe's new band is an AWESOME powerhouse! The textures on the album are nothing short of amazing.    JOE SATRIANI IS THE BOSS................JUST LOOK AT ALL OF THE MUSIC HE HAS PRODUCED THE PAST 15 YEARS!!!! (I own all of it!)    Eddie Van Halen whose playing I love has had a disappointing career as far as production effort. It's truly sad this legend cannot hold a candle to Joe as far as music production.    I will be seeing Joe in January on the US tour, I have seen him about 5 times and you always walk away from his show shaking your head with a grin a mile wide. Thanks for your efforts Joe, one of the hardest working musicians ever!

B008FERHV8|5.0|The plot is fairly simple. Ree Holly (Jennifer Lawrence) is at home taking care of her mother, who takes happy pills and is menatlly out of it. She also cares for her two siblings. She is 17. She goes to school and chops wood too. Clarence Carter's &#34;Patches&#34; lived in a dream world compared to her. Her father is missing and it appears he will miss bail. The family farm has been put up for bond. Ree searches for her father, who made and sold Meth.<br /><br />The movie is shot on location in Southern Missouri, Jesse James country. It captures impoverished rural America. The accents are remarkably well done and not overdone like so many films. Jennifer Lawrence gives us an Academy Award performance. The movie also captures the independent spirit of the people, their general disdain of law enforcement, and their willingness to help each other in a time of crisis, in spite of a certain code of silence.<br /><br />Like many small isolated communities, most folk are somehow kin. Ree uses the kin card to elicit help. Her uncle, who refused to help her, eventually does so after Ree displays bravery and persistence. Remarkable performances by the entire cast, including the child actors. There are no super heroes walking tall or high action scenes. It is realistic, which translates into scenes some might consider boring, although I personally found them interesting as we worked with Ree to unravel a simple mystery, one which everyone seems to know the answer, but no one is telling.<br /><br />There is no sex or nudity, but it does show people with a meth spoon up their nose.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|If you want to hear some music that is a little different,this may be something to purchase.  You can see the movie on TV for free occasionally, and listen to the music to see  if you want the CD.  I especially liked the version of \\"She's no There\\" on this CD.  It is nowhere like the original Zombie version,but it draws you in places.  Listen to it and see if you agree.

B0014I4KIK|2.0|I got this as a gift for my wife who liked  one song on this CD.  She played it a couple of times, and it has collected dust ever since.  Neither of us liked any of the rest of the music on the CD (and I didn't care for the one song she liked).
B001GM28HO|5.0|She probably represents the Madonna of our generation, her music is great, I don't take it seriously, just fun, catchy, pop music. Great debut, no filler, all killer. Believe me when I say this, all of the songs are great, stand-out on their own, and if I had to pick a favorite, I don't think I could. Great album.
B000TXNDUW|3.0|I am starting to come to the conclusion that \\"The Criterion Collection\\" means \\"buyer beware\\". This is not the first Criterion Collection DVD I have purchased that has had technical issues. In this movie, the entire bedroom scene where our two protagonists chat in bed was uninterpretable on this DVD due to the fact that the subtitles went by in a single frame flash. I thought: is this intended to be subliminal? Because that's about all I was getting. I don't speak french and couldn't read the subtitles, and the scene went on too long for me to simply enjoy two lovely humans rolling around together. Last time I saw this movie, in about 1979, I think it had the same problem. I would have thought that it would have been fixed for this release.<br /><br />The movie itself is of interest in that it represented a break from traditional films and moviemaking. Even now, the casual nature of the protagonists love affair is a bit shocking, and the nihilistic approach to life that the main characters display is oh so stylized. But I loved looking at it and enjoyed the cat-and-mouse with the Inspector. The jazz music score is funny to us now but it still a great counterpoint to the action. How I wish to look like Jean Seberg! Worthwhile viewing, but it's best only if you speak french.

193413712X|4.0|Tinkers is a magical story about two men doggedly pursuing anachronistic professions.  Howard sells notions out of a horse drawn wagon to housewives in rural Maine.  His son George repairs antique clocks.  The events of the novel are bounded by the family's death watch at George's bed.  As his body fails, his mind wanders back to boyhood and the events that shaped his life.  When we cut away from George, we're in his father Howard's consciousness.  Howard has serious epilepsy, and his neural circuits fling him into luminous dimensions that, sadly, he is unable to share with his wife and children.  Howard is bathed in grace, but his seizures are so frightening that his wife is prepared to have him institutionalized.<br /><br />More than plot, it's Paul Harding's prose that captures the reader.  Whether it's the inner workings of a clock, or how a bird's nest gets assembled or the way sun and clouds repaint the greenery in a New England meadow, he makes us SEE with fine grained particularity.  At an historical moment when we're all pixilated by our electronic devices, this is a great service serious novelists can perform for us:  force us to slow down, really look at something and try to absorb it.<br /><br />Although Harding (along with his mentor, Marilynne Robinson) paints marvelous word portraits of the natural world, his ultimate goal is to make us think about the supernatural forces that underlie and shape physical reality.  Tinkers pokes gently at the membrane that separates the known from the unknown world, trying to capture what Dylan Thomas wonderfully labeled \\"the force that through the green fuse drives the flower.\\"<br /><br />Both George and Howard have lived fully and felt deeply.  In the end, like all of us, they know more than they can say.  But they keep peering into the thickening shadows that edge the woods at twilight, right up to the moment when full darkness descends.
0440423023|4.0|Ok, Childs wrote 15 of these books; I have reviewed probably half of them or more.  What can I say?  If you like the main character, you will like this book.  It is a typical Reacher book with all that implies.  See my other reviews of Reacher for more details.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|FROZEN    Adam Green is a good filmmaker from what I have come to gather, some people love him others not so much. You may remember a little Slasher movie maybe you have heard of it, a kick back to the days of Slasher glory called \\"Hatchet\\". I have heard both sides on that film from those who like it and those who don't, as for me, that is a review for another day. Maybe you have heard of \\"Spiral\\" or a really good one he produced called \\"Grace\\", that one was really good. Either way this new one of his is actually different then what you would expect from the creator of \\"the next icon of horror\\" [hope I got that quote correct].    Two childhood friends Lynch [Shawn Ashmore] and Dan [Kevin Zegers] along side Dan's girlfriend Parker [Emma Bell] go snowboarding and skiing over the weekend like they do it seems all the time. Of course the girlfriend kinda invited herself because she wants to be involved in everything Dan does. Naturally this does not sit well with Lynch who misses the old days of him and his buddy just hanging out, good old fashioned guy time. When a girl who works at the resort that normally lets the guys ski for free is not working that day Parker is sent in to persuade the guy to let them go up the mountain. It eventually works and they spend the day going down the easy slopes for Parker.    By the time the place is getting ready to close they decide they want to make one more run, this time down some real slopes. Lynch is upset he had to make his way down the easy ones all day. The same guy is there and decides they make one more run, after they go up he is called off and a different guy takes over. That guy mistakes another group of three that come down as them and shuts the ski lift off. The three are calm at first but soon panic surfaces as they realize they are stuck 30-60ft off the ground.    This is actually a very good movie and does a great job making you feel what these people go through. Writer/director Adam Green did an excellent job herefrom shooting this to pulling off the tension of the film. But with that said I think his biggest strong point here was the script, these three feel like real people. From the \\"oh they will get it running\\" to the strong feeling of panic these are real people. I honestly thought the characters and dialogue were very spot on; I really think this is how most people would react. Even from what Dan does to afterwards realizing \\"we can climb the cable and make it to the ladder\\", when people panic the do the crazy first thing that comes to mind thing first, like jump. It is afterwards usually that in hindsight you realize there were other options, I liked that here.    The actors were very good in this as well as they played easily off one another, especially after they were stuck. It is from this point on that the bond between the three really showcases. The relationship between boyfriend and girlfriend and boyfriend's best friend is great, I have actually went through his kinda thing with my girl and best friend when they first met. All three were great here but in my opinion show stealer award goes to Shawn Ashmore as Lynch, really liked his performance here.    From the wolves to the tension everything was really good here except one thing, the ending. I really thought it would have been a much better ending if what happened did not, as in the opposite happens. To read any further would be a spoiler so turn back now, you have been warned. Now for those who have seen it feel free to give me your take on this and leave a comment. As you [reader who has seen this movie] know both guys fail to make it by the end of this movie but both die trying to save the others. Dan is first when after his jump he breaks his leg and is eventually eaten by the wolves. Lynch is next trying to save Parker [whom he really didn't get along with at first] as he cuts his hands to shreds climbing that cable and making it to the ladder. Of course after he boards down a little [slowly] we find out the wolves got him as well. Now all that is well and good I suppose since this that kinda movie, but why does Parker make it.     She did nothing to help the entire movie really and one could even argue that she kinda caused this. Now I wouldn't really say that because Lynch [even though it was just for his friend] did agree to her coming but I can see the case. Any way she doesn't even have to jump a horrible amount of ft or climb to the ladder on razor sharp cable. No she gets to jump off at a much safer distance after the ski lift can't hold her weight any more [even though two more even heavier people are no longer on there]. Then she makes her way down the mountain and even stumbles across a pack of wolves eating Lynch, one even face to face. Do they attack her like any creature would being not only surprised by someone falling next to them but also to protect their kill, no they let her walk on. Then she falls onto an icy road with her head sticking out there ready to be run over, and no the person does slide on the ice but only to turnaround and get her.    What ever the reason for the ending that is really my only complaint with it, other than that I do highly recommend this movie. The DVD has some great special features so check those out as well, and enjoy the flick. Adam Green I think will be making a huge hit some time in the future [I mean that in a mainstream top of the charts box office way, he has already achieved that on an independent level] if he keeps making films like this. I say go ahead and get this movie it is worthy of your collection, but try out the rental, it may lead you to seeing his other films.
B001U7FW1O|4.0|I always rate bands on unique offerings and not the amount of popular songs they had. Okay on this album and DVD really bought for the three songs I love. But the 80's to me were crap on a lot of music levels thanks to 'M\\" TV showing that videos were more important than being a musician with a great song...#@#@#$%3 idiots.<br />But these guys came through and rocked and actually are one of the great era bands of that time.<br />This collection in unique like them and made for the definitive collector of great bands.

B003JSSPSY|1.0|This TV show is pretty much flagerant embarrassment to the series. nuff said, if you want to buy it it will only be for eye candy.      And for all those people that say take it for what it is..... the people that enjoy this and dont want to READ the books to see what the real story is, are just getting fed drool compared to what some (including myself) say is the best written story that has ever read. to me it far surpasses LOTR.    It even says in the special features, that they were looking for a fourth regular for the series and \\"they\\" (being the all knowing screen writers) just happened to think that Cara fit the person they needed. WTF? Its apparent in the books not cause they say so.    How about this? spend the extra $30 or so and buy the entire series of books, One: you get the real story. Two: you use your own imagination into what the character are like and the world around then (i know thinking involved, such a tragedy). Three: you dont have to sit in front a TV to enjoy doing something. and finally Four: read last longer than the series so you get more out of your dollar.
B003YOMNCM|5.0|We were fortunate enough to see her play this Tchaikovsky Violin Concertos last month. She was amazing and we truly enjoyed her performance. We're so glad that she released this album. This concerto is so beautiful, and just like other Tchaikovsky, it's very easy to listen. Hilary's performance is excellent as usual, and I think you'll never get tired of listening to her.  To be honest, though, I'm not a fan of modern classics, so I haven't listened to Higdon so much. I should give it a try.

B0041T7FS6|5.0|It does seem odd that only now we are getting a box set dedicated to Chic's music.  In recent years, the closest we've had was probably the two-disc \\"Definitive Groove Collection\\"  which collected all of Chic's hit singles and single releases; but that only covered music by Chic the band.    The purpose of Savoir Faire is to cover the Chic Organization's output, covering not only Chic's music,  but music produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards for other artists such as Diana Ross, Debbie Harry, Teddy Pendergrass and Norma Jean Wright.  It also includes some unreleased songs by Johnny Mathis (Yes, that Johnny Mathis).      There are so many legendary songs on this disc, including \\"Good Times\\" and \\"Le Freak\\" by Chic; \\"We Are Family\\" and \\"He's The Greatest Dancer\\" by Sister Sledge; and the original CHIC productions of Diana Ross' hit songs \\"Upside Down\\" and \\"I'm Coming Out\\".  Listening to this box set, you realize the impact that the CHIC sound has made on modern pop, dance, R&B and hip-hop through many samples and remakes.      The major source of contention on this box set is that DJ Dimitri from Paris has remixed five songs on the album, replacing the original versions.  I am loving the mixes of \\"Saturday\\" by Norma Jean Wright, \\"Thinking of You\\" by Sister Sledge and \\"I Want Your Love\\" by Chic.  Dimitri from Paris' mixes don't stray too far from the originals but he still gives a fresh take on these songs for today's listeners.      I would have preferred that the liner notes went a little deeper into the history of CHIC and their successes and setbacks (little is mentioned about the struggle between Rodgers/Edwards and Motown over the Diana Ross/CHIC collaboration, and even less is written about the Mathis/CHIC recordings.)  I would also have preferred that the compilers used Harry's \\"The Jam Was Moving\\" instead of \\"Backfired\\".  \\"Jam\\" is a far more enjoyable song than the dull \\"Backfired.\\"  The much sought-after Mathis/CHIC collaborations are actually a bit disappointing, but I'm glad some of them have been released (it's too bad \\"I Love My Lady,\\" which is better than any of the Mathis songs here, was not included).      However, the four discs come in a compact box, with some nice pictures.  And the sound is excellent, despite some negative reports I have read in other reviews on other sites.      This is undoubtedly the best box set I have purchased this year.   I highly recommend this.  It may be a little pricey (it is an import from France, after all), but it's worth every penny.    Good times, indeed.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|The events are realistic--I know people living these circumstances. However, the dialogue was just down right hokey. Then again, if the discourse had been realistic, I doubt viewers unaccustomed to the regional dialect could have understood much. Taken as a whole, a pretty good movie.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Loved the Santana riffs, but the rest of the album (cover tunes) just didn't make it for me. The incorporation of pop and rap into Santana's music doesn't appeal to me. Very disappointed with this heavily marketed album.
B001KVZ6LQ|2.0|There's really no reason to upgrade to this Blu-Ray edition if you have the DVD released several years ago.  The improved resolution simply magnifies the grain of the film and unfortunately it detracts from your enjoyment of the movie.  The Special Features menu is particularly difficult to navigate.  While it has quite a few features relating to the making and history of Kong, you don't know which feature you're going to see until you hit \\"OK\\" on your remote.  Some movies should not be  transferred to Blu-Ray.  The original King Kong is one.
1427210497|3.0|First I had a hard time getting started with this book. It seemed trivial and after getting my interest, it would end up talking about someone or a period in time totally different.

B003Q6D2A0|4.0|MOVIE RATING:  4 stars  B+ )<br /><br />Never Let Me Go (2010) is one of those small, well-crafted indie films that typically only diehard cinephiles seek out and appreciate. But the rewards for that search are well worth the effort here. It's a science-fiction film in the very broadest sense of the genre, but to me it's really just an existential coming-of-age love story within a vague sci-fi like framework. And when I say sci-fi, I mean in terms of a movie like Gattaca (1997), a fantastic, futuristic, character-driven, but vaguely sci-fi film. Never Let Me Go is much less sci-fi than Gattaca, but I think if you appreciate and like Gattaca, then you might appreciate and like Never Let Me Go.<br /><br />There are a few movies that I was strongly reminded of while watching Never Let Me Go: Dead Poets Society (1989), Gattaca (1997), and A Single Man (2009). I think the mid-20th century boarding school feel of Never Let Me go, at least in it's first act, is what reminded me so strongly of Dead Poets Society. But as the film plays out, it reminds me more of Gattaca and A Single Man. All three of these films deal with the topic of \\"completion\\" (i.e. death), in similar ways to this one. There's a strong sense of sacrifice that comes with suicidal death in all four films, but each takes a slightly different look at the topic.<br /><br />The story of Never Let Me Go is centered around Kathy (played byCarey Mulligan and Izzy Meikle-Small), Ruth (played by Keira Knightley and Ella Purnell), and Tommy (played by Andrew Garfield andCharlie Rowe), who are human \\"clones\\" living purely to be future organ donors for \\"real\\" people. These three characters, along with hundreds and probably thousands of others, are raised in boarding schools around England without parents. Instead, teachers or guardians take care of raising and educating them, telling them as little as possible about the real world outside of the school (which feels more like a juvenile detention facility or prison). The kid clones only know what they need to, so that they understand, internalize and embrace their limited \\"special\\" life purpose and nothing more. It's a chilling scenario because these kids are all going to grow up just to give themselves over to die (or \\"complete\\" as it is called in the film). They are brainwashed from birth that they are simply living organ donations...nothing more...and that they are special because of that.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is a movie that really asks two key existential/spiritual questions: What makes us human? And why are we living? By looking at these questions through the abbreviated lives and experiences of these three cloned humans, we get this sort of abstract overall view of ourselves through their eyes. Is it love that makes us human? Is it sex that makes us human? Is it friendship that makes us human? Is it art that makes us human? Is it self-awareness that makes us human? These are answers to these core questions, along with many more, that the film ponders in a subtle way. The film doesn't really give answers as much as it asks the questions and allows the viewer to come to their own answers, if any, through the characters and their journeys. I like that the filmmakers here have left us with open-ended questions because it gives the movie something to continually look at over the course of my own life as I watch the film again.<br /><br />I've listened to podcasts with writer Kazuo Ishiguro (who wrote the novel that this film is based on), screenwriter Alex Garland, and director Mark Romanek, and they all confirm that this film is really just a vehicle for looking at life in general and what it means for us to be living. It's a story of what it's like to be human. But because we are so self-aware, we often times have to see our lives through the lives of others to really see ourselves. And that is what cinema is all about in my mind. It's a vehicle for reflection...it's a mirror. Sometimes the mirror is ornated and jewel-encrusted, and other times it is plain and simple, like it is here. Kathy, Ruth & Tommy are trying to find the meaning in their short lives as clones, which they are told is their life purpose, just as we are trying to find the meaning and purpose in our lives as humans.<br /><br />By having Kathy, Ruth & Tommy live shortened lives due to their planned organ donations, they have to deal with the issues of mortality and purpose early in their life. And  they arrive at acceptance of their mortality in a quicker and more finite amount of time. Their lives are truncated, so they get to what's important in life faster than the rest of us. We typically linger through three of the clones' lifetimes before getting to where they get much earlier.<br /><br />While Never Let Me Go is a bit slow in its pacing and editing at times, stumbling along the way, the movie really grabbed me internally after I left the theater and it has stayed in my mind ever since then. I think the story could have been told in a more engaging manner, but I give it credit for sinking its claws into me and not letting go. I can't say enough about the quality of the acting by the three leads. Knightly, Garfield, and Mulligan all really show their talents as up and coming actors in this feature.<br /><br />The production design and cinematography on the film are both beautiful and appropriate for the story. While we don't really know if we're in the past or the future, the sort of 1960s to 1970s look and feel of Never Let Me Go worked for me to create an interesting context for the story to occur in. Rachel Portman's score has a beautifully quiet tone throughout the movie and it lends just the right emotional queues when necessary. I've listened to the score a dozen or more times on its own, and I really appreciate what Portman did here. She captured the existential questioning of the story in her score and every time I hear it, I think of the movie.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is a character-driven dramatic film with a lot of psychological depth to it. While on the surface it seems to have very few emotions throughout it, the emotions are there and they build-up to a satisfying ending for me. I think the film's lack of box office success is not due to the film itself as much as its due to the subject matter. Never Let Me Go is not an escapist movie by any means. So it's appeal to the general public is probably limited. It's a movie where you go to find out who your are internally and deal with those key questions in life that most people don't want to deal with. But if you have the courage to look within, Never Let Me Go may just give you something worth holding on to. It did for me., like it is here.

0316067938|2.0|The best word to describe this book is disappointment. The captivating writing style that is present especially in the first book is lacking on this one. No romance...no mystery...no innocence...about the characters.  I only hope that the people that are producing the movie make enough changes to make it work. Also, I HOPE that Mrs. Meyer can regain her writing \\"mojo\\" and make it up on the upcoming Midnight Sun. Please give us back more of the Edward and Bella that we all felt in love with at the beginning...
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I bit into the first twilight book like the avid young fantasy reader I am. After the first five pages, I rolled my eyes and only kept reading the rest of the series to make fun of it.  Is Meyer honestly into this kind of stuff? Pedophilia? Underage pregnancy? Abusive boyfriend relationships? Girls, do NOT use young Bella here as a role model. Trust me. For one thing, just to start off, if the first 200 pages of something is about finding out what Edward is, do not slap the words &#34;Edward was a vampire&#34; on the back of the book.  Just to keep this short, the series went downhill from there.  From bad to worse to downright horrific. After reading tis one, all I can say is that I hope the editor gets better.  Honestly. Do not read. It kills braincells.
0525951652|5.0|Ken Follet at his best. Can't wait to read #2 in his trilogy. I can still remember all the characters in the book... to this minute.
B000002KKD|5.0|It is a hard decision to state this,since they have made so many excellent recordings,but this is narrowly the best.Followed by Wild Planet and Bouncing off the Satellites . This one really holds up, the energy and uniqueness of each track make this  classic a must have for any rock/alternative/dance collection.
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer that Saxon rivals Iron Maiden. I personally think Iron Maiden is the greatest metal band ever, but Saxon are a great band as well. Every person has a favorite album by an artist and Power And The Glory is my favorite Saxon album. The spectacular opening through This Town Rocks and the incredible The Eagle Has Landed (the title of which has also been used on several great live albums) still blows my mind, probably 100 plays later. I really do like all their albums but would also recommend Dogs Of War, Crusader or any other great Saxon album.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Was informed 4 days later that the item I was promised was, in fact, out of stock.    B.S. Productions.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Video quality is outstanding and it isn't even Blu-Ray. I think anyone buying this show on dvd already knows something about it, so I don't need to tell anyone about how great the show is.
B003YP7N9O|1.0|I would have gladly allowed myself to be fleeced for another copy of Stand Up just to get the rest of the BBC and the bonus tracks (even if some are just more duplicates), ....but once again, like Crimson and Hendrix, they go and stick this DVD in that I have no use for and do not want to pay for. Why don't they sell that DVD separately? I hope they soon release this without the DVD. They really should stop doing this. I really think the mergers between the electronics industry, the music industry and the movie industry have a lot to do with this. Imagine when all this merges with the computer industry: what a nightmare.  I won't be buying this unless the price really drops...Oh, by the way, I noticed my Who Tommy Deluxe is a 5.1 surround disk. But it is a single layered disk and can be played on both. So, it was totally unnecessary  to release this in this way: EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:  5.1 audio only players are obsolete now. I guess no one wanted them. So, it was released this on DVD in order to accommodate the DVD player. If 5.1 layered audio was not obsolete, we could have saved some money.<br /><br />And another thing that bugs me about this. Apparently this CD of Stand Up is not even remastered. Out of all the other early ones remastered in the early part of this century, this one did not come up so well. It is ripe for a real re-master. Let's hope they just do it right soon: remaster it, give us the bonus material and skip that DVD.
B000089Q9D|5.0|One of the finest, most brilliant movies I have ever seen. It is at once funny, true to life, and heart-wrenching. I have seen this many times over, and still find it mesmerizing. Each time I see it, I find something new to ponder. The acting is superb! The scenery perfect to the WWII era is depicts, and the music by Ennio Morricone is exquisite. A haunting masterpiece...especially for anyone who has experienced the pain of loss along with the love that wrought such pain. Watch it in its original Italian language, with subtitles. It loses much passion in translation! This is one for the HEART!!!
0141328290|4.0|When Clay returned home from school one afternoon to discover a shoebox sized package at his door, the last thing he expected was to spend the night amongst past memories with the words of a dead girl echoing through his head. No, the last thing expected was for that voice to blame him for her death. In the space of one night he will discover his part in the death of a girl he barely knew.<br /><br />It seems to Hannah that ever since she moved to town things had only gone from bad to worse. It all began with the rumours that started not long after her arrival by someone she had thought she could trust. Then the list was released, an attempt at revenge but not at her, however its affect was no less hurtful. When things never got any better, when there was no relief from the darkness closing in around her, Hannah made a choice. But there were thirteen reasons, thirteen people, who played a part in that choice.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is a dark and desperate tale of bullying that leads to depression and tragedy. Suicide is an important issue and one that should be discussed, but that doesn't make it any less painful to read, to experience the blame and grief within these pages. It is a powerful story that left me feeling as dejected, angry and somewhat confused as the characters within.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like probably millions of people, I had heard Susan Boyle's \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" audition for Britain's Got Talent and was bowled-over so I got this CD.  It is outstanding.  Who knew this lady was so versatile?!  Love her \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\"!
B00475AUWW|4.0|I feel like I just wasted $10 on this. I was looking forward to reading it, because the book has so many great reviews in the press.<br /><br />But, the Kindle formatting is so pathetic that I don't know if I'll ever read it or not. Words are broken without hyphenation. Example 1: not appears as no at the end of a line followed by a t at the start of the next. Stands is broken at the end of the n. There are too many examples to give. Just about every line has a broken word.<br /><br />And, probably for the same reason (the poor formatting), it's difficult if not impossible to select the text one wants to. For example, I wanted to highlight this:<br /><br />\\"Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and t<br />he unlived life within us. Between the two stan<br />ds Resistance.\\"<br /><br />But all I can seem to capture is the \\"ds Resistance.\\"<br /><br />I have bought a lot from Amazon, and I expected better.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br />I originally assigned 1 star to this review, because of the incredibly poor formatting of the text. I ultimately purchased the book from Apple via iBooks, and after getting Tom's comment below, I decided to modify my review.<br /><br />Pressfield  provides great insights. Really profound. When I first read through the book, I was a bit put off by the way he talked about Resistance, as if it were an external demon, and how he talked about getting help from his \\"muses.\\" After reading it, my initial impression was that it was hard to take seriously, although it had some good points.<br /><br />After reading Tom's comment below, I went back and read the bookmarks and highlights I had made in the iBooks version of the book. Turns out that I had made about 25 bookmarks and that all of them offered really profound insights and advice. One can apply the advice whether one believes that resistance is an external beast or one's own subconscious (or reptile brain).<br /><br />Also, after looking through the bookmarks, it occurred to me howgood Amazon usually is with its Kindle products. Anything that I highlight in a Kindle book, I can later access through my browser or via the My Clippings.txt file, and I can highlight as much text as I want to. I can even copy this into my own little motivation system for even easier access later. I can't do this with iBooks, and likely will never be able to. (Nor is it possible with Google's new ebook setup.) That sort of makes up for this one bad experience with a Kindle ebook.<br /><br />Having said all that, the Author gets 5 stars, Amazon gets 3 stars (a big negative offset on the specific ebook, partially offset by a good system overall), averaging out to 4 stars.
0307594777|2.0|It seems the author, Larsson, died prematurely and I think the three books that are presented to us as three novels fully achieved really aren't that.   For me, this trilogy is only a coarse work because probably the author hadn't the time to refine his writings. We see, all in this books are tremendous: the protagonist Lisbeth Salander is  the daughter and sister of a father and a brother genetically ill until a grade only comparable to the criminals of Lombroso. Furthermore, if this were not enough, she's jailed and tortured by another madman, a fool psychiatrist who is  an exact copy of the \\"Mad Scientists\\" very popular from decades as Dr. Mabuse or Caligari. In front of these evil monsters, are the heroes, leaded by the journalist Mikael Blomkvist.  The final episode of the terrible judgement for sexual abuse and crimes of state are unbelievable, because a person as Lisbeth which possess about 2000 million dollars and such ability with the internet can escape by suborning many people, from Sweden to Australia.   There are also a strange but very abundant mentions of commercial brands, as the Ikea magazines and others that are fully superfluous. So I at less only can conclude Stieg Larsson had in mind a more fine novels, but he died too soon and so, this trilogy as we known it is a complete nonsense with some traces of real talent.
B002JVWR4U|4.0|13 Episodes on 4 DVD Discs, released October 12, 2010<br /><br />\\"Dollhouse\\" is a series starring Eliza Dushku as Echo, a woman who is in the care of an organization that wipes the minds of its operatives and then imprints them with different personalities to go out on different missions paid for by clients (as an escort, bodyguard, wife, mother, FBI undercover agent, etc.). When they return, they are wiped clean again and are like child-like dolls walking around an underground house without any memory of these experiences. Echo is a special doll because she becomes self-aware and develops her own identity apart from the other dolls and retains all of the knowledge she has gained. The wiping process no longer works on her brain but she continues to act as a doll biding her time while she plans a way to take the Dollhouse down for good.<br /><br />Her original handler was Boyd Langton played by Harry Lennix, but he is now head of security in the Dollhouse. The science lab geek who has invented the technology and fixes problems from his computer while dolls are in the field is Topher Brink played by Fran Kranz. The head of the Dollhouse is Adelle DeWitt played by the lovely Olivia Williams whose severe haircut for Roman Polanski's film, \\"The Ghost Writer\\" added a new level of hardness to her character during her journey this season. Other dolls past and present from the Dollhouse that are in this season are Sierra (Dichen Lachman), Victor (Enver Gjokaj), Mellie (Miracle Laurie), and the character revealed to be a former doll in the last season, Dr. Claire Saunders played by Amy Acker who was in another Joss Whedon series \\"Angel.\\" Over the course of the season, loyalties go back and forth, a tech geek and hard British woman develop consciences, Echo becomes a person instead of a blank slate, and the series concludes with a second Epitaph futuristic episode to show that in spite of all the characters' efforts, the future is still a bleak world filled with bandits with guns.<br /><br />The first and second seasons both had 13 episodes and no one believed it would get picked up for a second season, not even Joss Whedon. He made a futuristic ending episode called \\"Epitaph\\" at the end of Season 1 and when he found out he had more time to play in the Dollhouse, he very quickly made some big adjustments for the second season. The setting looks different, Echo is no longer a blank doll, some characters left and new characters arrive looking very familiar as Whedon pretty much said the heck with it and brought it a whole bunch of old friends from other projects he worked on.<br /><br />Alexis Denisof also from the \\"Angel\\" series plays a Senator intent on bringing the Dollhouse down and his wife played by Stacey Scowley stands by him guiding him along the way. My favorite new character is Bennett Halverson played by Summer Glau, most remembered for Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Joss Whedon hits \\"Firefly\\" and follow-up movie, \\"Serenity.\\" Bennett Halverson is a foil to nerd Topher as the head nerd at the Washington, D.C. location with a dark streak as she has a personal grudge against Echo's original personality, Caroline. Alan Tudyk makes another appearance as Alpha, the only other doll to have become self-aware in the same way as Echo who made is his mission to collect as many personalities as possible which resulted in him becoming a bit psychotic and he is obsessed with Echo.<br /><br />This show had a plan for 6 years, chopped it down to half a year, then added another half a season resulting in an accelerated plot that allowed for many great moments. The plot is WAY better after Echo becomes a person because the blank slate doll gets old very fast which is why I quit the first season three episodes in when it came out. Once she gets a little bad ass and starts utilizing her incorporated training, martial arts skills, and other tech knowledge, it is a lot more fun to cheer for her and hope she can free her friends. OliviaWilliams is an absolute delight as the cold British woman only out for herself and severe to everyone else and Fran Kranz's Topher becomes much more funny in this season and less like a cruel child burning ants with a magnifying glass as he crushes on tech rival, Bennett. Their short lived romance is very sweet, while the attempt at a romantic relationship between Echo and her handler, Ballard is never fully realized or believable since it mostly occurs when she isn't quite a person yet always making it creepy and weird. If you're a Whedon fan, don't miss out on some great storytelling here! If not, then it's easy to see why it got canceled because it's nowhere near as fun as the first few seasons of \\"Alias\\" like I hoped it would be originally. Season 2 is WAY better than Season 1, maybe just start here and skim the summaries of the first season?<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />There is commentary on episode 1 of Season 2 titled \\"Vows\\" by Joss Whedon and he marvels at how they were miraculously picked up for a second season and how the format of the show was changed in light of Epitaph 1 at the end of the first season. Characters had a different journey to go on and he had to find ways to initiate them going there and speed up some of their progress due to the abbreviated season length and increasing budget cuts taking away the amount of episodes certain actors could be in. The set received a complete lighting makeover in all aspects, Echo's journey to self-actualization took larger steps, and the character of Paul Ballard essentially moved into the Dollhouse.<br /><br />There is also commentary on episode 4 called \\"Belonging\\" by Jed Whedon and new bride, Maurissa Tancharoen who were both writers on 17 of the total 27 episodes of the series and presumably of the one they commented on. They also talked about the journeys of characters, mostly about Sierra and Dichen Lachman's performance of her that had to range so much during the episode as she played doll, her original personality Pria, and other characters to the whim of a scary rapist guy.<br /><br />Defining Moments is a featurette talking about the short life span of the series, the highs and lows of the process and its creation, and the challenges that posed on storytelling. Looking Back: A Roundtable with Joss Whedon in the cast is literally a table they are all seated around while eating and drinking a meal together discussing the characters, their favorite moments or personas in the series, and how much they all enjoyed working together.

B0025KVLTW|5.0|This is possibly the most unforgettable Beatle's albums containing many great songs like All you Need is Love, I am the Walrus, and Strawberry Fields Forever. I absolutely love this album and agree that this is one of the Beatles strongest albums of all time and showcases the true talent of the Beatles when they were at the peak of their career, before they started to struggle with keeping the band together. This is a definite must own for true Beatle, rock, or music fans.
B003ZD9DTI|4.0|1 DVD Disc & 1 Blu-ray Disc, released October 5, 2010<br /><br />\\"Mad Max\\" was one of the first movies to come out of Australia that got huge attention around the world and began the career of a star, Mel Gibson. It is the story of Max, a police officer in a time where bandits and lawlessness runs rampant who tries to get away from it all after something happens to his partner only to have more bad guys go after his wife and child leaving him only one choice -- get bad ass and take them all out in a big car action scene.<br /><br />Now it has come to Blu-ray with a DVD combo. The DVD has two featurettes - one on Mel Gibson as the \\"Birth of a Superstar\\" and one on \\"Mad Max: The Film Phenonmenon\\". When the film first came to the States, for some reason all the Australian voices were dubbed in American English! Are you for real, America??? Come on! It's not a different language, it's English for crying out loud! It's not like you can't understand their accent so even the great Mel Gibson superstar was dubbed over, geez. If you want to hear that version though, it is an audio option to switch to English dub. *smacks forehead*<br /><br />On the DVD is commentary with Jon Dowding, David Eggby, Chris Murray, and Tim Ridge where they go into detail about how certain stunts were performed and how they could only afford to put Gibson in actual leather clothes while everyone else was sporting vinyl. The DVD also has trailers, a Road Rants trivia and fun track, TV spots, and a photo gallery. The Blu-ray disc also has the \\"Mad Max: The Film Phenonmenon\\" and commentary with a clearer picture and sound.<br /><br />The difficult thing about a release like this now is that in all the bonus features talking about what a star he is, how beautiful, how talented, how much money he has made, it is all tainted with the reality of the public's current view of him after too many incidents have occurred that have tarnished his reputation as an actor, director, and producer. Mel Gibson was the first Australian actor to be paid a million dollars for a movie and the first actor ever from any country to be paid $25 million for a movie. It is true that \\"Mad Max\\" is a classic for high octane adrenaline action movies and was a forerunner for every \\"Fast & the Furious\\", \\"Transporter\\", and other crazy car movies. Not only did it reinvent action and the chase scene, it was one of the first apocalyptic movies which led the way for every other interpretation of what happens after....fill in the blank of a major event here as in \\"The Book of Eli\\" earlier this year.<br /><br />If you dig this classic, it's not a bad deal at all for all the stuff you get and you just have to listen to them raving about Gibson with an open mind if you aren't a big fan of his shenanigans right now.

B00000I8UF|5.0|Art Blakey is one of the biggest names in 20th century jazz history and Moanin' is one of his highest regarded songs, making it into a jazz standard. This album has some great jazz songs and two very famous versions of Blakey's most popular standard. The mastering is alright, but sounds great and is a must own for any jazz enthusiast. Even casual fans of jazz will love this album since it contains some of the best songs of the entire genre. Moanin' defines jazz and shows this performer at his finest.

B000V63BN6|5.0|This collection contains most of Stevie's hits spanning his first number one hit Fingertips to his later hits in the 80s. All of his famous songs are here like Superstition, Sunshine of My Life, and Sir Duke. Of course it will have certain songs missing since Stevie had many more hits and had many more albums, but this collection contains the absolute best of all his albums. If you want more songs by Stevie, get his individual albums and if you want his newer songs, get his newer albums, but if you are just a casual fan and want his best songs, get this album.

0765350386|5.0|This book was great! I've become a big fan of Sanderson's writing. I still can't get over how fun the dialogue is between the characters. I love the banter!<br /><br />This book is about a girl who is part of a people group called the skaa that were made to be slaves by the noblemen. A thousand years ago, the one called the Hero of Ages (who is still alive), supposedly saved the world, but then he took over the world and named himself the Lord Ruler and God. He suppresses the skaa, and the entire world has been transformed.<br /><br />As has probably already been said by many people, Sanderson has created a totally new magic system called Allomancy for this novel. There are those called Mistings who have partial power over this magic, but then there are Mistborns who have full control over it.<br /><br />There are those who resist the Lord Ruler, such as the skaa rebellion and to some extent, the thieving groups around the city. The girl, named Vin, has been a part of thieving groups for a long time, but she has never been a part of one like this...one is led by a very unlikely character and whose job is to defeat the Lord Ruler himself.<br /><br />The book starts off slowly, but once it gets going, you will have trouble putting it down. I would definitely recommend to sci-fi/fantasy fans and anyone who likes Robert Jordan or Terry Brooks.

0307346617|5.0|I am a historian and a huge zombie, vampire, etc. fan. This is written in \\"Studs Terkall\\" oral history style--with lots of different \\"interviews\\" that shed light on the terrible events of WWZ. I was amazed at how well the author thought through his historical \\"event\\" and used the interviews to shape and tell what happened. The author knows how to write really good (fake) history and really good zombie stories.
0316098337|5.0|The book starts for me with an irony that stays woven into the story until the end.  A book called \\"Room\\" winds up grappling with huge, infinite ideas all within a converted shed, smaller than most living rooms and a boy's imagination grows beyond those of most.  As we come to know Jack, it's hard not to question our own worlds.  Jack's purity at times makes me question how stifling and negative our so-called worlds really are.  Is it Jack that really needs to learn socializing skills or is it us?  It is only when Jack escapes the room that he begins to feel stifled and restrained.<br /><br />Early on, I assumed the book would focus on their escape.  It is a powerful moment when the reader realizes that Jack's mom has been planning this escape for years, just waiting for Jack to be old enough to pull it off.  I was at first surprised when Jack's escape comes so swiftly and almost too easily.  With about 150 pages to go, where was the author taking us after the escape?  Jack's re-entry into society is just as fascinating as his unique, life of total confinement.  His interpretation of modern society and social norms is fascinating and almost makes the reader yearn for life in the room once again.  It's a phenomenal writing achievement.  Jack's consistently unique voice and lack of definite articles because he grew up with only one of everything adds such a deep, deep texture to what is an incredibly told story.<br /><br />Chris Bowen<br />Author of [[ASIN:1432724533 Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom]]

0316098337|2.0|I gave this book 2 stars because I did actually finish it.  However, I skipped pages at a time in order to do so.  Reading from a 5 year old's perspective is excruciating.  It was also inconsistent.  At some points in the story the mother would correct the young boy's grammar and yet other times she would allow him to ramble on like a 2 year old.  Note to author: by the time someone is 5, they can carry on grammatically correct conversations.  The story line was also weak with inconsistencies.  This book was not worth the hype.  If you must read it, borrow it from the library.
1863513418|5.0|Love the book, it has just what I needed. I have shared it with friends and they all love it too. Wonderful pictures and step by step instructions that are easy to follow even for someone who has never done this type of work.
0525951652|5.0|Do you ever just read a book and hate the fact that it ended?  You've become so engrossed in the characters and plot that you feel as if you lost a great friend when turning the final page.  Well that is Follett's book and so much more.  Not much more to say than this a another Grand Slam for Follett!!
B0036BGA6I|2.0|Audrey Hepburn makes the movie worth watching and as a motoring enthusiast there are some interesting vehicles. Overall the movie is disjointed and the character played by Albert Finney is so unappealing that he spoils both the romance and the comedy.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Anyone who is hooked on the Twilight series has to buy this dvd.  It will become a classic for this generation.  Great movie series, gets better and better with each movie.
0765326353|5.0|I really liked The Way of Kings.  Brandon Sanderson completely immerses the reader in a very detailed, complex world that is innovative and original.  The beginning of the book was almost like learning a new language, because I REALLY had to concentrate and keep track of each new term.  (Sanderson, a glossary would have been very helpful in this book!)  I almost gave up and put the book down.  I'm EXTREMELY glad that I kept reading.  The stories of Kaladin and Dalinar are very exciting and uplifting, and I cannot wait to read more.  I didn't like Shallan's storyline, but I guess \\"researching\\" is boring by nature, and it does add some helpful info.      Also, if any book is a reason to get a Kindle, this one is it.  This book is HEAVY and THICK, so it was difficult for me to hold it at times.  This was a great book overall.
B00280LYIC|4.0|ill admit when i first heard about this book i thought it seemed stupid but when i read it i could not put it down! i learned my lesson, never judge a book until you have read it!
0061433047|1.0|If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett --  as I am -- I strongly recommend that you don't read this book.  I have read everything he has written, even his books for children.  \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" feels like it was written by someone else, who had only been told about Pratchett's books, but had never read them himself.  The book starts with a bloody miscarriage, a 13-year-old girl is beaten so severely by her father that he kills the fetus.  Would you ever expect to see that in a Discworld book, especially one written for children?  There is almost no humor.  The Feegles, for example, are grotesque copies of the mischievous imps of Wee Free Men, at one point actually drawing their swords to cut the legs off people.  The plot is a forced rehash of A Hat Full of Sky, another thwarted attempted possession of Tiffany Aching.  Even the title comes from the prior book.  The weirdest scene, not counting the miscarriage, is the bizarre \\"wedding\\" which inexplicable involves profanity.  I am terribly, terribly sorry that Pratchett has Alzheimer's.  But I wish someone had warned me that he can no longer write, so that I could have avoided this horrible story and remember him only as the author of the books that I love to read and reread.

I also love The Office, 30 Rock and Friends.  This show is 1/3 Saved by the Bell, 1/3 Friends, and 1/3 30 Rock.  Very sweet, very funny, and very silly.

1582701709|4.0|OK, so I do believe that The Secret exists.  I had little things take place but I'm still waiting for the major things.  There were signs but again still waiting.  I'm confident though.  I would recommend this book because it does help you to think differently about yourself and your outlook.  I think it works.  Again, still waiting for the major stuff I asked for and believe in.

015206396X|3.0|A great book to begin with and with the middle is great but in between them are scenes that should not be put in a middle school library or be nominated for the Texas lone star award (which is the only reason I read it). My library said that it was rated high school down but I wondered if the judges (or who ever rated it) only read the back cover. I am trying to finish the lone star books but this one and \\"Maze Runner\\" are either very creepy or filled with sexual scenes

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I was a fan of Sex and The City (The series), saw every episode, and even purchased it on DVD, to watch again. When the first movie came out, I saw it on the big screen, and thoroughly enjoyed it. That said, I have to say that this sequel, left me unsatisfied on many levels.<br /><br />First Level: Samantha's character (that unconventional, brave, brassy creature we all loved) has morphed into a crude, desperate caricature of a menopausal woman, and talk about being unsatisfied, the writers of S&C2 beat to death the point that Samantha \\"can't get no satisfaction.\\"  There is a scene at the end of the movie that makes poor Kim Cattrall seem crazed and totally out of control. (Remember when that's what society thought of ALL menopausal women?) Insulting.<br /><br />Next level: Carrie. Once cute and quirky, but still insightful, this character now seems to be aging ungracefully, and also somewhat desperately. More whine than shine, and the insight into relationships that made us love her have evaporated into the dry desert air.<br /><br />Final level: Charlotte and Miranda's characters in the film were no longer the stable ones, but instead, suddenly immature and somewhat silly.<br /><br />Other quick points: It was nice to see the girls together again. The scenery was great. Fashion not so great, and too young for the women wearing it.<br />Story line not even close to believable.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this movie, and I'd still recommend it to die-hard fans (just for old-times sake), but for other viewers, it may fall far short of your expectations.
B003L20IFG|3.0|Paul Conroy, a private contractor, working as a truck driver in Iraq, wakes up after an ambush to discover he is inside a wooden coffin buried beneath the desert sand.  He has nothing but a lighter, a flask with whiskey, some pills and a cell phone provided to him by his captors.  He begins to make desperate calls for help as time drags on and his situation becomes more and more dire.    This is the premise (and a large portion of the plot) of BURIED, an independent film from Spain, starring Ryan Reynolds in what is essentially a one-man show.  It's a tense little thriller that is nearly spoiled by some serious flaws.  Reynolds gives a fairly convincing performance as a fairly ordinary guy who begins his ordeal in a panic and only gradually finds his way to calm.  At least, he's calm for awhile.      The movie is mostly the various conversations he has with the outside world.  Grappling with lost signals (and a dying battery), answering machines and a disbelieving bureaucracy.  He can't reach his loved ones.  He can't convince his captors that he doesn't have $5 million dollars to exchange for his freedom.  There's really nothing he can do about his situation...he has no way to break free and must rely entirely on a world of people who aren't quite as motivated as he is.    Director Rodrigo Cortes does a good job of finding as many ways of filming the events of the films as he can.  His camera swoops around inside the coffin, yet we always have the claustrophobic feeling.  The film has a simple premise (sort of in the way that OPEN WATER was a simple, claustrophobic little film), but Cortes and company grab all they can out of it.    However, even though we can believe that Conroy would frequently panic and make some bad decisions...he makes too many bad choices.  When he does reach people on the phone, he does an unbelievably bad job of convincing them that he really needs their help.  I can believe him losing his cool once or twice...but he does it fairly consistently.  And when he finally DOES reach someone who might be willing to help, he spends a lot of time sharing unneeded information.  He knows his battery is running down, yet he often wastes his breath.  It got to the point where I occasionally thought, \\"Well, if he dies, he has no one to blame but himself.\\"  (Notwithstanding that he didn't put himself in the coffin.)    Worst of all, though...the film manages to take some pretty nasty jabs at the mission in Iraq and make some attempts at moral relativism.  One of the folks working to help Conroy, a hostage expert in Iraq, actually tries to explain away the terrorist acts as the work of people who will simply do anything to survive.  \\"You'd do the same if you were in their situation, Paul,\\" this awful man says.  REALLY???  If a time comes when the only way I can think to feed my family is to kidnap folks and bury them alive...go ahead and shoot me.  To dare suggest that Americans would be just as bad as these terrorist extremists is a mighty big (and offensive) argument for a little thriller to make.  For unsubtle, unearned and unsubstantiated political/social statements inserting themselves where they don't belong, BURIED takes the cake.      The day after seeing the film, what I remember most is not the tension and excitement and fear...but the bad taste in my mouth from the group of Spanish filmmakers and producers who took pot shots at America.    I mention all this, because the film is generally very effective (though not as tense as some other reviews I've read have implied).  If you don't mind the politics I mention, by all means enjoy the film.  If you find the premise intriguing enough that you think you need to overlook the politics...then you'll have a good time.  I just wish someone had warned me.
1416550550|5.0|I read a lot of several different types of books, and this is the first book I have read in a long time that I couldn't put down.  I enjoyed the characters and the subject matter.

B003YWUTKM|2.0|This is an Orb album and apparently not a very good one.  I had high hopes for this given David Gilmour's involvement.  After 3 complete listens -- Not a single memorable melody, emotion, or piece of guitar on the whole album.  Barely listenable as background music.  To say this features Dave Gilmour is an overstatement.  More like Dave's guitar is sampled like a random synth effect.  There may be something here for die hard Orb fans, but Floyd/Gilmour fans will be scratching their heads as to why Dave was involved with this project.  Floyd/Gilmore fan sites maybe doing both the Orb and Gilmour a disservice by implying that Dave Gilmour did much more than allow his guitar to get sampled and mixed.
0142410705|1.0|My son, who is 15 years old, started this book and quit.  He said there is too much sex and swearing -- about every other page.  The reviews I had read made this book sound funny, and he said it did seem like it was humorous -- but he stopped reading it because of the all the sexual references and bad language.

0691142165|5.0|If you're trying to get to primary data about historical debt and currency crisis, this can't be beat. Yes, its a tough read. Yes, you'll feel like you're back in college. But there is nothing else quite like this out there.<br /><br />For example, I'm trying to figure out how bad the US debt burden really is. There is a data set in this book that looks at 300 years and over 200 data points of sovereign defaults and currency crisis based on debt ratios to GDP, Exports and Govt Income. By all those measures, the US currently stands (in 2010) at a 65% - 70% chance of default (or high inflation).<br /><br />Other books will give you reasons of why this or that may happen. This book gives you data and lets you decide for yourself. There is nothing better than looking at hundreds of years of data to understand that what is happening with the modern financial crisis is nothing unique. It has happened before hundreds of times, and it will happen again.
B000ZN802W|1.0|Hey, the film had wonderful AK scenery (how could it not) and it had several pretty good actors (Chris wasn't one) but in the final analysis - it was a really well crafted travelogue film about a kid who was mentally ill, and the end result is quite unappealing. Would never watch it again.

0061433047|4.0|This was my first experience with Discworld, and thus also my first experience with Tiffany Aching, and it was overall a quite enjoyable experience. The book stood alone well, and while I could tell there were quite a few references to events in previous novels (both in the Tiffany Aching series and in the larger Discworld series) they didn't get in the way of the story being told and didn't seem to spoil anything if I decide to pick up the earlier novels. (At least, nothing more than the jackets would have spoiled for me anyway.)<br /><br />It's very definitely aimed at young adults (say 10-12 and up), with its teenage protagonist dealing largely with the issue of learning to act as a thoughtful independent agent. The Discworld setting was there as backdrop, but largely irrelevant to the story at hand, and while there were comic moments, particularly with the Wee Free Men, this was not a laugh-out-loud sort of book. It was focused on several themes common (but nonetheless vital) to young adult novels: finding your place in the world, thinking before you act (especially if you are short on sleep), and most importantly not standing idly by while those around you suffer. It also sounds a stern warning not to get caught up in the madness of crowds. And, impressively, all of those themes were well served, because Pratchett makes sure that the reader sees that there are no Bad Guys, just people reacting (often without thinking) to the people and circumstances around them.<br /><br />Tiffany is a good heroine, strong-minded and action-oriented, but with a knack for self-reflection and enough humility that she quickly owns to her own mistakes and errors of judgment. I particularly enjoyed the fact that, unlike most heroines, she was expected to stand on her own two feet, and there was no one waiting in the wings to save her if she fell. This was unfortunately undercut by a mild love story that, while not in any way objectionable, simply didn't feel like it belonged in the tale of such an independent character. However, what was lacking in that department was made up by two very strong central images (the title and the hare) that Pratchett wove throughout; they are what I will take away from the novel long after I've forgotten (though not totally forgiven) its little bit of soppiness.<br /><br />So all in all, a solid, well-paced and well-written work of fantasy for younger readers.independent character.

B003Q6D27S|5.0|After a disappointing performance at the box office with \\"Saw 6\\" in 2009, the producers wisely decided that the seventh installment in the \\"Saw\\" franchise would be its last. People simply expressed a disinterest in the \\"Saw\\" series of films after the sixth. This is nothing new in the horror genre; many other scary films like \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\" suffered from the same fate as \\"Saw\\": overexposure of a great product at the box office.<br /><br /> The studio wondered how to bring the audience back for the final installent of \\"Saw 7\\" and the decision was made to make it in 3D. Also, it was announced heavily in the press that this 3D version would be the finale. Obviously both ideas worked wonderfully as \\"Saw 3D\\" became the #1 movie at North American cinemas Halloween weekend 2010 raking in an impressive $24,200,000. This made more than $10,000,000 than \\"Saw 6\\".<br /><br /> The story is pretty much the same as other installments in the \\"Saw\\" series; people are kidnapped by the maniacal Jigsaw and are put into torture chambers to realize how lucky they were with their lives. The propose reason for killing these victims is due to the fact they took their lives for granted. Not for those who have a weakness for gore, \\"Saw 3D\\" is exciting, involving, well-acted, and a thrill-ride. If you enjoyed the other \\"Saw\\" films \\"Saw 3D\\" will satisfy your thirst!<br /><br /> Cary Elwes who played a doctor in the original reprises his role in this outing, so his perfromance is a good bookmark for the franchise.
0307474712|5.0|This was a great book!  I got so wrapped up in the characters and couldn't put it down.  Totally wasn't expecting the ending outcome which made me love it more.  What an ending...Going back to the beginning killed me at that point of being so involved with them.  I didn't want it to end!
B003YHSE7W|3.0|Story line weak not as interesting as the first.  Implausible action; plasma whip can cut a race car in half, but iron man's suit just gets scorched? Iron man suddenly has a laser that can cut dozens of 'droids in half, but lets fire fight first for 5 minutes before deciding to use it?  If CGI is your thing, OK, but as a movie not worth the money.  Hollywood has become a wasteland of pathetic acting, writing and directing.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Clint Eastwood, one of my favorite actors of my youth, now partially retired as an actor is now dedicated to film directing. Im very very impressed by this film as Clint covers new ground dealing with life after death experiences and psychic phenomena that like the film suggests, there are people out there that have this GIFT and others are scammers.<br /><br />PLOT - This movie is 3 stories going on at the same time: A woman in Tsumani on vacation that experiences death. Two close twins and one of the dies and Matt Damon a retired psychic that was laid off and decided to take a break and go to England. With a magical twist of fate, all these 3 people meet each other at a Book Fair in London.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece and is real proof to me that MATT DAMON as an actor can cover a lot of ground which is a talent that not all actors are able to do.<br /><br />RATING 10<br /><br />RAY ST JOHN

B00005J6T1|3.0|Let's face it, this is not the greatest album of the 80's or of Madonna's career. In fact, the only reason i own it and listen to it is because it came from Madonna, if it was from anyone else i'd dispose of it faster than you can think of. I like to listen to it mostly because i like to go back to the beginnings of madonna.    Her bebut consits of disposable shallow bubble gum pop songs we're used to expecting from artists like Miley or Katy Perry. Madonna sounds really squeeky and her voice is nothing we're not used to expecting from other plastic pop starlets. In the era of MTV, talent was not really a prerequisite to be in Pop music, all you need is something catchy and an attractive enough image to keep your videos and music rotating on MTV.    The only song here worth my time is the irresistable \\"Holiday\\". It immediatley sounds like a classic and you just can't help but smiling while listening to it.    Another track that stands out is \\"Burning Up\\". It's nothing really major but it does stand out from the rest of the tracks in this bouncy debut.    If you're not really a Madonna fan or you're not on a nostalgia trip to revisit anything 80's you really won't be missing out on much here.     Just be sure to get your hands on \\"Holiday\\"
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Perfect casting, costuming and sets. Looks expensive. Ciaran Hinds is so good in this. He looks like the perfect sea captain that the ladies would love. No overly handsome \\"pretty boy\\" could play this role. Amanda Root looks a little wild-eyed most of the movie but she plays her role with tenderness. I love that the star crossed lovers get another chance and the ending is beautiful.

B003BW0CB6|3.0|I have read some Connelly in the past, a little here, a little there. I decided it was time to read some straight through, and I chose the Haller character to do it with as I'd been wanting to read \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" for quite some time. I loved \\"The Lincoln Lawyer.\\" I liked the next one, I kept reading. reading the five or so in a row I noticed something. Connelly is good, no doubt about it. But he's also repetitive, his plots don't really vary from novel to novel, and he steals from himself liberally. If you've read one, you've just about read them all (other than finding out what the newest coincidence/unlikely even is). If you read them once a year as they come out, no problem. He's a good writer, and you'll enjoy. If you read them all as a set, you will be disappointed at the repetitive nature of Connelly's work.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I won't spend too much time on the film, as most of you who are thinking of buying this blu-ray have already seen it, but here goes; The original Iron Man was a very fun ride thanks mainly to the absolutely perfect casting of Robert Downey Jr., as he essentially IS/WAS the bad boy that Tony Stark IS/WAS.  The script was fun, the effects were awesome, and while a bit by the numbers the movie had the huge benefit of the fact that Iron Man was (at the time) essentially a \\"B List\\" character in the Marvel Universe and no one really expected much out of the movie.  Now Iron Man 2 has the unenviable job of following up on the momentum started in part one, but for the most part pulls it off rather well.  Mickey Rourke spouts ominous lines about blood and sharks and what-not that could come off as silly except he's actually making a very true point that once you show that God (or in this case Iron Man) is mortal and can in fact be hurt people will no longer worship him.  Rourke delivers a fun performance with the only gripe being that I wish he was a little more fleshed out, as he really does have a reason to hate Tony Stark and the character could have been a little less one dimensional.  This is a script fault though, nothing to do with Rourke, as he makes the character work.  Sam Jackson is at times a bit too Pulp Fiction-ish in his delivery but for the most part is an awesome Nick Fury.  Paltrow delivers her usual good performance despite having to once again be the damsel in distress, and Scarlett J. is a wonderful Black Widow (who's true super power seems to be gorgeous self curling hair in battle scenes?).  Downey is Downey, he IS Tony Stark, and minus a couple times of going a bit overkill he is awesome.  A good movie, lots of Avengers set up, with an ending that's a bit rushed but overall ok.       Now to the actual blu-ray.  AWESOME!!  Tons of content, a director's commentary that's actually fun AND informative, and tight packaging.  As an added plus, the digital copy that every blockbuster has to have so they can add a \\"3 DISCS!\\" to the cover also contains a DVD copy of the film, a concept a truly wish all studios would adapt.  On the bonus disc you get hours worth of featurettes, some interesting deleted scenes, an AC/DC Shoot to Thrill music video, all three of the films trailers (why are some studios NOT putting the film's trailers on their own blu-ray's now???) as well as some other Marvel Trailers, etc.  Overall a very good package, highly recommended.

B0041JMT82|5.0|This book is very comprehensive and is divided up among the different shapes of crochet motifs.  There are also helpful instrucitons for how to crochet in the round in the beginning of the book that go beyond what I could find in other books.  I have learned how to start a magic ring (the easy way:), join new colors into a motif and to disquise a join from this book!  All of the crochet motifs are beautifully crafted and neat so even a beginner (like me) can see what is going on and how a finished object should look.    It is helpful to have a visual reference to the sometimes subtle differences in the crochet motifs featured.  I really like this book - if you are a beginner you should add this to your collection. I have found crochet in the round to be one of the more challenging techniques to date, this book really boosted my confidence and was the most helpful resource in doing so.  Five stars!
0345505387|1.0|I am a HUGE Outlander series fan! HUGE! So is my mother-in-law and we were both excited when we heard a new book, the retelling of Outlander from Jaime's viewpoint was coming out.  We did not know what a graphic novel was, and apparently missed that part when I saw the title.   Needless to say, neither of us were pleased when we got our books.  I agree with another poster that said, why would Diana waste her time writing this when she could be working on the next real book for the series.  Waste of time and money for this as far as I was concerned. I did not like the artwork, the story AND the artwork made it hard to enjoy and follow along. I did not finish this book and am highly disappointed.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I have every Megadeth album and I think think this one is one of the best of all time. It has classic Megadeth but also a mesh of complexities/ metal/ and blues augmented blues riffs. This is a great album and should get more recognition.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Long after viewing Frozen I'm still feeling its effects, so I'm compelled to write this review. The plot of \\"Frozen\\" is pretty simple as far as thrillers go. Three friends go on a snowboarding trip where they happen to get stuck on a ski lift. The ski resort is closing for the week and it just so happens to be Sunday night so basically, they're screwed. As the hours pass, and the weather worsens, the poor saps are forced into making drastic and ultimately deadly decisions in order to survive. Much like \\"Open Water\\" before it, \\"Frozen\\" is able to pull off being very simple but compelling which is central to its charm. While watching \\"Frozen\\" you can't help but put yourself in the characters shoes because the premise, while not probable is not imposable. I really enjoyed \\"frozen\\", while the plot maybe too simplistic and predicable for some, it had just enough emotional substance to keep me watching. I found myself guessing what would happen to the characters but kept watching just to see it unfold, so I think the film succeeded in what it was attempting to do. So, \\"Frozen\\" is definitely worth viewing. It wont dazzle you with special effects or keep you on the edge of your seat but it has just enough action and some pretty nasty scenes to make it a solid thriller. My suggestion, watch it right before you go on a snowboarding trip. It may get you second guessing on your travel plans.
0061989142|4.0|I enjoyed this book by Lauren Conrad, I like her style and thought she had some good fashion ideas.  The only problem I have with it is that the clothes she had in the book are way over my price budget.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|If you enjoyed the first two, you'll enjoy the final installation as well!  Larsson does a great job with his character development right up until the end.  Not my favorite book in the series, but an acceptable and suitable ending :)
0385738757|3.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers, this book is very much like \\"Lost\\".  Every time you think it's going to solve a riddle, 5 more pop up.  It picks up right where the first one left off, which was nice.  But then a lot of the main characters get split up and/or killed, and it just becomes total chaos and confusion.  The theme of this book is basically about the WICKED people (whoever they are) examining how the kids (but especially Thomas) handle the \\"variables\\" (which are never really explored, just mentioned constantly to the point of annoyance).  I did not enjoy this one as much as Maze Runner, the focus is completely on Thomas and there is very little on the rest of the kids - which gets a little monotonous/one dimensional.  I also wasn't sure how to feel about the big twist with Teresa - they never do make it clear what her deal is.  I felt like this one was a little all over the place, but it was still enjoyable and I got through it pretty quickly.  A fun, easy read... but I\\"m hoping the final book gets back up to the caliber of the original.
0143118420|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Does that make me shallow and self-absorbed?  I think not.  I gave her credit for going in search for help to make her life better.  Not much of that going around these days.  Too many think others should straighten out their problems.  She was fighting her own demons and trying to make sense of what made her tick.  I don't care that she didn't go and see all there was to see in the countries she visited.  She was there to improve her life, not be a tourist.  I  have, and will continue to, recommend this book.
0811876373|5.0|To be honest, when I first heard about cake pops I thought, how hard can they be?  I tried a recipe from the internet and though they turned out really tasty, the execution was pretty bad - and I consider myself a pretty accomplished baker.  So, I decided to buy this book in hopes of perfecting my new passion.  Well, I've only made one batch since I got the book (pumpkin pops for Halloween) and though it took me a bit to get the technique down, they turned out pretty darn well and got rave reviews at the bonfire party I took them to.  I really look forward to my next batch now that I have the technique down, thanks to the awesome tips from this book.  There are so many different decoration ideas in here, and it really is just a starting point.  The only negative I can say is that although the decorating ideas are endless, there is not really much focus on the taste.  There is the base recipe for cake pops, and \\"common combinations\\" as well as a few cake & icing recipes at the end. However, there is not a whole lot of creativity past your classic chocolate, white, and yellow.  I guess that part is up to you - which is just fine with me, that's the part I am very good at.
B001AGXEAG|3.0|I am a fan of Tim Burton, but there is something missing in this film for me, some lack of spirit, like it is merely clever rather than a coherent work of art.  Sure, the actors are very good, and it is a great pleasure to see the young Winona Ryder.  Keaton is great as well.  But Baldwin and Davis?  THey are kind of walking through their roles, just like they want to continue to exist more or less as they did before the inconvenience of their deaths.  There are lots of weird details, but they simply don't add up to a greater vision.  I expected more.  Much more.
B00402FGE4|5.0|Watching the first episode of this show, I was groaning constantly. It seemed that someone had sat down and decided to merge two of the most popular science fiction shows of the decade (LOST and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) into one expensive-looking series. I mean, it had all the cliches. You've got the pretty girl who pretty much has the words \\"love triangle\\" tattooed across her forehead, the awkward boy genius, the Adama-like commander, the Baltar-like scientist, and a goal of returning to Earth from someplace far away.<br /><br />Oh, and there were flashbacks. Sure, the action was cool, but it mostly looked like the visual effects artists of BSG had found new jobs.<br /><br />I worked my way past the two part pilot and into what the main concept of the series would be. You have an Ancient ship called \\"Destiny\\" flying somewhere in another galaxy, and a group of soldiers and civilians are effectively trapped aboard it. They have very little knowledge of what makes the ship tick or what its purpose even is; they can't even figure out how to turn it around or make it do simple things.<br /><br />Once I had given this premise a chance to settle, I continued on just to see if the writers would drop the ball. They didn't. They took that ball and ran with it to places that I still find myself trying to make sense of. I'm bewildered, frustrated, and angry at everyone on Destiny. And I'm loving every single second of it.<br /><br />What you have is a spacebound mystery that leaves you largely in the dark (LOST) on a ship where its crew just wants to go home (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA or STAR TREK: VOYAGER). The concept seems derivative, largely because it is, but once this series found its footing all bets were off. You stop caring about what Destiny really is, where its going, and why. Suddenly, I just started caring about the characters, and tried to put myself in their shoes as much as I could.<br /><br />In that sense, I think STARGATE UNIVERSE is starting to win me over more than BSG and LOST ever did. SGU has a lot to say about life, the universe, and everything, but hasn't yet allowed its story to suffer beneath the weight of religious overtones and politics. It tackles these subjects with a scalpel, giving you a good story first and a message second, never the other way around. It asks you to think, but doesn't force you to.<br /><br />And this series is visually beautiful, I have to say that. This is the space opera that I was hoping BSG would become. The acting is fantastic, as well; the cast really do all they can to sell this premise, the story, and their characters. The writers also do their best not to sell the science of the series short. For the most part, everything is well-researched and at least mostly plausible...given the implausible circumstances.<br /><br />I've just finished the last episode and I am jumping with excitement over what's going to happen in the next season. SGU has made a believer out of me. It's taken me on a wild ride: one that doesn't appear to be ending anytime soon.o say about life, the universe, and everything, but hasn't yet allowed its story to suffer beneath the weight of religious overtones and politics.

The Grand Design is the most readable, most engaging, and most easily understood look at space, space-time, dimensions beyond the three dimensions we're so comfortable with, and is a doggone good story well told.

B00005RHGK|4.0|As ridiculous a title as this movie has, you might assume that it's a teen slasher gore-fest. But the graphic violence is minimal, and much emphasis is placed on the relationship between the two adolescent siblings, Trish and Darry. Their sibling rivalry, with its petty bickering and silly games that only the two of them understand is refreshingly accurate, and they don't become all lovey-dovey when trouble comes their way.<br /><br />And trouble they have. A demon who, according to psychic Jezelle [Patricia Belcher] is permitted to feed for 23 days every 23 years is on day 22 of its eating binge. It captures young healthy people whose scent makes it wild with desire. It takes only certain parts, eyes to help it see, hearts to help its own heart stay strong and beating, and so on. Then it sews up the corpses to preserve them in a quilt, which it keeps in the basement of an old church (desecrated, no doubt). When Trish and Derry see one of the demon's sewn up, quilt-bound bodies dropped through an old pipe that leads into the basement of the church, they feel compelled to go back and see if they can help the victim. But the victim is beyond help, and now the demon has their scent, and it loves what it smells of one of them--which one, we do not know. But the demon is after them as a final addition to its collection.<br /><br />Along the way, Trish and Darry never suddenly turn into best friends--they annoy the heck out of each other up until the very end. But they do band together, as siblings will, and their private games and one-ups-manship tells us that their relationship is deeper than either would admit. The love-hate feelings of siblings is very well done, and is one of the highlights of the movie. Too, like most horror movies with teen protagonists, we never see parents, and parents would be of no help. This movie, and others like it are an allegory for the transition to adulthood that we all must make on our own.<br /><br />I do wish they'd thought more about the title, but Jeepers Creepers is an effective coming-of-age movie, with authentic characterizations and a fairy tale plot in a modern setting, with the traditional fairy tale goal--make the transition alive.Creepers is an effective coming-of-age movie, with authentic characterizations and a fairy tale plot in a modern setting, with the traditional fairy tale goal--make the transition alive.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I picked this book up on a lark- I had seen several people reading it, and at least one of my friends mentioned that she was currently reading it.<br />After starting, it took me about a week to get through this book- I was coming home from work looking forward to reading, planning out what times I would be able to read and for how long, etc.<br /><br />There are some wickedly horrendous parts to this book that really made me want to throw up, but, like a car wreck, you can't turn away!

B0002KVULG|5.0|After upon arriving in London from Transylvania, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) is the only survivor on a ship as Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis) rescues him as she is on her way to visit her good friend Lucy (Kate Nelligan). Dracula meets Lucy, her father Seward (Donald Plesance) and fiancee Harker (Trevor Eve) as they make Dracula feel welcome at home, that is until Dracula lusts for both Lucy and Mina for he feeds upon them and other victims in an English village. Doctor Van Helsing (Laurence Olivier), Seward and Harker team together to try to put an end to the king of vampires.<br /><br /> A highly underrated version of the timeless story from Bram Stoker! this Walter Mirsch (Pink Panther) production is one of the better Dracula adaptations. John Williams boasts a tremendous score and Langella portrayed Dracula well like Bela, Christopher Lee, Gary Oldman and more. There is a romantic and sexual passion in this 1979 version even though it's different from the book, the special effects for it's day are quite good and some of the acting is good too. It's based more on the play that Langella starred rather than any other version of Dracula as i say it works very well.<br /><br />This DVD contains a great transfer with few extras like audio commentary, featurette and photo gallery.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|What a worthless piece of trash. Patently offensive throughout the length of this epic in boredom. No laughs. Uggggh. Had to tolerate this becuase my wife insisted on sitting through to the bitter end, but she didn't like it any better.
B000JML7YC|3.0|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JML7YC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img<br /><br />This initially funny, then sad, then silly novel begins in one tone: Catherine is a silly girl who reads too many Gothic novels and and takes her ideas of life from them. As the fourth of ten children, she is overjoyed when a childless couple invite her to accompany them for a six-week stay at a spa. There she makes several friends in succession, in a way such that she comes to realize that real life doesn't copy Gothic romances quite as much as she thought. When she is invited for a three-week, then indefinite, stay at the Tilney household of Northanger Abbey, her reading causes her to leap to unwarranted conclusions from which she is yanked by the uncompromising sensibility of Henry Tilney.<br /><br />As she proceeds toward mental normality, away from the constant influence of the novels, she is totally startled when the General, Henry's father, who had appeared to be highly in favor of a marriage between Catherine and Henry, orders her sent home instantly with his strong disapproval. He is not even gutsy enough to tell her himself, but sends her friend, his daughter Eleanor, to tell her. It is due only to Eleanor's prudence that Catherine even has the money with which to get home by stagecoach.<br /><br />Still stunned, she is pulled out of the depths of depression by a visit from Henry, who tells her why his father had behaved so badly and assures her that he still wants to marry her. Her parents agree to the marriage only on condition that the general also agree.<br /><br />Up until now, the novel has worked very well. But what should be probably a quarter of the book is jammed into a couple of chapters of hasty telling, with no showing at all. One has the feeling that the author was tired of the book. Considering that it was her first novel and that she wrote it out in longhand, I suspect that was the case. All the authors I know, including my husband and I, are tired of the book by that point. But with a computer, it is a lot easier to go on and finish the book correctly than it was in the days of quill pens and inkwells--especially since Austen had no room of her own and had to keep her manuscript in what we would now call the living room, simply covering it when visitors arrived.<br /><br />This is a highly uneven book. That has led to a problem with deconstructionists finding in it all kinds of things that, for the most part, are present in neither the text nor the subtext nor even the author's context. Such fiddling around is not necessary. The faults in the text are quite obvious and do not need to be sought after with Satan's magnifying glass.lot easier to go on and finish the book correctly than it was in the days of quill pens and inkwells--especially since Austen had no room of her own and had to keep her manuscript in what we would now call the living room, simply covering it when visitors arrived.

031603438X|5.0|To be honest, I don't know what the reviewers who gave this book less than 3 stars were expecting. I do agree that it is a real pleasure to read if you are a Rolling Stones fan. However, if you are expecting a junkie memoir, most likely you will be disappointed. If you want to read a book that is primarily about Keith Richards drug use you should purchase \\"Up and Down with the Rolling Stones\\" written by his close friend, Spanish Tony Sanchez.  \\"Life\\" is about the inner workings of the Rolling Stones, the hanger-ons, his friends, and some pretty zany adventures ;but  centers primarily  with what matters most to Keith Richards, his music. For instance, before reading this book I really didn't know how or who wrote the music and lyrics. The songs were written by Jagger-Richards , what does that mean? Who did what?  Was it like a Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership that fizzled out long before and was continued to fulfill contract obligations? You will have to read the book to find out. While his drug use is mentioned in the book, it did not consume it. It was part of his life and it influenced his music , the Rolling Stones and his personal life. However, this book is also about recovering from addiction. This guy was seriously strung-out on heroin and lived to tell about getting clean and getting on with his life; talk about real inspiration. He has my respect for that alone. Another thing I like is that he didn't use this book to settle old scores. In contrast, Bill Wyman's book \\" Stone Alone\\" was basically a chance to vent on how much he disliked working with Mick Jagger and his rage with other members of the band; a chance to tell the world how he really felt about working with the Rolling Stones! Keith Richards is honest but not hurtful. I enjoyed reading this book. \\"Life\\" was written with taste and honest introspection. Furthermore, I realized that I really didn't know who Keith Richards was before reading this book. There is another Keith Richards besides the junkie persona that seems to follow him wherever he goes. I enjoyed getting to know the recovered Keith Richards.he junkie persona that seems to follow him wherever he goes. I enjoyed getting to know the recovered Keith Richards.
1439133948|3.0|I waited a long time for this book. It's definitely worth a read if you are a long time Vor series fan, but if you haven't read the whole series then start from the beginning; otherwise you may be disappointed by Cryoburn. It definitely lacked the LOL moments that we got in previous books and the plot twists weren't really jaw dropping. Not exactly predictable but not exactly heart stopping. Miles affection for the children is touching and sweet but they only elude to Miles former uncanny ability to escape death and capture (with lots of laughs along the way) which made us fall in love with the series to begin with. Even in the action scenes I didn't feal intense fear that THIS was the time he'd run out of luck. Yes he's older and has a family, but he's still MILES.     This book won't change your life but it will make you feel like some hole in your sci-fi reading heart has been finally filled. It just made me want the next one.     I confess I read reviews after I heard someone dies because I didn't want to be thrown into a depression if Miles was killed off (just so Bujold didn't have to write anymore?). I thought the ending was good enough without the \\"Afterwards\\". It leaves it open for more in the series which Bujold knows we want. I hope she gives it to us.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Give this one a miss.  This is definitely not the story of Beowulf.  They took far too many liberties with the story and cheapened a classic epic by 1)adding stupid comic and overly sexy details; 2)using gratuitous blood spatterings and much gore; 3)altering the plot significantly; 4)making Beowulf a boastful, lying, easily-seduced muscle-bound \\"hero.\\"  Hrothgar as the father of Grendel?  Honestly!  Even worse, Beowulf as the father of the dragon!    As a teacher, I previewed this DVD to see if I could recommend it to my students.  Absolutely not!  No way would I let my own children (all teenagers) see it, and I'm going to get rid of my copy as soon as possible.    Disgusting!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" is a very thorough analysis of the recent and enduring global financial crisis.  It gives the chapter by chapter time line but fails to give us what to do next?  There may be no easy answer as it looks like the dishonesty and greed was endemic to Wall Street and the top tiers of government.  This is a crisis that is world-wide and we are still looking for solutions today.<br /><br />There must have been no guards at the gates of greed - no regulations on convoluted financial instruments.  It absolutely astounded me that multiple people could insure the same property and then bet against it.  The many interviews and research were well organized.  Many of the key people in government and at top financial organizations refused to be interviewed, although the evidence of conflict of interest in many decisions is overwhelming.  High level politicians, journalists, financial managers, economists, and others were interviewed on how a crisis of this magnitude happened.  It cost over $20 trillion and causes grief with unemployment and on-going foreclosures.  It is an amazing piece of work, well worth watching, discussing and action.  The rich get richer, more power, and blatant disregard for the common good.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|New to the world of the Twilight Saga? If yes keep reading.     If you are looking for a new fantasy adventure series to fall in love with believe me you are making the right choice. If you love the harry potter books and inspired films by JK Rolling then you will love the books and inspired films by Stephanie Myer. Twilight Eclipse is the third movie and book and to fully appreciate this film I suggest you watch the two films before it and read the books Twilight and New Moon. If you are a parent trying to get your child interested into more history books and movies the twilight saga is a great place to start. Stephanie Myer really did her homework for creating the world of twilight. Readers and viewers will get an in depth view of what life was like in the early centuries especially in the twilight saga eclipse film. Watch Rosalie's pre vampire world of life in the 1930's and Jaspers life as a younger calvary solider. This movie will surely inspire anyone to learn more about history. The music can also inspire viewers to appreciate the art of classical music. Howard Shore's production of each musical piece really helps set the mood for the world of twilight and the most important band muse give our action adrenaline junkies something too. In fact had it not been for the band muse none of this would have been possible since their music is what inspired stephanie myer to write the book.     Looking to broden your horizons of literature, music and above all fun then buy this movie if anything it will give you something to smile about and with the way things are in the world today what wrong with something to brighten up your day?  Absolutely nothing. Smile, laugh and enjoy eclipse and mark your calenders for the final chapter in the twilight saga breaking dawn coming to theaters November 18, 2011 for part one and November 16,2012 for part 2. I am literally bursting at the seems for those two films to come out next and I am counting down the days until December 4 of this year for the eclipse dvd to be released.

This album is a little heavy on the symphonic choiral arrangements...but I like those...some people may be put off by this. I was really surprised when I heard \\"Gateways\\" It sounds a lot like a Mushroomhead song! My husband even brought that when he heard it. I am very happy to see this song is in the top 5 at Liquid Metal the Sirius Metal station (even though it is a rare day when they generously may play a Black Metal or Prog metal song)The list is made by the listeners. So perhaps the station might consider adding some Black/Prog metal once in a while! I highly recommend this album and there is not one reference to Satan in all the lyrics which is refreshing!
B00003CXUM|5.0|I had no idea who Wong kar-wai was when I saw IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE at an international film festival in 2000. Nor was I familiar with actors Tony Leung Chiu-wai or Maggie Cheung. Or cinematographer Christopher Doyle. So I had no idea what to expect. Which may be the best possible frame of mind to be in when about to encounter the sublime...<br /><br />A gorgeous, atmospheric, sensual and very artful film, it centers on a man and a woman who rent rooms in the same home in cramped Hong Kong, 1962. Each is married, though we don't see their spouses. In fact, we don't really see many other people, and we usually see the two in close quarters, whether together or apart - at home, at work, in the street, in a restaurant, in the back of a cab. There is much to this film beneath its lush, color-saturated surface...it is a mesmerizing exploration of repressed desire, the other side of infidelity...and lost time.  Wong's use of Nat King Cole on the soundtrack, singing in Spanish, is inspired.<br /><br />Since seeing IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, I've made a point to see Wong's other films (and own some of them): DAYS OF BEING WILD (1991), CHUNGKING EXPRESS (1994), HAPPY TOGETHER (1997) and 2046 (2004). Wong kar-wai is one of the great contemporary auteurs and I look forward to his upcoming release, THE GRAND MASTER, starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Zhang Ziyi.<br /><br />I've also sought out other films featuring the great Tony Leung Chiu-wai (who has won 5 Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Actor and 2 for Best Supporting Actor) and Maggie Cheung (winner of 5 Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Actress); the two appeared together in the 2002 Zhang Yimou epic, HERO.<br /><br />Interested?

Each and every song touches both my heart and my mind. It will yours, too.
B0041EUFGU|4.0|\\"Mr. And Mrs. Smith\\" is an enjoyable and very watchable action flick that also has a lot very funny scenes interspersed through out. This review is for the \\"R\\" rated Amazon OnDemand version.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on a typical upper-middle class couple living a seeming normal life in suburbia, but both leading double lives as assassins. The pace of the movie starts out a little slowly, but picks up as their relationship and work lives begin to collide.<br /><br />There is definite on screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and that goes a long way to compensate for some of the slower scenes and occasionally hokey situations.<br /><br />This is not a very deep movie, but it is a good choice when looking for a lot of action, a little romance, and a laugh or two.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B000F8O35U|1.0|The DVD that I purchased was advertised as a 'new' product but upon delivery it was found to be open, used and damaged. I am most upset because I paid over $30.00 for the product. Thank goodness it was my niece I was sending it to and not a friend. I would have been mortified to send a defective product to a friend. If it is at all possible to get a refund or new DVD, I would like one.  Sarah
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It was advertized as, like new, it didn't even have so much as a finger print on it...   Delivery was fast.    Plus I LOVE the movie, but i already knew that...
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|AWESOME!!!    My 3 yr old twins (boy/girl) love the colors and scenery of the movie.  The story of love between two people beyond anything physical and without any selfish motives, transcends all age groups and was refreshing to see!  Loved it from beginning to end!    Service was great too.  We didn't expect it as soon as it came but they got it to us in less than a week!
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|I had really high hopes for this movie.  What a let down.  If the director is trying to attract a younger audience, I am afraid none of them will get it.  I do understand what the premise was, but think it was poorlly executed.  Not believable enough for adults, and too deep for teens.  What a waste of my time.  I totally don't get all the positive reviews.  I fell asleep half way through, then tried to get through it again before finally turning it off.  I love deep thinking suspense movies.  This was epic garbage.  Blech.
B001BNFR6W|2.0|Bought this set new on sale at Bestbuy. These are the fussiest discs ever. None of my players have ever rejected a disc before, not even the most suspicious rentals so I know it's not my equipment. So far they will all play, but no 2 are the same in their quirks. I thought some discs wouldn't play at all since they wouldn't work in my blu-ray player, but they would play OK on the PCs. Some will play fine in the Blu-ray player but only IF I fool with going to the disc menu and \\"Play all\\" from there. Some will only play from \\"Play all\\" and not individual episodes from the list.  Some discs freeze on the opening menu but will play if I hit \\"disc menu\\" on the remote. The most consistency I had was on computers.<br /><br />I only paid $30 so I can't complain too much.  I'd advise only buying this set IF it is on sale, and you have some flexibility as to where you watch them.  If a computer isn't an option, think twice.
0316069485|4.0|Michael Connelly has been one of the most intriguing contemporary authors in recent years and in The Reversal he does not disappoint!  The author's  knowledge of criminal proceedure and courtroom operation are on point from start to finish.  His story telling is top notch and all this equalls into a very fine tale.  When Mickey Haller switches from the defense  table and go over to the prosecution table and then teams up with Deputy DA Maggie McPherson, their has to be something special.  Plus, when you add the antics of long time LAPD detective Harry Bosch, who just digs and digs (literally & figuratively), you really have a team that is interesting.  It is a good story line and characters are developed to the point that you feel as though you might be sitting in the courtroom watching as they begin the prosecution of child killer Jason Jessup. The initial portion of the trial is fairly routine but as things progress, the suspense builds and the reader questions the ultimate direction of he story.  Throughout the story, Connelly shows us the lengths that an unscrupulous defense attorney may go to in an over zealous defense.  Bottom line:  If you enjoy good courtroom drama, with numerous associated twists, you'll love this book.
1594488843|5.0|I love it when friends, authors, thinkers, comedians, and scientists are able to cut to the heart of something we've all been thinking, but were never able to articulate: in Drive, Daniel H. Pink goes after our real or imagined relationship with money, and to what extent it actually motivates us to not just work harder, but be more creative and effective in our jobs.<br /><br />Not only are his findings fascinating, they're so contradictory of traditional Economic models for human behaviour that he proposes a totally new paradigm. He calls it Drive 3.0. (Drive 1.0 being Biological, and 2.0 being Economic)<br /><br />Since most of us (in the developed world) have the first two taken care of by about age 25, most offices and workplaces are filled with bored empty zombies, clacking keys and shoving paper around until they retire. Their problem is they bought into the Drive 2.0 model (\\"it's all about money, make more and you'll be happier\\")<br /><br />Well, of course money makes some people happy right? Sure! When those people are running short of it!<br /><br />Anyone in the US who makes less than about 30 thousand dollars annually will actually be ecstatic to get more money. They can be incentivized to work more and work harder on any job, you name it. But once they hit the 30 thousand mark, they start to slack off. Money is about survival, and 30 grand is enough for most people to survive. Once they start making more than that, it's time to stop paying, and start inspiring. And here's where the fun, cool, creative jobs are. Pink refers to this new motivator as Intrinsic motivation.<br /><br />Wow. Sounds amazing right? Wouldn't that be incredible if you could just hit the phones, bursting with energy for 8 hours straight, calling up prospects, pulling in commissions, and all the while, just feeling happy and delighted at work?<br /><br />You're right. It would be. So how does that happen?<br /><br />Traditional economic models we studied in school indicated that if people wanted something bad enough, that demand would push up prices. At the Undergraduate level we always assume that more money is good, and can never be bad. Therefore, if you give someone more money, they will always be happier and have more utility.<br /><br />That's where the cracks in Drive 2.0 start to show. The purely Economic man is just utilitarian. He'll work doing any job (shudder) just to make money. He then takes his utility and doles it out to his family members in the form of consumption and `time off'.<br /><br />The message is simple: work is painful and bad, money is what you get for doing the bad stuff, and with money you buy things and go on trips and have fun. I repeat: work is painful and bad. If we cling to this ancient model any longer it will doom us to boring listless work lives. And we have no excuses, because there are examples of very cool fun exciting workplaces all over the world.<br /><br />If you can't imagine how such a workplace would function, I want you to think about Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player, arguably the greatest competitor there ever was. He wanted to play against the best in the world.<br /><br />If MJ just wanted to win, he could have played against college kids all day, not play against the best players in the world. So we know ego wasn't his main drive.<br /><br />If he just wanted money, he never would have had the motivation to even make the High School team... he would have just been a Doctor, Lawyer or Stock Broker...So we know money wasn't his main drive.<br /><br />If he just wanted Championship rings he would have called up his friends and taken his Dream Team buddies on the easier, dullest Dynasty of all time....So we know Rings weren't his main drive. And besides, when he put that jersey on, MJ had no friends. Not even on his own team.<br /><br />And yet he went in to work, and performed brilliantly. He had fire, passion, motivation, and will. And when he needed more of it, he created it outof thin air. Would anyone say he was doing it for ego, cash or rings? History shows that he didn't do that. In fact he recently commented that he never would have joined up with Charles Barkley or Magic Johnson-he wanted to beat them. [...]<br /><br />The point is, when you watched Michael when he was in the zone, he was in a totally different head space. It's when you're faced with a challenge, but you have the power and resources to overcome it, and you relish in that challenge, as well as the triumph. That zone is known as Flow. And Flow, my friend, is what's missing from your job-not cash, an executive washroom, or Casual Fridays.<br /><br />Ok, Cash. It's a sensitive subject, so let's address the elephant in the room.<br /><br />Bottom line, most people are totally baffled when it comes to money. When they have too little of it, they complain, and when they start making more of it, they don't know where to put it or how to invest; if anything they get too comfortable and start flashing the credit cards, which ultimately lead to financial ruin. Most people never reach a `good place' when it comes to their finances. It just doesn't seem there's ever enough of it! And yet we were always taught in class that the more we get, the happier (er, full of utility) we get!<br /><br />Pink explains that our desire for money is pretty much relegated to basic expenses like buying food and paying bills, but nothing like Flow. Not only is Money incapable of `buying' flow, our compensation packages often stand in our way of flow. Wait, what? Ironically the more companies pay us to do our jobs, the less we enjoy them. Harkening back to the simplistic models of Econ 101, we naturally associate any activity that we're being paid to do, as work, and suddenly, not as fun as if we were doing the exact same thing for free (reverse rationalization, if you will). Being paid or incentivized actually throws off a lot of the creativity and joy of work.<br /><br />Can you imagine how hard it would be to write a Hollywood movie, knowing that you might make 20 million dollars if it's a hit, and you'll probably never work again if it's a dud? Ouch. Better stick to a bland romantic comedy with the current it girl, and quirky goofy model actor.<br /><br />So we combine these two huge ideas thusly: when you or your employees graduate from school, they will do anything for money; they need it to pay off loans, to get a new car, maybe put money down on a new house or a honeymoon, but as their salaries rise, don't expect that to fuel them forever. As your employees move into management roles, you have to get the most out of them by inspiring them, and giving them the freedom to choose how they want to do their jobs (scary, I know). As long as their job is challenging (but not impossible) they'll always be jacked up to come into work, and if necessary, stay overtime working on the latest big project. Nurture their creative sides, and everyone in the company will benefit.<br /><br />To sum up, this book is the difference between a great job, and a terrible one. It declares the Drive 2.0 model dead, and consider yourself lucky that you got the message early. Can you use these ideas at your current Workplace?Then start today. If not, start looking for a place you where can. It's worth it.<br /><br />Just do it.<br /><br />More Reviews like this on 21tiger<br /><br />Michael Robson<br />[...]fact he recently commented that he never would have joined up with Charles Barkley or Magic Johnson-he wanted to beat them.

B0025KVLTC|3.0|Although it is one of their better albums, it is no better then Rubber Soul, The White Album, or Sgt. Peppers.  I don't get what makes so many people think this is their best album.  Some people even believe this is the best rock album of all-time.  Maybe its because, a long time ago, Rolling Stones magazine, on their older list of \\"best albums of all-time\\", put Revolver at number 1.  I don't know.      About half of the album is very good Beatle music.  Nothing as good as \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" or \\"Let It Be\\" is on this album though.  The other half of the album is kind of weak.  George Harrison has 3 songs out of the 14, which is more harrison per lennon/mccartney song then any Beatle album.  Theres' some pretty sappy or corny songs on this album too that kind of bring down the overall greatness of the work as a whole.        This album is good, 3.5 stars.  Just don't think you are getting some kind of incredible masterpiece, as a lot of people have suggested.
0525948023|5.0|I was going through a particularly bad time when I started this book and sought this book out for that very reason.  I knew I couldn't keep being so negative, I needed a solution (although, I was sure it would not work, I still bought it). In retrospect, that was mainly self-created/ego suffering. I was actually taking time in my day to cry.  I thought it would be cathartic. It wasn't, it just reminded me to be sad everyday :) LOL! The pain-body (a variant of the ego) loves pain because that is what keeps it alive and it can be very seductive. I felt so justified in my anger and sadness.  Now I know. Now, not only can I see my ego, it so apparent to me that my friends and family members also like to dwell in past suffering and negativity i.e. in pain body/ego land.     I was a cynic when I started the book. I grew up in an environment where everyone was 'mock-spiritual' and the books they read and the practices they followed never brought me any solace. So that is how you become a cynic. I remember reading Tolle's first chapter where he says: 'this book will change your life or be completely meaningless to you'. I remember my exact thoughts at that moment (it was my ego reaction): 'Wow, what an arrogant guy'. That first chapter didnt do much for me (it was just a general introduction), but the further I read the more I understood. He was not arrogant, he was right. This book profoundly changed my life (the only thing that has had this level of positive impact). Im not telling you I'm enlightened, but I stopped crying about that issue (doesn't seem at all important now). What reading A New Earth does for most people is bring into their lives a new element that they rarely experienced in the past. It is a slight awakening and every moment offers the choice between living in the moment (experiencing more awakening) and not. As for Tolle's famoust words: 'this book will change your life or be completely meaningless to you': I found it to be profoundly transformative, sodid 2 of my friends. I offered it to my sister, she said: 'how could I not be my ego?' and she gave me back the book. I think the book and its insight is available to you when you are ready for it and mostly when you have suffered a lot (as Tolle says suffering is most peoples spiritual teacher). That is because to really get it you have to realize that feeding the ego is counterproductive to your aims. When you suffer letting go of the ego does not seem to be such a bad idea. When everything is going well your ego seems like your best friend...    To those that say this book is meaningless. It might meen more to you when you are sick of your ego. When you realize that psychological pain and suffering are simply mind games, and have no real basis. There are no problems in the Now.  To those who have never read this book, I suggest getting a copy and if you don't get it now, Im pretty sure there will be a time in your life when all this clicks.   I read the following books: A New Earth-Ekhart Tolle, My Stroke of Insight-Jill Bolte Taylor, and The Power of Now-Eckhart Tolle: I consider it to be the trilogy that finally made me understand the spiritual realm and removed a lot of negativity from my life.     What is important is constantly dwelling in the now, by not letting your mind/ego take over everything you do. Everyone who complains about Tolle, saying that it is a quick fix, simply missed the essence of the teaching. Its a practice, and an arduous one, but the rewards are phenomenal. When I go through periods of dwelling in the practice, outside external problems do not affect me as much. However, when something does bother me a lot is when I realize that I have not been practising present-moment awareness. So the essence is keeping the practise alive in your life and once you have awakened even slightly it is hard to go back to complete ignorance (which is reassuring). AND once you have really, truly figured this out, you will realize that you already have within you, the solution to every single problem that will arise in your life.

I love Disney, But there were some dissapointing flicks.<br /><br />Starting in 1989, The Little Mermaid started the Disney Renaissance. It included movies like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Tarzan, and others. The Disney Renaissance ended in 1999. I just hope that The Princess and The Frog starts another Renaissance.<br /><br />This would be awesome!

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I loved \\"Band of Brothers\\" and was very happy when \\"the Pacific\\" after years of discussion became a reality.  Unfortunately, that reality was often disappointing although there were bright spots.<br /><br />One thing that I think is pretty much undeniable is that unlike \\"Band of Brothers\\" the story in \\"the Pacific\\" lacked cohesion.  It jumped back and forth from character to character and it didn't have the same wallop that \\"Band of Brothers\\" did by showing one group of men who fought together in a series of battles.<br /><br />The Good Parts<br /><br />1.  The fighting on Pelelieu was incredibly well done.  I had no idea until seeing the series that it was bad as that.<br /><br />2.  The scenes on Okinawa had similar impact.<br /><br />The Bad Parts<br /><br />1.  The Australia leave episode...nothing particularly wrong with it but it was totally expendable and slowed down the narrative (and I understand that the Leckie romance that was the central part of it was fictional anyway, so why bother?)<br /><br />2.  Leckie and his problem with bed wetting:  The episode that focused on Leckie's embarrassing problem really was the nadir of the series to me. I know that things like this happen in war but they are just not \\"cinematic\\" and the last thing I want to spend time watching.<br /><br />3.  The fact that the entire series never showed any of the Marines taking prisoners.  I know that the Pacific theater was possibly more merciless than the European theater, but I think it would have been good to show the protagonists of the story actually seeing the enemy up close after they'd surrendered (and some Japanese did surrender and did not get shot while trying to do so).<br /><br />4.  Tom Hanks' asinine comments about the war being charged with racism and vengeance were a major turn off to me.  I have no doubt that racism (on both sides) was present but \\"you live when you live\\" and it's infuriating to see someone judging events that happened a long time ago with sensibilities that have become predominant only recently.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointed and I don't see myself buying this DVD set.  I can only hope that Hanks and company do a series about other forgotten wars like Korea or maybe World War I or the Italian campaign in WWII.

0307120007|1.0|I am at a complete loss as to why this book is a classic.  Is it just because it has been around so long?  The story is non-existent and the language is halting and awkward (and yes, I get that repetition is good for language development, but not if you can't stand to read it more than once).  \\"Bunny is eating his good supper.\\"  Really?  In addition to it's lack of charm, the book itself is cheaply made, smells funny and can be unsafe, as the plastic binder is easily removed by determined little hands.  There are far better books for $10.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|I can only imagine someone liking this film if they've never seen the original, because it breaks no new ground in the franchise.  It works double-time to copy the original's high points, right down to Adrien Brody and Alice Braga slavishly aping Arnold Schwarzenegger and Elpidia Carillo.  I struggle to grasp so many creative people approaching such a popular franchise and producing such an uninspired product.<br /><br />Eight people, mostly men, wake up in freefall over a bizarre jungle, strapped into chutes and packing heat, but with no idea how they got there.  They are conscientiously multi-racial and multi-national, but they all speak English.  Perhaps their captors checked their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.  When strange critters with dozens of tusks attack, the humans realize they're trapped in an alien game preserve, and they're the designated prey.<br /><br />First, the underrated Danny Trejo deserves better than this film gives him.  Laurence Fishburne is wasted in Gary Busey's Predator 2 role.  This movie offers a checklist of Unlikely Heroes Being Chased stereotypes.  Adrien Brody makes a particularly unconvincing action figure.  We scarcely see the shimmery effect that was so creepy in the first film.  And since when does the Predator's battle cry sound like Chewbacca?<br /><br />This movie does nothing to build tension.  It never convinces me that these human characters deserve to live.  The action scenes appear unmotivated, and the dialog sounds like it was written by a computer that ate the original script and spat back something passably similar.  Robert Rodriguez is better than this, as is this cast.  After interminable sequels, I wish they'd stopped after the first one.
0307386171|4.0|I had to read this book as part of a reading group I belong to. I thought it started out weird and couldn't understand what the story was about for most of the novel. However, it all finally came together at the end and I really enjoyed it. The book has a great story to tell and an important message to convey. I would highly recommend this book and this author -- quick, easy read.
B000001ELB|5.0|I've had this album before, but on cassette tape.  I'm revamping my Kiss collection.  A classic for any Kiss freak!
B001R4MEU2|5.0|As a big fan of Procol Harum, I was in the 1970s often looking out for music in the same genre as this amazing group. I read at a certain point an article on Genesis, and subsequently bought their newest album \\"Selling England By the Pound\\".<br /><br />I remember that I initially found their music somewhat strange, even though the group, as Procol Harum had something symphonic about them, there were so many rhythm changes, and the song writing did not have the same tight structure as Gary Brooker's.  Procol Harum  ahd a strong inspiration from classical music, but also had strong roots in r&b. With Genesis it was much harder to define, what kind of music was their main-influence.<br /><br />I did fall relatively quickly for the group's music and wanted to search for the their earlier records, including \\"Foxtrot\\".<br /><br />The album has a little more edgy sound than \\"Selling England\\" and it does not have very catchy tunes like \\"I Know What I Like\\", but there are still plenty of melodic highlights to find on the record.<br /><br />\\"Watcher of the Skies\\" is at once stately and rocking. The number is actually quite typical of the group's music during this period. Lots of funny rhythm shifts, but I somehow feel that the number lacks a little melodically; especially when compared to other tracks from the album.<br /><br />\\"Time Table\\" is a beautiful ballad built up around the piano. A great song which is allowed to be just this.<br /><br />\\"Get 'Em Out by Friday\\" is a more complex number which contains various musical pieces. Another highlight.<br /><br />\\"Can Utility and the Coast Liners\\" with its very mysterious lyrics is another very melodic song; beautiful build-up;  again by several different pieces.<br /><br />\\"Horizons\\" is a pretty little acoustic guitar number, which  works as a prologue to the album's long suite \\"Supper's Ready\\". \\"Supper's Ready\\" is a very ambitious piece, put together by seven different parts, each with its own subtitle, spanning a total of 23 minutes.<br /><br />It goes without saying that it takes some litenings to get an overview of the number.

0060899220|5.0|A friend loaned me this book and I chewed through it slowly, savoring every delicious eye-bite.<br /><br />There are days when I really miss being in the service industry and reminisce fondly of those good times.  Then there are days when I'm reminded of the reality within the reminiscence and I'm immeasurably grateful I got out before I completely burnt out.<br /><br />Reading Bourdain's book, I had both those feelings at once.  It was, for me, a bittersweet ode to the best and worst of times in my life, the times which have shaped my character and outlook on life, taught and toughened me, gave me a thick skin, creative vocabulary, mad skills and incurable neuroses. I was not a chef in NYC, but a bartender in New Orleans.  Same underbelly, but with different points of view from different ends of the animal.  What's interesting is how similar the experiences and mindsets are. His thoughts on mise en place, psychopathic geniuses, oblivious owners, newbies, wannabes, \\"artists,\\" battle wounds and life in a perpetual sleep-deprived chemical haze could have been written by any one of the thousands of us lunatics for whom the industry was/is our chosen home and our addiction/obsession.  He just does it so much better (and much funnier) than many of us could manage.<br /><br />I am buying a copy for my daughter who is One Of Us.  She's been on the front lines and behind the scenes tending bar, waiting tables, running food, cooking, catering and kicking ass expediting in the window. I guess this kind of craziness is in the blood and can't be understood by mere mortals.  Bourdain will have a multi-generational following of fans by the time she gets done with the first chapter.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|The \\"Sex in the City\\" movies (and the HBO series) are excellent cultural documents of post-Giuliani gentrified Manhattan if looked at as satirical commentaries on a certain class of silly women of a certain age, and a particular type of equally silly, female-identified gay men who emulate them. The characters are excellent representatives of mindless consumerism that thinks of itself as stylish and cutting edge, of people incapable of sustaining a meaningful relationship who think of this as being independent, of shallow sexual antics that disguises itself as sexual empowerment, and of the class-aggressiveness of the professional middle classes (with a faint whiff of racist exclusion manifest by the papacy of non-white faces in a majority-minority city) that masquerades as urban sophistication. It captures these realities of contemporary Manhattan perfectly, to which may be added similar scenes in Washington, D.C., Centre City Philadelphia, the Castro in San Francisco and several other trendy urban environments. The film itself is of course silly, but that's beside the point. It is a major artifact of the current moment in big city America, the way \\"The French Connection\\" captured the urban decay and grittiness of the 1970s. Anyone interested in this phenomenon should definitely see this film, then take a stroll though the far west side of Chelsea, or Login Circle in Washington, or down Market in Phili, et. al. It'll be enlightening as well as a good laugh; just make sure you're laughing at these scenes and people and not with them.
0316098337|5.0|I was surprised by the range of 'stars' for this book.  I loved it!! The voice and reasoning of a 5-yr old brain.  A mother's hope and effort to raise a healthly, intelligent little boy.  It was shocking sometimes.  Definitely not fun and games.  But amazingly hopeful and brave.  It provided a thoughtful insight to a world I could never imagine on my own.  And, for me, that is why I am always looking for the next great book.  I sure hated to put this one down.
044654759X|5.0|Nicholas Sparks always come with new ideas for his novels despite almost all of them having similar settings, which just bring the effect of reality and closeness to our daily lives and shared it back among people. Safe Haven is not just your regular romance story, it's about courage and how someone can manage to get up and leave behind the bitter past. It's about trust and having a good friendship. It's about caring and feeling on how being taken cared of.   Beware: You might not want to leave the book before you finish it! Kudos Mr. Sparks

0316077054|1.0|i rather liked beautiful creatures of when the main characters were first introduced. It wasn't that great in my opinion but had potential to be a good series. But then THIS came out and made me go whaaat? Lena's personality completely did a 180. i mean yes she lost her uncle who was like a dad but come on she was acting completely like a brat and another b word that i wont type out. Ethan seems to be rather useless most of the time with no power to do anything to stop Lena's turning to the dark side. Liv was the only character i liked and i pretty much wished she was the female lead by the time i got to half of the story.About 3/4 of the book i couldn't take it anymore and ended up just returning the book to Borders. The story moved much too slowly to make up for the horrible characterization and it was just too painful to read any further. i don't know if it gets any better towards the end but i am seriously contemplating whether or not i want to read the next book.

B00004W510|5.0|Music from Big Pink came out. With that single recording, all the other music I was listening to seemed somehow diminished, trivial, less important. Then Big Pink was succeeded and eclipsed by \\"the Brown Album\\". How was that possible? One of the greatest rock albums ever made. Not one, not two, but three soulful and powerful singers, and when those voices melded, the results were heavenly.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|My 12-year old son has ADHD and when he first saw the cover of \\"The Maze Runner\\" at the store he was skeptical about reading it. I told him it was required reading for the summer (it actually was), so we bought it. It turns out that \\"The Maze Runner\\" is now his FAVORITE book. The story draws you in by the second chapter and he just couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.   Apparently, the mind wipe that the main characters had been given causes the curse words to be wiped from their minds too. My son found it funny when he came across the made up words the boys had replaced the curse words with. No, there is no actual cursing in the book.   \\"The Maze Runner\\" is an entertaining, suspenseful story; perfect for preteens, young adults and up. I liked it too, but it does have some death scenes at the hands of creepy weapon-bearing blobs.   My son is a slow reader, generally uninterested in reading, but he can't wait to read the next book, \\"The Scorch Trials\\".

0385474547|5.0|This is a very engrossing read giving an account of life in a small Nigerian village in the late 19th century. Okonkwo works hard to become a successful and prestigioun man in his community but the arrival of the white missionaries utimately destroys the existing fabric of society. I have long considered that Colonialism wrecked more havoc on civilisation than it purportedly professed to establish. This is my first book by Achebe and this sensitive and very balanced account was a very rewarding read.

B003JLA4KS|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since permanent waves when I was in elementary school. I have never stopped listening to this band for my entire life. I have seen them live multiple times and over time, my appreciation and love for Rush's music has only grown. I can not imagine the world without the power trio. From their humble beginnings to their humbleness today, they remain the same. Musically, the progression of Rush over time is mind boggling. For me, they are the most consistent musicians since Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. With the 19th album in the works, I can not imagine the USA without Rush on tour delighting fans every where. This video tells their story exactly they way the boys wanted it to be told. 5/5. Perfection! No Rush fan should miss owning this gift for fans from the trio....

Be warned though, after you finish the main battle portion of the book, you will definately need to take a break, catch your breath and have a drink!
B0025KVLTC|3.0|Great album, but not so great a remaster.  This 2009 remaster is better than the very poor one for Rubber Soul, but still very disappointing compared to what was on vinyl.
B003TML0VO|2.0|There's nothing inspiring in this collection.  I liked the coice of songs, but Santana didn't bring anything new to them.  Sounds like he just phoned it in.
B0025KVLT2|2.0|Obviously Rubber Soul is an extremely good album.  Unfortunately, this 2009 remastering is not.  The remastering took all of the soul out of it.  This is not even close to the original LP in terms of sound quality.  A lot of the sound that was there on vinyl is absent, as if they took an eight track recording and cut it to two tracks.  A disappointment.
0547258305|4.0|I loved this book- it is easily my favorite book in a long time. Honestly, words cannot express how I feel about this book. The characters are everything they should be; dynamic, original and extremely fun to follow. The stor begins with Katsa; who due to her Grace, is an extreme fighter - probably the best in all of the seven kingdoms. Her Uncle, a King, makes her do his bidding and therefore she is extremely feared throughout the kingdom. But Katsa doesn't want to be just a thug, so she begins the Council; a secret organization that helps people in need. When the book opens up Katsa is in the middle of one of the Council's missions to save an old Lienid man who has been kidnapped. This is where she meets the other main character, Prince Po, and the story takes off.<br /><br />Katsa is everything a heroine should be - she is a fierce warrior, has a kind heart and feels guilt. She develops so much throughout the story, she evolves into a woman in more ways than one over the course of the book. She starts out immensely lonely, with only a few friends. Most people are afraid of her Grace and cannot get past it. This creates a lot of sympathy for her character. I always find it amazing when I find myself reading a book about someone who does horrid things, and I am completely taken to the character. It is a sign of a terrific author when that happens; when I feel fiercely loyal to a character who begins the story as basically an assassin.<br /><br />I found the plot and pacing to be phenomenal. The book grabs hold of you in the first few pages and doesn't let up until the end. Katsa's story is a whirlwind of adventure, romance, loyalty and bravery. You cross forests, mountains and seas with her and encounter plenty of surprises along the way. The story is never short on plot twists, but they aren't those aggravating ones that I hate. I cannot exactly explain what I mean - but the plot twists fit in the story, they aren't outlandish and out of place. Do you know what I mean? Nothing is more irritating to me then something coming out of left-field that does not fit with the story or characters.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read the next book in the trilogy Fire, when I was halfway through with Graceling, I put Fire on hold at the library. I am desperate to know what happens to Katsa and Prince Po. If you haven't read this book, please go pick up a copy of Graceling. I was hesitant at first, because I was afraid of being let down. But I wasn't; I loved it more than I thought possible.mean?

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Someone once said if you sell the premise you sell the story. She didn't sell me the premise. It was too implausible. Tightly crafted and all, but too unrealistic, wo enough supporting reasons for why the world has degraded into the state it has.   For the absolute best in this genre -- future shock dystopia -- read Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I sat through 60 minutes of this before saying enough is enough. I think this movie was contrived to milk gullible people. And it wasn't even interesting. I live in a garden style apartment, and between the noisy neighbors and the metalic sounds from my heating system - I get more scares in a day then this movie produced. Please - stop fooling people. Demons and Satan are real - Jesus said so. But stop this amateur nonsense. /s/ Steve @ BibleProbe.com
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I bought this because of the single teutonic terror and im glad i did. This very well may be the record of the year. Everything that i love about metal is on blood of the nations. And it is pulled off in a almost flawless fashion. The riffs,solos and leads are fantastic always engaging and captivating. The singer who replaces udo pulled it off without a hitch the vocals fit the music perfectley and i find them to be better than udo's ever were. And andy sneap did a tremendous job giving the cd a killer sound balancing the instruments perfectly. This record is pure 80's in the best way possible. And any metalhead will definitley be missing out if they don't get this cd.
B00005K3O0|1.0|I can't believe this movie is rated 3.5 stars overall.  I almost never leave reviews, but I am writing this in hopes of helping drag the overall rating down where it belongs.  Just about the only people who could like this movie are those who liked it when it first came out in the 70s.  There were some great movies in the 70s of this type. The Exorcist was such a movie.  This garbage was not.

0670034711|5.0|I think that this book really speaks to you when you're in a certain place in your life.  And I was in that place when I read it.  No, I wasn't breaking off a relationship, but I was searching for some peace and yes, for some love - but more love of myself than love from anyone else.<br /><br />If you've read my blog for the last couple of years, you know that while I have found great love in my romantic life, I lost pieces of myself through my lack of employment.  You know those commercials about how when you quite smoking, you forget how to do the things you used to do while smoking?  It's like that for me without a job.  I lost my routine, a portion of my social life, and all of my professional life.<br /><br />Gilbert travels through Italy to \\"eat,\\" to feed her soul.  She learns to slow down and enjoy tastes and textures and moments.  I, too, learned that through my newfound love for Yoga.  It has really taught me to live in the moment, to take the time to imprint moments on my mind.  No more rushing through life, just wanting to be done.  Done with life?  We spend our entire work weeks wanting to get to Friday.  We live for 2 out of every 7 days.  Does that make sense in any way?<br /><br />Though I may not agree with their governments or their socialized medicine, I would say that Europeans are MUCH better off than North Americans in that they know that there is more to life than work.  I think that this is what Gilbert learned in Italy.<br /><br />In India, she learns to pray.  She learns meditation and that incredible difficult state of just being still.  Try it  See if you can sit still, no TV, no computer, no kids, no spouse, nothing for even just 5 minutes.  Difficult, isn't it?  Your mind starts telling you what you should be doing, what you are behind on, why you don't measure up and how you're wasting time when you could be DOING something.  But again, you miss the point of life if you just rush through it.<br /><br />\\"But you must stop looking at the world through your head.  You must look through your heart, instead.  That way, you will know God.\\"<br /><br />In Bali, she learns to love.  And when I say that, I mean, really what it means to love in real life, not in the fake life that Hollywood movies and novels portray.

And that you need to love someone for whom they are today, not who you hope they turn out to be.<br /><br />\\"I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men.

B000024JEX|4.0|I'm a fan of this box set and have listened to it many times over the years but there are a few things that annoy me about it enough to knock off one star.    Gary Peacock's bass is sunk too low in the mix and somewhat difficult to hear.  Jarrett's piano is, of course, recorded perfectly and well voiced in the recording.  Peacock's bass by contrast is a bit thin and reedy and I'm always straining to hear it.  This seriously detracts from hearing the interplay of the band as it should be heard.  Apparently Jarrett's ego was well represented during the mixing and mastering of this recording so the bass was mixed low to keep the piano dominant at all times.    Two other annoying characteristics that are common on most Jarrett recordings are present on this one.  Several minutes are devoted to nothing more than the sound of the audience applauding.  I don't buy music to listen to the sound of people clapping; I buy music to listen to music.  It makes me wonder if Jarrett is so insecure that he feels he has to include gratuitous applause to remind the home listener to maintain a state of sufficient appreciation.  Also, there's the well documented grunting and squeaking from Jarrett.  It's actually not too bad on this recording but it is there.    All that said, this is still great music by one of the best jazz combos in the world.  There's far more to appreciate here than there is to complain about and this Blue Note compilation is a must for fans of the Jarrett trio.

B003S9W8EQ|4.0|Pillars of the Earth was fantastic. Quite honestly - 1000 pages later - there was nothing left over to demand a sequel.  But here we are with an equally massive follow up.<br /><br />World Without End is just as good. Any criticisms have to do with beating the same horse twice. If you've never read the first novel -which isn't necessary to enjoy the sequel - then none of my criticisms apply. It will be fresh and unique for you.<br /><br />The town of Kingsbridge is a bustling city about to undergo the Black Death. Instead of building of a Cathedral its characters revolve around the plague. The same themes from Pillars are trotted out - the cruelty of Medieval society, the oppression of women, the abuses of priests and lords - with new characters and twists this time around.<br /><br />More of the same.<br /><br />While I understand that historical fiction isn't accurate it's hard not to roll your eyes throughout World Without End. One female character becomes the lightning rod of feminism: freeing herself of the burdens of marriage, overthrowing bishops and mayors, and eventually running Kingsbridge herself. Indeed all the protagonist characters have 21st Century intellect while the antagonists are stuck with a 14th Century mind set. It's not a fair fight. Follett goes so far to infer that one of the characters is the first to receive the honorary \\"key to the city.\\"<br /><br />Amazingly, all the characters that matter are smart enough to figure out how to avoid the plague. Sigh. It's just not believable.<br /><br />World Without End is also extremely sexual. Rape, after rape, feel after feel, sex act after sex act, it gets tiring and slutty. Follett also spends 100 pages worth reminding you of things that already occurred - as if too stupid to remember.<br /><br />If you can brush aside these things then World Without End is a satisfying read. However, I'm of the belief that the author should have just left Kingsbridge alone.<br /><br />Rating (Gouge my eyes out, below average, average, above average, more please)<br /><br />Average<br /><br />Liked: thoroughly entertaining, holds interest throughout 1000 pages, details of the Black Death<br /><br />Disliked: lewd sex acts every other chapter, repetitive themes, not believableerage     Liked: thoroughly entertaining, holds interest throughout 1000 pages, details of the Black Death     Disliked: lewd sex acts every other chapter, repetitive themes, not believable
0316098337|2.0|I was able to get past the 5 year old narrator/language issue - that wasn't the reason I disliked the book. The first half of the book was absolutely captivating, but...****SPOILER ALERTS***** ...after their escape from the Room, the story just fell apart. What was the purpose of the suicide attempt? And the roles of the characters in the second act? The maternal grandfather just comes and goes after stating something to the effect that he \\"can't deal with this\\". The maternal grandmother is bizarre and one-dimensional; the \\"step\\" grandfather has a little more character to him but that's about it. The ending was simply anti-climatic.
B00006I53S|3.0|Bought this used, so there was a somewhat surprising amount of dust trapped within. Second time using this lens I got an 'error o'1' message, had to remove the lens and swith it out and missed a touchdown play (I do high school football photography) Put the lens back in and it worked ok, but now I don't trust it. First time shooting with a used lens; I think I will save up for new lenses going forward. I also use a Canon 100mm prime f2.0 lens for night games and while it doesn't get strong close-ups, it does a great job if I stay near the action on the sidelines.

B0009FTXGI|4.0|This hood is not the same quality as an original Canon, but hey, at this price how can I complain. It lacks the inner mat fabric coating and does not have the same smooth feel as an original Canon when installing or removing it. That said, it does the job, it's not ugly, and it's pretty darn cheap. Unless you must have Canon, this will perform as advertised, although it remains to be seen whether or not it will last as long as an original Canon version.
1439163146|1.0|Three things quickly become evident when reading James Franco's short story collection 'Palo Alto' (2010). First, that Mr. Franco has attended a number of creative writing classes. Next, that Franco writes well on a line-by-line basis; lastly, that 'Palo Alto' would have absolutely no chance of being published were Franco not a talented, world-famous actor, a spokesmodel, a sex symbol, and a celebrity.<br /><br />The essential problem with the 'Palo Alto' stories is that Franco really has nothing to say; in terms of plot, he has only one, which all the stories are a variation of: a mentally-sluggish and emotionally stunted young person has a violent encounter, and then drifts on with his or her life.<br /><br />Even the most prototypical of these stories, which may be the opener, 'Halloween,' is not interesting or engaging on any level. On Halloween night, a young man on his way to confront his girlfriend, who he believes is becoming involved with other young men, hits a woman with his car, but drives away. Ten years on, he remembers the accident whenever passing the location where the hit-and-run occurred, but later still, thinks of it only as an afterthought.<br /><br />On the page, Franco's voice resembles a confident combination of early John Updike and middle-period Raymond Carver, while the bitter, sardonic ghost of Bret Easton Ellis hovers just out of sight.<br /><br />When and if Franco has something substantial to say, he may become a writer of considerable talent. At present, however, 'Palo Alto' serves as a limited window into Franco's mind and little more. As such, many of his fans will want to read the book, but as fiction of weight and merit, the volume fails completely.<br /><br />In light of Franco's recent extremely high media profile, readers who dislike the book shouldn't rule out the possibility that Franco knows 'Palo Alto' is poor and has pressed to have the book published for inscrutable reasons of his own; it may be that Franco has viewed the book's entire publishing cycle as a test of his personal power or merely as 'performance art' of a different variety.a test of his personal power or merely as 'performance art' of a different variety.
1401324029|5.0|Jameson Rook, the famous magazine journalist, is found on the scene of Nikki Heat's murder victim - gossip columnist, Cassidy Towne. Rook has been shadowing Towne for his next article.<br /><br />Nikki isn't thrilled with their reunion. She's still getting grief from the magazine article he published about her. Plus her team isn't happy with him either. Still, she must work with him to uncover the murderer.<br /><br />In a case this big, there's too many celebrities with a grudge against Cassidy Town. She broke many stories, dug up dirt, and slung mud. It's almost impossible to find someone who didn't want her quiet - permanently.<br /><br />Heat and Rook wade through the suspects ranging from a member of the mob, a pro baseball player, a sketchy politician, and a singer. Rook has the inside track on Town: she was writing a tell all memoir about someone famous. She refused to divulge that information, but she dug up something juicy.<br /><br />I love the combo of the books and the TV show. I like how the books differ from the show, yet I can still picture the characters from the show while reading. It's sort of like a tell-all fictional book - very fun.
B000ERU6EE|5.0|i am very pleased with everything about this.  not only was the shipping fast.  but my package showed up in perfect condition.  the sound of this record is great. very dark and ominous.   this band is fantastic.  i encourage you to check out their album \\"deathcrush\\"
B0041OOJNU|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. I love all the songs especially Rabiosa, Loco, and Addicted to You. This is definitely one of Shakira's best albums. I liked her last album, She Wolf, but there were a couple of songs I just couldn't get into. But with this album, it's a 9.5 out 10. Eat song will have you dancing and jumping with pleasure. I really like the album and am very pleased. I prefer it when she sings in Spanish. Great album! Again, a solid 9.5 out of 10.
0553805371|1.0|What you get in this nicely packaged book is just a brief history of physics, from special relativity to M-theory, reasonably dumbed down for lay audiences. All of this has been said before at least equally well, and the pretentious title is nothing but a marketing ploy. Save your money for something else.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|Okay, I bought a BK-2 to go along with my BK-7, and BK-9 and the rest of the knives in my collection. I've tried it out doing several things and I think this knife is about as tough, thick, and strong as a knife gets. It should fit the needs of the military, police, firemen, and rescue squads. If somebody wants to take one camping I don't see an issue. You sure aren't going to break it. The one I have has a tiny teat or bump on the base for breaking tempered glass. The sheath is secure even though the strap around the handle is hard to fasten.    It is best to add that I think the BK-7 would be a better choice for the military. The BK-7 is a little wider and stronger than the older USMC knife design. The blade is the same length as the USMC knife and due to the extra thick blank it is made from the BK-2 is just as heavy as the BK-7 if not more so.     The BK2 is not designed as a fighting knife at all. Way to much mass in a blade that size. I have a ~13 inch bladed roundel dagger that doesn't weigh this much but then it was designed for killing back in the old days before guns became king and it is about perfect for what it was made for. Lay that blade out beside a BK2 and you can figure out which blade was made for combat in an eye blink.     The nicest thing I can think of to say about the BK-2 for pure civilian use is that it butchered a chicken like it was made for the job. On the other hand you can use it in the kitchen on your veggies but you will notice you are having to push harder. Need to whittle a point on a stick? The same problem. It can chop through soft living wood but when I chopped on a old half rotted hunk of box elder I quickly realized that slamming the section of limb against another tree trunk was going to be a much faster and easier way to convert it into smaller pieces.      The BK-2 weighs as much as a cold steel trail hawk, a light weight hawk meant for camping and such, but it sure doesn't chop like one nor does it have a hammer side and you are going to get a heck of lot more leverage tearing things apart using the hawk. Throw in a light fixed blade like a Dadley or even a good jack knife and I'm much better equipped to deal with life than I would be hauling around the crowbar/butcher knife.      The BK-2 goes into the collection. For me it is not a user.  I have more _effective_ options. Everybody else should suit themselves. It's your money and if you decide to use this item as a survival knife it's your life. Even if the worst happens I'm confident the knife will survive even if you don't. ?8^)
0553805371|5.0|The Grand Design is both a very approachable and a very deep book for the laymen - depending on your interest level, it could both serve as a great overview, and a great launching point for more reading and investigation. Hawking and Mladinow take the reader through the history of last 400 or so years of theoretical physics, helping us understand the significance and the impact of the more recent quantum physics research and theories: gravity, relativity, space-time, multiple histories, and so on. In the process, they tackle a number of existential questions (\\"Why are we here?\\", \\"How were we created?\\", ...) and propose a remarkably complete set of answers and theories to answer each one - whether they are correct or not, we don't know, but it is nonetheless the best, and most consistent overview I've read to date.
1441866868|3.0|This is a review of the audiobook version of the The Wind Up Girl.  I'll quickly say that I enjoyed the story, its a good piece of futuristic steam-punk(ish) sci fi with great characters and an engrossing setting.      The audiobook was a bit of a let down, Jonathan Davis reads and I overall I like his voice but this part requires lots of young female asians and I found his performance highly distracting at times.  I also felt very uncomfortable during some of the more graphic sexual scenes as Davis has the a very grandfatherly type of voice.  Finally, he reads too slow.  I would of preferred about 10-15% faster reading of this considering its 16 full CD's long.  I'm not really sure what the audiobook industry standard is but I feel Davis is slow and it just took to long to get through a book I would of read normally in half the time.
0446672653|5.0|No matter what romance book you've ever read nothing will compare to this True story of Soulmates that cross oceans of time to be together again. I have bought this book and continuosly given it away.. because something this good should Never sit collecting dust on a shelf. What's written in this book gives Meaning to Life.

B003E48AYC|2.0|I expected a little more from Tim Burton. Great visuals, but a not so fun plot.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This is one of the most exciting films. It was gripping all the way through. No dull spots or slow spots. I did not like the ending and wish it had been ended more happily.  A great film.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I bought this to watch with my kids.  We all love this.  The set contains all episodes plus the two movies.  Though the movies are on the last disk, so technically they are not in order.  My kids like to count at the end of each episode how many new costumes are on the people.  If you have watched this on MTV in the past you know what you are getting.  If not, this is a show about a teenage girl with a popular younger sister.  She is smart and sees most of the world around her as inane.  This doesn't have the original music, but instead has filler music in it's place.  It would have been great for that, but it is good enough.  Case is sturdy enough, came well packaged.  I enjoyed my purchase.
B000002UC5|5.0|i hold a special spot in my heart for 'mccartney'. i remember going to buy it at specs music when i was a beatles crazy pre teen back in the mid eighties (it was the vinyl columbia records reissue)standout tracks for me would be: that would be something (with paul showcasing his beatboxing skills), ooh you, momma miss america, teddy boy, every night. he played all the instruments on the record and to it's detractors, 'mccartney' sounds rough and unfinished. my theory is mccartney went for this d.i.y/low fi sound to sort of deconstruct the whole beatle myth. there's a lot of albums by other artists that appear to have been influenced by the sound of 'mccartney (ie early albums by beck, beastie boys check your head and a helluva lot of indie artists out there) i have a huge music collection this is one of those albums that i revisit with frequency. to be listened to with an open mind and leave any preconceived notions at bay.
0553386816|4.0|Short story collections are a lot like good buffets that offer up a wide variety of flavors to sample. Piled on the plate some are more savory than others but hey, that's the value of sampling.<br />  With the Ford County Stories John Grisham sets the proverbial table with some interesting fair. In its 356 pages you'll find seven stories, some tastier than others but all well crafted and seasoned. The first story BLOOD DRIVE wasn't my favorite on my daily commute but Grishman soon won me over with the others than followed. MICHAEL'S ROOM was a very good look at the trouble with some lawyers while FISH FILES said something more of the profession. CASINO, QUIET HAVEN, and FUNNY BOY followed and once done I felt Grisham had done a good job.<br />  For a $7.99 cover price; a price less lower than the cost of a movie ticket, Grisham provided some good entertainment for my morning commute which earns him four stars.

0316017922|5.0|Outliers-The Story of Success. I really enjoy the writings of Malcolm Gladwell. I read this book for the 2nd time, this year and wanted to share it.      So can you really just make it on your own? Malcolm says no!    In Outliers Malcolm goes about and stated that people don't just make it on their own but every single one is reliant upon others. This goes back to to how we are all so dependent upon our groupthink culture and how we are all so interrelated.    The Matthew Effect    So being from Canada I like hockey and the Great One-Wayne Gretzky. Its interesting how he states in the book that the majority of players in the NHL are born earlier in the year due to peewee league age cut off dates. Don't believe me look at page 20. Huh, so when was Wayne Gretzky born-Jan 26, 1961. Gordie Howe-Mar 31, 1928. Bobby Orr-Mar 20, 1948. Interesting and then check out Czech soccer player on page 27 and it starts to make sense. Birth dates do make sense.    The 10,000 Hour Rule    Do you remember Jan 15, 2009? Maybe not, but you you might know the Miracle on the Hudson.    You see no average pilot could have landed that plane safely. Why would I say that? You see Mr Gladwell states in the book that there seems to be a rule that sets the average man apart from the experts, the 10,000 Hour Rule. you see the Beatles got their first gig in Hamburg Germany at a strip club. They said that they played here day and night and before they made their big break for America and playing on the Ed Sullivan Show was appox 7 yrs.  and this is of playing almost everyday of their early lives. Bill Gates spent the majority of his early years messing around on computer. He was beginning to write code since he was 13.    All we ever hear about with these people of influence is what they accomplished with their talents, but we never hear about their time spent in development. You see those years are what equate to the 10,000 Hour Rule. This is roughly 10 yrs.    So why did I mention the Miracle on the Hudson? You see Capt \\"Sulley\\" Sullenberger was calm, collected and knew what he was doing, why? He had over 25,000 hours of flight.    The Trouble with Geniuses    He also mentions that a person is only so smart to a certain point to where there seems to be the law of diminishing returns on how smart they are. That point is around an IQ of 120, after that it doesn't matter how high you score. He gave the example of the genius of Chris Lanagan and his socially awkwardness and lack of people skills. He may have been a genius but he was no Oppenheimer. Robert Oppenheimer who helped build \\"The Bomb\\" was also a genius but had what was called practical intelligence. He tried to poison his teacher and got off by talking his way out of it. How, well he was raised with intellects and around socially susceptible people, not like the farm boy Chris Lanagan was. You might be smart but your background and years of development do count.    Legacy    So does being from the South really make you want to fight more than being from the north? Culture of Honor. Does being a Korean Pilot make you more careless when it comes to flying a plane? When is it okay not to be polite when you are running out of fuel? How does the Geert Hofstede theory size up to other countries to one another? Does it make us weaker or stronger? Does the Asian way of counting numbers make them smarter at math because its quicker? Does working on Rice Paddies really give you a stronger work ethic? Can't you get that from just reading a book? Does the KIPP program really make inner city kids Ivy League contenders? How? And if Aunt Daisy didn't go to the Chinese shop keeper, Mr. Chance, to give her a loan to get off the island of Jamaica to go to school in England would Malcolm Gladwell have been given a chance to come to America and become the great writer that he is?    You see our lives are all full of these interesting questions, but the one thing that is certain that Gladwell makes is that we are not selfmade, but formed by our surrounding, our ancestry, and practiced trades. We are all dependent upon one another.
0451228731|3.0|If you like the matrix movies you'll probably like Daemon. That's not I.    The beginning of the book, and the blurbs, seem to indicate that this will be a book heavy on ideas. As one goes into the story, however, it becomes clear that the action will dominate. The hinted-at ideas concerning computers and society never materialize.    I've seen/read about too many superhero shoot-em-ups, explosions, car chases, spurting arteries, etc. etc. etc. more of the same. Unimpressed.    Wow, what a concept: malware programs getting loose on the Net, trashing financial records, shutting down power grids, turning criminals out of jail, destroying people's lives by messing up their personal records, etc. etc. etc. more of the same. Real original.    The only novel touch in this area is the way the Daemon recruits its human servants. Besides this (and perhaps not even that), we've seen it all before.    True, an action story is going to have all this, and yes, new and inventive ways of reworking cliche ideas can be fun to read. However, it's not these events themselves that make for a good story -- it's how the characters react and respond to these events. This story is sorely lacking any character development; it's just a Hollywood action extravaganza in print. All the action and ideas concerning the role of computers in society fail to serve to move the plot along or supply any insight. The plot goes nowhere, it's just entertainment.    Perhaps the only redeeming feature of the plot is the ending scene, wherein Sebek becomes one of the Daemon's minions. Notice that all the characters shown being recruited by the Daemon are coerced because they are in situations in which they are powerless to resist. Sebek is different: he's a cop in good standing and can only be coerced into service for the Daemon by first destroying him. This plot strand is the only coherent one I can find running throughout the book. So I guess it does have one shred of structure, after all. Otherwise, whatI said in the preceding paragraph is accurate.    The only thing I liked was Suarez's theme that our society is going down the toilet because the tiny minority of the plutocrats at the \\"top\\" are selling us all out for personal aggrandizement. The Daemon is Sobol's method of getting revenge and/or punishing these scum. Or perhaps even throwing them all out of business and righting our off-kilter modern capitalist society. (the story does not make clear which is Sobol's goal or motive) After all, as Ross tells Phillips, \\"the corporations ARE the government\\". This is right on the mark. Too bad Suarez doesn't do a good job of dramaticizing this perspective with a good story.    And for another thing, Suarez shows how the Daemon can destroy those elements of our wired society that it wishes to, but fails to show just what he intends to replace them with. It's easy enough to tear down the system, but foolish to do so unless one has something to substitute.    Come to think of it, it is kind of interesting that throughout the first part, the Daemon is perceived by the reader to be the villain, and that only near the end does that perception change when Sebek willingly goes over to Sobol's Daemon.    I have a problem with this assertion that all the technology presented in the book exists in the present-day real world. IT DOES NOT. The Daemon is a superintelligent AI program that behaves like a human villain. Show me a computer program, gaming or not, that can do all that the Daemon does in this story??? I won't hold my breath. In fact, Suarez himself says in several places (through Ross) that's it's just a computer program executing a logic tree. Come on! Not even a Matthew Sobol and his two helpers could have thought out in advance all the plot permutations that the Daemon flawlessly navigates.    And what about all this hardware used by the Daemon's army?? How could such a vast conspiracy be kept secret from the nation's (and the world's) intelligence services? No way!(and the lack of any involvement of the world's international community in this planetary conspiracy is another oversight of Suarez's)    Suarez's writing is clear and fast paced (perhaps too fast). It's not a bad novel at all (hence three stars), but it's not nearly so profound as the prestigious Mr. Cook proclaims, nor any of the other blurbs on the covers and title pages. I guess that I just demand a little more substance in a book-length work.    If this is all it takes to get published nowadays, it bodes well for my own budding writing career. Stay tuned.
1594481717|5.0|The book that has inspired me to pursue more of my Right Brain development is from Daniel Pink's, A Whole New Mind.      I read this book last month and it got me off of my butt and decided to develop my creative thought process. In this book he mentions how we have become this analytical or Abundance, Asia, and Automation society. Just as Peter Drucker says, \\"If it gets measured, it gets managed.\\" And if we can manage it we can systematize it and then scale it to where we can outsource it at a cheaper cost. This is the land of the left brained analytical thinkers.    So how do we stop this outsourcing of work, jobs, and information? We need to develop our right brain thought processes or high concept, high touch. He explains this process into 6 stages of development: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, Meaning.    Design    Look at the design of the Butterfly Election Ballot for the 2000 Bush v. Gore and tell me if it makes sense to you?      What if this was designed in a simpler, easier format? Our attentions spans are short, heck I'll be amazed if you've even read up until now, so we need to have simple easy to use functional items.    Story    Everyone loves a good story, that's why grandpa was always so great to be around because he always has such interesting stories. If you need a good template for story just look at mythologist Joseph Campbell and the Hero's Quest. This is the format used by cultures all over the world, don't believe me then look at The Lord of the rings, Chronicles of Narnia, Star Wars, The Matrix, even the stories of Buddha, Mohamed, and Jesus Christ.    Symphony    This word epitomizes everything it means. Think about when you here a song you like. It has a percussion for a beat, strings to keep in tune, a bass for those lower notes and thrown in there are some lyrics to compliment the beat. All these things come together and form a hit that we all bob our heads to. Same thing with life, if we are given lemons what do we do but makelemonade. In order to make lemonade you need to use all these different items and follow a recipe. So you need to go and make your own recipe.    Empathy    The ability to image yourself in someone else's shoes. Why is this important, because a machine can do that, and if it could we would all be useless. But this avoids automation because we can connect ourselves with those we associate with. Empathy is a crucial criteria because this will avoid any chance for automation and keep the whole aspect of relationships alive with one another.    Play    So playing video games will make you smart? When playing role playing games you are engaging your self in a role that in the future you may become familiar with and therefore know how to handle it. Games are a form of diversion and you can gain much in the relation of human interaction that a machine or computer can't. There was also these laughter clubs that came out of India that just exhumes joyfulness.      Think about it, what happens when you watch a funny show by yourself, do you laugh at every joke? What happens when you are around others that are laughing, do you join in too? Of Course you do. Joyfulness is a factor of play and we need to engage with those that are joyful.    Meaning    I think this word speaks for itself. We all need to have some sort of purpose or following in life, whether this be a spiritual purpose, a goal driven purpose, or just a change for the better purpose. We all need meaning in our lives and Viktor Frankl coined this phase well in his book, Man's Search for Meaning. Another great book that I will comment on at another time. We all need a purpose and we need time to spend in meditative thought to develop our minds and exercise our thoughts. We may have heard the old saying that an idle mind is a workshop for the devil. Meaning allows us to have a drive and ambition. What is your meaning in life?    Overall this book was a quick simple and humbling read. I see things that I need to develop on and change to evolve my right brain thinking process. I am glad I picked up this book and decided to read it, because it has helped to inspire and gotten me to develop my own site to let everyone who is willing to know that I as well am a man of meaning and purpose and I want to sow this to the world.
B003Y7L5W8|3.0|While I appreciate all of OMD's material, I have a deep and special fondness for their sparse, highly-textured and dark, pre-\\"Junk Culture\\" (1980-1983) songs. Only one track approaches that terrain on this release, \\"New Holy Ground\\". A few of the tracks sound too recycled as well, especially \\"Sister Marie Says\\", which sounds too much like \\"Enola Gay\\". If you're only into the pre-'83 material you would probably want to pass on this one. All other OMD fans will love it, I'm sure.
0765326353|5.0|Let me first state for the record that I am a HUGE Sanderson fan - the proof of this being that having read his books in paperback, I then rebought them all in hardback.  I had this book on pre-order for months and dove straight into it as soon as it arrived. Maybe this all set the bar far too high and I did not enjoy the first few chapters - particularly the assassins scenes - I ended not liking any of them later on either and skimmed through them. I loved the magic system in the Mistborn trilogy but in The Way of the Kings it just made me dizzy when I tried to visualize it. But due to my love of his other books I plowed on and luckily after the first 100 pages was gripped and continued reading at every opportunity. This is a long meaty book but with the exception of the above named scenes was interesting all the way through.  I liked all the main characters and it was often annoying to have to leave them to move onto another character but this is the strength of good writing that you really want to know what happens next.
B00204AA0O|4.0|I love all of Regina's pieces. I have grown very fond of this one as well. Mostly because this is the first album of hers that i own. The only problem I have is that i bought the edition without the bonus songs, which I very much like. Nevertheless, I wil recommend this album to any Regina fan. It is full of upbeat and sometimes quiet songs. It is indeed full of variety as always and doesn't fail to please the heart.
1401323952|5.0|I am one of those cookbook collectors who, like another reviewer, is a bit obsessed and running out of shelf space...now more than ever a cookbook must earn its keep to stay--and this one qualifies. It also happens to be my first Nigella book, altho' I bought her Christmas book last year for someone as a gift. I am so glad I bought this cookbook to call my own.  It is awesome. The size alone is massive, probably the thickest cookbook I own. Not only is it impressive in size but in the contents and useful information as well. Other reviewers have already mentioned the highlights, many of which I also would have listed--so I will just say, \\"ditto\\" on all counts from me too!<br /><br />Her personality definitely shines thru the pages, so I don't know what another reviewer means when she says it doesn't...not so at all. There are so many passages of her 'talking' on the page to the reader, that I am making a mental note to go back and read it all when I have time, b/c the number of recipes are calling to me right now. But what I have read tells me I like her gutsy and authentic style.  For instance, I chuckled today while reading the recipe I made tonight, African Drumsticks; on the top of page where it gives the number of servings it will make, it says:  \\"Serves 4-8 (depending on age and appetite).\\"  Boy, do I know EXACTLY what THAT means.  Don't we all? Yet nobody ever says it, except Nigella! Let's get real...and Nigella is! They were tasty and fast & easy to make; and I'm a bit ashamed to admit, ten drumsticks fed LESS than four adults here! She also had a footnote that freezing the chicken in a ziplock with the marinade keeps for three months. I would never have thought to do that. What a great idea--not just for me on a busy weeknight, but for a way to bring food to someone who is sick or bereaved and can't cook for themselves. Just defrost and put in the oven--done.<br /><br />I sometimes see her cook a recipe or two from this book on Foodnetwork, and the only thing lacking in the book that she includes on the show is to give metric measurements when she bakes. I simply jot down the metric weight in my book to the corresponding recipe when she mentions it on the show. (Altho' I am a cook more than a baker, I so appreciate weighing metric on my digital scale when baking). I made her churros which are stupid easy and will keep a permanent place in my file.  Altho' I had another churro recipe I was happy with, I could not make it for my toddler granddaugher b/c of serious food allergies. Nigella's churros are free of dairy/eggs, so my granddaughter ate the churros w/much delight (and to my great pleasure as well as we could make them and eat them together). The Coconut-Cherry Banana Bread was moist, easy, and fast to make; and you can switch out bananas w/any other fruit puree; I switched out the cherries for cranberries.  Last night I made a Flourless Chocolate Cake to give to a friend who must eat gluten-free. It was fun and easy to make. I omitted the lime zest and instead added a teaspoon of instant coffee to batter which boosts the taste of chocolate. Saved myself the calories by eliminating the Margarita whipped cream on top.  It said to use one 9\\" springform, but I used many mini-springforms, so I could dole them out as little food gifts and still keep one for me! Easy to be flexible with her recipes. The pics are there to inspire, too. I will be back to report on further recipes as I have many more to go.<br />Update: I made her little chocolate cups that use an indented muffin pan. I had to use an egg substitute due to allergies, but it came out fine. My 6 yr old grandaughter loved the chocolate edible container underneath the scoop of ice cream we put into it. I wish I had more time to make more recipes!
B0014BEDBG|4.0|If you like pop music, and particularly Justin Timberlake, you'll likely enjoy watching this concert DVD.  The NYC venue is high energy, having the stage at the center of the auditorium gives an interesting feel, Timberlake's singing and dancing are decent, his dancers are good, and his band is excellent (especially the drummer, though I found the lead guitarist to be weak, and I play both instruments).<br /><br />At the same time, it's also evident that Timberlake isn't in the same league as people like Beyonce, Madonna, Prince, Janet Jackson, etc., so I consider this performance to be second tier, and there were certainly moments during this concert when I felt bored and wanted to hit fast forward.<br /><br />In short, definitely watch this DVD if you're a Timberlake fan, consider it if you like pop music in general, and skip it if you don't like pop music.
B004132I4S|4.0|Sufjan Stevens is a lonely guy. Whether or not he bares it with sparse strings or buries it in a sea of choral and orchestral melodies, his sense of isolation saturates his music.    Most would not think of Sufjan as a troubled soul; his bright, cheery music on \\"Illinois\\" painted him as more of a bandleader of an indie private school than any brooding artist. However, despite the innocuous tone, the lyrics dealt with unanswered prayer, sickness, serial killers, and the darkness that lurks within each of our hearts: in essence, using the guise of state trivia as a platform to discuss deeper issues.    \\"The Age of Adz\\" has no quirky disguise of levity.    Adz is an exploration into loneliness, insecurity, bitterness, and unabashed love. The opening track \\"Futile Devices\\" washes over the listener in melodious melancholy. It's simplicity is one platter on which the tone of the album is served; the next two (\\"Too Much\\" and the title track) betray an entirely different one. It resorts to the tactic used in \\"Illinois,\\" in which Sufjan nearly overwhelms a simple melody with a complex wall of precise instrumentation. I won't go over each track; they mostly utilize these two different platters, often in the same song: a sound of intimidating instrumental and choral bigness, and one of stripped down humility. The title track and final, 25 minute epic (which does keep one's interest) both begin with a bang that nearly covers Sufjan's vocal melody, but each end with only him and a banjo; the melody that once seemed translucent rings clearly with lyrics like \\"I'm sorry if I seem self-effacing, consumed by selfish thoughts. It's only that I still love you deeply. It's all the love I've got...\\"    However, Sufjan uses a much less organic sound than the friendly instruments in \\"Illinois,\\" trading swirling woodwinds for blaring tech effects. The sound is a colder, more cutting platform for his cold, cutting lyrics. Sufjan blurs and swiggles his voice in autotune during one movementof the epic. Yet, he uses it masterfully as a tool to express his lonely dehumanization. Thus, he knows exactly what he is doing: his experimentation is utterly precise.    Despite the initially cold techy sound, this album seemed to resonate deeply with me. I find it fascinating that Sufjan chose to be his most vulnerable on an album as grandiose as this. It was brilliant. \\"Age of Adz\\" affected me deeply. I highly recommend it.
037582913X|5.0|This simple book captures the essence of the fearful things the imagination can do in the presence of the unknown. It is a great metaphor for the journey inward. It is also SUPER fun to read to kids. You can play with the pages and act like they are really hard to turn or have the kids decide if we should listen to Grover's pleas or forge ahead. And bonus points with the kids if you can do a good Grover voice. I always get hoarse because the kids want to read it over and over. My favorite kids book!
B002T9H2LA|2.0|A movie like a glossy magazine , we should know that's only about gossip , but some out there take it for real .  I guess this movie was supposed to be a satire but at the same time somebody tried to take things seriously .  Like being a little bit pregnant . The dialogs in german language sounded like dutchmen are trying to speak german , really awful . I mean , if you're spending that much money on actors , at least you could try to keep things real .
0547258305|5.0|This book was a thoroughly enjoyable read. My favorite find since The Hunger Games trilogy. Excellent character development, and a wonderful mid-story twist. Suspense that kept me reading long past bedtime, too! The ending was good enough to leave me satisfied with the story, but also good enough to keep me hoping and wishing for a sequel! Parents be advised of some mature content in this book, making it more appropriate for older teens than young ones.
073937771X|3.0|First off, I love the series. Lisbeth Salander is a keeper. This last part of the trilogy was good, and not altogether disappointing, but it seems that Larsson (R.I.P.) got a bit lazy towards the end. Things came together a bit too easily and too conveniently. It sort of seemed like after building up the story over 500 pages (paperback version), he or his publisher felt that he needed to wrap up the story. Therefore, it seemed a bit rushed. That being said, it is such a pity that we will never hear from Lisbeth Salander again. I haven't seen any of the films yet, but I regret that they didn't cast Winona Ryder as Lisbeth.
0375836675|2.0|I enjoyed Zusack's other book, The Book Thief, even though it was a bit on the melancholy side (how could it not be, having been set during a war, right?) So since I read mostly Teen Fiction anyway, I thought I would try this new book. I was very disappointed. And to be quite honest, I did not even finish the book. The first few chapters felt flaky and unorganized to me. I tried to keep reading, hoping the pace would pick up, but then got to a scene where Zusack is unnecessarily graphic and goes into detail where eluding to such would have sufficed. Does he think his readers have no imagination? Must a violent portrait be painted in such a manner, especially in a book that is supposedly for Teens?? As a parent and as a teacher, I would never recommend this book for teens. I strongly encourage parents to read the book before allowing their children to do so.

0545123283|5.0|Maggie Stiefvater's Mercy Fall's series quickly became one of my favorites within the first few pages of Shiver. I was eagerly awaiting the release of Linger and I have to say that I never thought I could fall in love further with a book or books then I did after reading the second in this Trilogy.<br /><br />The lyrical majesty that Maggie created in Shiver flows right through to Linger making the characters richer, the woods fuller and the story even more magical. Sam and Grace are faced with obstacles big and small as they each try to figure out how they fit into their new lives. The emotion's of each character leap off the page which made me feel as if I was sitting in the golden woods right with them.<br /><br />In Linger we read from four different points of views - Sam, Grace, Isabel and new-comer Cole. Each of the four characters is going through something, growing with the changes that have happened over the fall and winter. Sam trying to find his place in his new life, Grace dealing an illness and inner turmoil, Isabel and her guilt and grief over her brother and new comer Cole and his... well Cole as a character is complex and has a lot going on, so I'll just leave it at that. I loved hearing more from Isabel. Her sharp and sometimes harsh wit more then fit against new comer Cole's cockyness. The moments between Sam and Grace are full, rich and often breathtaking.<br /><br />From beginning to end I just couldn't get enough, and boy, what an ending that was. I was in shock, I think I even gasped out loud as the events unfolded into an ending that I never saw coming.<br /><br />All in all Maggie knows just how to pull at a person's heart strings when it comes to the love and emotions of her characters. I have to admit that my heart was heavy throughout Linger for many reasons. I'm sure if you've read it you might know what I'm talking about. I just can't seem to say enough about how amazing this series. I am on pins and needles waiting for the last in the series - Forever which is out next summer. I can say without a doubt that the beauty in Linger is something that I'll continue to carry with me for a long time.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be asked to be part of the blog tour for Linger, which I was so excited about. In addition to the review, I'll also be posting a interview with Maggie and a contest for you chance to win a copy of Linger! So keep checking back today for more fun and to help us continue to celebrate the release of Linger!!<br /><br />For more info and reviews please visit my Book Review Blog here - [...]t summer.

0439023513|4.0|Warning! This review is written differently then all my other reviews. It does contain spoilers throughout, but you will get a warning once spoilers will begin.<br /><br />The third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy - Mockingjay has been one of the most anticipated books of fans of this much loved series. The first two books - The Hunger Games and Catching Fire - told a story rich in characters we all fell in love with and rooted for from beginning to end. With the release of Mockingjay readers were more then excited to find out the conclusion to this epic tale.<br /><br />Giving Mockingjay the 4 stars that I did was in fact a hard choice to make. Writing this review is tough. I thought giving myself a few days or longer might clear away the questions I had to make writing this easier, which needless to say didn't work out as planned. I usually don't write a review with spoilers, nor do I write reviews where I talk things out at such length, but it needed to be done and this time there's just no way around it. So, please know that from this point on I will be addressing key points that will give things away - so be warned there will be SOME spoilers laced throughout!<br /><br />****Spoiler Alert****<br /><br />First, I have to say that I read half of this book with my breath held and the other half with a kind of, the only way I can explain it was that I was lost. The characters felt so different from where we left them in Catching Fire that at times it was hard to recognize them from the previous two books.<br /><br />Katniss didn't seem like her normal fighting self. And I often wondered if that was because she questioned Coin and if she even wondered if things would be different with Coin as president. In the beginning of the book when they are trying to talk Katniss into being the Mockingjay there was a conversation with Coin that made me believe she felt she not only didn't have much of a choice in the matter but that she questioned just what Coin's true motives are behind everything. Is this why Katniss wasn't her normal fighting self? Was she just tired of running a race in a never ending up hill battle where she then believed no matter what she did the way of the world would never change? Or did she believe there was nothing she, just one teenage girl could really do to make positive changes in the world of Panem? Or was it the fact that she was pretty much injured throughout the whole book?<br /><br />The lack of Peeta was also hard and what little interaction these two had I enjoyed more so then I did with her and Gale. I found Gale to be more then lost within Mockingjay, and found how easily he went from the hunter, gather and provider to uncaring and cold soldier a bit too easily. I mean everything with the mountain and his answer to how to take it down was more then callous and shocking to say the least. However the flip side is, Panem is a rough place to live and was Gale finally pushed over the edge too? Still, either way you look at this, it just didn't feel like \\"Gale\\" to me. Sad but true.<br /><br />The ending was shocking. I felt it was rushed by many pages and left more holes in it then Swiss cheese. I mean, Gale is a HUGE character and to leave his story so open ended was wrong and extremely harsh. There was no closure with Gale - he's there one page and gone the next. I felt that Katniss's mother was selfish on so many levels. I understand all that her mother has gone through from before the beginning of book one, however Katniss has suffered through SO much for her whole family and all the people within Panem and her mother can't take a trip back to their home to make sure if her now only daughter is alright? That just didn't sit well with me and actually made me frustrated. I mean common! Look at all Katniss did and all she survived for the love of her family! And yes, I know Peeta and Haymitch had more of a hand in keeping Katniss alive then I'm giving credit here, however I'm really talking about how her relationship with her mother was within those last few pages of this book.<br /><br />These were the main aspects of the book that I didn't agree with or understand. However, I did give Mockingjay 4 stars and now that I worked through all the negativity and got that out of the way, I believe that in all reviews, the ending should focus on the good and that's just what I plan to do here.<br /><br />Peeta being tortured was a given, this wasn't a good thing, but... let me explain - anyone who reads Mockingjay will know its coming. However the degree to which this is done is not only epic but fit with the one character that I felt never changed - and that was Snow.<br /><br />Everything that was shocking to me in this whole series is what I found as part of the best of the best. Peeta being tortured and just how he was tortured was not only a key part in his story as mentioned above, it was so true to Snow that anything less then this just would have been far off course for this ruthless character. The struggles in Peeta because of just how he was tortured, and then within his relationship with Katniss - it opened up and showed a different side to the two. I might not have liked what I saw, but if you think back to their relationship throughout the whole trilogy this was just another uphill battle they are forced to climb to figure out what their relationship meant to each other.<br /><br />The story did give me many conclusions and endings to main and subplots. Where there might have been some holes, however there were answers and endings - both good and bad. The good surpassed the bad. The wedding between Finnick and Annie gave hope to everyone that was much needed throughout all of Panem. The little bits of strength that Katniss gains from Finnick were nuggets of gold within the pages of Mockingjay. Finnick, while suffering alone was able to rise above everything to be there for Katniss when she needed to be pulled up and out of the haze I often found her in.<br /><br />Collins writing was there shining through again in Mockingjay, and while I didn't agree with many parts of this conclusion, sometimes a clear happy ending just isn't in the cards and that alone is sometimes need and often is refreshing in books. In each of the three titles there had to be bad to get through to the good and it's the same with Mockingjay.<br /><br />I recently read something about how people are upset with the Epilogue and I can see where some would feel it was forced and some might find it a cop out. Yet I've read it a couple of times and I go back and forth on this one. Today I see how wonderful it is. For me, it shows that all Katniss struggled for wasn't lost. That in the end she won. Peeta won and that in the end they both found just want they needed in the world and each other. That nothing is perfect and everything isn't easy and sometimes you have to struggle to get to the good in life.<br /><br />All in all, Collins has written another book that many will be thinking and talking about for a long time to come. With the end of any much beloved trilogy or series there's always a chance people will be upset because of how things ended and without a doubt there might be people not pleased by various things in this book. There might be things I didn't agree with, nor understand; however, in the end, I do have to say that the good outweighed the bad. I'll be suggesting these books for a long time to come to other fellow readers and I'll look forward to rereading each of these books numerous times. I'm more then looking forward to seeing just what Collins writes next. Enjoy.<br /><br />For more info and reviews please visit my Book Review Blog here - [...]hose last few pages of this book.

0385738757|5.0|I thought it was outstanding. What a great follow-up to The Maze Runner.. The Scorch Trials picks up right where Maze Runner stops. Now this is the 2nd book in the trilogy and being so, it doesn't answer as many questions as it dose create new ones... with a bit of a \\"LOST\\" feel to it, it has the reader constantly searching to find the answers.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials continues, once again, from Thomas's perspective and you live the story through his eyes and emotions.. although Thomas himself changes and grows throughout this book from the boy he was in Maze Runner, to a much more mature and complex character, who makes some very important and grown up decisions.<br /><br />There are some new characters introduced and we do learn some more about WICKED, Patterns and Killzones, but not quite enough to really explain anything completely... Although, like Thomas, Teresa and the others, you will come up with some pretty strong guesses, as you move through the story.<br /><br />All in all, I loved it.. a fantastic, high energy and quick paced book where in, you really care what happens to Thomas and his friend. I'm looking forward to what Dashner reveals in the final book.. knowing to expect the unexpected, should be another great ride.
0316113506|5.0|Zumba, here I come!  I purchased this book hoping it would give me some support and motivation to work out.  I always seem to make it a low priority and I never make time to exercise.  I keep buying DVD's, but don't follow through for long.  This book really puts it out there, where you can't ignore  or rationalize the benefits and need for exercise.  It's very technical in places, giving biochemical details about how exercise affects your brain in very detailed descriptions, which works well for those geeks among us (including me).  You can bypass this, and get some very concrete, easy to understand information. The book relates the positive effects of exercise on high school students who take part in a before-school workout program, indicating that schools should return to a requirement for physical education, but in a program quite different from the traditional ones.  Each student would be evaluated on their improvement over their baseline measurements, instead of being made to feel inadequate against other more athletic students. I found the book very motivating and it has made exercise a number one priority for me.  I feel so much better emotionally and physically, and have so much more energy.
142311339X|5.0|Jason doesn't remember anything when he wakes up on a bus full of kids on a field trip to the Grand Canyon. He doesn't remember where he came from, how old he is, or even his last name. He doesn't remember why he's enrolled in Wilderness School \\"where kids are the animals.\\" He certainly doesn't remember that he's best friends with a kid named Leo and that the girl sitting next to him, Piper, is his girlfriend. And Piper is a girl you don't easily forget.    Piper is put off by the fact that her new boyfriend is suddenly distant. She's also troubled by a recurring nightmare that's plaguing her sleep. In her dreams, her father, the famous actor Tristan McLean, is being tortured and held prisoner by some sort of evil presence. She doesn't understand what it all means --- both her nightmare and Jason's change in behavior --- but she hopes it won't get any worse.     Leo has a knack for tinkering and fiddling with nuts, bolts and machines. He's always felt out of place in life, especially since his mother died in a tragic fire when he was younger. You could say that fire plays an important role in his life, but he's careful to control his amazing ability. He's finally found good friends in Piper and Jason, and he doesn't want to do anything to screw it up.     When you're a demigod, though, there are enough powers and forces to screw things up for you. Jason, Piper and Leo encounter their first monsters at the Grand Canyon, evil wind spirits, and have no idea what they're getting themselves into. After escaping a savage and death-defying attack, all three demigods inexplicably find themselves at Camp Half-Blood where the other campers are none too pleased to see them. Percy Jackson and the other demigods saved the world against the Titans, so everything should be great, right? Apparently not.    Jason, Piper and Leo learn about a prophecy that is much worse than the previous one foretold. This time, Hera, the giants and some mysterious female patron are involved, and it's only the beginning. They embark on a quest that will take them from the northernmost provinces to the familiar Bay area and back again. Olympus has shut itself off from the world, so the demigods are on their own this time. It also doesn't help that someone important has gone missing --- Percy Jackson!    Greek and Roman mythology is alive and well in this new series by Rick Riordan, author of the popular Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. Just when you thought the world was safe from ancient monsters, Riordan introduces fans of the books to even more stories from the ancient Greek mythology. This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail. New and familiar characters make appearances as well as the hilarious references to pop culture. I always learn something new whenever I read these books, and it certainly helps that I laugh along the way. You're not going to want to miss this one!       --- Reviewed by Benjamin Boche
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wonderful movie. I own an akita, so this movie meant so much to me. I would recommend it to anyone that is a dog lover.
031603438X|5.0|Yes, I thought the book was great. At the same time you have to figure out why you would read a 547 page book about a rock star? In this case you read it because you will be instantly enthralled at what it is like to be one of the world's foremost players in the music business. Let's face it, Keith Richards has probably lived the equivalent of several life times, none of which seems to have been in any way BORING.<br /><br />In the 1970's, the Federal government of the United States labeled the Rolling Stones, the most dangerous rock and roll band in the world. What follows in \\"Life\\" is one incredible story after another, year after year and decade after decade. For a self-confessed addictive substance guy, you have to be amazed that he could churn out this much biographical material about himself. I admit I am not objective. We live in the same town in Connecticut and Richards is a solid part of the community living what seems to be a very stable existence. Now having said that, this is what you are in store for, and it is some ride through the last 40 years:<br /><br />* The story of traveling through the South to gig after gig, while on the political enemies list of the United States is sensational. Keith knows that when you travel the South, you don't stray from the Interstate Highway system because the police forces in each town are out to get him. So what does he do? He strays that's what, and he's carrying in the car enough drugs and other substances to be classified as running a pharmacy. The story goes on for pages and pages and gets funnier and funnier. You will meet a judge who walks around with a bottle of booze in his sock, because he needs a hit every 30 minutes.<br /><br />* What do you say about a guy who says that for years he only slept twice a week? What are all the ramifications of a lifestyle like that? What a way to go while the rest of us are jumping on a commuter train picking up Chinese food at 7PM.<br /><br />* He tells you that everybody from his home town is a thief and then proceeds to go through the place person by person telling you why this is so. The book provides comic relief to anyone with an open mind, or even those who have lost theirs.<br /><br />* We all know how money rock stars make, but Richards tells you that by late 1964, they have never made a dime for themselves. Everybody else was making the money but not the band.<br /><br />* The author has no hesitation whatsoever about telling his perceptions about anybody and everybody in this business. He goes after Robert Stigwood the English promoter with a vengeance. The guy always owed the band money. Richards says Stigwood's modus operandi was to promise late payments, and then the late payments turned into not paying at all. If you want to understand the music business this is the book for you.<br /><br />* On page 180, he takes you through an incredible story about his new manager Allen Klein who tells the boys that Decca Records has been cheating them for years. Klein takes the band into Decca's offices and has them dress in black, wearing dark sunglasses. He informs the boys, telling them to say nothing, just look intimidating. The Chairman of Decca Records breaks down and renegotiates the biggest contract in recording history, bigger than the Beatles. You come through this story realizing that Richards is quite a businessman at heart. He recognized early on the necessity of entering into win-win contracts while everyone else was asleep at the switch.<br /><br />* Mick Jagger is all over this book. Depending upon what chapter you are reading, Jagger and Richards love one another, hate one another, and love one another again. By the end of the book they are back in love. You figure it out.<br /><br />Every page of this book has something fabulous to say and is interesting. There is no question that you are hearing Keith Richards' voice when you are reading this book and that is very important in a book like this. There were two incredible concepts that you can walk away from this book with. One of them is what all men dream about, when  Richards says you have no idea what it is like to have 3000 chicks in front of you that are ripping off their panties, and throwing them at you. You realize what awesome power you have unleashed.<br /><br />The other concept is something that is very perceptive. Keith Richards say you had to be with the right people when taking acid, otherwise beware. This is a brilliant book written by an incisive man who understands after all these years, who he is, what he is, and how he is. He has come to terms with himself, and is comfortable within his own skin. If you are a fan, you will love \\"Life\\". If you are not, maybe you will become one. Good luck and thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard Stoyeckom this book with.

031603438X|5.0|I found the most fascinating parts his discussions of his and his and Mick's songwriting processes.  It's a page turner, populated with so many interesting people, facts and opinions. E.g. \\"Don Everly is the greatest of rhythm guitar players.\\" He is a warmer, more down to earth guy than I had thought already.  Smart, interesting point of view.  Hope he restarts the X-Pensive Winos.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I am a mom of three boys (ages 5, 3, 1) and probably like many of you a lover of CLASSIC Disney.  As a young child, I was (and continue to be) in love with \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" \\"Robin Hood,\\" etc.  I think around \\"The Lion King,\\" I started tuning out...Anyway, nostalgia is a powerful thing and I want my kids to experience some GREAT animated films that I enjoyed.  I paid no attention to the hype around this film due to my disappointment in the recent flicks that Disney was putting out, but my aunt bought this DVD for my kids and I thought, \\"I might as well check it out once so it is not a TOTAL waste.\\"  Boy, am I glad I did!  This movie is FANTASTIC on every level--and what is truly amazing is the fact that all three of my roudy, polar opposite children, my husband and I can sit and watch this (and laugh out loud) TOGETHER!  I've read some of the criticisms as far as the Shadow Man and his Voodoo, stereotypes, etc, etc...I can honestly say as a very content conscious parent that I understand these concerns--but I did not find the \\"scary\\" scenes inappropriate and I did not notice any RACIAL steretyping (and this is coming from a black woman).  I found the story as a whole to be totally charming, exciting and surprisingly refreshing.  This is a definite classic in our home and I'm pretty sure that it will become one in yours as well!
0805091742|5.0|A couple weeks ago a friend raved about a book.  He explained that The Checklist Manifesto had insights to avoiding problems.  I borrowed the book from the library and was blown away by some of the ideas.  Now I'll buy the book and review it with my children.    Early in the book the author makes a fascinating point.  His analysis of the source of mistakes is that broadly there are two basic reasons why we make mistakes.  The first major reason for many errors is because we don't know enough.  If we have only an introductory education on how to drive a car or write software we can often make simple blunders that more experience will teach us to avoid.  The second major source of mistakes is we are careless.  This turns out to be a major source of faults when there is great complexity.      Atul Gawande is a doctor and much of this book is about the complexity of medicine.  Dr. Gawande explains that medicine has become the art of managing extreme complexity.  Currently there are over 13,000 different diseases, syndromes and types of injuries.  Imagine that!  Trying to stay on top of even a fraction is an almost impossible job.  At one clinic the average doctor had to deal with over 250 primary diseases and conditions in a year.    With the increase in complexity comes the greater chance for mistakes.  For example in the United States there are over 150,000 deaths each year for people who have gone through surgery.  Research indicates that over half of those were avoidable.  People die from mistakes!  In a typical day a person recovering from surgery may need 180 different specific actions.  If one of them is missed or done wrong the patient might die.    Dr. Gawande switches from medicine to airplanes.  In 1935 Boeing was demonstrating their new bomber the B-17 to the Army Air Corp.  The generally accepted belief was Boeing had it in the bag.  The plane could carry five times the as many bombs as the Army had requested.  It was designed to faster and farther than thecompetition.  Yet the plane crashed right after take off.  They had invested heavily in developing the B-17; the lost of the contract almost killed Boeing.  They launched a major investigation into the crash.  Why was there a crash?  They went over every piece of wreckage.  They came to a surprising conclusion.  While they had one of the best test pilots in the industry it appears that the B-17 was too complex to fly.  There were many, maybe too many, things to keep track of.  If the pilot missed one of them the plane might crash.  A key result of this investigation was the widely adopted use of the checklist.  Now before every flight a pilot reviews a checklist and airplane accidents are very infrequent.      The author breaks down problems from another approach.  He shows how there are three types of problems.  The first type of problems is simple problems which can be solved by a recipe or formulae.  The second type of problems is more complex problems, but repeatable, like flying to the moon.  Fundamentally these complex problems can be reduced to a large set of simple problems; each is solvable with a well understood recipe.  The last type of problems is non repeatable complex problems, like raising a child.  The fundamental problem is the solution for one problem may not work for another similar problem.  Parents face this all the time, discipline and rewards work differently with each child.  Checklists don't solve all problems, but they help tell which problems are appropriate.    Much of this book is about a surgery process improvement team Dr. Gawande was contributing to, and how they decided to recommend the use of checklists with surgery.  They found that it was important to consider what goes on the checklist and what doesn't go on the checklist.  They drew heavily from the airplane industry.  For example you don't need to tell the surgeon to breath, he does that automatically.  The checklist shouldn't be too long, because people will tend to skip steps or toss it out completely.  The team noticed that few mistakes happened with a well functioning surgery team, but at most hospitals the teams were formed and reformed for almost every surgery.  It was hard to have each surgery team function as a cohesive team.  They tried to encourage this by including on the checklist a step where each team member would introduce themselves.  The result was the teams become more united and covered each other.  Nurses felt freer to point out to a surgeon when they skipped a step.  This single item lead to a huge decrease in the complications and deaths after surgery.    The book also explores how checklists get used effectively in other industries like building construction, and to some extent investing.      This is a fascinating book and well worth reading, probably worth reading twice.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|We started watching this 1/2way through season one and my wife & I are both hooked. Now I'm looking forward to seeing it from the beginning!    I'm fed up with TV being full of more gay characters than I've ever met in real life but the gay couple on this show are very entertaining and it adds to the quality instead of being a drag.    A lot of the humor really hits home for us as my wife has a latino accent although not nearly as thick as the Columbian trophy wife (Gloria) who's a big step up from \\"Peg\\" for the former MWC star Ed O'Neil.    Recently he was nagging her about a 3-6 month old soccer match still on the DVR and I laughed so hard because my wife won't delete (or ever watch) the 2009 Latino Grammy Awards tucked away with her other 40+ saved shows.     Phil tries to funny with his lame jokes and is kind of creepy as he reminds me of DEXTER, almost like he's an older brother always wearing nice pants with a collared shirt talking in that calm, toneless voice.    It almost seems like the writers get their material from stealing Marraige counseling files, a LOT of it is very funny but also realistic. Not absurd stuff that would never happen like in many other shows.    The show is targeted for adults but for the most part can be enjoyed by the whole family without too much eye/ear covering.    Check it out!
0385738757|4.0|In the beginning of this breathless, adventure-crammed tale, Thomas and the Gladers are \\"safe, rescued, and delivered\\" to a nice clean dorm, having lived through their escape from the Maze. As Thomas snuggles into his bunk bed, listening to the snores of his friends, he can also hear Teresa speak to him in his mind. Since she is the only girl in the group, their rescuers have sequestered her in a separate room. Speaking mind to mind, they discuss their fear that they will never lose the image of the terrible Grievers. But they haven't seen anything yet...    Thomas slips off to sleep and into a dream that seems to be a memory of an event that happened when he was a very small child. In the puzzling dream-memory, his mother cries as she tells her son that she doesn't know why he was chosen, but that he's special. The young dream-Thomas asks if she will become crazy, the way his father and other people have. As the dream ends, he again hears Teresa speaking in his mind: \\"Tom, something's wrong.\\"    That turns out to be quite the understatement. Thomas can't quite seem to wake up, even when he realizes that Teresa is screaming. Even as he sleeps on, he's aware that there are noises around him --- sounds like shrieks of pain, yelling and crashing. But those are nothing compared to his sudden realization that Teresa is gone. Even when he calls her in his mind, there's no response.    Thomas fully awakens...to a living nightmare. The other Gladers are running around pell-mell, staring aghast out the window and obviously terrified beyond belief. He sees a horrifying person standing outside his barred window. The stranger appears crazed --- covered with wounds, scars and burns --- and is begging Thomas to kill him. As if that isn't bad enough, Thomas and the others find an unbelievable sight when they leave their dorm rooms. In the large room hangs the dead bodies of their rescuers.    As horrendous as things are, Thomas knows he must find Teresa. He goes to the room she slept in, and outside a sign displays these words:    Teresa Agnes. Group A, Subject A1.    The Betrayer.    In the room, instead of Teresa, he finds a boy who introduces himself as Aris. He says he came from the Maze and then proceeds to tell Thomas an incredibly shocking story. Before long, Thomas, along with Aris and the other Gladers, head out on an urgent quest. To reach their goal, they must cross the blazing Scorch. Along the way, Thomas occasionally experiences more of his own lost memories in short-dreamed snatches. Unfortunately, this only makes him even more mystified at what they reveal and what they don't. He also encounters a most unexpected enemy, along with a bit of a romantic triangle, during the ensuing adventure.    This unrelentingly thrilling plot is the very definition of a page-turner (with yet another heart-stopping cliffhanger ending). Readers will wonder with Thomas about the true nature of WICKED, his previous life, The Flare, mysterious tattoos, female motivations, and much more. More anxiety for us readers: How on earth can this story wrap up? And when can we get our hands on the final book in the trilogy?     Meanwhile, attention all Hunger Games fans: There's a new game in town.       --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B0047SF41G|4.0|I watched this movie with some reservations, but after viewing, I believe it is, on many levels, the BEST of the franchise (however much or little that may be saying).  Several things stood out to me:    1.  The movie is very well-cast. Brody strikes me as having a similar screen presence to Lance Henriksen, and Topher Grace is perfect as a \\"wild card\\" (though not much of a surprise).  2.  There is an \\"economy\\" to the story set-up, with a limited number of predators involved.  This is the opposite of what the trailers suggested, and to my thinking far more effective.  Having a lot of them would simply take away the need for stealth and cunning characteristic of the creature.  3.  Even heavily criticized scenes are set up and paced well:  Laurence Fishburne's scenes, while somewhat disrupting the story, are effective in themselves, and can be appreciated as a possible \\"preview\\" of the fate of humans trapped in the predators' preserve.  4.  The film develops a theme of moral choices in extreme situations, and how decisions reflect or shape a person. The diverse fates of the characters present a possible cycle of victimhood and villainhood, similar to (and inventively building on) the original story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\".    David N.

1400064287|5.0|Heath brothers wrote an interesting book to read and the information they provide has a great value to readers, which specifically can help people with significant message to pass on to their target audience or readers. Since the first day I bought the book till the time I read it, I always wondered the meaning of the duct tape that is wrapped on the cover of the book. After I read it, I found out that it conveys a message that is simple, unexpected, concrete, credible & emotional story. I believe that the six elements of the book, SUCCES, are necessary key points for anybody who is willing to use them for effectiveness of their messages.   Speaking of the kidney heist story, Heath brothers discusses, \\"Good ideas often have a hard time succeeding in the world. Yet the ridiculous Kidney Heist tale keeps circulating, with no resources whatsoever to support it.\\" It was very creative example to discuss and combine the six elements with the story and come-up with an interesting fiction that makes you eager to find out the end of it. The bottom line is that it is not the usefulness of the information that attracts the listners, but it is the way we addressed it.  In response to the unexpectedness, the heaths mentioned, \\"To make a message stick, you have got to push it beyond common sense to uncommon sense.\\" you can get people's awareness by ignoring their point of view, and come up with an idea that can surprise them. For example, when President John F. Kennedy gave a speech to the congress about the satellite launch his statement was stickier because of the way he put it out. The speech was unexpected and call for full team participation to reach a common goal, which was to become the international leader in space. \\"Before the decade is out, achieving the goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.\\" Sounds like inviting the people of the United States for strategic innovation with in the time frame than to specific sectors.   Finally, the authors discuss the elements of why some ideas survive and others die. It helps us on how we should convey our message using some techniques to be effective rather than broadcast with out considering the attention of our audience.

B003WTE886|4.0|Ok, I kind of want to say right here and now that I LOVE nearly everything about Taylor Swift.  Her previous album, `Fearless', is one of my favorite records of the past decade.  Nearly every song is flawless and the album only grows stronger and stronger the more I listen to it.  The same things could `almost' be said about `Speak Now', and honestly I would be saying them all about this album had she never released `Fearless'.  Here's my one issue with Swift; she is so good at what she does that she doesn't do enough `other' things to differentiate her albums.<br /><br />`Speak Now' is basically `Fearless' with lyrics in a different order.<br /><br />I know that sounds like a grand slam complaint, but it really isn't.  Regardless of the obvious similarities, I've been listening to this album for over a week straight and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.<br /><br />It's that good.<br /><br />When Swift channels other influences the album pops for me.  When I hear her mourn the loss of love on `Last Kiss' I am reminded of the intimacy of Damien Rice, and that more than fills me with admiration.  When I hear her spunky beckoning of revenge served cold on `Better Than Revenge' I can see Paramore rubbing their newfound fame all over Swift.  Her rooted sound on `Mean' gives me a good old country chill (throw the pop aside, this is pure country fun).<br /><br />And then she goes and sings so convincingly about the loss of innocence on `Never Grow Up' and reduces this grown man to a lapful of tears (seriously, best song on the album for many reasons).<br /><br />Like I said, there really isn't anything to dislike here (except for that closing track, `Long Live', which sounds like a watered down version of `Change').  `Mine' is fun and totally pop-country-princess worthy.  When it comes on the radio, I don't turn it off.  `Sparks Fly' is sweet and enchanting like only Swift can do it.  `Enchanted' has a beautifully catchy chorus (and her vocals are stunning, especially the way it cracks when she says \\"meet you\\").<br /><br />Sure, `Speak Now' and `The Story of Us' are fun and reminiscent of the breed of pop-country that made Swift so popular, but they do sound like the filler on the album.<br /><br />Swift really ups her game when she shows vulnerability.  `Innocent' is beautifully touching (even if her age makes it a tad strange to take seriously) and `Dear John' shows the devastating effects of manipulation on a young girl's heart (you're a real charmer Mr. Mayer).  `Back to December' is really effective in that it shows Swift accepting blame for the demise of a relationship she regrets destroying.  It shows accountability that isn't seen a lot in the whole `pop-princess' genre.<br /><br />And then there is `Haunted', which is like AMAZING!!!  Why didn't she close this album with this song?  Sure, it has elements that recall `Change', but it certainly stands on its own.<br /><br />Like I said, I love Swift and this album is no exception.  If she had never released `Fearless' then this album would be a certified A+ for me.  In fact, I think overall I may like this album a tad more than I like `Fearless', but the fact that it sounds so similar is not something I can overlook in this review.<br /><br />BUY IT, LISTEN TO IT, LOVE IT...but you'll understand what I'm saying when you do.Sure, `Speak Now' and `The Story of Us' are fun and reminiscent of the breed of pop-country that made Swift so popular, but they do sound like the filler on the album.

0312370849|5.0|Sarah Starzynski, an exuberant 10-year-old girl who lives with her parents and younger brother Michel in Paris in the summer of 1942, could never have imagined what horrors her young eyes would see.    During the Nazi occupation of France, raids on Jewish homes were becoming commonplace. In the past, the fathers of these families would be taken away, but on July 16, 1942, a more drastic practice was instituted --- entire families were now to be arrested. French police pounded on the Starzynskis' door one morning. Fearing for her younger brother's safety, Sarah guides Michel to a secret cupboard where they often played and locks him in, reassuring him she would be back to free him when the policemen have left, and she carefully pockets the key. The family is shocked when they are all ordered to leave their apartment, but they still maintain a shred of hope that this will end soon. After all, it's the French police, not German soldiers. They wouldn't let anything happen to them, would they?    What Sarah didn't know at the time was that this particular day began the horrific Vel' d'Hiv' roundup, in which Jewish families were ripped from their homes and placed in an arena in the center of Paris, and later shipped off to concentration camps, some of which were located in France. (The code name for this barbaric ritual was, shockingly, \\"Operation Spring Breeze.\\") The stricken Starzynski family look on in horror as they and many of their neighbors and friends are herded into an overcrowded arena, then shipped to work camps outside of the city. Sarah is fearful for her family and especially young Michel left behind in the secret cupboard. Can she risk a daring escape and get back to Paris in time to save him?    Julia Jarmond is a forty-something American journalist living in France for the past 25 years. Although she adapted to life there quite well, marrying a successful Parisian businessman and raising her daughter as a proper French young lady, she is constantly reminded of her stature as the \\"L'Americaine,\\" especially by her husband's family. She and Bertrand recently inherited his grandparents' apartment and are beginning renovations with the anticipation of continuing their happy lives there.    Due to the upcoming 60th anniversary of that fateful roundup of Jewish families in occupied Paris, Julia is given the assignment of writing a piece for her magazine about Vel' d'Hiv', considered to be a black mark on French history. Over 8,000 Jews were arrested over the two-day period, and more than half that number were children. Julia had never heard of Vel' d'Hiv' and was equally shocked to discover that very few French people knew all the facts, or if they did, were reluctant to speak about it. \\"Nobody remembers the Vel' d'Hiv' children, you know. Nobody's interested,\\" she's told. But as she delves further into her research, she uncovers a startling connection to young Sarah's story and her own family.    Much like Irene Nemirovsky's SUITE FRANCAISE and Jenna Blum's THOSE WHO SAVE US, Tatiana de Rosnay's compelling novel creates a dual storyline set against the horrific events of the Holocaust. At times heartbreaking and horrifying, SARAH'S KEY is an unforgettable, gripping read concerning one of the darkest times in history. The reader is transfixed by both Sarah's story and modern-day Julia's, and how they come together will leave you breathlessly enthralled. You will be hard-pressed to walk away from this book unchanged.    First published in hardcover in 2007 and now available in paperback, SARAH'S KEY is a natural for book clubs, where it surely will spark lively and riveting discussions, with the most likely questions being \\"How did I not know about this?\\" and \\"Why wasn't I taught about this in school?\\" At once an enthralling and a revelatory read, this is a novel you won't soon forget as it stays with you long after you've set the book down.        --- Reviewed by Bronwyn Miller
B001OQCV6A|2.0|The biggest issue I have with `Sherlock Holmes' is that it tries to explain too much at the films climax that it comes off rather silly and pretentious and un-enjoyable.  Here's the deal; I totally understand that Sherlock Holmes is all about the little details, but when those details are so well shielded from everyone else that the conclusion makes the audience scratch their head in utter bafflement it loses all of its credibility.<br /><br />Seriously, they would have been better off sticking with the supernatural aspect of the film, no matter how `un-Holmeslike' it really was.<br /><br />To top everything off, the film is far more interested in showy displays of slick paced action than really building the mystery needed to keep this franchise alive (yes, franchise, since the script was obviously written with a sequel or two in mind).  The CGI sequences range from intriguingly crafted to messy and cheap looking.  The action also takes the audience out of the real story here, and when all is revealed it seems like an epic letdown.<br /><br />The acting is decent at best, with Jude Law once again proving to be the best thing about the movie he is in (this guy is rather brilliant).  Robert Downey Jr. is kind of messy here and uninteresting (how did he win that Globe????) and the usually mesmerizing McAdams is dreadful and Mark Strong is nothing more than a stereotype (this guy has a ton of promise, but he's been reduced to a sad afterthought for most his features).  The one glimmer of greatness was in Kelly Reilly, who is chucked to the wayside for big explosions, but her dinner scene with Watson and Holmes is stunning.<br /><br />I wish Richie were smart enough to use her more.<br /><br />I want to talk for a second about Guy Richie because I actually really like his directing style.  I think that the gritty humor he laces his films with is spectacular.  I actually think he should have been Oscar nominated in 1998 for his work on `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'; it was that good.  Sadly, `Sherlock Holmes' is almost too polished.  It loses the gritty realism that Richie brings to his action flicks.  It has his usual quick pace, but it is too crisp for its own good.<br /><br />The story is a tad messy and incoherent, but that could have been forgiven had the ridiculous `explanations' been reworked (I like the whole `I never saw that coming' aspect of films, but Holmes rambling at the end of this film sounded like he pulled it out of thin air, it was that preposterous).  It could have been so much better.<br /><br />I kind of hope the sequel never gets made.Sherlock Holmes' is almost too polished.  It loses the gritty realism that Richie brings to his action flicks.

0525951652|5.0|Answer: Nobody.  Fall of Giants is yet another in a long line of captivating reads from a novelist who, in my opinion, is one of the best in the game right now and has been for a long time.    Fall of Giants takes us from the beginnings of the first world war to its end and the rise of the Bolsheviks in revolutionary Russia. What Follett manages to do is create fictional characters during this time period and ties them into the myriad historical events.  Russian peasants, Welsh working class, British nobles, German aristocrats, American political hopefuls..Fall of Giants covers a broad base of backgrounds and class systems and shows how the war affected everyone involved.      Without interesting characters a book like Fall of Giants could have easily read like a dry history text but character driven stories are what Ken Follett does best.  I have yet to encounter another author who can weave colorful characters and addictive character drama into a historical backdrop like Follett does. He's done it time and time again.  From Pillars of the Earth to Hornet's Flight to World Without End and now Fall of Giants, Follett's resume of historical fiction and character driven stories just keeps expanding and maintains the high standard that he set for himself years ago.  Most of the characters are fictional, but interspersed with the real history that serves as the background of the story, each character's own personal story just rings true as if they were part of history and the things that transpired in the book COULD have happened.      At nearly 1000 pages it's a doorstop of a novel, but if you like it as much as I do you'll be wishing it were longer.  Count me in as one of the many fans eagerly awaiting the second and third installments! They can't come soon enough.

030726999X|5.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" satisfies as the last installment of Stieg Larsson's trilogy about one of the most interesting and intriguing characters in the history of literary fiction.  Lisbeth Salander is such an enigma.  You can't help feeling sorry for her, at first, as she seems to have a life full of appalling events.  However, it isn't long before you realize she not only hasn't folded up and quit on life, she realizes she has the ability to get from life what she wants on her own terms.  Those terms end up being rather stark, to say the least.  I got the distinct impression during the first book that she was going to end up \\"winning\\" her battle against her demonic father, his minions, the other potentially deadly threats which come her way, as well as her own inner demons.  However, it was rather satisfying to see it all play out in the third and final book.  I was hesitant to begin a story set in Sweden, which I know so little about, and I wondered whether some of the culteral references might be lost in the translation.  However, I soon realized the writing was good enough to bridge the language gap.  I will likely see the movies made in the original Swedish (with subtitles), however I really can't wait until the American (English-language) versions come out here in the U.S., which is supposed to be very soon.

0307454541|5.0|This first book (of the Millenium Trilogy) is simply un-putdownable. A veritable page turner, in the most non-cliched sense of the word. Makes you want to dig into the second book without delay.<br /><br />Carl Mikael Blomkvist is a financial journalist with integrity and who has been accused of and found guilty of libel against a business tycoon. A business tycoon who is almost certainly guilty. He has been handed a hefty fine and three months in jail. Lisbeth Salander is a 25 year old hacker who does PI (private investigative) work for a security firm, but someone who has also been deemed as legally \\"incompetent\\", is regarded as a \\"retard\\", has a mostly undisclosed history of abuse, and who may also be suffering from Asperger's Syndrome (hinted at but not stated definitively). And then there is Henrik Vanger, the octagenarian patriarch-in-retirement of Vanger industries. He has been obsessed with the disappearance of his grand-niece almost forty years ago. Vanger proposes to Blomkvist that he write a history of the Vanger family and also try and find out what happened to his grand-nience, Harriet Vanger, who he suspects was murdered. No body was found, no one was suspected, and no one charged. Yet, a grim and smug reminder of her disappearance makes an annual appearance at Henrick Vanger's house.<br /><br />As Blomkvist starts his work, first alone, and then with the help of Salander, they dig deeper and find things that had been overlooked, and things start to go horribly wrong. A sadistic, ritualistic murderer may in fact be on the loose. Blomkvist's life may be in danger, in mortal danger, Salander herself has to deal with abuse, Blomkvist's newspaper may be in danger of going down in the wake of the libel suit, and the Vanger family is no gathering of saints.<br /><br />This is by far the best fiction book I have read in almost ten years. The pace is measured, even slow at times, but never slackens. Enough detail is included to keep you involved. The central characters are thoughtfully etched out, except for Salander, who towards the end acquires almost superhuman capabilities and requires a fair stretch of imagination to accept. Minor quibble. There is substantial dialog between the characters; important if you are to build empathy, or antipathy, towards the characters, and yet given short shrift in so many works of fiction.ly etched out, except for Salander, who towards the end acquires almost superhuman capabilities and requires a fair stretch of imagination to accept.

B003ZTQN1I|4.0|The more I listen to this, the more I find that I can't wait to see if the movie lives up to the soundtrack. Let's face it: it's hard to get a great soundtrack *and* a great movie, and this makes me think that maybe it can be done. That said, there are a few misses: Ronnie Dunn's voice doesn't work for me on \\"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Double)\\"; maybe it's because I heard Gary Stewart's version first. Leighton Meester's voice is good as well, but the song is bigger than she is (maybe a deliberate choice for the character?) -- I love the lyrics, but I don't love the singer. Standout cuts: Me and Tennessee, Country Strong, A Little Bit Stronger (already a hit for Sara Evans as of this writing). Overall, it's a nice mix of new country and old. If you're a fan of any of the artists, or simply a fan of modern country, you'll probably like this.

B003WTE886|5.0|Perhaps no other artist today presents such a remarkable success story as Taylor Swift. At only 20-years-old, she has won Grammies, CMT awards, and MTV awards to name a few. She has broken the record for the number of singles by a female artist to debut at #1. More than Mariah Carey or Madonna. She's gone platinum on all her albums (undoubtedly including this one). And what's so incredible is she did it all on the merit of the music itself, not on her sex appeal (although she is pretty, you won't see her pole dancing or sporting black leather or pretty much anything besides cute dresses, unlike Rihanna, Gaga, or...dare we say it...her once-competitor Miley Cyrus). She's full of girl-next-door charm and her music is written and sung from the heart, full of emotion and passion. It amazes me how Swift speaks the language of the ordinary person. She says everything we want to say but can't or don't dare. Maybe that's why so many people (granted, the vast majority are under the age of 30) gravitate to her.    With her third major album (if you don't count \\"Beautiful Eyes\\") Taylor holds onto the formula that helped make her famous, catchy love songs, whether they be roll-your-windows-down, summer anthems (Our Song, Love Story) or breakup ballads that make you want to sit down on the edge of your bed and just cry (Tim McGraw, White Horse). And of course the angst-ridden revenge threats (Picture to Burn). All of these are present and accounted for in \\"Speak Now\\" but there's also a surprising element of plain human songs about life. After all, Taylor is growing up. And so are her fans. Those high school student who followed her when she first made her debut at age 16 are now graduated and in college, experiencing a totally different aspect of life. There's a lot a new experiences and new feelings, a sort of initiation into adulthood. And sometimes it's hard. I know because I'm one of them. That's why the mention of new apartments in the big city and growing up are driven home for me.    Musically, there's a lot that is the same, but there's plenty that show's Taylor's evolving style. Perhaps the biggest surprise is her vocal performance. I've finally heard what I've been waiting four years to hear: her belting out a song. I'm honestly impressed. She's finally a good singer. But then again, a lot of her previous material didn't really require a huge set of pipes.     Alright, all the generalities aside, let's get down to the songs themselves.  \\"Mine\\" is the first single. I think it's supposed to be the \\"Love Story\\" of the album, but personally I wasn't as impressed with it. There seems to be no difference, no creativity. Raidio-friendly, but not my favorite. 3/5  \\"Sparks Fly\\" is much the same, relying on generic hooks. The lyrics are good. I hate to say this, but it sounds similar to \\"Fearless\\" from her last album. It's too bad Taylor went formulaic on these two. 3/5  \\"Back to December\\" is the first song that grabbed my attention. It's recounts the meeting of former lovers after being apart for a while. She sings about how if she could she'd go \\"back to December\\" and change her mind. The words and music are paired beautifully. 5/5  \\"Speak Now\\". Oh where do I start? This is a breath of fresh air after the Tayloresque first two singles. Granted, it's about Taylor stealing the groom from the altar, which I can actually see her doing. But if you take it as a fantasy vs reality, it's really enjoyable. I think I'm sensing a little Ocean City musical inspiration, at least in the verses, which is a refreshing sound for her. 4/5  \\"Dear John\\" is a heartbreaking letter to an old boyfriend about their dysfunctional relationship and how hurt she is. I can really close my eyes and feel the music. It's bare and honest, but sad. 4/5  \\"Mean\\" made me laugh. It's probably the most country-sounding song of the album. It's not obsessive (thankfully). It's basically her telling this bully off. My favorite line is when she pictures him in the future, \\"Drunk and rolling on about how I can't sing\\". Take that, critics! I liked it. It's a nice sound for her. 4/5  \\"Story of Us\\" is not one of my favorites. It's a breakup song but, again, it's formulaic, the lyrics not even as good as \\"Mine\\" or \\"Speak Now\\". Musically, it reminds me of \\"The Outside\\" from her debut album. 2/5  \\"Never Grow Up\\" is perhaps my personal favorite, definitely of the album, possibly of all her songs. She speaks about growing up from experience, urging children never to grow up and to stay simple and innocent. The third verse is exactly where I am in life and it's very personal. I've listened to it maybe a half-dozen times and I've cried every single time. Once in public and once while I was driving, so beware. This is embarrassing seeing as I'm a guy. 10/5  \\"Enchanted\\". This is a real stand out track to me. It's about a stranger she meets and feels this enchantment towards. It's the beautiful, pure romance like this that make me like Taylor so much. On top of that, it's musically one of the most impressive songs. Practically flawless. 5/5  \\"Better Than Revenge\\". Oh my gosh this is interesting. Ok first of all, it's an aggressively obsessive song about getting even with the girl who stole her boy. It features some surprising lyrics: \\"She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress\\". Musically, she remind me of Avril Lavigne to which is scary. It's energetic and well-produced, and I guess the album wouldn't be considered Taylor Swift without a revenge anthem like this but it's not what I love about Taylor. 3/5  \\"Innocent\\" is a beautiful song about life. Everyone has messed up. Everyone, to one point or another, is haunted by their past. We all long for peace with ourselves. Taylor takes on the role of compassionate friend who makes you believe in yourself again. A really sad, but encouraging song. 5/5  \\"Haunted\\" is a very interesting direction for Taylor. As you can probably tell by the title, it is darker and semi-tragic. The vocals almost remind me of Paramore. It might be her best performance of the album. She really belts it out. The arrangement is creative as well. 4/5  \\"Last Kiss\\" is well-written. She does a good job at creating a mood and atmosphere. It's another heartbreaking breakup song, very easy to listen to. 4/5  \\"Long Live\\" is a tribute to her band. Love love the songwriting, using heroic visuals (heroes, crowns, dragons, kings and queens). It's an anthem to believing in yourself and taking on the obstacles as a team. I can definitely see it going into a lot of home-made slideshows of girl's soccer teams. I love it. 5/5    Overall, not a disappointment at all. It's hard to compare it to her previous albums because there are songs from each that I really love. But I'm happy to say that Taylor succeeded. She kept some vintage style that will be sure to please her fans, while maturing both in themes and vocals. This is a powerhouse album that you won't regret buying.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|Wanted to watch this to pay particular attention to Mick Taylor and there is a generous amount of footage trained on him.<br />While the film saturates the screen time with Jagger and Keith, the film makers do manage to swing over to Charlie and Bill from time to time as well as horn players Keys and Price. There is a 2 second shot of pianist Nicky Hopkins if you don't blink.<br />Which is a crime. But the film makers weren't thinking of Nicky back then.<br />Their focus was on Mick and Keith which is not illogical.<br />So, the amount of screen time given to Taylor is very much appreciated.<br />Observing his demeanor and stage presence is facinating.<br />Taylor and Richard split time between rhythm and lead guitar.<br />I love how after the first few high energy songs, Jagger introduces Love In Vain with \\"Here's some blues for you\\" and the atmosphere is de-escalated dramatically.<br />Taylor's guitar solo in Love in Vain is one of the highlights of the concert.<br />As a matter of fact, the performance of Love in Vain was outstanding while I would have to declare the highlight of the entire concert to be Midnight Rambler with its weaving textures and rhythm changes fast to slow to fast to slow and Jagger's expressive harp playing.<br />Toward the end of the show the Stones dust off Bye Bye Johnny which we learn later in the 2010 interview with Jagger they used to close their shows with in the '60's at the Crawdaddy club.<br />The bonus feature is a rehearsal filmed in Switzerland in what looks like a television studio, with just the five Stones in a close knit circle.<br />In a change of pace we get to watch Jagger minus all the over the top stage theatrics-standing with just a microphone in front of him.<br />This section of the disc I liked perhaps more than the main film because it was easier to hear the separation between Keith and Mick's guitars.<br />The two interviews, past and present, with Jagger are wonderful.<br />It never fails to delight me to watch Jagger so enthusiastic and boyish with an easy laugh and smile.and smile.

142311339X|5.0|Rick Riordan kicks off his new Heroes of Olympus series with The Lost Hero. While some of the characters will be familiar to readers of the Percy Jackson quintet (Chiron, Annabeth and Thalia Grace all make appearances), the book revolves around three new demigods: Jason, Piper and Leo.<br /><br />When Jason wakes up in the middle of a field trip, he knows his name and nothing more. He has no idea why he was sent to The Wilderness School, a boarding academy for teens with `problems.' He doesn't recognize his best friend Leo, a mischievous Latino with unlimited energy. And he has no idea why he is holding Piper's hand - except that Leo and Piper both assure him she's his girlfriend.<br /><br />Piper doesn't know why Jason lost his memory, but her boyfriend's amnesia is just one item on a growing list of problems. Her famous father has been secretly missing for three days and Piper's dreams are being haunted by evil beings she can't identify. In order to get her dad back, the dark creatures assure her, she'll have to betray her friends. And to really put a cherry on the sundae her day has become, an unnatural storm attacks the field trip and, she, Jason and Leo are whisked away to a place called Camp Half-Blood - and informed they are the children of Greek Gods.<br /><br />Leo is used to being a misfit and an orphan, so he kinda likes being a demigod, especially if it means he gets to play with the awesome power tools in his new Cabin. But there are troubling things afoot at Camp Half-Blood as well. An important camper has gone missing and his disappearance is somehow tied to Jason, Piper and Leo. Then there's the Great Prophecy everyone is talking about. Before he knows it, Leo and his two friends are on the road, undertaking a very dangerous quest.<br /><br />As with the Percy Jackson series, Rick Riordan skillfully interweaves modern teens and ancient legends in The Lost Hero. This time out, the field is expanded a bit as the Greek creation myth of Gaea and Ouranos, the Roman aspects of the Greek Olympic Gods and even the Cherokee belief system all play a part in the tale.As always, Riordan's young heroes employ logic, luck, trust and courage to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds, providing the reader with a thrilling, absorbing adventure.k Olympic Gods and even the Cherokee belief system all play a part in the tale.As always, Riordan's young heroes employ logic, luck, trust and courage to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds, providing the reader with a thrilling, absorbing adventure.

I become very emotional when I listen to it; it has the quality of stirring up all kinds of feelings. This album lends itself to one's imagination by creating a picture or story with music that you can enter . It fills me with happiness to know that there are still such artists in this world. Bravo Secret Garden!!!
B001E45XT4|3.0|so, i bought these in january. at first they seemed great! they did well with sound, and they were extremely comfortable on my head. Well, after a while of putting the headphones on, and taking them off again, i started to hear a cracking sound whenever i did so. and after a while, they snapped in half. The wires were still intact, so i superglued the pieces back together, and then duct-taped the entire thing just to make sure....they now bend WAY too much, and they are very uncomfortable on my head. looking for replacement as I write this.

B0009HLD0K|3.0|While waiting for the DVD to arrive in the mail I mentioned to various friends that I had purchased it.  Each of them...all in their mid forties said it was a good movie.  Alas, seeing it for the first time has me wondering when did they last see it.  If you watched the movie back in '79/80 then it probably holds nostalgia and a good example of the sort of \\"coming of age\\" movies being made then, but as someone who saw it for the first time in 2010 the movie is dated.  The plot line is fairly transparent and somewhat obvious.  The DVD transfer is poor - a higher quality may have given the movie and the characters more impact.  Shame, as I had high expectations for the movie.  Surprised it was nominated for 5 Oscars.
0316077054|4.0|While I liked this book, I did not like it as much as the first. It is also one of the ones that is next to impossible for me to review without giving spoilers.<br />What I can say-- there was always plenty of action, things to question as well as questions being answered. Ethan is still very likeable, and I relate to him and his voice. Link is around still and funny and easy going as ever. We see Amma a lot and learn more about her and her abilities, which is a very good thing in my opinion. One of the things that I did not like is Lena's choices. While I understand some of her reasoning- still doesn't mean that I like it.<br />I didn't see much of the storyline coming, and I did not expect the changes that occurred. I am eager to get my hands on the next one.

1400064287|5.0|Do you ever wonder how people understand and remember certain ideas and products?  How about how do certain items and messages make more of an impact on people that others do?  According to authors, Chip Heath and Dan Heath, writers of Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die, they believe that messages and ideas must tailor a specific audience and whoever is communicating this idea, must make enough of an impact to change the audiences' behavior or opinion.  The authors also believe in six principles that would ensure ideas to stick with the audience or consumer.     It is very important while conveying a message to completely understand exactly what it is you're trying to communicate.  What better way than to practice as must as possible before talking about the message.  This way being prepared, you know the message you want to convey, who you are speaking to, you can entertain to maintain attention and most importantly be believable.   The message or idea must be simple, unexpected, concrete, creditable, emotional, and must have a story.  These attributes are the six principles, in which Chip and Dan call \\"SUCCESs\\" (p. 18).  A message or an idea should obtain each of the six principles.  The message should be simple so that it is easy to get across.  It should be unexpected because this is what gets the audiences' attention and engages their curiosity about the message or idea.  Next, it should be concrete because consumers remember more things they can actually visualize.  Then, creditability is necessary because in order for consumers to believe in the product or idea, they must believe in the message that they are hearing.  The message or idea should tie in emotions as well because businesses and speakers want people to feel moved by their product or message.  Finally, the idea or message should have a story, which makes it more effective in the end because people can begin to actually see themselves involved with the product, message or idea.I believe that these six principles are very essential to anyone in this world who is trying to convince someone into doing some or to buy something.  Whether it be a salesman trying to sell a boat, a wife trying to get her husband to buy her the new Fall Coach purse, an employee trying to convince their boss of a more efficient way of doing business.  All must include these six principles to be effective, or at least some of the principles most hold a higher status than others.  Also, when I hear a commercial on television, I do not necessarily pay attention to every single one, but rather I pay attention to the ones that pertain and most relatable to me.   I was recently in the market for a new car and of course I was working with salesmen.  One in particular was great.  He was well prepared to make a car sale.  He made sure I understood the car by breaking down the feature and specifications of the car into simple terms.  He told me information about the car that made me more interested, such as great gas mileage, it would last me a very long time and a rebate would be offered if I decided to purchase the car.  This definitely made the salesman credible because he knew the car inside and out.  When he could see that he almost had me with the sale, he began telling me how safe I would be in the car and how happy I would be with the purchase.  He told me stories and testimonials of other people who had purchased the same car and said that no one had came back with any issues or complaints.  That is when the salesman sold me on the car, tapped into my emotions and really sold his message on the car.     Chip and Dan Heath did a great job with this book and had some really good examples to support their ideas.  I truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone who wants to convince an audience of doing anything.  I did not disagree with any idea in this book.  I felt that they backed up their ideas with concrete facts and examples.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I remember when I was 14 years old in June 1977 saving my allowance to buy this, my first Beatles album. I still have the same vinyl copy today. I see here it has been remastered & the price reduced. I'm surprised to see it's now only 4 or 5 bucks more than what I paid 33 years ago. It's good to see the music I loved as a teen being kept in print & improved.
B003WTE886|5.0|I can understand the impulse buy that \\"The most helpful critical review\\" said that he bought the three albums, I count Fearless Platinum as its own album, and how you do it because you have a twenty burning a hole in your pocket so why not?   I think on some of her earlier songs were a bit over hyped just like the guy who wrote the The most helpful critical review... Perhaps if I was a fifteen year old girl I would like Fifteen, no offense to the song or the people who like it, more but I am not so I thought it was a bit over hyped being played almost all the time on the radio...  Speak Now however has a much more... Pop edge to it that Taylor Swift has always had to my ears where she is not country but not pop either, perhaps that is why I didn't find the other albums so good is they were always somewhere in between and not in a good way...   This album I feel found that perfect balance.  Only small things I have is that the album cover is a bit blurry... I like how its not the averge headshot that a bunch of... single artist (not counting the band) use. How it changes the pace and gives you that little bit more.   The only other thing is the track listing... Not the songs just the track listing, how it kind of goes up up down up down down up (if that made sense...) and so forth I think it could have been better listed, perhaps that is just the one person saying it.   All in all I love this album, which is somthing from some one who didn't like the first of her albums.
B0040MF1XK|4.0|Louis Lortie is a French-Canadian pianist whose playing I know only from his fine recordings of Ravel and Chopin. He is not someone I would have automatically thought of as a born Beethoven player; his playing has seemed too French, i.e. elegant, measured, precise, cool. And indeed those qualities are here in abundance. But the funny thing is that as I listened on and on, and again and again, his approach grew on me. There tend to be, generally speaking, two kinds of Beethoven players: those that take the emotional, rough and ready approach, and those who are rather more gently  romantic. Lortie is neither. He is precise, he is emotionally a bit reticent, but when one listens closely one hears nuances, variations in touch and tone and dynamics that bring deeper meaning to the music than precision and reticence ever can. Of course there are the more classically balanced sonatas, say  Op. 14, No.1 or Op. 31, No. 1, which  many players play as Lortie does, in a classical manner. But what about the more dramatic and emotional sonatas, say the 'Appassionata' or Op. 31, No. 2 ('Tempest'). Well, Lortie doesn't break a sweat nor a piano string, but he gets the message across and in a manner I am finding quite satisfying the more I listen to them.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed in Op. 106 ('Hammerklavier') in that is really does call for more busting loose than Lortie manages, but this is the only performance that I have any significant reservations about.<br /><br />Most of these recordings were made in the 1990s and issued separately on Chandos at full price. But a number of the sonatas were recorded in December 2009 (Opp. 54, 57 'Appassionata', 78, 79, 90) and just this past June 2010 (Opp. 109, 110, 111) and issued here for the first time. I imagine I heard greater depth of both musicianship and feeling in these latter recordings. They are still Apollonian, but there is something more complex emotionally than in the earlier recordings. I love the last three sonatas for these reasons, especially in the slow movements. I feel these performances are a real addition to the available sum of Beethoven sonata recordings available.<br /><br />This would not be anyone first choice for a complete traversal of the 32, nor anyone's only set. And certainly for those who expect more red meat in their Beethoven will want to avoid it. But these are very good performances that deserve to be heard and pondered. The budget price is a real consideration, too.<br /><br />Scott Morrisons for these reasons, especially in the slow movements.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|One factor I think about in ranking a movie 5 stars is whether - upon successive viewings - I discover more layers of meaning or excellence.  Will the movie get tired or will it get stronger?  \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Judgment at Nuremberg\\" are those kinds of films that get stronger each time I see it.  I include \\"Reds\\" in that same category of profoundly interesting films.    One brilliant aspect is the director's playful use of the \\"Witnesses\\" - talking heads framed in black - that interrupt parts of the narrative like a Greek Chorus. Sometimes they have something insightful to say...sometimes trivial...but all the Witnesses knew John Reed or Louise Bryant back 70, 80, 90 years ago.    Warren Beatty's epic sews many different threads successfully.   Yes, it is a love story about John Reed and Louise Bryant, but part of that love story is the personal growth of Louise Bryant's character as a woman.   Early on, she complains she is not taken seriously.  John Reed responds that only if she writes about serious things  will smart men begin to take her seriously.  And he is right. In time, Louise Bryrant must have developed an insightful, observant voice. In literary style I actually prefer Louise Bryant's \\"Mirrors of Moscow\\" to John Reed's better known \\"Ten Days that Shook the World.\\"       \\"Reds\\" is also a story of young men and women who were willing to make tremendous personal sacrifices if their efforts might bring about a better world. And this at a sad time in American history when child labor, poverty wages, and 70 hour workweeks were common. It is also an uncommonly honest film about socialism and the Russian Revolution.       There are many deeply intelligent scenes.  Two examples:  John Reed and Emma Goldman privately debate whether the Communist Party has abandoned its principles.   Or Louise Bryant is compelled to answer to a Congressional Committee about her patriotism and faith.      On every level, this is a thinking person's film that has many obvious and hidden treasures. Alas I feel that too many current films celebrate comic book heroes rather than real flesh and blood individuals...people with very serious flaws, fears, and yet outstanding courage. John Reed was such a person.     While I personally believe his desperation to support the communist party was a wrong choice...I will accept the reality he did so at a time when the idea of a workers' revolution seemed to be an alternative to the evils of unchecked capitalism.  So, for example, in condemning the U.S. decision to get into World War I, he proclaims that the U.S. Government is ready to support J.P. Morgan even with the blood of its sons. In other words, John Reed argues the American elite would protect J.P. Morgan's financial interests against catastrophic bank losses even if that meant war.  Nearly 100 years later, what has happened?  Hundreds of billions of dollars were recently loaned by the U.S. Treasury to AIG Insurance and to the Big Banks during the economic blow-out that these institutions caused in the first place.      History repeats itself.  Learning from these great films may serve as a warning...next time.

If it were told from the mother's point of view, I don't know if I could have read it.  The boy is so innocent that his point of view takes a horrific situation and makes it sweet in its own way.  Truly an amazing read and a book that I am thinking about days later.

It not only shows supporting techniques and strategies, but also helps to boost your confidence. I especially enjoyed the Writing Task 1 part with many graphs and diagrams, however all the parts are written diligently. Thank you Simone, I keep my fingers crossed for all the IELTS takers. Good luck!:)

B0006IIKS0|5.0|Some Kind of Monster documents the making of what is not only the worst Metallica album but possibly the worst album ever in the history of recorded music. This is a fascinating look at the demise of what was once a great, original and innovative band.<br /><br />None of these guys come off very well with the exception of Jason Newsted who actually has the sense and integrity to abandon the sinking ship regardless of how much money he stood to make by sticking around. However Hetfield and Ulrich who were the driving force behind Metallica come off especially bad. Hetfield seems truly pathetic going through rehab and his constant whining. He actually complains about how hard his life is and gives as an example that after doing shows he parties and gets laid every night! Ha ha! Can you imagine how many millions of teen age boys sat in their room playing guitar dreaming of living the life that Hetfield has!<br /><br />With Ulrich he comes off like the spoiled rich kid grown up that he is. The auctioning off of his art collection and gloating over the profit he made like he's JD Rockefeller or something scene was a perfect example. Sipping champagne with his model bimbo wife at his side. I did like how Lars Dad more or less tells him that Metallica sucks now while attending one of the albums recording sessions.<br /><br />There were also pathetic group therapy sessions with the band and some con artist therapist. You even get Dave Mustaine of Megadeth making a cameo appearance and embarassing himself possibly as bad as Hetfield and Ulrich did. I never would have dreamed this band would have come to this. One of the great appeals that Metallica had to people when they were a great band is they came off like down to earth metal kids. The way they acted, dressed, the beer they drank, etc. They would spend their money on stuff like comic books not multi million dollar art collections. Now they either sip champagne or are rehab basket cases instead of having a cold beer. This is so sad and pathetic. If you want to experience the real Metallica buy their first three albums and the Cliff'em All video. They did some other good music but those are essential..

B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|I watched this movie on Blu-Ray and I have to say it's one of the grainiest Blu-Ray's I've ever watched.  I had to double check to see if it was in fact a Blu-Ray disc and not a DVD.  The grain may have been added on purpose but it didn't look intentional to me, anyone with a brain can tell you that this is way too grainy for it to even qualify for Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the movie is great. I've seen it a million times and it's always entertaining but I'm just reviewing this movie from at Blu-Ray quality stand point.<br /><br />You're better off buying the DVD version, specially if it's going to save you money.
0307454541|3.0|After reading this, I don't really understand the big hype around it. This is the kind of the book that if it wasn't for the hype, I'd put it down after ten pages. I agree, later, it does get better, the mystery, suspense, and danger are all there, but that's after you read maybe 50% of the book. (I read it on a Kindle, so I'm going to use % instead of pages).<br /><br />First of all, the writing itself is quite dull and flat. I guess I'm trying to say that it is written in a really detached tone of voice. The book mostly consists of narration, but would sometimes cut off in the middle of the narration/exposition to give a detailed conversation between two characters. This disrupts the flow of the story quite a bit at times. Also, jumps between Blomkvist and Salander are numerous and sudden. Some places the pronouns aren't made clear so that it takes a while to understand who the \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" is referring to.<br /><br />The story itself didn't get really interesting until like 20% into the book. In fact, while the prologue shows the mystery, the real mystery didn't start until then. Beginning was all set up to introduce the characters, but not very engaging. However, one thing I liked was how the book focused on the characters even after the mystery was over (at 80% of the book). You see Blomkvist internally struggle with the choices he has to make, but Salander, albeit changed, was not that much different. And I am curious about Salander's past and what made her this way. But the real crime suspense part was over way too early and then we're left with Blomkvist taking revenge. The book came full circle in the end, but you can definitely see Stieg Larsson's own beliefs shining through in Blomkvist. If Larsson hadn't included the financial reporting and just wrote about mystery, the book would be much more interesting (but then again he couldn't find a way for Blomkvist to accept the job to solve the murder).<br /><br />Like some others, I do not understand why it's called the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, because it's not really about the girl (Salander). She didn't join the crime investigation until later. I think the author only included her because of character development, but the book didn't have to be about her, which only took away space from the crime. Overall, a book that tries to do too many things at once and would've been better if it had just tried to focus on one thing.the Dragon Tattoo, because it's not really about the girl (Salander).

6305633177|5.0|When I was teenager and watched this video over and over and over again it would have been completely unfathomable to me or any of my friends that were also huge Metallica fans that they would have ever turned into the complete and the totally pathetic jokes that they have become. Both as artists and human beings. Not that they didn't do some good stuff after Cliff died but the only absolute essential Metallica to own are the first three albums and the Cliff'em All video. They really were a truly great and innovative band at one time.<br /><br />Here you get lots of live footage. Mostly done from the crowd by fans with hand held cameras. Also interviews and footage of them just hanging out. As low tech as it is it works not just well, but great. You feel like your standing in the crowd watching the show sometimes.<br /><br />Besides the music one of the things that appealed to Metallica fans back then was that they looked, acted, dressed like any other metal kid. Which makes it all the more horrible that they have turned into poofy, arrogant, money grubbing, out of touch jerks. Watch this and compare it with the Some Kind of Monster documentary if you want a good example of how money and fame can completely ruin people. Both as artists and as human beings.

His books have never disappointed me, they always make me laugh and think.  It does help if you spent time in Europe.  It helps you understand some of the relevant references.  Even though this book may be considered young adult, The Tiffany Aching books are great.  And no one can top the wee free men (with the possible exception of Death and Nanny Ogg)  I am truely saddened by the fact that he has early onset Alzheimer's.

B000000W6R|4.0|I must get it out of my system and write a review for this album. After reading Rich Lattas highly rated review with song for song discussion, im somewhat perplexed to find that the tracks I routinely skip are mr Lattas absolute faves in the Pumpkins canon. For a reviewer who obviously takes its task seriously and loves the Pumpkins like I do, he seems to favor the more mundane songs over the true gems. I know that we all have our individual taste but I for one believe that good taste tends to converge. Have I simply listened to more music thus having developed a higher sense to distinguish between the great and the good? I would love to hear from anybody who can explain this better than I just did.     The other reason to write this review is that I have always found Pisces highly intriguing and keep returning to it - a weird album, from the title (even in the pumpkins realm), to the green front cover, to the fact that it was wedged between Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie as a b-sides with nonetheless the full 14 songs, of often better than average quality and with some absolute highlights!    To start with my highs and lows - I appreciate this album more for its softer low-fi tunes, especially Whir, Obscured and La Dolly Vita but I also recommend such heavy outliers as Frail and Bedazzled, and Pissant.  On the other side of the musical coin you will find Plum and Starla, which are duds that should never have been released in my view.  Don't agree? Do read on..    Sooth  Sweet music but Corgans voice is a tad too sweet and at times annoying in its expression. The melody is limited with a last few interesting bars arriving too late to save this song from mediocrity. ***    Frail and Bedazzled  Must be a Gish take out coz it brims with same energy, positiveness and soft loud passages. A solid piece. ****    Plum  The opening chords put me off immediately and its midtempo generally seems to bring out the worst in the band, this song sounding particularly boring. And no, the guitarsolo does not redeem. Being a guitarist myself Im always on the lookout for great solos and true enough Plum has a lot of guitarwork but Corgan cant seem to keep it interesting. This is an awful track.  **    Whir  Makes me open the windows and draw in the sun. What a beautiful piece this is! Corgan sings with conviction and the little subtleties of the instrumentation are fantastic. And yes, the melodramatic chord set at the end totally completes this piece and actually is the reason why this is better than good. If you cant stand nice surprises like these you should stay away from alternative rock, period.   *****    Blew Away  On its own this track is decent and an average band would have been very happy to release such a composition but then again, the Pumpkins are not an average band and capable of so much better.  In contrast with Whir this song simply doesn't shine. James Iha's voice is alright but there is a reason why Corgan is the vocalist in this band.  ***    Pissant  Great dark riff and an outstanding example of the Pumpkins' thrashy credentials. ****    Hello Kitty Kat  More drone and less impact than Pissant but still brings it home with some interesting guitar parts in the end. ***1/2    Obscured  How to improve on Whir? Obscured is how! The same summer but drawn out and you just wouldn't want it to end.. Fortunately the Pumpkins know a thing or two about interesting endings and, again, leave their particular stamp here. Latta calls it a mood killing drone and sure enough my first impression was somewhat similar but I can now appreciate it for the emotive outburst it is. Somemore the Pumpkins clearly have tried to limit the tonal contrast as much as possible.  Another classic.   *****     Landslide  I haven't heard the original but get the feeling Corgan tries too hard in the vocal segment. Competently  performed otherwise but it hardly touches my buttons. If only that lovely solo lasted longer.. ***     Starla  Supposedly the killer track here but I strongly dislike at least half of it. I find the softer beginnings nice and listening full of promise but then the electric guitars kick in at 2.52s with their endlessly droning and mostly identical riff. The trick is to resist reaching for the skip button and wait for 4.34s when the same relaxing music returns augmented by, oh yes, a tabla of sort, and another minute or so of soft tonal bliss. At 5.35s it is droning time again augmented by none other than a 5 minute guitar solo which never goes anywhere. If the Pumpkins had weaved an ending at 5minutes+ I would have given this a ***1/2 instead of the ** rating but hey, who am I to criticize a bands right to experiment...?    One reviewer mentioned that this track transports him to the same plane as Wagners Liebestod does. While I grant everyone their own musical experience and joy, I should caution the potential buyer who may get carried away hearing that statement. Starla is no Liebestod for sure. The undoing of Starla is its uninventive guitar riff and ugly solo. Allow me to suggest Led Zep or even Sonic Youth for much better guitar epics.   **    Blue  Creative short piece but not very exciting. A welcome and easy redemption after Starla though. ***1/2    Girl named Sandoz  Latta calls this campy and I must agree. He also calls it cheesy and again, that's on the dot. However not cheesy and campy enough to earn my appreciation. Feels like somewhat of a misfit on this album. **1/2    La Dolly Vita  So simple and effective that you might think this piece to be a banal one, but the truth is that simple equals good here (and elsewhere in music). This is perfect pop ending in an explosion of gorgeous rough guitars, and yes, a short jarring finale not unlike Whir and Obscure. The triumphirate of soft classics on Pisces is complete. *****    Spaced  The title says it all. And it works somehow. ***1/2    So in my opinion only half of the songs here are beyond mediocrity. Not enough to make it a classic Pumpkins album but enough to be a must have for every Pumpkins fan.  Pisces transcends its Bsides tag and is really not much different from most Pumpkins studio albums in that it solidly delivers the great, the mediocre and the ugly.
1416594795|5.0|I bought his book without any great expectations as I have a scientific background (though not in biology) and was already convinced of Darwin's theory of evolution before I read the book.   I expected a rehash of things I knew or thought I knew.  Still, partly because I had a long flight ahead of me and partly because I like Richard Dawkins (watch his excellent BBC documentaries if you get the chance) and thought it would be money well spent I bought the book.    I was therefore very pleasantly surprised when I started reading it.  Not only did I find the style quite engaging (not at all a dry arduous boring science factbook)and easy to read but I was also very pleased at the amount of things I actually learned.  I was not aware (or only generally aware) of the experiments that have been conducted that show evolution at work on short timescales (a few years or decades):  - Wild foxes turned into dog-like animals (complete with wagging tails, floppy ears and human friendly behavior) in only a few decades.  - Fishes changing their camouflage patterns in a few years depending on the river bed (sandy, pebbly, stony) they've been relocated and the intensity of predatory activity (more predatory activity = best camouflage is favored, no predatory activity = flashiest males are favored!).  - Carnivorous lizards turning into herbivorous ones (ie changing skull shape and digestive system) when relocated on a different (but with less insects) island off the same coast.     - Lenski experiment on Bacteria (amazing!) splitting an initial population of bacteria in 12 'lineages' subsequently kept strictly separate but under identical conditions (same flask with same liquid and nutrients) and showing how those 12 lineage evolved to cope with their environment over 40'000 generations (a few year's time for bacteria)with one of the lineages hitting (as a consequence of random genetic mutations) on a way to use a different nutrient, leading to an explosion of their population density.    In a nutshell, this is an excellent book targeted at non-specialist audiences who either want to be able to articulate rational arguments about the theory of evolution or people who genuinely wonder what the theory is about, how it came to be and how it is supported by scientific evidence (including the most recent developments in genetics).

This is not a great book, its not even a good book, it is a bad book; an unable to finish bad book. The charcaters are not beliveable and the story even less so. The author must have gotten a huge advance for the publishers to go all out to sell this thing.

B004A8EI9M|5.0|If you happened to have read the comics or just like the zombie horror genre then this is a great thing for you. The Walking Dead manages to take a fresh approach in a genre that has been done and done again. Its still just the first episode and the show has moments where its still trying to find its feet but the shots are impressive and it has a pretty decent story which is something severely lacking from a lot of modern horror. It uses the comics for guidance but doesn't patronize the material. Well done premiere.
1576751988|3.0|I am reviewing the 2002 edition.<br /><br />I like Brian Tracy.  I just finished reading another one of his books titled \\"Goals!\\" and then I decided to read this book.  This book is very short and I finished it in about two hours.  Most of the information, if not all, is available in \\"Goals!\\".  I felt like this was a concise version of that book. In all fairness, \\"Goals!\\" is a newer title though.<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Eat That Frog\\" offers good advice and because it is short, you can use it as a quick reference or a pick-me-up.  I agree that a lot of self-help stuff is common sense but sometimes you need someone to help clarify that common sense. For this reason, I don't give self-help books low ratings unless they give you bad advice. The message of this book is pretty clear and it revolves around visualizing your goals, writing them down, and then having complete clarity and acting on them at 100% until they are 100% done.<br /><br />My advice is that this is a good book and you can only benefit from it.  However, if all you want a concise goal-setting/procrastination book, buy this one.  If you want something with more depth, buy \\"Goals!\\".  I just ordered David Allen's book, \\"Getting Things Done\\". Judging by the reviews, that seems to be a more appropriate book on ...well, getting things done.<br /><br />I only paid 1 cent plus shipping for this book, so I don't care.  I wouldn't pay full price for it considering, like I said, \\"Goals!\\" is the same message but in a more verbose package.<br /><br />I will keep this book as a reference though.<br /><br />EDIT:  After I read this book, I read \\"The Now Habit\\" by Neil Fiore.  That is a much better book because it clearly defines what procrastination really is and it gives you some good advice on how to get around it and eliminate it from your life.  I sold \\"Eat That Frog\\" because it really didn't teach me how to tackle the procrastination.  It taught be that I could do it but now so much how. \\"The Now Habit\\" shows you how to tackle procrastination effectively and I recommend that over this title.w to tackle procrastination effectively and I recommend that over this title.
B0043HA1K0|2.0|I so wanted to really like this album but I just cannot get into it!  I love the Roots, have all of their albums and I enjoy John Legend when I need something mellow. I listened to it all the way through 3 times now and I am just not feeling it.  The performances were lackluster at best, the song selection was just odd.  I was a kid during that era that the original songs were written and these performances just don't do the era right.

1400064287|4.0|The book \\"Made to Stick\\" by Chip and Dan Heath, takes a main theme from \\"The Tippng Point\\", by Malcolm Gladwell, and expands on it.  The Heaths take the thought that an idea must be `sticky' in order for it to be a success and set parameters to it.  In this book, the Heaths tell you how to actually make an idea sticky.  The Heaths make a guideline to stickiness using the acronym SUCCES.  This is simple enough to remember, as it is your overall goal.  They state that if you follow these guidelines, you'll be sure to have a concept that is fit for presentation to the President.   While elaborating on their points, the Heaths conclude each section with real world examples and personal stories of how things have actually worked in the past.   This easily ties everything together and gets their points across.  I believe that out of the many business books that I have read, this may be the most beneficial.  While other books are fair in their own ways, this read was truly easy to understand and relate to.  Each single idea that was presented throughout the book was backed up by a real world story: a telling of how the recently discussed idea has actually been practiced.  That is what reeled me into this book.  Whether it was a story from Southwest Airlines, or folklore of the \\"Kidney Heist\\", the Heaths made it easy for every reader to understand exactly what they were speaking of.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I was not planning on purchasing this album, which shouldn't hurt Taylor's feelings - a million others did this week.  However, for the 3.99 price tag, I couldn't refuse.  What a pleasant surprise to find such an excellent album!  She may not be the greatest vocalist live or otherwise, but this album has music that is intelligent, well produced, and yes, catchy. I believe Taylors run at the top is not to be soon over with material of this quality.  My hat is off to you, Miss Swift.
B004132HZS|5.0|The idea of updating Holmes to the \\"present day\\" is not new at all. For the 14 Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies, the first 2 were set in Victorian times and the next 12 were all set in the present day, which at that time was the 1940's with cars and phones and styles not seen in the 19th century. In those movies, the viewer does get used to the time changing and can enjoy the movies based on the mystery and the deductions.  This new series brings Holmes all the way up to present day London but the characters are conisistent with the way they have traditionally been portrayed. So this new Holmes is still Holmes and the Watson we see is consistent with Doyle's Watson.( Some may think they've taken liberties with Moriarty though). This is the key to the success of the new stories. The stories are fast paced with many modern twists but they keep the characters intact. Very enjoyable and those who liked the Jeremy Brett stories should also like this series.  As to bonus features, there's a 60 minute version of the pilot that is a little bit different and a \\"unlocking Sherlock\\" that gives some behind the scenes info.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|Positives:  It's good to see a bit of honesty with regard to Christianity's darker moments; not that other religions are immune from similar indiscretions. Sadly, institutionalized religion's quest for numbers, power and control has not abated and still deceptively couches desires in misdirected terminology and goals.     Negatives:  (1.) Can't studios find it in their vast budgets to hire appropriate consultants -  in this case teachers and scientists. During Hypatia's time the methods of Socratic discourse and teaching to encourage reasoned thought were well known. Hypatia failed to query her students in order to elicit creative responses to questions; did not encourage return creative questioning; did not redirect or build upon responses...  (2.) As a scientist Hypatia did not behave as any scientists I've known both in terms of her emotional responses and the thought processes she used for problem solving. These characteristics don't change with time - they are timelessly inherent to the inquiry process.   (3.) Throughout the film the use of contemporary language such as \\"optical illusion\\" and \\"heliocentric model\\" distracted from understanding that period.
0143113100|4.0|Until recently, doctors and scientists believed that the brain was genetically hardwired, that nerve cells within the brain when damaged by disease or trauma were irreplaceable. Dr. Doidge, however, demonstrates convincingly that the brain is capable of being reshaped or reformed throughout its lifetime. In The Brain that Changes Itself, Doidge shows that when one part of the brain fails, other parts can fill the gap. When brain cells die, at times, they can be replaced. This is revolutionary medical news, especially for people impacted by a brain injury.<br /><br />We know that survivors of a serious brain injury make great strides when they participate in formal rehabilitation in the first weeks and months following their brain injury. We also know that they generally continue to progress when they return home, reenter the community, and challenge themselves to return to their previous lives. But, it has been generally believed that this progress plateaus at about one or two years post-injury.<br /><br />In the past decade, however, we have begun to hear the term neuroplasticity, the medical term for the brain's ability to reconfigure itself. In The Brain that Changes Itself, Norman Doidge presents some compelling case studies that contribute to the growing body of literature supporting neuroplasticity.<br /><br />Dr. Doidge tells how people suffering from stroke, cerebral palsy, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior have reorganized their brains and dramatically improved the quality of their lives. As an example of the power of neuroplasticity, Doidge describes how Christopher Reeve, who suffered a severe spinal injury, recovered some feeling and mobility seven years after his accident<br /><br />Reconfiguring the brain, however, is not easy. It requires the diligent repetition of specifically targeted exercises over long periods of time.

B003EYVXXW|1.0|This movie was a great disappointment! I was anxiously awaiting its release on DVD because this period in history (Byzantine Era/Late Antiquity) is almost never dealt with in movies. I titled my review \\"lost opportunity\\" because making a movie about Byzantine Egypt with characters such as Hypatia and St. Cyril was a golden opportunity to show both ancient science and religion in a positive light and show the relevance of both to our modern world. It is true that these two didn't always get along in the 4th and 5th centuries but this was not due to anything intrinsic to either Science or Christianity.     Moving away from paganism and the worship of statues and nature was just as much an advance of human reason as Aristarchus' heliocentric theory.  Unfortunately, by watching this movie one would get the impression that those who believed in mythology and in twelve gods living on Mount Olympus were the rational ones and those who condemned such beliefs as foolish and outdated were just uneducated fanatics. Rather than making an intelligent statement about science and religion this movie is just a hatchet job on St. Cyril and the Orthodox Church. The early Church was never against science, anyone who has read the works of Clement of Alexandria or St. Basil the Great would know this. The Church was against paganism and the worship of false gods and idols.  This movie however did not only get the religion side of the story wrong but it also got the science side of the story wrong. Some examples:    1) The movie implies that Hypatia came up with the idea of eccentric orbits. This is totally false. Ptolemy's whole system was based on eccentric orbits.  2) The movie claims Hypatia discovered the First Law of Planetary Motion. There is absolutely no evidence for this. Also, how did she arrive at an elliptical orbit based solely on the need for an eccentric orbit? On what basis does she reject the eccentric orbits of Ptolemy? This is why the movie hides the fact that Ptolemy's system was based on eccentric orbits in the first place.    3) The movie dismisses the objection to heliocentrism which states that objects would be displaced by the motion of the Earth. This objection is not entirely wrong. Hypatia's experiment of dropping a sack from the mast of a moving ship would not result in its falling straight down as the movie suggests but it would be displaced by a very tiny amount due to the Earth's rotation, this is known as the \\"Coriolis Force\\". Whether the sack would be displaced towards the East or towards the West would depend on whether the ship was traveling north from Alexandria or south towards Alexandria. The problem is in being able to notice and measure such a tiny displacement.    But the most glaring offense of the movie is its portrayal of St. Cyril and his followers. It is obvious that the makers of this film did not read any of the writings of St. Cyril who was an intellectual of the highest order. The actual St. Cyril of history, the St. Cyril that we can discern from his own writings, the St. Cyril that was the champion of Orthodoxy at the Council of Ephesus bears no resemblance to the evil uneducated murderous thug of the movie.  If St. Cyril was an anti-science thug why has the International Astronomical Union endorsed the naming of a lunar crater in his honor?   It is unfortunate that this movie was an agenda driven hatchet job rather than an honest portrayal of history.
B00288KNL8|3.0|This movie is not suitable for children under the age of 10. If you have a sensitive 10 year old, I would not recommend it either. The grandparents showed this to the kids when babysitting. Big mistake. Quite disturbing.

B002ZG99G8|3.0|Too many movies try so hard to something they are not.....ENTERTAINING!  Yeah, it's a weak plot but who cares...it's mindless fun.  I call this movie the poor man's A-Team!  Great for just pure escape-ism, a few cheap laughs, and GAWD awful acting....at times!  Pass the popcorn please!

0698116496|5.0|I loved this book. Bought it for my two grandchildren and read it 4 x' s  before I realized it.  Can't wait to read it to my grandkids 3 years old and 18 months.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This is probably one of the best (and craziest) movies that I've ever seen.  All characters are very well played.  If you're looking for a light hearted movie, this isn't it.  Shows how quickly one's life can be turned around and upside down.
0525951652|5.0|I believe Amazon should separate the rating for the book vs the format.  I purchased the book on CD.  it is outstanding, made a LONG drive from the NE to FL fly by.  Great book for people that love history with great characters.  you will learn alot and be entertained at the same time.    I believe it is as good as World w/o End.  Loved Pillars but World and Fall are his best so far.  So good you want to keep driving to \\"hear\\" the story.  The same reader does Fall that read for Pillars and World.    Buy it, you will not be sorry, then donate to the public library, you will get some of the cost back as a tax deduction  :))  and be sharing a great book!!
030726999X|4.0|As a series I really enjoyed all 3 of Larson's novels, but this particular book was my least favorite. Yes, you learn a lot in this book and a lot of questions are answered, but it's fairly slow developing for my taste. If you've read the first 2 you pretty much have to read this one.
B003B02OQ4|5.0|This is my favorite of John Grishom's novels. I found the writing tight, the story believable, and I was rooting for the kid at the end of the book (from the beginning, actually), as well as feeling sorry for him.    Severe emotional trauma is real, and is what the little brother was going through. I suppose that those reviewer's who don't believe that what was described have never even come close to understand.     The secrecy of the kid is totally understandable. He learned, over and over, that adults were not to be trusted. For almost anything. He is also super intelligent, which is usually true for those who have survived what this kid has survived. The ones who don't survive are the ones who haven't learned that.    I thought that this was a very, very good book. I have 3 copies of it, in fact. Hardcover, paperback and ebook. It is one of my favorite re-reads.
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor Swift's done it again... I confess to having thought that after releasing Fearless, Taylor could never pull off the same magic again. But there is nothing Miss Swift does better than proving people wrong.    Despite the perfection of Taylor Swift (the album) and Fearless, there were a few tracks that just I almost hated hearing. (The albums themselves remained perfect because the other songs' excellence balanced them out.) I skipped over Tied Together With a Smile, Perfectly Good Heart and Invisible on the former and Breathe on the latter every time I played her albums through. The same does not apply here; while there are some songs that are definitely not my favorites (\\"Speak Now\\", \\"Innocent\\"), I feel like they mesh well enough with the rest of the album that a straight-through listen is pretty nice.    REVIEW    Packaging-  5/5    Gorgeous. The front cover is very glamorous, though something about it (perhaps the excessive perfection) suggests that this was partially artificially edited. The overall theme of the cover seems like it would have fit more beautifully with the title \\"Enchanted,\\" but I personally prefer the title they chose.    The back end of the CD depicts Taylor wearing a flowing yellow dress and black heels, looking up and into the distance. Splashes of color rim the lower and left border, and the way the track names are elegantly presented almost makes this seem like a scrapbook, not a commercial album.    This time around, Taylor included the typical end-notes in the beginning in what she calls a \\"Prologue\\". She scores points for originality on the end-notes for each of her albums. For Taylor Swift, she replaced the \\"thank you\\"s with \\"I love you\\"s; for Fearless she added a bit about the title at the beginning; and for this one she made the end-notes the beginning-notes. The \\"prologue\\" is written in a font that fits it well, and it is headed by the most beautiful splashes of color that resemble the ones on the back end.    The titles for each track fit the overall mood of each track brilliantly. I disliked the Fearless track fonts a bit because I felt they either went overkill or didn't fit their respective songs correctly; for Speak Now Taylor did it perfectly. The lyrics of the songs are written in a simple, straightforward, slim font that I really like. As usual, Taylor's hidden messages in each of the songs that are quite fun to hunt out :) The best part of the lyrics is that they neither hide to the point where they are impossible to read, nor do they detract from the main focus in the booklet: The artwork.    SONGS-    Mine-  5/5  I am very, very glad Taylor chose this to be the album's first single. She opens the song with gentle vocals; strings are introduced, and then she leaps into the song. I was able to almost instantly tell that this song was a flash-forward, not a literal retelling of a story - she is a brilliant lyricist. The song is very upbeat, and Taylor's vocals stay high, clean and strong throughout the song. Sure, it might be autotune, if you've ever heard of an autotuner able to replicate the sounds of the faint but true vocal strains found even in wonderful voices like Kelly Clarkson's when reaching those really high notes. It's definitely Taylor's natural voice. \\"Mine\\" closes with fading echoes that keep this song stuck in your head.  Just an fyi, I've played this song only, oh, about 220 times. It speaks volumes that my intense addiction to this song has only begun to taper off after nearly half a year of obsessive playing. To the Grammy and country music awards, if you do not at least nominate this song for a few awards you clearly do not know good music when you hear it. Just saying.    Sparks Fly-  4/5  I may have given this a 5/5 rating had I not heard the live version first. The recorded version lacks the originality and passion of the live one; Taylor changed some of the lyrics, perhaps because the original sounded a bit too racy for some of  Taylor's younger fans. Also,the instruments are not the same.  Overall the song is pleasant. Its theme is like a combination of The Way I Loved You (forbidden love) and Hey Stephen (almost complete adoration). Sparks Fly may sound pop as the recorded version, but it is far more country live. The melody is still upbeat, so I do still love it.    Back to December-  5/5  This is the THE most mature song I've heard by Taylor yet. She's freely admitting her own flaws, and the touch of bells and strings add to the deep emotion. I have a feeling that had Back to December not made the record, Taylor would have recorded it anyway and sent it to Taylor Lautner. There is no trace of autotune in this song, and from the way her voice carries her emotion it's clear that this song has a lot of meaning for her.  The music video... let's just say it disappointed me. With more flashbacks and storyline, this video could have been a million times better than the dull narration it is now.    Speak Now-  4/5  Happy and bright, but almost like You Belong With Me on steroids. Instead of taking place at prom and a football game, Speak Now's setting is at a wedding and stopping the bride and groom from saying their vows. It's a highly interesting perspective, but I've always seen weddings as that final place where love is announced. The concept of interrupting one because of one's own romantic interest sounds a bit selfish. However, the song itself is pretty and has an almost glossy sheen to it and I do enjoy it.    Dear John-  5/5  This song is very, very slow yet almost dripping with emotion and regret, hence the nearly-seven-minute length. I do not envy whoever Taylor directed this towards, because it's rich in justified anger, so rarely found these days. This song is a slow version of Forever & Always, except that includes a name (John Mayer, perhaps?). This song is not just pretty - it's beautiful. Don't listen if you don't have a heart, or if you dislike emotion.    Mean-  5/5  Definitely the most country on this album. Taylor, in her soft-spoken manner, takes a vicious lash at her most unreasonable, outspoken critics, but in a subtle way that will not be picked up by those too stupid to pay attention. I'm certain she had WhatTheBuck (arguably YouTube's biggest idiot) in mind when he wrote this, because this guy is someone who simply will not stop criticizing and making fun of her for anything. This song is a good example of putting one's anger to good use. Taylor, well done.    The Story of Us-  5/5  One word: flawless. It's catchy, memorable and contains some of the best lyrics ever. (\\"Oh, a simple complication / Miscommunication can lead to fallouts... I don't know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down\\".) Of course, it doesn't hurt that this perfectly relates to a situation I had a few months ago (\\"This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less / But I liked it better when you were on my side\\"...). Very clearly written for John Mayer.    Never Grow Up-  4/5  I'm an older teenager now so I have more years to reflect back on that I thought I ever would (and I'm certain I'll have far, far more). Taylor well communicates how she misses her childhood and almost flawlessly captures the innocence of youth in this tune. The meaning of Never Grow Up is beautiful and well-crafted, but the melody itself is less than exciting. Taylor's rare song \\"Brought Up That Way\\" would have been a far better song for this spot on the album.    Enchanted-  5/5  THE best freaking song. Ever. I simply cannot stop listening to Enchanted, and I can so easily understand why Taylor originally wanted to call the album Enchanted instead. This song owns Teardrops on My Guitar, Love Story and every other musical hit, Taylor Swift and otherwise. I have never before heard a song that so fittingly displays the way one feels when they first meet someone they fall in love with. (\\"This night is flawless / Don't you let it go / I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\\".)Taylor, I love you for writing this song.  Apparently she wrote this for Adam Young of Owl City! I had no idea she had feelings for him. :D    Better Than Revenge-  5/5  As just a song this song definitely earns the 5/5 score. I have rarely heard such anger in Taylor's voice, and it's almost ridiculously obvious that this song is written for Camilla Belle (you know, that snotty woman who stole Joe Jonas). But... but... where's the country?! This tune could have come straight off of an Avril Lavigne album. That is no insult to Taylor's songwriting, because Avril is a fabulous songwriter as well, but I don't feel like such a pop sound belongs on an album categorized as country. If Taylor were to have produced a pop album I would not feel this way.    Innocent-  4/5  My one complaint: This song is sleepy. It echoes of her forgiveness for Kanye West and is very alluring and classy, but perhaps because of this it is also slow and dreamlike. I enjoy listening through the entire song and will often listen to it several times in a row, but it is not as bouncy or electrified as songs like Better than Revenge or as deep as White Horse (from Fearless).    Haunted-  5/5  Second best after Enchanted. Her voice is... how do I put this?... not quite shrieking, but full of the desperation of knowing someone you are in the craziest kind of relationship with is slipping out of your fingers. These are the kinds of songs that make me feel like Taylor goes back in time to how she felt when writing the song while recording it. The instruments behind Taylor's emotional voice add to the haunted (no pun intended) feeling of this song, and the abrupt ending is perfect for the desperate mood of this piece. Taylor's already released \\"Mine\\" and \\"Back to December\\" as singles, and I definitely feel like the third single should be this because it's a great song while serving as a foil to the rest of the songs in mood and lyrical content.    Last Kiss-  5/5  Initially, I wrote:  \\"As is the case with Innocent, Last Kiss's one minor drawback is its sleepy quality. Songs like this prove Taylor is not a plastic Hollywood doll but a real person with emotions; she's still clearly stung by Joe's treatment of her. This feels like the most like a journal entry.\\"  New review:  The liner notes for \\"Last Kiss\\" read, \\"Forever and Always\\". As we all know, Taylor wrote that song for Joe Jonas--so, presumably, Last Kiss is about Joe. While Forever and Always has an incredibly angry/betrayed tone of voice, Last Kiss's general feel is, \\"I loved you but I couldn't make you happy. I hope life treats you well, so you get the happiness you deserve.\\" I used to think the slow tone was a flaw, but in actuality, it adds to the deeply emotional tone of the song. This will probably never be performed at awards shows because it is lengthy and, at first \\"sight\\" (or at first listening?), it seems dull. It's the sort of song that needs to be allowed to grown on one to love. Now that I've let it do so, it touches me every time I listen to it, and it has acquired the ability to make me cry.    Long Live-  5/5  This is the new \\"Change\\", and, fittingly, it too is the last track on the album! Taylor captures the moment of victory and couples it with an almost silent and obscure dig and her cynics to make a triumphant conclusion to her album. Additionally, some people feel like it's dedicated to Taylor Lautner. Lines like \\"We were the kings and the queens\\" and \\"A band of thieves in ripped-up jeans got to rule the world\\" directly contradict this. (Since when does a single couple consist of \\"kings and queens\\" or a \\"band of thieves?) I propose the notion that Long Live was written for Taylor's band instead.    BEST ON THE ALBUM:  (1) Enchanted  (2) Haunted  (3) Back to December  (4) Last Kiss  (5) Better Than Revenge    WHAT WOULD HAVE MADE THIS PERFECT...  -Replacing \\"Never Grow Up\\" with \\"Brought Up That Way\\"  -Tacking on \\"Dark Blue Tennessee\\" as a fifteenth track  -Cutting \\"Innocent\\" or at least making it somewhat interesting  -Rewriting Speak Now. I like it mostly because it gave the album its fitting title, so lyrics like \\"You want to say something / Say your thoughts out loud / Fight to be heard / Get up and speak now\\" would have been better than \\"Baby I didn't say my vows / So glad you were around / When they said speak now\\". Same title, but better song overall.    (I first wrote this review on October 31, 2010. I finished revising it January 25, 2011.)
B00361DR4Q|5.0|Just a short review to say that this is a wonderful performance and production and at a price which no one with Blu-Ray should pass up.      Only one issue - why does another performance come up when I access information on this disc?  What I get is a Netrebko/Villaizon performance information.  That's really strange.    Otherwise, buy this fast before they realize how inexpensive a price they're charging.
031603438X|4.0|If you're a Stones fan (like me), read the book.  It's well written and has a style and flow that picked me up and carried me along.  Certain things I was curious about remain unanswered.  Mick Taylor's departure?  Nonbody knows why, not even Mick Taylor himself, per Keith.  Gram Parsons leaving the scene in France?  Keith says he really didn't know anything about it.      LIFE is Keith, the son; Keith, the musician; and Keith, the addict.  It's fun to see that the coolest guy on earth actually had a rather normal family, and it's clear how much he loved them.  He was born to play music--that should be obvious to anybody with ears--and the way early R & B affected him is a soulful thread that runs throughout his story.  His account of the song writing process of the \\"Glimmer Twins\\" is hilarious.  Who knew all those great songs happened this way!  As for addiction, he seems as up-front about it as he can be--the price of admittance to the club he wanted to join.  But all addicts live with a measure of denial.  He faults Mick for following another star, but who wants to be in business with a heroin addict . . .  In Mick's place, I'd have felt betrayed by my friend.      But then, Mick and Keith's \\"old lady\\" . . .  well, read the book.  It seems an honest effort, from the heart.  Like his music.    (Side note: When I first heard that he was coming out with this, I thought, \\"Ooohh, I hope Stanley Booth writes it with him.\\" While I can't fault James Fox, part of me still thinks that SB, with his wit and sly phrasing, would've been a natural.  I hope he'll write something soon.)
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I've been a fan of Robert Plant since the beginning of his days with Led Zeppelin.  This music is nothing like what he did with Zeppelin, but I could listen to Robert sing anything (including the phone book!), and I own everything he has ever put out.  Plant fans will not be disappointed; however, if you are hoping for his music of yesteryear, this isn't it.  His voice is still really strong, and he still sounds awesome, in my opinion.  I love this!

006112429X|1.0|I would very rarely say this about a book written this well, but don't waste your time, especially as a book club choice.  Why?  Three reasons.    First, the \\"shocking plot twist\\", which is revealed later in this review after the words SPOILER ALERT, is actually a bit of a cheap and misleading trick that doesn't make sense on several levels.      Second, the protagonist, Kevin's mom, is ridiculously bereft of both psychological insight and, apparently, the most basic advice and guidance about raising a child, which makes no sense given her level of education and general sophistication.  Her son, Kevin, is obviously troubled from a very young age, yet despite quite serious problems, she and her husband seek no professional help for themselves or for Kevin, even after she gets so angry about yet another misbehavior that she throws him and breaks his arm.  She's educated and very thoughtful, yet apparently doesn't consider, and/or is never advised to seek, serious professional behavioral health treatment for her son or herself.  None of the moms in my book club thought this was plausible at all.    Third, because it's an unrealistic, but very realistically-written, story, it leads the reader to ultimately waste a great deal of thinking (and leads book groups to a great deal of discussion) about a richly woven fiction of implausible circumstances.  You spend lots of time thinking or talking about the story as if it were true - how could this happen?  are people born this bad?  - when really, it's all an unrealistic yarn not worthy of that level of analysis.  If any reader is inclined to invest this much time and attention in a very painful story of a teenager who becomes a murderer, that time and attention would be much better invested in reading true stories and trying to learn what we can from them, so that as a society we can deal with real issues, instead of fictions.    SPOILER ALERT:  The book is written as a series of letters from Kevin's mom to her husband, Kevin's dad, who is described on the back cover blurb as \\"estranged\\".  As you read them, they strongly suggest that he is living elsewhere with their daughter, a girl much younger than Kevin.  Only at the very end do you discover that before Kevin went to his school and killed people there, he killed his dad and sister at home, in a gruesomely-picturesque, made-to-sell-the-movie-rights fashion.  In addition to making the blurb a lie, and leaving the reader feel cheaply misled and manipulated, this \\"twist\\" adds to the profound inauthenticity and implausibility of the rest of the story.  For example, the mom portrays herself as a major social outcast after the incident, suffering cruel and angry treatment unmitigated by any public sympathy.  None of that seemed consistent with her having lost both a husband and a daughter in such a horrible way.  Also, it makes no sense that she would write all these letters about Kevin and yet make no mention of the daughter's terrible fate for so many pages...unless the author is trying to pull a well-dressed, but cheap, trick.
0307474712|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this book.  I honestly don't know how anyone (any woman at least..) could give it any less than 5 stars. Many of the other reviews on here do an amazing job of summarizing, so I won't re-summarize, but I will warn you not to read all of the summaries to the end! Some of them here tell you how it ends (which Nicholls clearly does not intend to have you know until you get there).  It truly is a great great book.  Nicholls keeps you reading and reading from page 1 and I found it SO hard to put it down.  His amazing story telling will suck you in and you'll feel like you are right in the moment with Emma and Dex, seeing what they are seeing and feeling what they are feeling for *twenty* years.      It's now a week after I've finished One Day and I'm having the hardest time finding another book that is even going to compare.  They're currently filming/have filmed a movie coming in '11 but I highly doubt it will ever live up to the book.  You will LOVE this book!!!
B001HN694K|4.0|Filled with gorgeous special effects, wonderful music, truly appealing actors and a clever return motif that allows both a reintroduction to Wonderland and a sequel at the same time, Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is quite a spectacle to behold. The film hinges itself upon the performances of Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter. All turn in effective displays of their considerable talents, and are entertaining. There are a few flaws in this version, which I feel do detract from the movie as a whole. Lewis Carroll's world is not treated with respect in all ways; random concepts (such as Fustilug, Gribling, Keltikidik, Queast, Zounder, etc.) are introduced which have nothing to do with the original stories, and Depp's dance number at the end is a travesty. The CGI, while striking and beautiful, gets in the way of characterization sometimes (especially the poor Queen and Knave of Hearts effects, which are more distracting than engaging). The worst flaw is probably that the brilliant wit, humor and logical paradoxes of Carroll's masterpiece are almost entirely missing. This seems quite surprising, considering the material they had to work with. All in all, however, this film is a darkly radiant success. It's beautiful, enjoyable, intricate and eccentric ... everything you'd expect from this director. Enjoy it, and hope for a sequel that's even better!
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I purchased this movie for our grandchildren.  The thorougly enjoyed it.  A great remake of a movie I took my son to see as a child.  I would encourage all grandparents to make this part of their movie collection for their grandchildren!

I haven't even finished listening to the new album because I'm afraid to.  I just keep pounding the skip track button.  What a drag!!!  I'm listing to Mighty Rearranger now to heal my disappointed heart!

B001GCUO5M|3.0|I had only seen small previews of this movie and had never really paid attention to it or had an interest in seeing it.  However, when it was on the discount rack at the local movie store I decided to give it a try.  Directed by Martin Scorsese it should have been a good movie.  And while it wasn't too bad, I'd rate it a high average compared to some of his other excellent works.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, an FBI agent who has been sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmate/patients there.  You see, Shutter Island is home to the Ashecliff hospital for the criminally insane.  Most of the people sent there never leave and are too dangerous to hold near the general population.  In fact, the woman who disappeared is accused of murdering her three children by drowning them in the lake.  His partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) is along to help him solve the case.  The problem is, things keep going from bad to worse when they start suspecting that no one wants this case solved after all.  Not a single person is being helpful and Daniels starts to suspect that the head psychiatrist (Ben Kingsley) is out to make sure he never leaves the island and expose their deadly secret.<br /><br />There is a lighthouse on the island and this is where Daniels thinks they are doing horrific experiments.  The head psychiatrist Dr. Cawley claims they only use medicine and therapy, but Daniels believes they are doing lobotomies in this horrible place as well.  He is determined to get to the bottom of it even though when the missing woman is found there is no reason for him to stay on the island.  However, strange things keep happening to Daniels (his dead wife keeps haunting his dreams) and he can only hope he won't fall into the madness that is Shutter Island.<br /><br />DiCaprio does a good job in this movie.  He's believable and while he does come on as an incompetent character sometimes (only because he couldn't hear me screaming at him to get out of there!) he plays a pretty deep complex character and does fair job of getting the nuances just right. As a whole I'm not a big fan of DiCaprio as I think its too easy to remember his previous films when he's acting and that can be mildly distracting. His partner doesn't have much of a part aside from a few side things so I didn't really feel I had enough background to critique his part in the movie.  Kingsley is always fantastic and it was great that he easily made the watcher suspicious of him from the get go.<br /><br />There was quite a bit of music in this movie and it does have an impressive score.  That said, it wasn't my type of music and therefore wasn't very memorable for me.  The genre of the music was mainly classical.<br /><br />An interesting premise. but it can be quite predictable at time.  Because of this I really didn't feel surprise at the end and some of the scenes in the movie could get quite boring as they were trying to build story without anything happening.  Definitely three stars, it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent either.  I did enjoy the locale of the movie as well, it was hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Review by M.

0765326353|5.0|As others have noted the book seems a little slow at the start, but really picks up as it goes along.  The characters become a believable ensemble cast and breath life into the story.<br />One of the things I really enjoyed about the book was the fact that while chapters and sections were broken up by flashing back and forth between characters each one left you wanting to know what happened next. I will admit to enjoying the sections with the Bridge men a little more than some of the others.<br />As I read it dawned on me why Brandon Sanderson was hand-picked to complete the Wheel of Time series.  While Sanderson has a different way of placing words he is very similar in his pacing, and his attention to character development fit with Robert Jordan's books.<br />At 1007 pages this book seems a bit daunting at first, but please don't let the size keep you from reading it...once you are about half way through you will find yourself wishing it wouldn't end, or at least I did.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|There is a reason why Britney Spears is the one and only true Pop Queen. Britney's music is just one in a million. Her singles always stand out from all the other washed-out pop stars we have today. Thank God we still have the ONE TRUE POP STAR in this music industry to give us an incredible album worth paying for.

0071373586|3.0|The overall concept of the book is great. It makes you critically think about advertising, and exactly how to win over the consumer. The points were succinctly presented at the beginning of each chapter, but I felt that the book conveys a very repetitive nature with a lot of unnecessary filling between the key points.

0307474275|5.0|THE DA(n) BROWN CODE<br />( Review)<br /><br />Published in USA Regional Mailbag, Number 274, January, February, March, 2004, Pages 17-18.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown. Doubleday, 2003, 454 Pages. $24.95. ISBN: 0385504209, Hardcover.<br /><br />Every once in awhile a novel comes along that everybody has to read. One recalls Catcher in the Rye, The Godfather, or one of my favorites, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.<br /><br />The first thing one notes about this story is how tiring it is. This is not to say it is dull. It even ends up being a page-turner. However, the unrelenting suspense is exhausting. Starting out in the early evening with a mysterious murder, it drags on through the night into another day, moves from Paris to London, and several other places, complete with car and airplane chases, bank robberies, more murders here and there, long lectures in the middle of the night in a villa outside Paris. To begin with. All this, combined with some complicate code which takes the whole book to unravel, only to find, more or less, the remains of Mary Madgadeline, and some documents, under the Louvre Pyramid. And one wonders, why not just wait till the film comes out?!<br /><br />The whole thing is a far-fetched and terrific spoof. Those who hate patriarchy will love the pitch to the feminists and goddess religion wackos. No doubt, all religions are some mishmash of rite and symbol, myth and magic, truth and lie. What makes it interesting is the lengths that are gone to to protect and promulgate some particular prejudice.<br /><br />In this story, Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, and have heirs, living in secret, in France. This just doesn't work. For one thing, everyone knows that if these two did have heirs, they'd be living in Italy and not in France. For sure.<br /><br />The Opus Dei connection is a colorful twist, and the traditional bishop and the albino monk are made for the screen. The scoop that the next pontificate withdraws the personal prelature stature from the organization, which was obtained by money in the first place, will be welcome news to Opus haters.<br /><br />Where does Da Vinci fit into all this? As a former Grand Master of the Holy Grail Society, he helps the cause with riddles and clues and writing backward. Of course, that is Mary Magdalene sitting on Jesus' right in the famous Last Supper painting. Then too, the Mona Lisa has something up his sleeve besides that shy grin.<br /><br />After awhile, all this code and encryption business gets a bit boring. Its hard to keep interested. Like the plot itself, about three fourths into the story, one simply is not sure who is now tied up in the back of the stretch limo, and can't quite muster the interest to care.<br /><br />Anyway, in the end we now know that the Holy Grail is the tomb of Mary Magdalene, along with tons of documents, that have been hidden and moved and moved and hidden down through the ages. Brown is at least successful in one thing. He manages quite well to debunk yet another myth and legend. Debunked, but not destroyed. See you at the movie.<br /><br />c.w. / Gethsemaniobtained by money in the first place, will be welcome news to Opus haters.     Where does Da Vinci fit into all this?

0385341008|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a uniquely written novel. It is written as a series of letters to and from Juliet Ashton, the witty writer of a published collection of anecdotes of her experiences in London during World War II. The war is recently over and Juliet is trying to rebuild her life and looking for a new subject to write about. She receives a letter from Dawsey, a pig farmer on the island of Guernsey. He has obtained a book that once belonged to her and is curious about obtaining more books by the same author. The island state of Guernsey was occupied by the Germans for the length of the war. The people of Guernsey have been cut off from news, nearly starved to death and in a spontaneous moment formed the literary society as a ruse to allow themselves to gather regularly without trouble from the Germans. What began as a ruse becomes a real love of literature for many of the members. In her correspondence with the members of the society, Juliet makes new friends and discovers a deeply moving story about mankind's desire to not only survive but to thrive even in perilous times.<br /><br />I was amazed that through letters the story could be told so thoroughly emotionally and that the characters could be so deeply developed. In the late 1940's, letter writing was really the only way to communicate with people at great distances (phones being not nearly so reliable and convenient--especially right after war). Juliet's wit, thoughtfulness and her insecurities come out in her letters to her friends. This style was really rather ingenious and I ended up liking it a great deal. It was much more personal. It was as if I had just discovered a packet of letters carefully saved and wrapped in a ribbon in my grandmother's trunk.<br /><br />The story reads so smoothly. There is not a single flaw in the writing or the story. I now want to move to Guernsey and live in a little cottage by the ocean and let my kids run bare foot across the fields and milk cows and feed little piglets.lk cows and feed little piglets.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I'm only disappointed because I read the book some time ago, loved it quite a bit, but found the movie much less \\"believable\\".  Think I'll watch the movies first from now on and read the books afterward -- so at least I can put faces  on their characters.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I finished off my hard notes with a resounding 'F', but I decided it should get at least a D minus for special effects and story potential. The low score primarily reflects the fact that, at least for me, Splice fell well short of the film it could have been, not to mention a number of issues I encountered with the plot and characters.<br /><br />Pacing. What can I say. This movie follows the worn-out trend of having the creature grow at hyper-accelerated rates so that the plot might progress in real time. I suppose it's widely accepted that to jump forward would be too awkward, so, it's just better to try and convince the audience that cellular activity at hyper speeds is completely plausible.<br /><br />Let's see what else was problematic or just straight up dumb... blobs spontaneously changing sex, the blob fight magically creating the force to pry large metal screws from the floor and tip the enclosure onto the audience, I don't see how anyone could not roll their eyes at that... um, the creature Dren magically evolving from requiring air to breath, to requiring water, then inexplicably to both?<br /><br />No precedent is ever made for it's sudden ability to grasp word association, or to be able to draw in crayon using a variety of line and shading techniques. Dren possesses fully-functional, bird-like wings with feathers, which magically vanish inside her like Wolverine's claws. It's absurd and, yes, I understand what they were trying to do; she's the product of DNA which has been combined from many different kinds of animals, and so she has wings from a bird, hooves from a deer, a tail from a kangaroo, which possesses a stinger like a scorpion. Her eyes are set wide like a moose, her tongue is long and tapered like a rat's, her arms are thin and boned like a dog's, and her nose is a recombinant of Michael Jackson. Yes, I understand all that, but it creates such logistical problems that I don't have time to delve into them with this review, not to mention all the problems with the bio-physiological characteristics and developments that we are expected to just accept.<br /><br />Let's talk about the whole Adam and Eve allegory. Deciding to use the oldest archetype in history was the worst idea ever. As a result, the characters are fairly shallow and difficult to like. It didn't take very long before I couldn't have cared less what happened to Elsa. Clive was a little more admirable, but not by much and not for long. So, Adam and Eve, What happens? You've got a forbidden tree of knowledge in the form of recombinant human DNA. It's off-limits. The woman disregards the rules and laws and goes after it. She drags her fiance, Clive, into it as well. The guy, rather than standing up to her and doing what he knows is right, allows himself to become a part of it. So now, the Authority is bearing down on them and they are at risk of being caught, so they hide themselves away, in that old barn. Things go south. She gets impregnated by her, let's consider Dren as her personal \\"Original Sin\\", and now her offspring will, quite literally, inherit it. This movie's women are dumb, selfish, and without any moral bearings at all, just like Eve. Conversely, the movie's men are equally dumb, in allowing things to happen, even encouraging it. And then Clive gets all weird in the head and we have a near-beastiality to top it off. Ultimately, the woman's actions get her boss, her fiance, and his brother killed. The final encounter with Dren is awful. Not only has Dren magically changed sex, just like the blob creatures, but she/he/it is degenerated into a flying creature that snatches up people, flitting about in the most unnatural and impossible way, as all CG creations seem to inevitably behave.<br /><br />Isn't this movie billed as being a scary thriller? Yet, there's almost nothing scary about it. Unnerving at times, disturbing even, but never scary and I wouldn't even call it all that thrilling. Any suspense in the film comes as the resultof the unshared feelings between Clive and Elsa, not because of any real fear of the creature itself.<br /><br />Vincenzo Natali requires us to suspend disbelief way too much for a premium, sci-fi thriller. If there's one major ingredient this movie is lacking in, it's plausibility. And, in my book, a lack of plausibility equals a lack of believability, equals a growing disenchantment with every scene.<br /><br />I really wanted this one to be worth keeping in my collection, but there's absolutely no doubt it's going back to the MTC tomorrow.nd Elsa, not because of any real fear of the creature itself.

B001DJLD1M|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy is a great cinematic series. It is the movie for our time. Neo (the hero) starts out the first movie trapped in an illusion of a society. He knows that something is wrong about this world and searches for answers via technology. Neo is finally awakened into the real world to find out that he was in an induced coma.<br />  We are living in a society that is in a state of delusion. So many of us believes that our schools teach our children how to think, our elected official are running the country, our hospitals make us healthier, etc. None of those things are true. As a matter of fact I cannot think of one institution that does what it claims to do. Most of them are in opposition to their mission statements.<br />  Don't worry! The Matrix Trilogy is not a message movie that will bore you. There are plenty of action scenes. You will get explosions, martial arts fights, and Neo even learns to fly. All you have to do is watch the first Matrix, you'll go back for more.

B003EYVXYG|4.0|THE SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD    There have been many things said about George Romero and even more things said about his Dead films post the original three. For the most part people liked \\"Land\\" and just excepted it for what it was; people seem divided on \\"Diary\\" and as for this one well people kinda disliked it. Now I will say from jump right now that I have enjoyed all of them, honestly I have. I really liked all of them and that includes this one, do I like some more than others, of course. Where would this one rank, well I am sure most people could guess.    This film is based on a solider you may have seen in the previous two \\"Dead\\" films, he is labeled something different in each but in the special features Romero says he is the same character. The film follows him and his group of comrades as they make their way to an Island off of the coast of Delaware. This island is home to two different families who hate each other; you know the classic blood feud story. The O'Flynn's want all zombies terminated while the Muldoon's are trying to round them up and save them for the day a cure is found. Seems like something is wrong on both sides but I [if this really happened] may be on the side called TEAM PEOPLE were we kill the zombies threat. Say what you want but they tried to kill Simon Pegg, and poor Nick frost was turned into one, that is unforgivable.    When the military click happen upon a video thanks to a kid that tags along in which a man claims to have boats to get to an island off the shore line in Delaware, they make their way to it. After a very entertaining stand off with not only the man and his men at the boat place but with the dead as well they finally make it onto one and head over there. It is here that the real zombie killing begins and the fun begins as well, the blood feud is still very going on. O'Flynn came along for the ride to make it back home finally after being banished by Muldoon and is looking for his daughter and revenge.    The film is really just that but with a lot of gore and death so it is still fun, especially for fans of this type of film. The film is not perfect and the flaws are there, this is not the best of the \\"Dead\\" films but with no expectations it is still kinda fun. I think it is a fun twist on an old story, kinda like the \\"Pride & Prejudice & Zombies\\" style books. The acting is good at least for the most part and every one seemed like they were having fun on this. O'Flynn was my favorite for some reason; he was just funny to me and his character was great.    Speaking of that all of the acting seemed good, the characters and even the performances some times seemed 2-d but for the most part I kinda thought it was over the top good. Romero always has strong scripts and his direction is always great here I think he said \\"I am just going to have fun with this one\\". The reason I say that is because it feels a little more loose than his other works. Still I found it to be a good enough movie that does not match the earlier films but is still worth my dollar.    This two disc version is excellent with loads of features, everything from featurettes to full length making of. Of course the always great commentary is a highlight on any film geeks list so you know I loved it. There are little shorts on here as well and many more things zombie fans will enjoy. To be honest getting the 2-disc version is really worth the money even if you didn't care for the film as much as his others. I say go ahead and buy this 2-disc version if you already haven't, it would be worth it.

1439177783|5.0|The first time I saw Portia de Rossi was on Ally McBeal. I remember thinking how stunning she was...she looked like a fairy princess with her magical long, blond hair, beautiful face and sexy body... I still consider her to be the most beautiful actress out there...In my mind, anyone who is beautiful is also filled with confidence and self-assurance. That is the shocking part of Unbearable Lightness; Portia's memoir is about her early years in Hollywood when she struggled with eating disorders and self hatred.<br /><br />The book begins with an account of what would go through her mind when she was in the throes of anorexia, while on the set of Ally McBeal. At that time, she ate 300 calories a day, while exercising compulsively. When she started on Ally she was a size 6; she eventually weighed only 82 pounds.<br /><br />Portia was married in her 20's, but her husband left her when he realized she was a lesbian. Much of the book is about her struggle with being a lesbian and her fear of being discovered. her mother's advice--don't tell anyone. (Note that this was when Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom was canceled after she came out.)<br /><br />For Portia, playing Nellie Porter on Ally McBeal was \\"to play a commanding, intimidating professional Lawyer\\"--everything she felt she was not. (Which proves what a good actress she is--I thought she was so convincing in the role!)<br /><br />Basically, the memoir is about Portia's struggle with eating disorders, her self-esteem issues and dealing with being gay. The book is extremely readable and her voice is clear and truthful. Knowing she is happily married to Ellen and obviously healthy makes the book easy to read--we know it's a good ending!<br /><br />I recommend Unbearable Lightness for its honesty, readability, and for its look into both the Hollywood and mainstream cultures with the craziness associated with being thin. I also recommend it to anyone obsessed with their weight; dieters and those already stricken with eating disorders.<br /><br />I also want to comment how revealing Portia is in her memoir. As in...OMG! She unflinchingly recounts her mindset during the time of her eating disorder...her low self-esteem, her dislike of herself...this had to have been extremely difficult. She was brave to write the words down--let alone publish them for the world to see. As a ordinary person (not a celebrity) there is a certain fascination in reading her words--I mean, if celebrities can have low self-esteem, what about the rest of us? From a wider perspective, Portia's words are much like any average person with low-self esteem, due to an eating disorder or for any other reason. For people who do suffer from the affliction, reading her book and seeing how she gets better is quite uplifting.<br /><br />Portia was courageous--and good spirited--to have written this book, as it can help others who are suffering.<br />Finally, several reviewers wrote that she doesn't discuss her recovery---NOT true. Portia writes about her recovery in the epilogue--and, in my opinion, says everything needed to make the reader understand how she recovered from eating disorders.<br /><br />Highly recommend!how revealing Portia is in her memoir.

B00275EGX8|1.0|First off, I'm a captain in the US Army and I've done two deployments in Iraq. I won't beat a dead horse, it's been said enough by my fellow vets so I'll keep it as simple as possible.    What this movie gets right:  -The look and \\"feel\\" of Iraq    What this movie gets wrong:  -Numerous technical issues, uniforms, equipment    What this movie gets UNFORGIVABLY wrong:  -The portrayal of Soldiers as undisciplined cowboys  -one vehicle convoys   -white light flash lights in the dark (essentially walking around with a bullseye on you)  -splitting up to cover more ground (a.k.a. suicide)  -sneaking off the FOB alone (just ask the Soldier being held by the taliban what a great idea this is, seriously what was he thinking?)   -EOD doesn't disarm IEDs unless they have to, 99% are detonated in place usually by remote controlled robot, not a guy in a bomb suit     If you are a civilian and want to see a decent portrayal of what Baghdad looks like (the scenery and Iraqis I mean)then watch the movie, if you've been there I wouldn't waste your time with this movie.  I thought HBO's mini series Generation Kill[[ASIN:B001AQO3WY Generation Kill]] was much better, the Marines in Generation Kill weren't just a bunch of, as one reviewer said Hollwood cliches.      I apologize, this wasn't as short as I'd hoped, bottom line... watching this I felt somewhat honored by the film makers attempt to share the experience of a Soldier in Iraq, but at the same time insulted and angry at just how wrong and Hollywood-ized so much of it was.

B002ZG99CC|2.0|The basic story of this movie is nothing new or too exciting, as it is a remake of a classic.  Many others have compared this to the original in pointing out the faults of this movie.      But I feel that this movie has enough faults of its own, without being compared, that makes it a bad movie.    ************** Possible Spoilers ahead *******************    1.) As many have said, the title is one of the bigger WTFs.  Karate is not used in this film, it only appears once in a TV program.  I know this is just the marketing trying to leech off of the name.  But still, if you name a movie Karate Kid, there should be Karate in the damn film.      2.) Dre, the main character, was not a likable character.  He starts out as an arrogant, disrespectful, spoiled, show-off brat with no real talents.  And he pretty much remains that way through out the whole film.  When he first arrived in China and meets his first friends, he immediately tries to show-off his basketball skills.  But he had none, so then he blames jet lag and then tries to show-off his ping pong skills, which he had none either.      The bullies don't really target Dre.  In the beginning, the main \\"bully\\" interrupts the meeting b/w Dre and his main love interest.  And pretty much ignores Dre.  Until he repeatedly tries interrupt the \\"bully\\"'s verbal berating/argument with the girl.  Then Dre gets brushed to the ground, when he tries to get in again.  Even then the bully is pretty much ignoring Dre.  Then the next thing Dre does is take a fighting stand and actually initiates the fight by charging the bully.  And of course gets beat up.      The rest of the \\"bullying\\" in school, is pretty much the bully telling Dre to stay away from the girl and the bullies.  No point in time, did the bullies actually actively look for Dre to bully him.  In fact, the bullies pretty much ignored Dre from that point on.  Till one scene, where Dre actually follows the bullies and throws dirty water on them.  Then of course he getsbeat up some more.    At that point, I actually found myself saying \\"good, beat some respect and discipline into that stupid kid (Dre)\\".    To top it off, his main motivation to learn kung fu was to \\"kick butt\\", to get revenge.  Not self protection.    Once you have a main character that the audience can't relate to and like, the story will just go downhill from there.    3.) Being that the main character is 12 years old, which parent in their right mind would allow their 12 year old to go alone to some stranger (Mr. Han, Jackie)'s private house alone to learn kung fu.  She hasn't even met the guy yet.  And even allows the kid to go with Mr. Han on day long trips across provinces.    4.) There is no sense of urgency, because there is no sense of time given in the film.  What I mean is, after we find out Dre must compete in the next tournament to avoid harassment, we were never told when the tournament is.  No sense of how long Dre has to prepare.  Even during the training, there was no sense of \\"oh the tournament is almost here\\".  It was just them doing stuff slowly, almost without a care in the world.      5.) The actual tournament.  I'm not too familiar with actual martial arts or kung fu tournaments, but considering that the kids in the tournament are supposedly in the 12-year age group, the rules for the tournament seems pretty messed up.  To score a point you have to hit your opponent, fine I can see that.  But when you have an opponent down and pined, you don't get the point till you deliver the actual punch to the face.

B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I'm not exactly sure why I see so many negative reviews for such a fantastic, revisioned, update to my favorite sci-fi series. Predators is what every sequel should hope to be. It takes the core of what was great about its predesesors and adds enough new myth to the series to keep you coming back.  The biggest hang up for people since the first Predator was no Arnold. I'm sorry but that is a seriously foolish way to base the principle of a good vs bad movie. Honestly Swarzenager is a terrible actor who just happened to appeal to the testosterone junkies of the 80's and early 90's. Adrian Brody offered a fresh and stellar performance to the series and I was more than impressed with the over all cast as we got variants of different humans. They weren't all military or police. They were killers from the worlds dark underbelly which gave them a more realistic and fresh feel. In fact you begin to see their humanity under the layers of their criminal exterior's come out as the situation dictates them to work with one another. This helps you care as they start to fall to the Predators.  Another hang up is the world in which are protaganists are placed. It is explained by Fishbourne's character that the world is terriformed from Earth's vegetation for mainly hunting humans. So this is not a plot hole as some would say it just isn't explained until later in the movie.  The Predators are not week in this movie at all. Just like in all the other movies becasue of the strict rules of \\"fair\\" hunting the Predators adhere to, they get killed like they did in all the previous movies. I mean come on, in the first Predator Arnold was as good as dead but the Predator decided to give him a chance when he easily could have decapitated him on the log. The same holds true here. In the desire for the perfect hunt the Predators are willing to bet their lives in fair combat. Because let's face it, how cool, really, would the move be if they just netted and plasma cannoned everyone in the movie?  What you will find here in this movie is a continuation from the tried and true form of the original two Predators with enough new and interesting mythos to leave you on the edge of your seat. If you are hung up on Adrian Brody as the lead then by all means miss out on a fantastic movie becasue you miss Arnie so much. But if you have an open mind and love the franchise of the Predator then you owe it to your self to own and enjoy and excellent piece of sci-fi excellence.
0756405890|3.0|I gave this book three stars because while i believe this appears to be a great beginning to an incredible series,  this book gave no conclusions to any part of the story and left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth. You should get some sort of reward for reading 600 pages.    The Good:  The overall plot isn't entirely new, but the the viewpoint, unpredictable stories, and 'autobiography' storytelling is.  This along with great character development is what makes this book good.  I love his delivery style.  I will be waiting for the next book to come out.       The Bad:  There where no conclusions to anything in the book.  It was 600 pages of information and background.  The book could have ended just as easily 400 pages in and it would have felt pretty close to the same.  I don't expect and epic battle at the end, but some sort of conclusion to something would have been nice. The villian (kid in university) was a little cookie cutter and appears to be the same that most other books have.    Conclusion:  Wait for reviews on the sequel before reading.  If the sequel comes out and is good then READ THIS QUICKLY and get to book 2.  If the sequel fizzes then you have saved quite a bit of time reading what is really just background to the next book. I would recommend this book to people that have little else to read at the moment (until a review of the sequel can be read). It is very well done you just won't have a full story till the next book.  Read everything from Brandon Sanderson until that time.
0316067938|3.0|Honestly, Eclipse was a lot better. New Moon and Twilight were better. And The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner was soooo much more interesting.<br />Bella gets married. Bella get pregnant. Bella has the baby and gets turned into a vampire. Bella keeps BOTH boys, no more heartbreak. The only sacrifice she makes is the burning, and that doesn't even last as long as normal.<br />And then the fight.<br />Terrible. Completely terrible. I wanted to see something happen. Personally, I wanted Jane's head ripped off.<br />Buy it if you've read the rest, save your money if you don't really care.

B003JYOFIW|4.0|Overall, this strikes me as a continuation Devo album, something I would have expected from then in the late 80s.  The sound essentially is the same, the rhythms and arrangements expected and delivering almost as well as I had expected.<br /><br />All twelve songs are pop, none longer than four minutes.  That unique Devo voice is there, that immediately recognizable Mothersbaugh/Casale sound, still thankfully youthful (despite the clear aging in that very cool rear-panel group portrait).  There's a lot of electronic sound--not necessarily noise--but that unique Devonic marriage of hard guitar chords over electronics a la [[ASIN:B000002KJ1 Are We Not Men?]] and [[ASIN:B003BWQE0E Duty Now for the Future]] just isn't there (you can hear them just starting to wind up in the far background on \\"Fresh,\\" unfortunately just as the song closes out).  The sound is clubby in bass and beat at times (\\"Human Rocket,\\" \\"Step Up,\\" \\"Cameo\\"), and has more than a hint of currently trendy voice manipulation.  In fact, the chorus for the closer, \\"March On\\" could almost be music for a car rental or computer processor commercial.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Fresh,\\" is the most catchy of the album, with a strong and easy chorus.  \\"What We Do\\" follows, and has a good opening hook and vocal. If you're listening to the lyrics, they're saying that those dancing to this song are mercifully going to be the first ones to go.<br /><br />The title track, \\"Sumthin,'\\" with its very, very [[ASIN:B0000JJXL8 Whip It]]-like beat, is as political as this release gets, with a shot at Dubya Bush, the New World Order (a reference now a good twenty years old), and complaints about pundits/angry mobs/fundamentalists/, outlining the current state of post-punk devolution.<br /><br />The package offers no song lyrics, nor detailed liner notes.  You get the bare minimum on personnel and copyright, but the booklet is a wordless tableau of photos centered on that iconic flowerpot hat, now apparently a delicious, sexy, irresistible blast of gelatinized cobalt-blue self-actualization.  It's pure Devo concept, open to any number of interpretations.<br /><br />One thing I was listening intently for is the raw, trembling, nerd-infused sexual drive that made songs such as \\"Pink Pussycat,\\" Triumph of the Will,\\" and especially \\"Uncontrollable Urge\\" (and more) so powerfully resonant.  \\"Please Baby Please\\" (with a percussion opening which instantly reminded me of [[ASIN:B000A2H9NY The Polecats']] \\"Make a Circuit with Me\\") is in contact with the touchy subject, but this song is a plea rather than the direct, earthy, threatening demands of old.<br /><br />Bottom line: we've heard this Devo before.  It's familiar and easy, with no strange departures, with their consistent product updated and tuned to a new consumer demographic.  There's nothing more Devo than that.obalt-blue self-actualization.

0385523912|4.0|A friend of mine working at the American embassy in Beijing sent me this book.  It is six separate defector's stories from North Korea, providing a glimpse into typical lives north of the 38th Parallel from the end of the Cold War, through the death of Kim Il-Sung and catastrophic famine of the late 1990s, to their maladjusted lives of freedom and abundance in South Korea in the early twenty-first century.  It is fascinating, often unbelievable and creepy.  The Stalinist regime is unlike any other totalitarian state of the twentieth century, save possibly Pol Pot's Cambodia at its murderous apex.  Life in North Korea, even today, resembles less a repressive police state than an insane quasi-religious cult, like a contemporary Jonestown, only with over 20 million members and possessing nuclear weapons.<br /><br />Author Barbara Demick writes clearly and simply.  She describes a hidden world of almost incomprehensibly forced devotion -- worship really -- of Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-Il.  She tells how each household is provided an official portrait of father and son and are required to display it prominently and alone on a plain white wall and clean it daily with a special piece of linen provided by the government that can only be used to dust the photo and frame.  All organized religion is banned in North Korea, but the citizens of the People's Republic are provided with their own deity and Christ-like son to worship.  As Demick tells us, \\"Instead of marking time from the birth and death of Christ, the modern era for North Koreans would now begin in 1912 with the birth of Kim Il-Sung so that the year 1996 would now be known as Juche 84.\\"<br /><br />Each morning, after passing signs on the way to school declaring \\"Let's eat two meals a day,\\" school children begin their day with a sing along to a tune called, \\"We Have Nothing to Envy in the World.\\"  The official government first grade arithmetic text book provides quizzes with none too subtle political messages that are sick, but humorously absurd.  For instance, \\"Three soldiers from the Korean People's Army killed thirty American soldiers.  How many American soldiers were killed by each of them if they killed an equal number of enemy soldiers.\\"<br /><br />Demick charts the experience and travails of six characters representing a relative cross section of North Korean society, although they are all from the industrial northeastern coastal city of Chongjin.  However, for me at least, one narrative was most compelling and memorable and insightful, the story of Mi-ran, a young woman with \\"tainted blood\\" thanks to a grandfather who served in the South Korean Army during the Korean War who suffers from lack of professional and personal opportunity in North Korea's already economically stunted society, but nevertheless carries on a secret courtship with a promising young engineering student on the fast track to Worker's Party membership and a life of relative privilege in Pyongyang.  Her story is poignant, touching and, ultimately, uplifting.<br /><br />Even if you have little interest in Korean politics, \\"Nothing to Envy\\" provides an amazing, unforgettable glimpse into perhaps the most secretive and terrifying society in history., but humorously absurd.

B003VIW8DK|4.0|I miss Robert Palmer. I bring that up just to say how grateful I am that Bryan Ferry is still doing his own version of sophisticated dance-pop. OLYMPIA is a brilliant return to form, sexy and assured, from the gorgeous Kate Moss cover (so like those sexy 70s Roxy Music covers, but with today's celebrity gloss included, focusing on her face more than her body) and the diva-esque title, you know Ferry's on his game. \\"You Can Dance\\" even opens with the keyboards from \\"True to Life,\\" and then veers into a darker, newer groove with brisk assurance. Other standouts include the sexy, plaintive \\"Alphaville,\\" the suave and flirty \\"Me Oh My,\\" and the elegant and wistful \\"Tender Is The Night,\\" (the titles are just so Ferry-focused, it's great to hear how in touch with himself he remains). The only cover, \\"Song of the Siren,\\" is sadly a shade too much on the dark side of the 1980s sound, it's just produced about an inch beyond it's natural life (and Tim Buckley and Elizabeth Fraser, both versions surely familiar to most Ferry fans, have already shown us that a stark setting is all the raw song needs), but it's not enough to spoil the mood, which is dreamy, sexy and flirty. File this one next to CLUES, NIGHT and DAY and MIDNIGHT LOVE.

1439181780|1.0|I haven't read this book. I am just sad about what Rhonda Byrne did to Esther and Jerry Hicks. My understanding is she stole the Secret from them and made the whole thing about money!!! She was greedy and deceitful! I would recommend reading Ask and it is Given by Esther and Jerry Hicks. This is where Rhonda got most of her material from.
B0002HN14I|3.0|I'm only reviewing the Williams.  The timbre and intonation are perfect. I love the trills. They are very crisp and clean. The double stops are very nice, clear but not strident. Ms. Hahn has loosened up a bit, it would seem, since her earlier recordings, yet she still plays a little too academically. This is romantic music and should be played more freely. In her recording of the Bach concertos she takes too many liberties, and here she holds back. I would like to hear her play more in the galant or high viennese style. Her vibrato is a bit mechanical, and her phrasing is often counterintuitive as the arpeggios ascend and descend to and from the upper register. I would also like to hear more dynamic variance, especially in the repeated patterns. She's a bit loud sometimes and doesn't have anywhere to go as she breaks away to expand the theme. Overall though, it's beautifully performed, and I enjoy it. It's one of my favorite pieces from one of my favorite composers. There are recordings of better performances to be sure, but the sound quality here is excellent. I can hear her fingers touching the finger board in places. The orchestra seems a bit muddled, but the dampened progressions in the orchestra contrast well against the brilliant tone of the soloist throughout most of the work. The exception would be the lively quaver triplet section in the middle of the piece. I would enjoy a crisper timbre from the orchestra there.

B000JBWWQ0|1.0|Thinly disguised catechism for New Age religion, naive and cheesy.<br />Beautiful scenery marred by supernatural \\"energy halos\\"...<br />Given the silly message, I am glad I never wasted my time on the book, reading it would waste more time than the movie.<br /><br />Adding to the New Age baloney, the movie distorts also Peruvian reality.<br />It portrays Peru in a very negative light, much worse than what it really is...<br /><br />Yes, we know Peru has problem with corruption but the Peru in the movie reminded me more about Dominicana rulled by Trujillo than the real Peru.<br /><br />no wonder the movie had to be shot entirely in Florida and Costa Rica.
1400052173|5.0|It's a fascinating and terrifying tale, reminding us that HIPAA and Patients Rights are very modern things.  It's also a very sad story at times when you realize the extent of ignorance and poverty that still exits in the US, and its devastating effects on a whole family.   The extent of the research, the narrative way it's laid out for the reader and woven together with the personal story of the family is incredible.  I'm so glad that Rebecca Skoot persevered and was the one to tell this story, she was the right one for this for sure.
0780021967|1.0|This has everything I hate about old movies: ham acting, corny dialog, and implausible plotting. The characters in this are about as bland and uninteresting as you could possibly create. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I don't know who is responsible for the weak plot. This is nothing but a chase movie. A murder happens in the beginning, then the main character spends the rest of the movie running from bad guys and having narrow, implausible escapes. There is no gradual accumulation of information in the movie as you would normally expect in a thriller or mystery. The mystery just gets spontaneously solved in the closing minute. If Hitch was a genius, he sure doesn't display it here.

0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Blink shows how  most thought processes in individuals can happen in a split second, like when Vic Braden can decide when someone will double fault in Tennis right before they do it.  Braden had no true rhyme or reason for knowing when it would happen, he has been around Tennis most of his life, but that doesn't mean you should have some type of ESP for when someone is about to do something a normal person could not possibly predict.    Gladwell continues to say that the brain can even be primed to act a certain way without you even realizing it.  Gladwell portrays this when psychologist John Bargh gives a group of undergraduate a test that has certain words that will prime the brain to either be aggressive (with words like intrude, infringe, interrupt, etc.) or polite (with words like patient, respect, courteous, etc.).  They are then put into a situation where they can either interrupt the proctor to tell them they are done or allow him to continue talking to his visitor, over 80% of the people who were given the \\"polite\\" test never interrupted while most of the \\"aggressive\\" students did after five minutes.  The mind is a powerful object that can be molded in many ways.  It can allow a war veteran to win a war game simulation under almost impossible odds; it can also make mistakes about Warren Harding being President.  Even worse, it can cause you to kill a man because you thought he had a gun in his hand, when really, it was just his wallet.    The human mind is a funny thing.  In most cases it will help you understand a situation better or explain things to you before you even realized it was doing it.  Gladwell says \\"And what Blink is - what all the stories and studies and arguments add up to - is an attempt to understand this magical and mysterious thing called judgment.\\"   However, it's not magic; it's simply a lifetime of experience and repetition that leads your mind to fully understand similar situations.  It is the knowledge that you may not even know you have, but it's the knowledge that separates the war veteran from the well informed adversary, the knowledge that allows you to \\"blink\\" and understand.

B003UYUQZW|2.0|I'd love a historical epic set in ancient Persia. Unfortunately, [[ASIN:B003UYUR10 Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]] is just the latest Hollywoodized action nonsense aimed at teenagers. Far from being epic, Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton come across as a bunch of flirty teens, not as a prince and princess. The action scenes are way overdone, with Gyllenhaal's character pulling off some impossible moves. In between the action, there's almost no character development. Perhaps worst of all, even though ancient Persia should be a cinematographer's dream because of the potential for beautiful locales, the sets were pretty boring. The supposed mystical temple was located on top of a grassy knoll. Where are the rolling desserts of [[ASIN:B00003CXB2 Lawrence of Arabia]]? There sadly haven't been many good historical epics since [[ASIN:B000NU2CY4 Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]]], and it looks like we'll have to wait a while longer.
0399536108|5.0|This is a good book for those who are looking to take the unconventional path in any facet of life.  Although the author is taking the unconventional method to travel the world, his ideas can be transferred to any lifestyle.  His goal for himself and the reader is to lead a remarkable life, which is unique to every person.  Great book for those who want to take the less-traveled path to personal success.
142311339X|5.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series. I absolutely loved the first five books and I thought that this new spin-off was fantastic as well. Rick Riordan did a really good job of making The Lost Hero different enough from the original series to be unique, but also made it relevant to the other books. The characters in this book were just as good as Percy or Annabeth or Grover, especially, in my opinion, Leo. The plot did tend to get a little confusing at times, mainly because most of the plot was purposefully kept from the reader. Also, the inclusion of the Roman side of mythology was distracting, but overall, The Lost Hero is a fabulous read for anyone, especially a fan of the original series.

B003PIUBZS|1.0|I'm not a prude, and have nothing against a sex scene that builds and fits the story and plot.  However, I hate gratuitous sex, which I define as that which not only doesn't contribute to advancing the film, but acts as a distraction from the story.  Spartacus: Blood and Sand takes every opportunity it can to show breasts, show complete nudity, and have explicit sex scenes that would earn an X rating anywhere else.  The effect is to come off as very crude.    As for \\"Art-house style\\", the show frequently represents a long duraion of time by showing the the main character running/fighting/etc. in place while running a film reel behind him.  This could be done to speed along the show or to reduce production costs, but I got the sense that it was done for that art-house effect.    All told - a very disappointing effort.

At first, I was going to get it from the library, but when I found out that there were 75 people waiting to read this, I took the plunge and bought it.  Yes, the price is high, but the book is worth it. I love epic stories and can't wait to see how this will turn out. I'm a slow reader and I can't stand the fact that people are waiting for me to finish the book.     Reading it on the Kindle is great....built-in dictionary, and the ability to search for characters if you forget whos who.
0385523912|5.0|Wow, I just finished this book and LOVED it!  I knew nothing about North Korea before reading this, but was always amazed at how they managed to control their people and stay in the dark ages during this vast global electronic evolution.  Thank you for making this about real, personal stories.  My heart is broken for these people.  I had no idea all of this was going on while I'm in my wonderful free country! I find myself google-ing North Korea and reading their latest news now.  This was not a light and easy read, but well worth it.  I will definitely look for some documentarys to watch on this sad, fascinating country!!!  Again, WOW!

It is also a quick read and hard to put down.<br />The explanations for the physics of the universe are the best I have ever read.<br /><br />I find it strange, however, that there was no mention of the mysterious dark energy or dark matter that is unaccounted for. The book is biased towards what we know and presented the material with a level of confidence and certainty that some readers may not agree with.<br /><br />In summary, it is a book worthy of such a grandiose title--a must read and sure to become a scientific classic.

B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon was the first Gene Kelly movie I had ever seen.  It was 7th grade Choir, and our instructor decided we would spend 2 days watching Brigadoon.  As any typical teen, I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of watching some 'old movie'.  Was I wrong.  This movie grabbed my attention in a way I never knew possible.  It opened up my mind to a whole new world of classic cinema and song and I will forever be greatful to Mr. Baklin for showing it to us!  I have since, probably watched this move a hundred times.  The sad thing, is that Gene viewed it as a disappointment because it was to actually have been filmed in Scotland and was eventually decided upon by execs to save budget and use a sound stage!  This does not, in any way, take away from the feel of the film.  Gene and Van Johnson are wonderful as friends with opposite opinions on everything, who actually complement each other.  The chemistry between Gene and Cyd is electric...you don't see attraction like this in movies anymore.  It's sweet, simple and perfect.  The scene with an amourous sheep herder trying to snag Van Johnson for her husband is one of my favorites!  Whether you purchase it, borrow it from a friend, or check it out at the library(mine has it on both DVD and VHS), It is definitely a must-see Gene Kelly movie.
B003UERZ88|3.0|I have to agree with most of the reviews from other people, the lyrics are cheezy, I mean come on, lyrics about racing, bullfighting, boxing....where is the metal in that???? There are though some songs that are up to par with some of the Priest stuff, but not for a Halford album...it was all about metal...where has all that gone. The \\"Nostradamus\\" cd by Priest was a flop as well as \\"Halford III: Winter Songs\\" that album just plain sucked. many reviewers have stated that the new Accept album is great and I must agree with them...that album just plain ROCKS!!!!!!! So buy the new Accept album instead of this, you won't be disappointed.

0307463745|1.0|These guys don't believe in planning. They say it is guesswork. There book is a litany of excuses for the lack of productivity that is endemic in the programmer world.     In their world you never know when things are going to be done. In my world, I give my word to when it will be done and do everything in my power to cause it to be so. If I fail, I find out what I can be responsible for and correct it.     When Kennedy said we will put a man on the moon and return him to the earth within the decade he made a declaration that caused it to be so. Imagine if NASA said there was no point in planning that outcome because it is only guesswork.    I read it cover to cover in a weekend. This wasn't hard as there was a lot of blank space. It was compelling in the same way that the show \\"Air Crash Investigation\\" is.
B003XKPPOU|3.0|I don't know if its the fault of the writer or the director, but it all just felt so mundanely mechanical, so by the numbers, and honestly after seeing a film like Mary & Max, which I know isn't the same type of animation, I can't take Pixar too seriously anymore, even Dreamworks outdid them this year with How to Train Your Dragon.
B003KGBIRK|3.0|I like this movie, but as a cheap crazy horror film, not as a serious film. The acting is abysmal, the accent of one character is so bad, it might as well be Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle. There is no story, the plot twists are laughable and this is one of the most dated looking films from the era. So why do I like it? Because it's an elaborate joke on the audience. It starts out exactly like a TV movie and ends up as weird as Eraserhead. I find it hard to believe that anyone would take this movie seriously. A lot of drugs might be responsible for that sort of reaction.

1400064287|3.0|Made to stick    This book is all about becoming top of mind. How the consumers and general public will remember, you, your company, and your advertise.  The more competition is getting in the world market, the more companies are trying to differentiate from each other and make its points and highlights to world.   The success cases start with something that will stick in mind of people. One case of success in my life I think is Xerox, with their photocopies. The Xerox brand became so famous in Brazil, making the word Xerox to be in dictionary meaning photocopy in Portuguese.  This is a big dream of any marketing personal; the value of company is not only measured by its tangible assets, intangible assets play a big role in company value, too.  Also using some Brazilians examples I remember a gas company called LIQUIGAS. It performed a marketing campaign in the 80's that used a jingle. The jingle become so popular that still today people will chose this company because of its past advertising, which was a very simple, basic that was referring the logo of the company (Blue Dog) and kept repeating it - It is Liquigas, the gas from the Blue Dog, you can trust it. For years in a row they sustained the number one market share position due those ads.  Another case of idea that sticks in the mind but inside the corporation was made by Rolin Amaro, he was the founder and CEO of TAM Airlines, and he would use the \\"Gold Rule\\" to treat the costumers. He was famous to personal great all the passengers in the first flights in the morning, and one time he listened to a passenger talk about how the checked luggage was poorly treated. At the same moment he went to the cargo operation to see it himself, agreed with the client, fired some personal, and he personal boarded the luggage in the aircraft showing to the employees that you should treat the luggage as your own. He created a simple phrase to express his company value: Passion to fly and serve. So until today the airline has one of the best service quality worldwide.  The main idea of the book is to give a guideline to structure the ideas to make than stick; my personal opinion is that those ideas must be created on a natural environment, because most of the labs ideas will not last. All the companies are searching that communication (internal and external) that becomes in the top of our mind. Finding or creating one is the challenge for the success.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I am a huge TS fan and was highly anticipating this album. I love how she mixes and infuses elements of country, pop and even some rock. After 2008's best seller Fearless, I must admit I was skeptical as to how she would be able to follow up with Speak Now, but she did. I'm going to break down song by song and review each song individually soo here we go:    1) Mine- 4/5. The lead single from Speak Now. The hidden message in the album booklet is TOBY, aka Toby Hemingway, the cute guy who stars in her music video for \\"Mine.\\" This reminds me of her previous hit songs, like Love Story and You Belong With Me because the lyrics are hopelessly romantic - \\"You are the best thing that's ever been mine.\\" Although it's really catchy and a hit on the radio, it's not my favorite song on the album, but all you Swift fans would be pleased.    2) Sparks Fly- 4/5. I believe Swift wrote this song a while back and played it live during one of her concerts. Fans eagerly anticipated it on this album and the hidden message is PORTLAND OREGON. Again, like Mine, the lyrics are fairy-tale-like and she sings about kissing in the rain. Catchy, poppy and my favorite line is \\"Get me with those green eyes baby.\\"    3) Back to December- 4/5. So obviously written about Taylor Lautner, the hidden message is TAY. Swift admits this is the first song where SHE is the one apologizing to someone (Lautner) because she broke his heart. Judging by the lyrics, she knows she messed up and would give anything to go back in time. \\"So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.\\" It also is rumored they broke up in December, hence the name of the track :)    4) Speak Now- 3/5. This song is ok, definitely not my favorite song on her album. The hidden message is YOU ALWAYS REGRET WHAT YOU DON'T SAY. So yeah, the theme and lyrics I definitely get and like, but I think there are stronger songs on the album.    5) Dear John- 5/5. One of my favorite songs on the album. Almost 7 minutes long, it's written about John Mayer. The hidden message is LOVED YOU FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY. Although there were rumors Swift and Mayer dated, I didn't believe them because Mayer is a womanizer and I didn't think Swift would fall for his moves. Apparently she did. What's also cool about this song is the hint of blues music, like the bluesy guitar rifts in the background- perhaps another hidden reference to Mayer.    6) Mean- 4/5. Swift goes back to her country roots with this song and it's a hit. Hidden message is I THOUGHT YOU GOT ME. It's speculated that the song is about music critic Bob Lefsetz who criticized her after her performance with Stevie Nicks at the Grammys. Even Lefsetz guessed the song was written about him as well. I guess she got even with him. \\"And I can see you years from now in a bar, talking over a football game with that same big loud opinion but nobody's listening, washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things...\\" ouch.    7) The Story of Us- 5/5. Another one of my favorite songs on the album. This song is written ALSO about John Mayer(!) since the hidden message is CMT AWARDS and she also said she wrote the song right after the event. Lautner and Joe Jonas were NOT at the awards show, only Mayer was there because he was performing with Keith Urban. Apparently they were seated 6 seats away and did not speak. How awkward is that? But then again, it makes for great song writing material. \\"Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.\\"    8) Never Grow Up- 3/5. My least favorite song on the album. It's cutesy and lullaby-like, but I think it's kind of boring, aka I kind of fall asleep listening to it. The hidden message is MOVED OUT IN JULY. Obviously it's about her living on her own now that she's \\"growing up.\\"    9) Enchanted- 5/5. Another one of my favorites. Hidden message is ADAM, referring to Adam Young of Owl City. Although 'wonderstruck' is not a real word, apparently Adam likes that word and Swift oh so cleverly used it in her song. I think they would make a cute couple :)    10) Better Than Revenge- 5/5. So. good. I love when Swift gets angry and bitter because that's she produces some of her best work. But isn't that the case with all singer-songwriters? This song is about Camilla Belle, who stole Joe Jonas away from her. Obviously written about Belle because she is known for her vintage style and Swift sings \\"...that no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity.\\" Need further proof? Swift also sings \\"let's hear the applause, come on show me how much better you are.\\" Another reference to when Jonas wrote the song \\"Much Better\\" about how much happier he was with Belle than Swift. However, Jonas is now dating Ashley Greene so I guess he lost that bet. Oh and the hidden message? YOU THOUGHT I WOULD FORGET    11) Innocent- 4/5. LIFE IS FULL OF LITTLE INTERRUPTIONS. That's her hidden message and I don't need to explain that this is about the Kanye West incident. If you don't know what I'm talking about, google it. This song is ok, I get the message she's sending, that she forgives him for what he did, blahblah they're all good now. So when should we expect to hear their duet?    12) Haunted- 4/5. Not sure who this song is about. The hidden message is STILL TO THIS DAY. Maybe about Joe Jonas since he was her first love? The full orchestra in the beginning sets the stage for this dramatic song and whoever Swift wrote the song about, she clearly is still affected by him.    13) Last Kiss- 5/5. Probably my favorite song on the album. It's about Joe Jonas and the hidden message is FOREVER AND ALWAYS, the name of her track on Fearless that's about Jonas. Swift has admitted she's only had her heart broken once and it was her first love (Jonas). The intro to the song is also 27 seconds long, which is the amount of time it took for Jonas to break up with her over the phone. She also references a July 9th plane ride, where on July 9th she went to see him in Dallas.I don't know why this song gets me, but it does. Maybe it's the way she sings it or the music or the lyrics, or everything, but it's definitely bittersweet.    14) Long Live- 5/5. A great end to an amazing album. The hidden message is FOR YOU and I'm guessing she wrote it for her band and how one day they will look back and remember all of their great memories. People have said it reminds them of her song 'Change,' but I don't hear the resemblance.    All in all, this is an amazing album and I have been playing it on repeat ever since I bought it last week. I HIGHLY recommend it if you are a Swift fan. Let's also not forget she wrote all of these songs by herself and she's only 20. This girl has a longgggg career ahead of her. So for all you haters, get used to her because girl is not going anywhere.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I enjoyed \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" slightly more than the first novel in the series.  On the positive side, the action starts much more quickly than in the first book.  The pacing is also better overall, with less focus on political issues and behind-the-scenes issues regarding Millennium magazine.  The book also adds some interesting background to Salander's character (most of which cannot be revealed without massive spoilers).  I'll also give small kudos to the book for bringing attention to a worthy issue - the trafficking of sex slaves, although I've seen this topic handled on several police procedural television shows, like \\"The Wire.\\"<br /><br />On the negative side, the book simply did not focus enough on the two main characters - Salander and Blomkvist.  Instead, much of the investigation is conducted by numerous interchangeable police detectives and even several researchers from Salander's old employer, Dragan Armansky at Milton Security.  These characters aren't memorable at all, although Larsson tries to inject them with a few broad characteristics.  So many pages are wasted with these minor characters debating Salander's guilt and murmuring that the case makes no sense.  These characters are constantly perplexed by Salander's seemingly disjointed nature...\\"How could a girl so small like Salander be so vicious?\\"  Yawn.  Likewise, the character of \\"the giant\\" (as he is known through most of the book) was rather ridiculous.<br /><br />As with the first entry in the series, this novel also could have been shortened and tightened up quite a bit.  Some of the secondary characters could have been combined, along with much of their meandering and repetitive musings about Salander and \\"the giant.\\"  The biggest disappointment is that Salander often disappears for large chunks of the book.  Again, better editing would have solved this dilemma, as her absense really doesn't create much tension or mystery.<br /><br />My ultimate question for an entry in a mystery/crime series is whether I am tempted to purchase the next one.  As soon as I finished \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" I immediately downloaded the next book onto my kindle and watched the movie version on my roku.  Larsson clearly has done some things right with this series.  I just wish that it had all been edited better!ether I am tempted to purchase the next one.

B003XL6EKS|4.0|I honestly can't complain about how this CD turned out. For some reason it isn't quite as hardcore as [[ASIN:B001FWRZ46 Day & Age]] or [[ASIN:B000GY729M Sam's Town]]. I just don't think there is as much guitar. But Magdalena (track 7) and Only the One (track 2) are great additions to Brandon's resume; in addition to the other tracks, of course. But you have to give credit to the fact that he wanted to keep the music alive while the rest of the band members wanted to take a break. I am going to see his live show in a few weeks, and I am more than excited. Plus Crossfire (the single) is in my top ten play count, so I must like it!

0061433047|5.0|This is the fourth book in the Tiffany Aching series set on Discworld. Tiffany is THE witch of the Chalk- the open farmlands outside of Ankh-Morpork. As the witch, most of what she does is birth babies, tend to the sick and poor, and ease people as they die. It's messy, dirty work that is unpaid except for potatoes, hams, old sheets to make in bandages and an occasional pair of old boots. Because witches can't be paid, and most of the people of the Chalk are too poor to pay her, anyway. On Discworld, being a witch has little to do with sparkle and wands and much to do with human need.<br /><br />Tiffany is (almost) sixteen, and is almost as mature as she thinks she is. She's tired all the time and scarcely stops to eat. When she tries to take a day off to attend the scouring (a country fair on the Chalk), of course things go badly- she ends up tending to a 13 year old young woman who's father has beaten her so badly that she has miscarried. Tiffany helps her by taking her to the Feegle mound to be tended to by the kelda of the Nac Mac Feegle, a woman- a wee tiny woman- who has the art of the soothins, the easing of emotional pain, leading to misunderstandings with the girl's family. Then the old Baron dies, with Tiffany in attendance, and she finds her self accused of murder, theft, kidnapping and of doing black magic.<br /><br />Tiffany has a couple of enemies, supernatural and human, but they aren't the only problems that have led to her troubles. She has brought some of her troubles on herself, and this can be harder to deal with than the spirit of an ancient witch burner who has been roused from his long sleep and is set on destroying her. Tiffany doesn't understand people nearly as well as she understands fire and magic, and her behavior has made it easier for people to turn against her when the spirit triggers their prejudice.<br /><br />It's a novel about growing up, about letting go of preconceptions, about understand the first thoughts and second sight, about catching the words that people almost say but don't dare to. I love all the Tiffany Aching books, but this one is my favorite. In between the slapstick humor of the Nac Mac Feegle and the magic flying broomsticks is a lot of psychology and philosophy and some musings on what constitutes magic.<br /><br />A lot of people have said that this is the last Tiffany Aching book. I do hope not. She is my favorite Discworld character, and there are a lot of plot threads left untied at the end that could launch several more novels of witching life on the Chalk. Well done, Mr. Pratchett, you have created the most believable witch in literature.that people almost say but don't dare to. I love all the Tiffany Aching books, but this one is my favorite.

B003EV6DBW|4.0|It's very clear from the first episode of this series that new producer Stephen Moffat wanted to make it VERY clear that this is no longer the Russel T Davies series that people had grown to know and cringe at. Pretty much everything has been changed and this is for the better.    We start off with \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", showing our new hero, our new TARDIS, and new companion in the form of Amy. The story itself was reasonably interesting and the execution was ok. It wasn't anything really great, but it was a solid start, and I loved seeing glimpses of all the previous Doctors (except, tellingly, number 10).    From there we go to \\"The Beast Below\\" and get the impression straight-away that perhaps Davies is back. There wasn't really anything great about this episode. It wasn't horribly offensive, but it was a bit twee and very lacking. I did enjoy the Doctor's moral choice at the end, but that was about it.    Then we arrive at \\"Victory of the Daleks\\". I do like the \\"X of the Daleks\\" title, which reminds me very much of the old school episodes. I also liked some of the performances. What I didn't like was the story, which was rather dull, and the resolution, which wasn't much of a resolution at all. It felt like two episodes crammed together and it didn't really make sense.    But then we get to two of the best episodes of any series, \\"The Time of Angels\\" and \\"Flesh and Stone\\", featuring the return of the Weeping Angles and River Song. It's everything the series should be; moody, atmospheric, interesting, and featuring wonderful moments of tension, like Amy walking through a crowd of angels with her eyes closed. Fascinating viewing!    After that we have another \\"meh\\" episode in the form of \\"Vampires in Venice,\\" which features vampires. In Venice. It is what it is. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't great.    Then, however, we go onto \\"Amy's Choice\\", which was far more interesting than it should be and had an ending that reminded me strongly of certain events from \\"Trialof a Timelord\\".    Sadly after that we go onto the two very mediocre Silurian episodes, \\"The Hungry Earth\\" and \\"Cold Blood\\". Everything about these episodes was wrong. The Silurians didn't look at all like the original ones (this is hand-waved a bit, but still), the plot is rather pointless and the ending didn't work for me at all. It was a real low-point for this series.    Things pick up, however, when we get to \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\", which is a story more beautiful than it should be, containing some excellent performances and a genuinely moving scene at the end. For me this is the story that really MADE this series of the show. I was entirely happy!    As we move into the endgame of the series we stop off at \\"The Lodger\\", where we see the Doctor playing football and going down the pub. It's a nice, fairly light-hearted piece, and I really liked it.    Finally we get to \\"The Big Bang\\" and \\"The Pandorica Opens\\", where we get at least something of a resolution to some of the ongoing plot points with this series. River Song is back, as is... well, pretty much everyone. The Daleks, the Sontarans, the Cybermen, the Silurians... basically everyone pops by to say hello and goodbye. While the story doesn't quite reach the level it wants to, it doesn't fail from a lack of trying.    Overall the series as a whole was quite good, and I'm looking very much forward to the Christmas special and the next series! Bring it on, guys!
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  This is truly the ultimate fan service for anyone who loved The Rocky Horror Picture Show!  The 1080/24p remastering is astounding.  Most of the movie looks like it was filmed this year.  You can see immaculate detail.  The color has been improved, and some of the costumes in the film pop out in startling fashion!  Some scenes (particularly the criminologist scenes) do seem a bit soft, but for the most part the film looks perfect.    The 7.1 surround sound mix is just crazy good.  The songs sound deep and sharp, and you'll notice several nuances you never heard before.  I've never heard the movie sound this clear.  One thing I did notice is that the songs seem louder than the rest of the film, however.  Also, \\"Over At The Frankenstein Place\\" has a minor flub, as a different take of Susan Sarandon's vocals was used.  It's not super-glaring, and it doesn't sound bad (despite what other reviews say) but hardcore fans will definitely notice it.  The mono track is the same as the original film.    The special features, sadly, are nothing to shout about.  The Blu-ray still contains both the US and UK version of the movie (the UK features the song, \\"Superheroes\\"), which is a real treat.  Further, you have the option to view either version with the alternate opening.  This film was originally intended to be in black-and-white up until the \\"Time Warp\\" scene where it would burst into color (like The Wizard of Oz), but back in 1975 it was too expensive to do and it was never released this way.  Now you can view it like this if you want, and it's selectable from the main menu as opposed to being an Easter Egg like the DVD version.    The packaging is just beautiful.  It comes in a glossy book containing some great pictures and quotes from the film.  The disc is on the inside back cover in a recess.  It truly pays homage to this classic film.    As for the movie itself, well, if you're buying this set you probably already know what it is.  At the time of its original release the movie was a huge critical and commercial flop.  But over time it's become hugely popular and currently holds the honor of having the longest theatrical run in film history!  The film is a rock opera about two unsuspecting lovers who stumble across an old castle inhabited by a transvestite mad scientist, his servants and his creation (a blond muscle man).  The songs are actually really great, and despite the loose plot, this is one of the most entertaining films of all time!  Highly-recommended!
B001FB55L2|2.0|I am amazed with some of the reviews I've read stating the casting in this movie was spot on, now I don't mean to knock Tobey Maguire as an actor but in my mind he does not fit the description of his character one bit, that's the first thing I have a problem with in this film. The other thing is the plot of the film, this had the potential to be a really great movie if they had of made it more about Jake and Natalie's characters becoming more romantically involved without the audience knowing Maguire's character is still alive until much later into the film. Instead it became more about how Maguire's character deals with life after being tortured in Afghanistan. Anyway that's just my opinion.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I started watching this movie by myself as my husband said he wasn't really interested.  He wasn't captured by the brief synopsis I gave him.  However, I stopped the movie after an hour or so and then watched it from the beginning the next morning with my husband half watching to begin with.  He was suddenly captivated and he watched the whole movie with me, in awe.  We really did enjoy this movie a lot and it was extremely well acted, produced and directed. It's all about Temple and how she dealt with her autism in her teenage years and got recognised by a science teacher when in boarding school when she was about 13- 18. She sees things in pictures and is a genius. She went on to university and studied Animal Husbandry then graduated with a MS and then got her Phd. She sees inside the minds of animals, especially cows. Check it out. It's an amazing insight into the mind of an autistic person and how smart they are. It helps you accept people with differences and it helps you see how people like her have really had to struggle to get anywhere in life and be recognised. And they have to deal with what life throws at them. I feel as if this is mandatory viewing for all as it helps to strip away stereotypes and free people from ignorance. Outstanding performance by all the actors. Lots of sentimentalism but nothing slushy or shallow. Really well done.
B0038Z5T4Q|4.0|Good movie, good quality DVD, it is an older version so a little fuzzy but good movie.
B000002OXU|5.0|There is much debate on the Internet about the best sounding version of \\"Who's Next\\".  No clear winner that I can tell.  So, read up and be informed but don't expect a guarantee.  Because, it doesn't exist!    That being said, I vote for the older Gold Master Sound MCA version.  I bought it on Amazon 'used'.    It wins over:  Newer remastered versions by Jon Astley  Remastered versions by Steve Hoffman (American or Canadian)  I have all 3 and in a 'sound off' the MCA gold was victorious!    No decision:    2010 Shm-SACD Japanese version.  Reviews have been questionable, so I have not bothered.  Mobile Fidelity Gold version (1999) - from what my research revealed, there was no decision between this and the MCA gold version.  I found a much cheaper MCA gold than what was available in the out of print MoFi version. As I am happy with the MCA version, I am unlikely to explore the MoFi one unless fate intervenes.    The quest has ended for me for now.  I am happy and sonically satisfied.    But with the ever changing audio technology, who knows who's next?
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What an amazing writer Stieg Larsson was. I think I am going through &#34;withdrawals&#34; after finishing the last book in the trilogy and knowing there will be no more.
B000000IR7|5.0|Sound is a very subjective thing.  I just had to add an opposite perspective here to what another reviewer wrote recently.  In my opinion, and to my ears, this is the best of the many Mobile Fidelity Gold discs that I have.  While 'Crime of the Century' is not my favorite Supertramp album ('Even In The Quietest Moments' is, then 'Breakfast In America'), the outstanding quality of sound in this release actually elevates it to better anything else I have on MoFi gold. In fact it is so good, I don't think SACD could improve on it.     For me, the ultimate proof of sound quality is when I hear things I have never heard before in a recording that I am familiar with.  The instruments are clearer, the sound stage has incredible depth and the music just has more drama.  In fact, it is this latter observation that is most important.  This is Supertramp's most dramatic album, their tightest concept and now I can see why it is the favorite of so many.      As I have just acquired this 'used', it is new to me.  With time, it may take the top spot.  It may also be that recent equipment upgrades to my stereo have made it possible for me to enjoy the nuances added by a superior Mobile Fidelity gold pressing.  If you have the kind of system to hear the subtleties, this is recommended without hesitation.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I have been a fan of The Black Keys since their most recent album was \\"Rubber Factory,\\" and own all their full-length albums, from \\"The Big Come Up\\" to this one.  \\"Brothers\\" contains some of the funkiest material I've ever heard from a rock band, and I particularly enjoy \\"Sinister Kid\\" for that reason.  In fact, I like every single song on this album.  It is worthy of the praise it has been receiving.  In conclusion, buy it!

0891419063|5.0|My father was 19 years old when he hit the beach at Peleliu with the 1st Marines, K Company, 3 Batallion, 5th Regiment (K35-The Old Breed)as part of a 50 cal water cooled machine gun crew, along with Mortarman EB Sledge. He also hit the beach at Naha Okinowa Easter Sunday.  He would NEVER talk about the war.  While I was attending USAF Air War College in 1992 we were studing WWII in the South Pacific and I mentioned my dad's participation. A classmate said he thought he had a book about my dad's outfit and brought in \\"With The Old Breed\\"...I read it that night cover to cover.  I called my dad the next day and described the book, and I only wish I would have recorded what he said.  He started talking about what happened there like it was last week, not 45+ years before!  I called EB Sledge and had the honor of talking with him about the book and told him the affect on my dad.  He said that it took years of prompting by family and friends to write the book because he knew there were so many like my dad who would not talk about how bad those battles were...and that the affect the book had on my father was further payment and satisfaction that he had done the right thing. My father was actually inspired to join the Old Breed Organization and he made contact with old friends...my father had a work accident and later died of his injuries in 1996.  I am so glad I read this book and sent it to my father, and I just purchased another one to send to the son of another Old Breed member.  It is indeed a classic epic of history thanks to EB Sledge.

0783116934|4.0|Citizen X, 1995 film    The story begins at a railroad station. A man walks away with a young girl. Later a man tilling a field notices a skull. In 1982 Rostov-on-Don a body was found. An official orders a search of the area for identification clues. Eight more remains are found! All had multiple stab wounds from a frenzied attack. The forensics official tells the committee of a serial killer. One doesn't think it is possible. [Unconscious humor?] What does the investigation need? The killer picked up a young girl and lured her into the woods for an attack. A detective looks for clues. A suspect confessed to the crimes. There is another murder. The detective wants an expanded search, and contact with the FBI in Quantico for expert advice. This request is impossible for political reasons! The killer strikes again. A new prosecutor will take over and aggressively pursue known homosexuals (because of boy victims). Doctors and surgeons are also watched. What about policemen?    The killings continue. The police hunt for clues. Suddenly Burakov sees an older man with a young woman and questions him. Chikitalo is arrested. [Intuition?] Bondarchuk orders his release because of his status. One prisoner commits suicide. Burakov's words are quoted out of context. Does he need a vacation? [Yes.] Does Bondarchuk have a secret? The Colonel knows it. Burakov wants a psychiatrist to help. Then another body is found. Bukanovsky will help, and produces a profile of the criminal. There is a big political change in the Soviet Union in 1990. The new General will help Burakov in every way. Every train station will be visibly guarded, except three: these will be watched by an undercover policeman. One policeman saw a suspicious man and questioned him. They search the woods and find a body. It is a relative of that policeman!     Chikitalo is arrested and questioned about abrasions on his body. After five days of interrogation he promises to talk, but they get nowhere. The psychiatrist talks to him about his profile, and what was done to the victims. Murder turned him on. He confessed. As elsewhere, the relatives of the victims protest in anger. Chikitalo led detectives to three more undiscovered bodies. He was tried for 52 murders, convicted, and executed.    This dramatization is based on certain true facts. Some of the events and characters were fictionalized for dramatic purposes. This was filmed entirely in Budapest Hungary. They said there was a difference in typing the blood and semen of Chikitalo and that was why he was released earlier. Could it have been a mistake in processing?    This unusual case made world news. This serial killer operated in an area where he could find travelers who would be willing to go off with him for a promised drink. This killer traveled a lot , like Ted Bundy or the \\"Green River Killer\\". They were all caught because there is always a mistake, as simple as muddy shoes. The examples of corporate bureaucracy ring true. Its who you know that can be more important that what you know. I think the actual story is more complex and can only be reported in a book. This movie is based on \\"The Killer Department\\" by Robert Cullen.
1427208476|5.0|This is one of the best books I read (well, I listened to the audio CD's) in quite some time.  I laughed, cried and was horrified (again) at the thought of the inhumane treatment of fellow human beings.  It never hurts to remember our past, realize how far we have come and how far we have yet to go!!  I highly recommend this book.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|This movie is terrific. Really fun. Not as good as the first one, but definitely worth buying!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Obviously the trailer, and the fact that it is a Tarantino movie, made this look like it would be Kill Bill, meets WW2.Unfortunately, it was both better, and worse than I expected. After seeing it in theaters, I was very disappointed. The acting was easily some of the best I've ever seen, however the reason I went was for the Basterds, who were barely in it.<br /><br />Watching it the second time, I knew what to expect and I could appreciate it for what it was, however it could have been even better, had Brad Pitt and the gang been in this movie more.Here are some pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:Perfect acting. Nice special effects. Great characters.Decent story.<br /><br />Cons:Long, drawn-out soliloquies. Not enough action.<br />Fantasy WW2 story made me question why this film was even made. I mean, I get that there are a lot of great fictional history stories, however including Hitler in such a un-historical way, took me out of the movie a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie, and worth owning just for the acting alone.
B003XRZZFM|5.0|i have never been more concerned about an up coming album then this one right here. and its not because \\"ics vortex\\" got kicked out ( that dude was a d bag and it was time for him to go) but i was worried about how it would sound without their great synth/keys player mustis. mustis wrote a alot and arranged a good portion ov dimmu's musik and his style was perfect for that band. i was mad that he is gone. back to this album, i compared it to the pryer album in sorte diaboli and as far as the musik goes ABRAHADABRA is much better! they hired an entire orchestra to compensate for the loss ov mustis ( thats how good he is) and had guest vocalists do select clean sections on certain songs ov the album. now one huge controversy is the female vocals on the track GATEWAYS... she does sort ov a witchy shirek which i had no problem with thought it fit the song well, and then later again with an almost cradle of filth like clean part where she and shagrath were alternating lines. i though the song was awesome and is one ov the best on the album. but the highlight for me is the track DIMMU BORGIR. this song is epic! and it combines every aspect that this band has incorperated over the years as becoming one ov the best bands the genre has seen. now i am a HUGE black metal fan, its my favorite genre. but im not however one ov the knobs that call themselves   TRVE or KVLT, those dudes are idiots. listen to the musik. you can NEVER sell out black or death metal its impossible. just because dimmu is bigger and there albums and shirts are more readily available does not mean they are a sellout or bad band. now granted i prefer bands like BURZUM, EMPEROR, DARKTHRONE, and IMMORTAL i consider these the best bands in the genre especially burzum... but i will also listen to dimmu, i like them a lot!! this album is a must buy for any fan ov dimmu borgir. the best thing this band does is make songs sound epic and larger than life and  this one sounds like a titan!! five stars awesome album
B0000214F0|1.0|It was so boring, I had to fast forward through a lot of it.    If you're wondering if it's sexy, the answer is no.   Is it even worth watching for camp value?  Again, no.  I am so glad I only rented it.  Otherwise, I would have enjoyed chucking into the dustbin where it belongs.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|One thing is the series, Battlestar Galactica is by far the best series I've seen of this incipient century. Another thing is this product. Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] has everything a current or a soon-to-be fan of BSG needs to experience once again the worn out visual style, the entanglement of the plot, the incredibly natural passing of events and the cliffhangers in every single episode. And of course, the characters: what a great acting! What a great cast!    Personally, I never had the chance to follow the series on TV, so when this pack came out, I just had to buy it. I watched the complete series in less than a month and I can recommend this to every fan of sci-fi. Wait a minute, if you are not into sci-fi, it's ok, I'm pretty sure you will love BSG anyway. It has political intrigues, a lot of action and fighting, lawyers drama, medical drama, moral ambiguities, religious fanaticism, philosophical contrasts and a strong background storytelling.    Summary for fans: Buy this, it has everything but \\"The face of the enemy\\" webisodes.  Summary for newcomers: Buy this product, hopefully your life and the vision of the world around you will change, for better, for ever. If not, it's almost sure you will not regret.
1400064287|5.0|Book review of Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die    Nowadays, there are more and more ways of sales promotion and creative TV advertisements are still critical ways to promote commodities. A successful advertisement should be well remembered by people. Therefore, to make a popular TV advertisement, advertisers have to find ways to make the content of the advertisement attractive and get their ideas to make a difference.   Made to Stick is a good book to teach people how to make creative advertisement since it told people how to make their ideas sticky. It concluded that there are six elements of a sticky idea, including simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. And according to the author, it's not necessary for the sticky ideas to have all the six characteristics.   I agree with the author's opinion since many popular advertisements I know actually do have some characteristics above. For example, the advertisement of \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" in China does make use of several principals of them. The name of brand means \\"farmers' garden\\". \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" is a brand of mixed fruit juice drinks. It's well known slogan is \\"shake before drinking\\". With its vivid TV advertisement and simple slogan, \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" successfully makes people impressed of its product.  In its TV advertisement, at first, a boy and his father both dressed in beachwear were purchasing beverage drinks in a store. Then, they saw a poster of \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" that read, \\"Nongfuguoyuan, shake before drinking\\". So the boy and his father raised their hands and funnily shook their body with the beautiful saleswoman staring at them strangely. At last, there was a sound saying, \\"Nongfuguoyuan is made up of three kinds of fruits, please shake before drinking!\\" and the boy and his father walked farther with shaking their body.  The advertisement is so creative and clearly expresses the feature of the product. The core of the advertisement is to \\"shake\\". It's simple, concrete and easy to remember. With the simple word \\"shake\\", it vividly tells customers that the juice is mixed with three kinds of fruits and you should shake it to be better tasty before drinking. It also indicates that the drink is healthy and nutritious since it is a mix of three kinds of healthy fruits.   Additional, the advertisement uses emotions to get people being interested in it. The story that the boy and his father misunderstood the meaning of shaking before drinking makes the advertisement more interesting. By watching the funny performance of the boy and his father, people will feel happy and relaxed.  If \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" didn't create an interesting and simple as above, instead, it struggled to tell people it was a mix of three kinds of fruits and it was so healthy. For instance, it used some reports of professional nutritionists to demonstrate how nutritious it was. It wouldn't be remembered by so many people like today since it would not be so sticky in that way.   Therefore, \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" makes use of at least four principals of Made to Stick, including simplicity, concreteness, emotions and stories. With these elements, \\"Nongfuguoyuan\\" expresses its idea creatively and makes it remembered by customers.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|Remastered \\"early\\" albums sounds horrible. That is not \\"The Beatles sound\\" - robots plays and sings it, not the real men.  Sound is clean, rhytmic, balanced, spacious, have more details and I like it at first, but after a while I've noticed that the sound is absolutely DEAD, like the synth.   Albums were not only \\"remastered\\", but remixed and completely RE-DONE, \\"digitaly syncronized\\". They played without errors - only computer can play like that, there is no personality of  real yound musicians.   Compare old records and this \\"remasters\\" directly and you will understand, what I am talking about. It is scary and sad.
0061122416|5.0|I am not a guy who reads a lot but for the first time in my life I finished reading an entire book in less than 12 hours and that book was \\"The Alchemist\\".  This book is not only a novel but contains some serious truths about life and morals. It helps you to see your dreams in a different perspective and motivates you to fulfill them.     If you want to know more about personal legends, dreams, wisdom, life, love, goals, God, a Shepard boy.....you have to read this book!
0393312836|5.0|Certainly the most violent book I've ever read, there is statutory rape, multiple armed robberies and assaults, and forced rape within the first few chapters. However, don't let that discourage you from reading this book. Burgess artfully crafts a unique slang which starts out confusing, but the book is so engrossing that you'll find yourself using the terms he creates in your own mind. This printing includes the final chapter that was omitted from the movie. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it definitely adds to the book, and you can choose to ignore it if you so choose. This book most certainly deserves to be called a classic, as it is really quite excellent, though not quite as impactful in the long run, I think, as other similar books such as 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Still, if you're looking for an entertaining read that has more substance than your average modern novel, this is a good book to turn to.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|After many rave reviews from friends, I was eager to see this.  Following their advice, I watched it alone in a dark room late at night.  I expected to be transported to an alternate world, completely free from my everyday concerns and believing in the experience of the moment.  This happens for me in rare, great horror films, like Blair Witch, Exorcist, the Haunting, etc.  It is special treat, if it sometimes disturbs my sleep.  Well, this film completely failed to scare me or even draw me in, which was a great disappointment.  I couldn't get myself to believe it, the details did not cohere into any kind of vision, and the acting was amateurish at best.<br /><br />I agree with viewers critical of this as a clever marketing phenomenon.  There simply isn't much there.  When you contrast this to Blair Witch, you see the deficiencies.  BW builds slowly into a terrifying climax.  You believe in the characters completely and with empathy, even if the actors are unknown, and every detail seems to fit into a vision of terror and some unimaginable power that is beyond the normal world we understand, all with the simplest effects.  Though it is not explained, a coherent explanation is implied and can be imagined.  PA has none of this.<br /><br />Not recommended.

B003F3NDWG|4.0|With so many investigative/forensic cop dramas around, there is no dearth of procedural murder cases. So the networks tend to hang their hats on spectacular-looking lead characters who can string out the season by dint of sexy banter and the exchange of longing glances. It helps if there's chemistry. CASTLE's winning formula rests on the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic. But the writers can only draw it out for so long, that romantic tension between the roguish best-selling novelist Rick Castle and the no-nonsense homicide detective Kate Beckett. And maybe I do feel a bit let down that the show in its second season ends up catering to that old recipe of let's almost bring them together only to yank them apart, nyah nyah. Yes, that's what I'm focusing on. Not the weekly murder mysteries (which are mostly never that gripping anyway), not the interesting supporting cast, not the show's humor. It's all about: Can Castle and Beckett just please get a room? No? Okay, *sigh* sign me up for Season 3.<br /><br />Rick Castle's pull with the mayor allowed him to shadow NYPD Detective Kate Beckett as she goes about solving mysteries. But the fact that Castle's fertile writer's imagination lends him a different perspective and insights into the cases, it's this knack of his that makes the 9th Precinct tolerate him (plus, it didn't hurt that he donated that fancy cappuccino machine to the precinct). Except the way the last season ended, the thought was that Castle may have finally stepped over the line. As Season 2 opens, Beckett is still cheesed at Castle for his poking his nose into Beckett's past, specifically into her mother's fatal stabbing. But Castle's exile from the 9th Precinct is resolved in the first episode (and the simplicity of how it's resolved is very cool), and so the Beckett-Castle crime-stomping team is back in business. For Kate, however, in a later episode, there would be a bit - just a little bit - of closure regarding her mother's murder (in the episode \\"Sucker Punch\\").<br /><br />Okay, just because I was waxing all rhapsodic over the two lead actors, it doesn't mean I don't appreciate the supporting cast, a bunch of engaging characters. Detectives Esposito and Ryan (a.k.a. \\"Honeymilk\\") seem really fun to hang around with, and these two jokers provide the workplace levity. But my favorite supporting actor is Molly Quinn who is so good at playing Castle's too-good-to-be-true teen-aged daughter Alexis. I happen to think that those father-daughter moments between Quinn and Fillion are almost as key to the show as the flirtations between Fillion and Katic. Castle may foster this charming grown-up kid act, but he takes his parenting responsibilities seriously, and this lends him some needed credibility.<br /><br />This time around, the series writers get 24 episodes to work with, and they play out several plot threads. Of course, there's the above-mentioned cold case centering around Beckett's mom. Castle's racy new creation, Nikki Heat (inspired by Detective Beckett), gets more run and Castle's book about her is even being optioned into a film. But then Castle gets a three book offer to write the continuing adventures of a certain British spy with a license to kill, except how is that going to affect his ride-alongs with the precinct? Things really heat up when the detectives hunt down a serial killer who leaves taunting clues to \\"Nikki Heat\\" (as he insists on calling Beckett) and the FBI takes over the case. These Feds are ramrodded by a frosty female profiler whom Castle declares is the federal version of Beckett (in the suspenseful two-parter \\"Tick, Tick, Tick...\\" and \\"Boom!\\"). To my disgust, the show even introduces a new prospective love interest for Beckett.<br /><br />Other episodes I liked: \\"The Double Down\\" features the detectives and Castle partaking in a little wager to see who can first solve their respective cases; On Halloween Beckett and Castle bump into New York's undead community (\\"VampireWeekend\\"); Beckett and Castle make an appointment with Lady Irina's House of Pain in \\"The Mistress Always Spanks Twice\\"; \\"A Rose for Everafter\\" has Alyssa Milano guest starring as Castle's lost love; and our guys tangle with an agency that immerses its clientele in fantasy espionage experiences (\\"A Deadly Game\\").<br /><br />One of the cool conceits of CASTLE is the ongoing cameos of celebrity authors who tend to regularly sit in on Castle's poker nights. It's a personal thrill for me because I read guys like Stephen J. Cannell and Michael Connelly.<br /><br />Also, it's nice to see that that fancy cappuccino machine is still going strong.<br /><br />Five DVDs comprise CASTLE - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON, with the following bonus material: a CASTLE Starter Kit which informs you on what you need to know, going in into this show; \\"On Set with Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas\\" has these two fun-loving blokes give you a tour of the show's set pieces; \\"On Location with Nathan Fillion\\" as he introduces various of the show's crew members; \\"Manhattan's Most Unusual Murders\\" is a behind-the-scenes peek at the production team's process of staging the show's murders; three deleted scenes (from episodes \\"Deep in Death,\\" \\"Vampire Weekend,\\" & \\"The Mistress Always Spanks Twice\\"); bloopers & outtakes; and two music videos: Hayley Blue's \\"Here Kitty Kitty\\" and Sky Blue's \\"Threshold\\" (from the episode \\"Famous Last Words\\").

B00004WIDR|4.0|I don't know why people are so down on this movie. First of all...it's hard to create the awe/wonder of the first film simply because it WAS the first film...it was new. But this movie is very entertaining. Yes it has it's flaws but it has that Spielberg stamp of the old serial movies...that trailer sequence in the beginning was great. And someone mentioned that the actor playing his daughter (Vanessa Chester) wasn't good...I really disagree. I thought she was great...just like a kid. And the scene when she wakes up to T-Rex...I thought that scene was so realistic (the look on her face) that it jolted me out of the 'movie hypnosis' feeling enough to think, 'she really looks like a regular kid that is terrified!\\" I did not like Julianne Moore in this movie. She and Jeff Goldblum had no chemistry at all. They SHOULD have brought the kid's mother into it somehow and had HER on the island (don't ask me how...this is the movies, they could make it work). Now THAT would have been interesting...more tension and interplay. Jeff Goldblum's character is as cynic as ever. Loved him. I give it 4 stars because I didn't like the 'bringing the dinosaur into the city' plot (although the Japanese tourists running away from T-Rex (Godzilla) was a nice touch. AND the movie sign advertising Arnold Schwarzenegger as King Lear...who the heck thought of that piece of sarcasm? As if!).  It's worth a rent or buy.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is an unusual story of a teenage girl who must care for her depressed mother and younger siblings after her dad supposedly dies.  Problem: the bail bonds guy and police don't believe he is dead, so she has to try to find him and prove whether he is alive or dead.  If he is still alive, there is another problem: their house will be seized and they will be left to die in the cold hills of Missouri, where life is rough and the citizens are unforgiving.    Great performances by Jennifer Lawrence and the others.  Good soundtrack and foreboding locations too.
B00000892G|5.0|I almost never , if ever, give anything a 5 star review, I tend to be very honest in my reviews, so trust me when I say that this is a true 5 star album. This is not just the best Virgin Steele album, but one of the best metal albums of any band of all time, better than the best ouput of the gods such as Maiden, Manowar, Priest, etc.<br />Metal has always been uplifting, but this album will make you want to go out and conquer a small nation when you are done listening to it.<br />VS have been called \\"the thinking man's Manowar\\" , but that is like comparing a GED to a PHD, VS are simply in a league of their own altogether when it comes to songwriting and compostion.<br />This album is killer from start to finish , with each song having it's own uniqueness and memorability, and ZERO filler.<br />The only improvement could have been a bit better production, other than that this is metal perfection.<br />Yes , it's THAT DAMN GOOD !<br />If you don't own this, BUY IT NOW, before any new release of any other band. This album should be a MANDATORY part of any true metalheads collection.
B003LR4QPE|4.0|Like the former reviewer, I was waiting for the original edition to become affordable.  After listening to multiple interpretations of the cantatas, and coming back to Rilling after quite a few years, I find his realizations interesting, valid and good. Naturally,one has to bear in mind that they are far from the authentic style.  The other groups were also sampled, and the instrumental and orchestral music is excellently performed, again remembering that the orchestra does not play on authentic instruments. The keybord works are interpreted, for sure, in line with the best.  The only serious drawback is poor hard-copy documentation, and to get the names of the soloists in individual cantatas one has to go to the cd-rom.

B00275EGWY|1.0|Speaking as an Army Infantry veteran of both OEF and OIF, I am compelled to submit a movie review for the first time ever because of how incredibly bad this film is. The best part was the end - because it was over. How anyone could compare this film with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is beyond me. As war movies go, it's more like \\"Delta Farce\\" or \\"In The Army Now\\" - except that those films are more realistic than \\"The Hurt Locker.\\" Anyone who thinks this movie is an accurate depiction of today's wars is completely ignorant and must be either a civilian or a pogue. There were SO MANY errors relating to uniforms, weapons, vehicles, equipment, and especially to tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) that I couldn't suspend my disbelief even for a moment. Here are just a few of the most ridiculous items: An E5 punches an E7 and it's no big deal, an E7 accidentally shoots his E4 while they're on a wild goose chase alone with no comms - and doesn't receive UCMJ action, 3 dudes in one gun truck go out alone over and over and their crew-served weapon isn't even manned half the time, a little dried blood on the rounds \\"jams\\" a .50cal, a patrol of infantryman abandons their vehicle with sensitive items inside and a weapon on top and gaggles in a courtyard in order to hide from a scary IED - not pulling any kind of cordon or security, and by the way almost no one had ACU's in Iraq in 2004 - except for everyone in this movie, and don't even get me started about when the guy goes outside the wire by himself in ACU pants and a hoodie and doesn't end up getting his head cut off on Al Jazera highlights. Are you kidding me? Was there even one Army combat soldier assisting production on this film? My privates could have advised them better than whatever clowns they were using. I can't believe this movie won Best Picture; I will never again give any credence to the Academy Awards. Finally, I think the unbecoming behavior of most of the soldiers depicted in the film, especially the team leader, reflected poorly on the US Army and makes me wonder what the hell the filmmakers were thinking. American should get down on their knees and thank God the soldiers in their Army do not behave like the \\"heros\\" in this terrible movie. It \\"hurts\\" me to give this film even one star.
0525951652|5.0|Being a fan of Ken Follett's books, I was excited to read his newest novel, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Fall of Giants starts just before WW1 and draws you in through it's characters. Mr. Follett characters come from different walks of life and different countries, giving many views of how this war effected different classes and different countries. Through their eyes the reader is able to be drawn into true historical events and see just how this war was able to bring about so many changes to the world.<br /><br />Being home sick with the flu I was able to read this book in two days and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes historical novels.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I already own this DVD series but wanted to buy this one for my sister-in-law.  When I received it, it was clearly a fake!  It looked like the pictures had been photocopied and some of the pages in the back were not even in the binding! Also, all of the individual DVDs were in plastic bags?!  And to solidify my suspicions, included in this DVD collection (that was released prior to the first movie) was a picture of Carrie from the first movie!  That same picture is different in my real collection.  The only positive is that when I contacted the seller with my findings and requested a refund, she obliged with no questions asked (after waiting 3 days for a response though).
B004A7UVLC|4.0|This rendition of Sherlock Holmes based off of the books, stands to be just as good or even better than the old series of Sherlock Holmes. 'Sherlock' has an allure, intrigue, the weird, deduction, and obviously the unique friendship between Dr. Watson, and Sherlock Holmes. The actors are really befitting of the roles they play, and definitely draw you in with the uniqueness. Sherlock is creepy smart, has near perfect memory and is more observant than a watch dog. Watson, is slow, but loyal, curious and courageous and warm. I have to also say, that this series is never boring. This is a most definite watch!

Why? The church does not wants to let people know the true origins of Christianity. Its bloody origins and its bloody past! I would recommend that people see this movie and enjoy the peek into the past. Then you should discuss this movie and try to make sense of it!    Note:   At the moment that I am writing this note, 2 individuals have not liked the review! Why? Because it is against their religion! The truth is the truth! History can be adorned but not changed.

I'm not too far in, but the boredom factor is taking over fast, and skimming ahead isn't encouraging me to pursue it. Doom and gloom without a glimmering of the ordinary, let alone humour, isnt' my cup of tea. For all the time spent on the characters' thoughts, they don't seem to come alive. A story needs to grab the reader and get moving faster than this one is doing. The political set-up is not exactly original - feudalism and women as concubines, wives or quasi-nuns - even for 1965. SF had been doing that for decades, and Herbert doesn't seem to have added much to it. But apart from that, it's the flat, verbose, pretentious writing that really irks me. Herbert reads like he's some undergraduate who's overdosed on the more miserable philosophers.     Back to the shop for this one ...
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I did not go see this movie in the theater because of all the bad reviews, but I did just see it on Netflix and I loved it.      I'm sorry I waited so long.  I understand what the other reviews are saying and maybe its not the deepest story line but it still touches on some real issues.    I particularly enjoy when Miranda and Charlotte discuss the challenges of motherhood.  It always seem to be men who need and get a guilt-free break from the \\"wife and kids\\" but women never seem get to say that they need a break from the \\"husband and kids\\" and what's worse....I don't think it is even expected that we too need a break.      I know that Samantha's bout with menopause was blown a little out of wack, but that is what made it funny.  I did not find it to be a knock on ALL menopausal women....I don't think women need to be that sensitive about what our bodies are going through.  So relax....it's funny....    As far as the over the top fashion....well...its SATC...isn't that one of the things we love about it?    I love the series and enjoyed the first movie very much and I will say I enjoyed this one just as much!
0525951652|3.0|I was looking forward to the historical nature of the novel and eventually the trilogy, but put the book down after only 100 pages or so.  I thought the characters weak, the plotting poorly developed,  and the writing pedestrian.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|Just what my 8 year old wanted. Got it for him for bringing home a good report card. He absolutely loves this movie!
B0042AEOG0|5.0|M.C.C. \\"MERRY CHRISTMAS II YOU\\" This is the best christmas album I have ever heard.<br /><br />The album starts with you hearing an interlube of \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town\\"<br />Then goes into dance to you drop \\"Oh Santa!\\"<br /><br />on the 3rd track Mariah gives her all in beautifully done version of \\"O Little Town Of Bethlemhem\\" this song is done with the music of the \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" which has a new twist on a classic song.<br /><br />4th track is another Mariah writin' Classic \\"Christmas Time Is In The Air Again\\" this is a soft sang song that some people may not like much. I believe that the soft singing fits the song. It's suppost to be soft sang.<br /><br />Track 5 a classic Christmas song The First Noel and Mariah puts a little something at the end of the song by remixing the Born Is The King part.<br /><br />\\"When Christmas Comes\\" a lot of people and Critics think this is the best song on the album it's another Mariah Carey writen Christmas Song.  If this song doesn't get you into the Christmas Spirt nothing will...<br /><br />\\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" first off this doesn't at all sound as if you're listen to a classic christmas song. Mariah turn this into a dance song and will have you singing this version over and over.<br /><br />Charlie Brown Christmas I love it you'll love it...  Who didn't love Charlie Brown Christmas and this will bring you back to that moment.  I love how she did this song.  I can't believe she put it on the album, but she did and I glad she did.<br /><br />O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus this in my opinion is the best song on the album. Mariah Carey and Patricia Carey, wow you in this Amazing version of this classic Christmas song...  Mariah's MOTHER Patricia shows the people just were Mariah got her beautiful singing voice and is wounderful. This song made me cry cause I love the Lord Jesus that much and Mariah Carey puts all of her Heart in this song.<br /><br />O Holy Night[Live] okay first off this is a low point on this album not because Mariah Carey doesn't sing well or it ain't a good song it's just this is no different then O Holy Night on the first album with clapping. But I don't know but it doesn't even sound live. It sounds like the album version.<br /><br />One Child is a great song and this is another Mariah Carey writen Christmas classic which now bring me to believe Mariah Carey could write and sing her own Gospel album.  Mariah tells the story of Jesus Christ in this song and it is so beautiful.<br /><br />All I Want For Christmas Is You this is another add of an old song by Mariah Carey and it didn't need to be on the album. I believe she could have put something else instead of this one.<br /><br />Auld Lang Syne???  Now if I didn't tell you this was the New Years Anthem you probably wouldn't know that.  Looks like someone has been wasted on New Years Eve....  Mariah know the words to this song???  I think??? Does anybody know the words to this song...<br />Okay as for the song it is an uptempo dance style version of Auld Lang Syne...  You feel like you're in a club<br /><br />Well there you have it Merry Christmas II You and over all I gave this album 5 stars... Because it really was 11 song album and with 2 songs that shouldn't have been on it.  Other then that I don't have any problems with this album.<br /><br />this is a perfect holiday album and you will love it all through the year.<br /><br />M.C.C.

B002VECM6S|5.0|a heartwarming movie, one of the best i have seen in a LONG time, bought the dvd and watch it all the time, family movie
B001GWK2MC|5.0|I bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday party and it was a huge hit. I was worried at first about the weight limit but I had several children ages 2-5 jumping in it all at once. THis is a fun addition to a party and fun for your child to just have at home. Perfect size for indoor fun, such as in a basement or playroom.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|Great ending to the series - a must for any committed Lost fan. Special features are very interesting!
0374531943|5.0|Fantastic book.  Especially enjoyed his insight into the suits and EVA's.  If you are a child of the space race years, this book will definitely strike a chord with you.  If you are not, it is still a fascinating and very insightful book.
B00005KARK|5.0|I purchased this movie (Disney's \\"Dumbo\\") as a gift for my little niece and nephew.  It arrived in good time in a well-padded envelope - very  nice!  Wanting to make sure it would be perfect, since it wasn't brand-new (but close!), I opened it and watched it.  No scratches on the disc and it played wonderfully!  Thanks very much! :)
B002I6251G|3.0|While this albums has a couple decent songs, it has lost the emotional sensibility that is emblematic of \\"The Back Room\\" and \\"End Has A Start\\".   The songs are soulless, cold, and mindless at times.  I was a bit disappointed and find myself turning it off halfway through and popping in \\"The Back Room\\" which never gets old.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|The Bluray arrived withing a few days of placing the order, way before the estimated arrival date. Happy daughter!
0739384198|5.0|These books are that popular for a reason.  NY Times bestseller lists for over a year for each English version.  They are well written, although I'm listening to the English translation.  The characters are real.  The story holds together.  The mystery is well crafted.  The whole thing really works as an adventure, mystery, story.  It also has as its theme the victimization of women, as happens all over the place.  Men are not victimized by this.  It took my second listening to identify all the victimizations, as they are so commonplace in our society, even women don't recognize them for what they are.  You also end up learning a lot about Sweden, as it's not like England, France, the US, or Germany.  And you get that flavor as well.  There are few books where I turn around and read them again, but this trilogy was one.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Great Great Show! I laugh out loud all the time. I own each season on DVD. Jim Parsons is awesome as Sheldon Cooper.
B00472NZDQ|5.0|Like a good royal customer who had tasted great meals, and Connelly rarely disappointed, I'd been eagerly waiting for the release.  Got it on Kindle few weeks after the hardcopy release in the US, then dived in to it.  Like many, the fact that we'd waited so long, we didn't want it to end quickly, yet pages turned and turned until the end.  Michael Connelly treaded well in the court room drama, a central theme to this book, and while showing Bosch in transient. With Connelly's narrative, you wouldn't have to know legal mumbles jumbles to enjoy it.  Nonetheless, I was looking for more actions on Bosch's side of things, to be honest.  A little light for him, the focus was much more on Mick Haller.  I look forward to the next Bosch novel!
0891419063|5.0|Very moving book, great service on my order.  It was in better condition than I expected and was delivered very promptly.
031603438X|5.0|Evreryone is Different,that is why there is only one Keith Richards!Some people like \\"Life\\" while others do not think to highly of it.One review comes to mind,that the book did not cover certain events in detail.Well, it was not written for that one person or two or three,It was written for ALL.There were 5 original members in a group and in 1962 they became \\"The Rolling Stones.\\" If Keith Richards were to cover every item that happened  He would have to at least write a book with 42 volumes covering each year...So Far.He was voted out of the 100 Guitarist in Rock 'n Roll as #10.As a Rock 'n Roll performer, I would say that He is #1.The Book is what its title reads; \\"Life\\" and that sums it up.Thanks and Praises to Keith Richards!
B003YUC2FE|1.0|I bought this set so I could use the digital copies on my laptops and keep the blu-rays safe for viewing on the TV.  The set did not have activation codes for the digital copies, and so I can not use them.  I tried to use Disney.com help but they have no pictures of what the activation code looks like. Tried the help line but their hours are very limited. I did a search online and found nothing but other people complaining about not getting activation codes with their Disney movies also.        Do Not buy this item unless your just looking for the DVD's and Blu-rays.  In fact from my internet search I would say don't buy any Disney DVD or Blu-ray if your hoping to get a digital copy.    Disney made sure I had my Magic Code to enter my points online but somehow couldn't get the activation codes in there.  Do a search for \\"Disney digital copy activation codes,\\" and see for yourself.  Once the box is open you won't be able to return it.
1416583432|5.0|Anyone who has any interest in dogs and every dog owner should read this book. It is the best analysis and balanced study of any piece I have ever read about these creatures who share a bond with humans probably more than any other animal on earth. I give five starts to Ms. Horowitz for a great piece. Brian
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I have really enjoyed this purchase.  I wasn't able to see most of the fifth season on TV.  It was mailed promptly as promised and in perfect condition.  In fact, I got it a day before promised.
B0016MZFXS|1.0|The clock was purchased as a gift for my Grand-daughter.  Product arrived D.O.A;  dead batteries.  I replaced the batteries with fresh ones, and after considerable tinkering and bad language, got it to display the time.  Nothing else.  Fortunately I read some German, since the only English is on the outside of the box. Nothing resembling English in the instructions.  Poorly made, and a great disappointment.  Worth about $5.00 if it worked.  The only good part of the experience was Amazon's return policy:  It went back that same day.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Speedy delivery. Clean well, maintained packaging, very reasonably priced and excellent viewing. A very good purchase and product.  This is the beginning of a 10 year tv series and only shows the quality acting in its infancy. Very true to the comics I grew up with in the 1950's.
0446569895|5.0|I laughed quite a lot when reading this book as Ozzy could have made it as a comedian as well as a musician. It is quite amazing after all the abuses that he tells in the book that he is still with us, hopefully book 2 will come out soon also!!
0312600844|3.0|The dilemma with a book so greatly hyped is that one has to contend between facing a potential let-down when it's found to be over-rated, and never quite knowing if the hype was justified if one never actually read it. I chose to read it and am now in throes of mild regret over lost time when I could be reading something else. Still, it was a useful exercise if only to come away with some idea of the current literary taste/pulse of the reading public. Suffice it to say here that if book choice represents a reflection of readers' interest/desire for self-knowledge or an expression of vicariousness, then self-absorption and a certain brand of narcissism appears to be well and alive in the contemporary and almost quintessentially American character and ethos. The old plot line of familial dysfunction has been milked often enough to be unutterably trite but I suppose that is Franzen's metier and cash cow so-to-speak. Unless readers are interested only in judging for themselves what all the hype was about, I'd suggest that they pick something else - derivative theme notwithstanding, Franzen writes well but so do many other authors with a lot more interesting things to say.

0142001104|4.0|The \\"void\\", the \\"space\\" is there to enable creations of our own. It empowers us as activists, achievers. The book hands us tools, methods that will empower us in terms of our conceptions and actions. It reminds us that we are not subject to them , on the contrary we are masters and rulers of our perceptions and actions. It lays out basic and strong methods to raise ourselves upon our pre-conceptions about ourselves, about the being around us and create new ones that will serve us, benefit us and transcend our limitations. It reminds us the continous universe of possibilities that await to be chosen and to be created by \\"the creator\\". But it also reminds us the responsibility of this massive universe of possibilities. Each possibility will be missed unless the actor realizes it, recognizes it, acknowledges it and finally creates his own conditions of being.
B003OMPMAO|5.0|I thought the book was great, read through very quickly wish there were more in the series.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Not normally my kind of music but Lady Gaga rocks! Purchased it after hearing Bad Romance - had not heard any of the others.  This is a double CD and love all but a couple from the whole CD. Great dance music. I normally listen to pop rock, Celine Dion, James Blunt, Leona Lewis, etc. Buy this CD - you wont be disappointed.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|it's a very great purchase and a great movie it comes with 4 souvenir postcards and a 24 page booklet an amazing letter from president roosevelt to the white house and all packeged in a very nice leather themed box and the delivery was even before the initial time !!!!
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This movie was shipped to me so quickly! It was in pristine condition - and I love it!
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Body Language was a big let down for me, after VERY good albums like Light Years and Fever.  This album is worlds better than BL.  More catchy/rocky songs.  But still no stand out hit songs on Aphrodite that are on a par with 'Can't get you outta my head' as far as songs that grow on you.<br /><br />Sadly all the good non-US albums/artists don't get serious airplay on US radio  due to the popularity, gimmicky, Madonna copycat  artists  who are forced on us by the music industry. So, sadly I don't expect to hear much from this album on radio.

B00275EHJG|3.0|I love the Pixar films.  Especially Toy Story 1 & 2 but this franchise is getting stale.  While Toy Story 3 was enjoyable, it was also overly predictable and had a few trying moments.<br /><br />I hope that Disney/Pixar decide to let this be the last of this series and leave it be.  I think any additional movies would take a way from the others.

0553805371|1.0|Stephen Hawking and I were born only a few days apart. Thus we have lived for the same number of years. Being also a scientist it is amazing to me that over my lifetime I could not find a single physicist who could define what they mean when they talk about a \\"particle\\". Nonetheless, they seem to ALL have an intuitive \\"basic understanding\\" of what a \\"particle\\" is; or else they would not have promulgated \\"wave-particle\\" duality or that a \\"particle\\" can follow ALL paths from A to B; even by moving backwards in time.    The fact is that all the REAL successes of quantum physics, since its inception in the late 1920's, have been obtained by solving Schroedinger's equation without worrying about the relevance of the Copenhagen interpretation (shut-up and calculate). The Schroedinger equation always renders harmonic wave amplitudes as answers. It is an elementary high-school fact that the phase-angle of a harmonic wave can only change continuously with position along a direction in which a wave-front is moving. And this change can only be linear.    This means that the phase-angle of a harmonic wave cannot change in the manner mandated when using Feynman's paths-over-history approach. In the latter case the phase-angle is allowed to change \\"freely\\" with position: In other words it is used as a fudge factor so that one need not take cognizance of the boundary conditions which are actually determining the physics. For example, the latter method allows a coherent, harmonic wave to follow a circular path. This is physically and mathematically impossible since there exist no boundary conditions whatsoever which allows such movement.    Thus any physics based on Feynman's paths-over-history is NOT based on harmonic wave-amplitudes, and, since Schroedinger's equation has been so successful, this indicates that the paths-over-history approach is pure virtual reality. It is probably similar to using ASCII code to create violin music: The results might seem good, but it is not physics since the harmonics of a violin is not generated by ASCII code. Thus to use this approach to model the origin of our universe is most probably just blowing hallucinatory bubbles in the sky.
B003EYVY04|2.0|I am also very very disappointed that this ultimate editions do not have the extra minutes that 1 and 2 have.  That is the only reason I purchased them because I too have bought them in regular movie, blu ray and now extended and I just spent 60.00 for the same movies 3 and 4.  I can't even send them back because I will be deducted half of the cost of the 3rd movie because I opened it before I found out it was not extended.  Very very disappointed.
B0008ENIAC|4.0|\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a bit strange in all its twists and turns but it gives Joan Crawford a great platform for her acting talents.  She plays several types in this film and it works.  Starting out as a poor beleaguered housewife, earning a few dimes selling baked goods, her first husband dallies with a fem fatale neighbor lady.  Though hurt and playing a victim she moves on to be a successful restaurant owner. She is strong and authoritative as the manager of several restaurants.  As Mildred, Joan also plays a grieving mother as her youngest child dies of pneumonia and her selfish oldest daughter Veda Pierce (Ann Blyth) uses her mother to get monetary gains.<br /><br />Mildred is motivated by her spoiled and only daughter's self-centered wants, but it drives her to become independent and wealthy.  All the men she has relationships with have issues that cause her grief.  Her first husband, Albert Pierce (Bruce Bennett) is a failure at work and cheats on her with the blond neighbor lady; her best friend Wally Fay (Jack Carson) is always trying to get her in bed though he helps her in business matters;  and her second husband Monty Beragon (Zachary Scott)  is another playboy and a gold digger.  He takes her money and part of her business as well as an affair with Mildred's daughter.<br /><br />Mildred is obsessed and dependent on the approval of Veda to the point of highest sacrifice.<br /><br />Overall the movie reveals a weakness many parents have and may teach a lesson on spoiled children.  Joan Crawford carries the movie with a standout performance, and the cast as well.
0375842209|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it was well written and the story is gripping. Excellent price as well.
B001VNB54A|4.0|Overall I was pleased with the series. Like many other reviews I too was disappointed only because I was expecting something more along the lines of BoB. With that aside, The Pacific was a very good series. It tells of the hard times the Marines had, the suffering they went through, the sleepless nights for fear of the Japs might sneak into camp and cut your throat. If you are expecting another Band of Brothers, it isn't here. If you want to watch a good series about the War in the Pacific, this is it.
0545265355|5.0|This is a great box set of really awesome books.  I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the trilogy!
B002ZG974M|4.0|If you've seen the previews, what you see is what you get. Babies is a look at four different cultures, four different places and four different babies. The \\"story\\" begins with two babies fighting, then moves into \\"A Few Months Earlier\\" and the Namibian mother's very pregnant belly and her rubbing brick dust into her skin. The film then moves on to each of the babies first hours after birth, slowly following each family as they live their lives, one developmental step at a time.<br /><br />Most of the time it's just the babies on the screen, the parents are usually not present and most shots are of the babies interacting with their locations and life. Each of the babies and families have all sorts of unique situations, animals, toys, hygiene, clothing, and it was fascinating to take a peek into the different cultures. I can tell you that I'm glad I gave birth in an American hospital and that I had access to diapers after taking a peek at Africa and Mongolia.<br /><br />There is very little talking, and if there is it is mostly background noise. Many, many adorable shots of babies dealing with life fill the hour and a half, and some shots were so cute it was totally worth the slow bits. If nursing mothers are an issue be forewarned that nursing is part of the film. One mom even squirts milk in her baby's face then wipes it off along the lines of the standard mom spit bath thing.<br /><br />Slow moving but sweet.
B0034G4OWM|1.0|So, my friend has a review on here, too, and she felt that my original review was too short and not explanatory enough as to why I hated this movie, and my kid didn't think all that much of it. I said, Well, we'll watch it again with the five year old I'm sitting, and I'll get back to you. I'm back, and here are some of the problems with this movie - and I am not writing it as to what I like or dislike as an adult, I am writing about it as a parent. Big difference. Firstly, this is so badly written, and it makes the fatal mistake of kids' movies - as far as I am concerned - of making the characters and even the animals if not flat out mean, as characters you won't really care about. The animals are all very generic - there's a raccoon, a skunk, a bear and alot of birds with gastric difficulties, and they go after Brendon Fraser's character, Dan, because he works for a company that is going to take them off their preserve. The movie opens with the animals - live action, by the way, and they don't talk like in most films along this vein -, running a boorish, cigar smoking loudmouth over a cliff, car and all. The five year old watching this with my son and I the second time never cracked a smile, and asked about ten minutes later, \\"Did the guy in the car get out okay?\\" Either make it cartoonish humor, like \\"Roger Rabbitt\\"  did, showing that the guy suffered a couple of lumps on the head, etc., or don't put it in. Okay, the movie then goes on for ninety minutes about these animals making Brendon's life miserable; they bang on his window all night, lock him in an outhouse, etc. etc., and it is greatly the fault of the writers, but none of it's funny. Brendon is a jerk, his son and wife are borderline cardboard, and everyone else in the movie is, yes, now the word 'mean' works. Even a young girl, thrown into the script because there was nothing else to come up with, is a smart-mouth for no discernable reason, and I'm lookin' at the clock, it's only halfway over, and neither my kid nor Heather are laughing. Other reviewers note the 'cheap' look - it's a right on the money description, and the other problem is that nothing seems to follow the thread of the movie from beginning to end. There's a couple of thought balloons dropped in over the animals' heads, and then that's it. I think that this would have been so much better had the animals spoke (but then again, they talked up a storm in MARMADUKE and I didn't care for that one, either), or even parodied their own behavior, again, like Roger Rabbitt. The only time both kids laughed was at the dream scene, and it was cute, clever and - about forty seconds long. And so, that's why I gave this movie one star, and if I didn't make that clear in my first review, my apologies. But I stand by that first review as a parent, and I didn't like the snippiness of the characters, the fact that everybody was either already a jerk or on their ways to being jerks, and I didn't like the fact that it didn't make it's target audience - little kids - laugh. At the very end of the movie, after the words \\"The End\\" are on the screen, there's a short clip of an owl getting his fortune told (Don't ask). The owl listens and then voices his opinion of the reading, in a human voice - Heather looked up at me and said, \\"Now why didn't they make all the other animals talk? That would have been funny!\\" Exactly. Now, Amy, will you pleeeaassse Facebook me?????er my kid nor Heather are laughing.

That said to Whitney Houston I am not going to go track by track because everyone who wants to buy this cd has. This soundtrack in my opinion confirmed what I felt about her but after this know for a fact she is THE VOICE. No other female artist after her(I mean no one either in her current state also)has the soul,power,passion and range that she brings consistenly. The Bodyguard Soundtrack is her at her very best.

B00008972S|5.0|West Side Story is my favorite movie of all time. I know every word of every song, etc.  If there could be only one movie in the world for me to own, it would be WSS.  I haven't watched this video yet, I'm saving it for the right moment when I have a WSS attack and have to watch it no matter what.  These moments come along every few years. When the time is right, I'll know it.  I have to own this movie to feel complete.  I know I can watch it whenever I want to because it is in my movie drawer in my own house.  Enough about me...either you love this movie with all your heart, or you don't.
B003VANOFY|5.0|My friend had the previous generation of wired headset from Logitech, and based off his opinion I ordered these.  I had been having issues with my previous surround sound headset while playing games online.  I was really surprised with the sound quality over my previous head set.  All my online friends commented on the clarity of the new mic, even though I hadn't told them I got a new headset.  The mic flips up out of the way and mutes itself when in the up position.  This is good because the range on the microphone continues to transmit all the way to the bathroom on the other side of the house.  The foam padding is very comfortable and the headset is light weight.  I can wear it for a couple of hours before I begin to notice they are on my head.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I love this movie and the sender Movie Mars is awesome, I am quite pleased with both
B002SR3T10|5.0|This Album is made by A band known for its sort of \\"Medival\\" and \\"Victorian\\" as Well as \\"Baroque\\" influences. That Certianly Shines here With Songs Coming from such time periods as well as today (although the music from today sounds as if it could be from such times). And While there is a version of the album without the live disc I reccomend getting this version simply because the live disc is far to supurb to pass up. Ian's Jolly old English flute plays some unforgettable nots and makes you wish you were'nt living in these hard times!
B003YHSE7W|5.0|This movie did not disapoint, it was everything you'd expect.I would reccomend you to buy this one it will be a classic movie  just like the first Iron Man.Robert Downey Jr was fantastic. Enjoy!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|WOW...that's all I can say.  I've been waiting for this one to come out on Blu-ray for quite awhile...and I can truly say, it was worth the wait.  Finally, this movie looks like it did in the theater...the colors, details and clarity are amazing...This movie has never looked good on VHS, Laserdisc OR DVD...Finally Blu-ray does it justice. Kudo's to FOX for giving this such a nice treatment. I just bought my copy and watched it all the way through...was only going to watch bits but got caught up all over again in the magic. I even put in the DVD and jumped back and forth to compare...and there just wasn't anything to compare...the Blu-ray blows the old copy away.  Just watch the scenes of Do-Re-Mi or the Church Wedding scene and be amazed by what Blu-ray can do...the details in the church are stunning...every detail from the carpet to the candles and gold backgrounds just stand out perfectly...looks as close to the print I saw in the theater last year as I've ever seen...For all those that think only new movies can look good on blu-ray, just look at how wonderful this 45 year old movie looks!!! If you have any doubts about this one...Don't...Run right now and pick it up...you will be glad you did.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|I was absolutely delighted to find that \\"The Walking Dead\\" was available through Amazon Video on Demand. I purchased the first episode last night and watched it with no problems on my Roku.<br /><br />This episode was fantastic - good pacing, good characters, and a surprisingly sympathetic/human protagonist. So far, the show appears to be more than JUST about survival, which is essential to a successful drama. However, the action segments were also exceptionally well done, as were the zombie effects. This is definitely a show that warrants continued viewing...
B001AQO3XS|3.0|while the movie should go without saying. wonderfully done movie. Immortals going thru time to win the prize........no spoilers here...take their opponents head or have yours taken. No problem with the movies content its the lack of respect for this piece of art! Dr No which is over 20 years older IS high def. This doesn't look any better than the VHS I own. The DVD looked like a direct transfer from the VHS and this is no better. The sound is canned no way near the 5.1 listed.    Save your money if you have the DVD no need to get the BluRay it has nothing to offer.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|This is very faithful to the comic, but even aside from that, this was a very well done episode.  The effects were great, the acting was good, and a lot happened in a single installment.  Great job!
B001P829VY|5.0|Fantastic film!  Unless you are a soul-less capitalist, you will probably like this movie.
0307386171|4.0|On the surface this is an account of a couple's first night of their honeymoon. McEwan brilliantly evokes the period, 1962, from the dinner in their honeymoon suite served by two Dorset young boys to the tensions building up to their first sexual emcounter. Edward and Florence both have very differnet reasons for being apprehensive and not surprisingly it is a ...! McEwan, elaborates on the background to their relationship whilst continuing the narrative in the present. Ths short novel was beautifully paced and voiced but I was left feeling that all too often writers choose difficult and negative subject matter, much like in McEwan's Saturday and most notably in Cormac McCarthy's The Road and it would be refreshing if these gifted writers wrote on something with more humour and joie de vivre. Nevertheless, the reader does get a wondreful perspective of the the conservative sexual repression which was still very much the norm on the cusp of the sexually liberating attitudes which had taken over ten years later.
6305511055|5.0|3 Days of the Condor is one of the best movies I've seen.  I'm happy to have it in my DVD collection.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm not really a big fan of Star Trek (I never saw the original TV series), but I did watch this '09 reboot with an open mind. After it was all over, I felt good about it. The movie is pretty fair: it wasn't great, but it wasn't really that bad. The story may have been eclipsed by the action, but the action itself is pretty neat: the confrontations between good and evil were mostly fun and intense to watch. The special effects are nothing really new, but they look impressive and fantastically detailed. The characters are likable, the old-school sets are cool, and the dialogue is never downright corny. The biggest problems I have with the film are nothing big. The music isn't very memorable, the actors' performances are somewhat stale, the cliches in the story was almost annoying, and the stereotypes are sometimes distracting. Still, this 2009 reboot of Star Trek is fun and fairly satisfying. I don't think I'll ever be a devoted fan of Star Trek, but that does NOT mean that I hate what's on here. I still like the movie (as well as some classic spin-offs).<br /><br />Grade: 6.5/10

1400052173|5.0|I heard of this story after hearing the RadioLab podcast from WNYC and I was intrigued. The tragic-heroic story of Henrietta Lacks and the immortal life of her cells, but the continuing brokenness of her surviving family members instantly fascinated me.   Rebecca Skloot has done an amazing job of telling Mrs. Lacks's story in a human way, a story which so deserves to be told. I find it incredibly fascinating, how Henrietta Lacks, a woman from an incredibly poor and humble background, became a modern day Eve. Although she didn't know, the cells that came from her cervix, basically from her womb, in turn have given life to so many other people in the world through the treatments and inventions created from them, but tragically, to little benefit to her surviving immediate family. What an amazing story. Here's a link to the RadioLab piece - it was beautifully done and you can hear Deborah Lacks as well.[...] Thank you Rebecca Skloot for bringing a wonderful portrait of Henrietta Lacks to light.

0345505387|1.0|I was disappointed with this book.  I am a real Outlander fan, but I have to say this book is a real disappointment.  The characters didn't match the discriptions in the book, in my opinion.  I thought it was weak at best.
B003VIW8DK|3.0|I'm a big Bryan Ferry Fan.. I think Boys and Girls and Bete Noire are my favorite things he's done. I was happy to hear some   material on Olympia that reminded me of those works and I'd say about half the CD works for me. There's a handful of tracks that  just seem trite and the lyrics seem like they wrote a song around a semi-clever title they liked, but the writing is uninspired.    Most of all I'm highly disappointed by the production and mixing on this CD. It's flat sounding, no dynamics, the clarity and punch just isn't there. And his voice is buried in the mix. There's no excuse for this given the tools they have today as well as the talent Bryan has at his disposal. Older CDs like Boys and Girls blow this CD sonically out of the water when I play them next to each other.     I'm still a big fan and this overall is one of my favorite CDs he's put out in a while. I just wish the production, recording and mixing wasn't so... blah.    Nevertheless, I still recommend the CD because if you like Bryan's music, there's no substitute. Just like Sade.. there's only one of them doing what they do and nobody else sounds like them. Rock on Bryan :-)
0553805371|2.0|I am not a scholar or a scientist.  I do know some about mathematical models and all the traps you can run into when claiming that the model represents reality.  What the Grand Design claims is that philosophy is dead and replaced by physics, specifically cosmology.  This modern physics is based not on direct observation (the stuff they are modelling are too small or too big or too far away to observe directly) but on mathematical models that can explain the indirect effects of the cosmos that we humans can observe.  You can match some mathematical model to any set of data if you make the model complex enough (like assuming ten or eleven dimensions instead of the more logical three or four).  This complex mathematical modelling in my book is not science, it is philosophy (an explanation (model) of the cosmos that cannot be observed and tested).  The problem with calling these models scientific is that science implies a level of observation and testing that has not (I think cannot) be accomplished.  You may believe in M-theory, I might limit my beliefs to direct  observation, someone else might believe is theology.  None of these beliefs can ever be proven and it is all philosophy.

B003UYV08E|5.0|Ironman 2 is fast acting, fast paced story.  Robert Downing, Jr is a creative actor, he IS Ironman.  plus he has beautiful eyes.  RDJ makes his character real.  Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic as Pepper Pots.  She plays her part well, very well.  Personnally, I enjoyed the first Ironman more.  \\"What happened to Butterfingers?\\"  Mickey Rourke was excellent.  He always plays his characters well.  For you Ironman fans, get Ironman 2, you will not be dissapointed.  ENJOY the movie.  :)
0440241901|4.0|I picked this book up from the back flap description.  It's a light read, funny - some parts laugh-out-loud funny.  I read it fairly quickly while waiting for kids at pickup from school, and it was easy to slip right back into reading it, even with short sessions.  Probably chic-lit at its best (though formulaic I'm sure) with a happy ending, of course.  I loved the premise that the main character spilled her secrets during a terrifyingly turbulent flight - I can relate, being a nervous flyer myself!  How these secrets come back to haunt her is the funny part.  I would recommend it!
0399156577|4.0|I am a 26 year old female and this was my first Nora Roberts read. I got the book from a friend of my grandmothers, so it is safe to say I was happily surprised when I started reading! I enjoyed the book alot finished it in under a week. I also really like dogs so I like that they played such a big role in the story. Also being from Washington state, I live on an Island close to Orcas it was kinda fun to read a book and know what all the places look like that she writes about. I will be getting my hands one more of her books, I like the thilling romance stuff!
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This is an optional device which may be helpful if your TV has poorly accesible HDMI ports or you have a a stiff cable that wants to go its own way. This device which has adjustable male and female ends might be your answer. The male end adjusts in two planes, the female end in one plane. For most many users this might be an unnecessary accessory, but if you need it, it seems to work fine.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|This is one of the first R-rated films I think I ever watched.  But that's not important.  What is important is the film: it is amazing, incredible, unique, beautiful, adventurous, risky, deep, and everything else that makes a movie great.  This film does so much that was different in film-making at the time: bullet-time is almost a staple in films and videogames, and we have this movie to thank.  The story is so original, the writing so impressive, the characters so real, the themes so deep.  Everyone should at least watch this film once, just to appreciate what the Wachowskis have done.

0061703257|5.0|If you like twists and turns and a mystery whose end is not easy to figure out, this is the right book for you.  Lehane mixes the right amount of creepiness, confusion, mystery and likable characters to produce another one of those mysteries that has the habit of sticking with you.  When US Marshall Teddy Daniels shows up on Shutter Island to find a missing patient, he's got his own baggage with him.  His wife Delores died two years ago, he misses her desperately and simply can not find peace.  As he throws himself into the job at hand,we are introduced to a smart, witty man who is pretty darn good at his job.  As he investigates, Teddy doesn't like some of the answers he gets from the staff particularly from the head doctor, Cawley, who seems nice enough but keeps Teddy from information and therefore from completely doing his job.  Is there a conspiracy among the staff at the institution on Shutter Island or is something deeper going on that Teddy just hasn't discovered?  Read to the end and you might still be guessing, but the ride is well worth the trip.  Very Readable!

B002HK9IDQ|4.0|I remember seeing this when it premiered: a big theater in Hollywood; I think it was The Egyptian.  Sold out.  Haven't seen it since, until the other day, courtesy Netflix; funny feeling to have forgotten about half of it.  I liked it, but it was somewhat disappointing at times, especially if one is of a mind to consider it as belonging to the category of five-star productions.  It disappointed me a little back then, too, but now I think I can put my finger on why.<br /><br />If one only is exposed to the soundtrack -- the Broadway soundtrack (as I was, since my mother played it all the time) -- one builds up a picture of the story that isn't borne out when one sees the whole thing.  The numbers run about 45 minutes and the non-number parts run to about two hours - the numbers are outnumbered -- and what's more, about all them have an upper feeling to them, even ones, such as \\"Just You Wait\\" that are, well, combative.  The rest of the drama is often rather sombre in tone, and marked by frequent conflict -- angry outbursts often - between Higgins and Eliza.  Well, it's drama, after all.<br /><br />Drama, yes, theater drama, and the producers seemed often at pains to keep everything as theatrical as possible (perhaps the idea was lurking in the background that theater is superior to cinema (a false notion)).  For instance, they never went on location, and perhaps only one scene was shot outdoors, and that was at night.  The horse racing scene at Ascot is not going to make anyone forget the chariot race in Ben-Hur; couldn't they have gone to Ascot, or at least inserted some stock footage of a real race?  All the scenes which were supposedly outdoors in daylight were obviously really indoors on a sound stage, and consequently the lighting looked phony (as it always does in such scenes).  Details like that add up.  The problem is that once a story gets made into a movie, the movie has to stand on its own two legs as a movie, which means it has to have what Kurosawa calls \\"Cinematic Beauty.\\"<br /><br />To me, that means the movie has look good visually, move visually, and coordinate with the sound, especially the music.  This movie does all that, but it's a little below average, especially on the visual score.  There is an absence of a pleasing painterly composition within the frame (in contrast to what one sees in movies directed by Orson Welles, for instance); it often seemed as though they were blocking the scenes exactly as if it were a stage play, and then setting up the camera, and aiming it in the general direction of the action and hoping for the best.  I don't remember any music occurring outside the numbers, and instead, there was talking, basically at all times.  Even the look of the numbers is static.  In \\"Wouldn't it be Loverly\\" Eliza is sitting down for the first third of the number, and the camera isn't moving either.  Then she gets up and dances about, but the camera is so far away that the resulting motion in the image is rather subdued.  And there were only five or six cuts through the whole number.  So it's very static, especially compared to a music video, or even The Sound of Music.  So, if this story had been made into a ballet with average choreography, or an opera with average music, would anybody be seriously thinking of giving it five stars?<br /><br />On the plus side there is Shaw's story, which is very strong: one might almost say mythic.  And there are the numbers, perhaps the best set of numbers in any musical: one classic after another.  The casting also is very good.  Audrey Hepburn and Marni Nixon do very well.  Rex Harrison, of course, owns the role of Higgins (without him they didn't have a movie).  I can only be wistful regarding the peculiar magic of the Broadway cast, since that was before my time.  It's certainly slick with regard to its so-called production values -- especially the wardrobe, which is often fabulous -- but that is mainly a matter of budget and technique, as opposed to artistry.<br /><br />One other thing: the ending gnaws at me.  They didn't kiss.  Although that trick worked in The Apartment, here it seems a little too cute.  In El Cid Charlton Heston got to kiss Sophia Loren, and in Ship of Fools Lee Marvin (of all people) got to kiss Vivien Leigh (there are advantages to being an actor, it seems).  But this...needless to say, is not going to make the Cinema Paradiso highlight reel.<br /><br />And it didn't deserve to win over Dr. Strangelove.gnaws at me.  They didn't kiss.

B002KDUDG6|1.0|I really like most of the songs on this album. But the mastering (sound) is just terrible. The music is very compressed and is too loud. The music has no \\"air\\". A shame but unfortunately not very uncommon these days with the \\"loudness-war\\" still going strong.
142311339X|4.0|I read all of the Percy Jackson series and loved it very much.  The characters were very unique and the story was interesting.  With this new book Rick Riordan does a good job introducing the new characters.  Jason out of all the characters is the weakest one.  I enjoyed how more minor gods were included in the story this time around.  Annabeth's inclusion could have been done better.  Hopefully later on in the series it will improve.  I really liked how a Latino character was introduced.  The three perspectives in the book were interesting.  I have to say though that at times the plot was predictable and many times I could guess what was going to happen next.  Overall though I really liked the personalities of the new characters Leo and Piper a great deal more than I did the characters in the Percy Jackson series.  If you are on the fence about getting this book you should give it a try.  I think you will enjoy it I know I sure will.  I do not like how I have to wait another year for the next title to come out.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Our baby LOVED his wind-up mobile, but the music didn't last long enough for us to get anything done or for him to stay happy! So we searched for a longer-lasting, remote-controlled one. This mobile is cute, albeit it doesn't match his room decor, and it is bright and engaging. Our 4 1/2 mo old loves to watch the leaves (they go up and down around the animals as they rotate). It was easy to install and I like the fact that it uses D batteries, so hopefully they last quite awhile. We don't usually turn the actual unit off, so it can be operated by the remote control any time. Overall we really like it for its length of operation, its design and its ability to entertain baby. I have a few minor caveats: The remote doesn't work from too far away; the sensor on the main body has to be visible to the sensor on the remote (no operating from behind the door or around the corner). The second is the music. Though it is calming and classical and largely not annoying, it is midi music, and I wish it were real symphonic music. At this point, baby doesn't seem to mind but it does bother me a bit. Lastly, I wish the music would fade instead of turning off at the timer. Sometimes if he is almost asleep the abrupt change in sound will cause him to stir or wake up. Maybe he's just sensitive though...Overall it was a great purchase for the price and we use it very often.
0882709194|1.0|If Jesus said we should seek the truth, why would Creationists betray him? Delightfully almost everyone on planet earth knows this book is a Creationist hoax. This is not Darwin's Origin, though it has that title and chapter headings. It is a bait and switch scheme, appearing to honestly address evolution while setting up the reader for superficial refutation. The usual Creationist chestnuts are cooked up for the reader. That evolution is as statistically likely as Shakespeare's sonnets (or this book) being typed by a band of monkeys (evolution is in large part highly non-random natural selection); that there are no transitional forms (science has found all forms are transitional); that there must be millions of transitionals (Says who? Species are blindly selected for by changing environments that may last for thousands or millions of years); that the eye is \\"impossible\\" to evolve (one of the most well documented developments not only in the fossil record but in species displaying each stage of evolution and alive today); and of course that Darwin is responsible for Nazism, Socialism, Communism, Atheism, and gas passed after a garlic pizza (yes, this last part is true).     If you search for facile one-liners suitable for street preaching, this book may be for you. But don't expect to field any questions with it. You can find any of the claims offered in this book from a door-to-door Jehovah's Witness \\"Watchtower\\" pamphlet or a Scientologist retreat.  What is interesting about this text is how much like the great evil Creationists claim to oppose they have in fact become.  Violating even the teachings of Jesus they will stop at no moral boundary to rule the mind their way. This is not to say the whole book is intentionally dishonest. The introduction closes with instructions on how to pray.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I don't need to write a lengthy description of accuracies or timelines on character and place. As an amateur historian of the Middle Ages and the Crusades in particular, I found this movie to be one of the best in both the telling of the Legend of Robin Hood and among the genre of movies available in the 1000+ years where stories can be found.<br />All bias aside, though...Ridley Scott is in my top five of filmmakers of all time. :)

142311339X|4.0|I stopped a couple of times while reading this wishing that I had the same feeling that I did while reading the Percy Jackson series.  Don't get me wrong... this is good.  It just didn't have the same spark for me that Percy did.  And if I'm being completely honest, I thought the old gang would be more relavent in this story.  The book reads pretty similarly to the Percy books.  Quests, monsters, a minor love story starts....  Then the end comes!!!  Oh my!  The end of this book makes it near impossible to wait for the next book to come out!  I can hardly wait and that spark I was looking for....  the last chapter made the book come alive!

1401324029|5.0|I bought this book because I love the show and also loved the book before (Heat Wave) If you're just like me I think you should buy it without even thinking: It is like the TV Show, but longer,  tougher and funnier! The Character are the same only with different names.   However, even if you have never watched the show and know nothing about it; it, still, remains a good book, exciting and enjoyable!
0307454541|3.0|On page 187, I finally decided I would finish the book - it took that long for me to be captivated enough to want to keep going. Hardly a page turner, it has some clever twists and surprises, but nothing to give it the hype it has been getting.
B0042AEOG0|3.0|The reason that I gave the cd 3 stars is because she put 2 songs on here that we already have on the first cd. but I will say her voice is amazing. And instead of having 2 songs run together why  not just make a ful song for each. I have breakdowns of each song  1) Santa claus is coming to town- already on the first as a song, the 24 seconds was pointless  2) Oh Santa- good, good, song  3) Oh little town of bethlaham/Little drummer boy- good vocals  4) Christmas time is in the air again- a good moving song that has good vocals   5) The first noel/born is the king (Interlude) This is a good song, that runs beautifual together, however born is the king could've ran on a bit longer but it ends good  6) When christmas comes- Another good song lots of good vocals, and a good strong high note to end the song  7) here comes Santa claus- I have yet to understand why people need to talk in the background why she is singing, It's hard to focus on what they are talking about in the backgroung and hear her sing at the same time. And i can't really get use to the beat.  8) Charlie Brown christmas- It's a good song just to short at only 2:49, she could've done so much more with this we all know Charlie Brown and she should've done more.  9)Oh come all ye faithfull- I love this song we finally get to hear mariah's mom, and find out where she got that voice. Both do fantastic on this album.  10) O holy night live- Again pointless on this cd we already have it on the first one and it sounds good, why ruin it on this one and have a live version where people talk on it. I feel that this is a filler as sort of a rush toward the end of a cd she could've put another song in it's place.  11) One child- This is my fave on the whole album very beautiful strong vocals, and a powerful song  12) All I want for christmas- Again we already know this song all she did was change the beat a little, and at the end she changed her high note, this it another filler and could've been switched for another song.  13) Auld lang syne- It has a good beat I just have no Idea why it's on here the song feels rushed    All in all it's an ok cd, a lot of fillers. Mariah could've done so much more on this I feel a little dissapointed the songs that's already on the first cd really have no point on this cd at all mariah putting the songs on here makes the cd feel rushed. she could have put more songs on here. However her voice is so amazing on the songs it sounds like the mariah we first feel in love with

031603438X|5.0|Rock & Roll, or, Rythm & Blues was new in the 60s in Brittain and The Rolling Stones popularized it all over the world, also outside the black community, where is has been developed first. Mick Jagger as lead singer and 'salesman', Keith Richards as scholar and architect of the music and above all innovative guitar player. Mick slept with the girls, Keith with the guitars (literally!). His side of the almost 50 year story is lively and honest, so it seems. He states that his drug addiction (until the 80's) contributed to his survival, althought he was on the 'death list' top ten for many years. A fascinating story, comparable with Voyage au bout de la nuit of C&eacute;line. Every Stones fan is inspired in some way in his/her own life. In my case in studying and popularizing the science and application of positive reinforcement for a better world.<br />Dr. Marius Rietdijk, VU University Amsterdam.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I can't remember how many times I've seen the sound of music from theater to vhs to laser disc to DVD...Yet it never gets old...I'll watch it during the times when I was down and somehow, it'll cheer me up....Can't understand why but it works...Now waiting for my limited edition set to arrive...should be a blast for my whole family..GET it if you've got a blu ray player.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I was given this as an early gift because we heard rumors of people getting this from amazon of poor quality and/or bootlegged, but its just not true. This is the official Disney product, shrink wrapped, and great quality! I'm not sure about the complaints- it does include a DVD version as well as a Blu Ray disk, so it could be that perhaps people put in the DVD thinking it was a Blu Ray- which there is a difference in quality of course. Unconverted the DVD does not look TOO bad, but not as great as the Blu Ray. As for the bootlegs, I'm not sure... this is the quality thing!!!<br /><br />As far as the movie goes... well its Beauty and the Beast. Seriously. One of the best animated movies of all time!!! If you don't have this yet... well get it!!!!!
B002IW8V0E|5.0|This is BY FAR the dumbest musical ever made. And musicals are not exactly 'food for tought', if you know what I mean.    Watchig Merryl Streep plugging power tools for intimate pleasure alone is worth the price of the package. Listening to Pierce Brosnan sing... priceless.
B0007OASII|4.0|I was seeking something new and discovered these guys while looking at stuff like Dream Theater, Nightwish, etc. My biggest gripe is the vocals, believe it or not. The vocals are very good, though I think he needs to insert more steady power instead of wobbly vibrato when holding a note. I feel as if he's trying to sing at a smoky jazz bar in some cases instead of along with hi gain guitar amps and pounding drums. He's still good, just reduce the emphasis on the vibrato.    Everything else in there is solid. You're not getting virtuoso playing, but what you do get is very solid production and plenty of hooks to keep you listening. I can't say the same for Nightwish. This is very Queensryche Rage for Order'ish. I know nothing about these guys at this point, but will do some reading to find out what the band members have done prior to this.     Overall I like it, thus the four stars.
0439023483|5.0|I got it for my preteen son, who reads at an 11th grade level. I read it first. I was a little nervous as I got started reading. I was afraid it was going to be bloody and gore, but it wasn't. The author did an amazing job of giving just enough detail without going overboard.   I loved it. I then bought book two. And that was a great book too. Next is book three -as soon as I get paid again. Lol
B003KGBISY|5.0|I hope someone reviews the Blu-Ray version soon! Is the movie complete on ONE DISC or TWO??? How are the subtitles??? Another reviewer mentioned that the subtitles would periodically disappear on the DVD version...
B003ZWTGKU|4.0|I'm a big \\"Wether\\" fan, and have many DVDs of the production from various companies around the globe.  Jonas is probably my favorite Werther -- he looks and acts the part, and his voice ... well, those of you who heard him at the Met in \\"Carmen\\" or Covent Garden in \\"Traviata\\" know what kind of power and dark beauty this guy sports.  My only reservation about the DVD, which has nothing to do with Kaufmann and the rest of the excellent cast, is with the camera work.  Pretty poor -- be prepared to be disappointed at the end of Act I when the camera give you only Kaufmann's chin, and no pan shots, as he emotes the hell out of the role.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|We own every copy ever made of RHPS - the 25 year anniversary one was good for extras but the video and sound were not really better than what came before.<br /><br />Enter Blu-Ray.  WOW!  The video is absolutely flawless and the audio is amazing.  This is how RHPS should be seen.<br /><br />Do not miss this release!
B001EC3JME|5.0|Perfect for me. I want something that will hold it tight no matter if I'm crawling, walking, or swinging around at all. It holds tight to where it's clipped and doesn't slide or fall off. I think it's actually pretty easy to take out the light, but at the same time my light doesn't feel like its slipping out at all. It is a bit hard to put back in the holster, but I'll sacrifice that for a good snug fit any day of the week.    Oh, and the flashlight I'm using is the Maglite XL100.
0307266303|4.0|Good stuff. Nice story. The science might be a little squishy, but that doesn't get in the way of the message and the story the author tells. A must read for distance runners.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Ordered this dvd by chance, and it quickly became one of my favorite movies.  Romantic, but not shallow. Sad, yet satisfying and uplifting. I have watched this video probably five times since I bought it and still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time I watched it. Though there is much one may contemplate as the viewer is exposed to the differences of life in northern and southern England during the early manufacturing years, there is an element of simple storytelling that makes this movie both delightful and enchanting. The heroine is smart and like-able (unlike so many empty-headed \\"beauty queens\\" of most movies today)and Richard Armitage has a voice that makes my three daughters swoon (and even me at times!) His character, Mr. Thornton, displays an unbending strength and sense of honor that is admirable (and lacking in most heroes today) yet an underlying vulnerability that makes him irresistable. The filming is poetic at times - especially in regard to the cotton mill as is depicted in my favorite line, \\"... I have seen hell, and it is white...\\"  Other than a few low necklines in the ladies' party dresses, common for the time, a clean and wholesome movie. A must see.
B003MTGW80|5.0|For those of us who have had the pleasure of being the in audience for the Los Angeles Philharmonic from the 1950s the following conductors/music Directors have made their impact on the orchestra: until 1956 Alfred Wallenstein, until 1959 Eduard van Beinum, until 1978 Zubin Mehta, until 1984 Carlo Maria Giulini, until 1989 Andr&eacute; Previn, until 2009 Esa-Pekka Salonen and now Gustavo Dudamel.  Each of these conductors influenced the orchestra the world paid little attention to until the arrival of Zubin Mehta who added the glamour to the ensemble so desperately needed.  But then it was with Giulini that the orchestra took on that European lustre and gleam that has remained to this day.  This generous sampling of some of the recordings Guilini made with the orchestra (his magnificent recording of Verdi's opera 'Falstaff' is unfortunately not included here nor is  the recording of the Chopin Concertos with Krystian Zimerman) allows us to relive those days when the orchestra's sound and position in the world of music changed.<br /><br />Guilini was in his mid sixties when he assumed the role of conductor and his concerts were evenings of stately, golden and sublime music making.  His specialty was Romantic music and he also was able to make the works of Debussy and Ravel seem majestic.  It is therefore not surprising that this set of six CDs (recorded in various places) includes Beethoven's symphonies 3, 5, and 6, Brahms symphonies 1 and 2, Schumann's 3rd symphony, and Tchaikovsky's 6th.  The tempi tend to be slow (read stately) and the emotional depth is awe inspiring.  But when listening to all six of these CDs (even though already having each of these DGG recordings as singles) the sound and complete experience that the master brought to Los Angeles is most obvious in this recording of Debussy's 'La Mer'. It is a recording for the ages and comparable only to that venerable recording by Fritz Reiner.  The Ravel 'Ma M&egrave;re l'Oye' and 'Rapsodie Espagnole' also sound fresh and beautifully detailed.<br /><br />Carlo Maria Guilini is still very much missed despite the fact that the orchestra has thrived under the immaculate leadership of Esa-Pekka Salonen and now the intense musicality of Gustavo Dudamel.  Guilini was old school in the finest sense of the word and this collection is a fine tribute to the man and his music.  Grady Harp, November 10eautifully detailed.

B002VECLVY|5.0|It's simple, if you don't like this movie you don't understand cinema and if you don't love this movie you don't love cinema!  That's it, that's all folks! Cinema is using all the photographic elements to tell a story, no matter how simple or complex the subject. If you communicate it in cinematic terms then you are a film auteur and Tom Ford is that auteur in this film, he even emanates Hitchcock in some scenes. There are not many movies made nowadays, that remind us of Vertigo & Rear Window; two of cinema's masterpieces from Hitchcock. See it, believe it and the blu-ray transfer is great!

B00000AF98|3.0|KISS' seventh album of the 80's and fourteenth studio album overall finds the band finally settling into its new sound.  With Bruce Kulick firmly in place as the band's lead guitarist (this is his second full album with the group) and Eric Carr no longer considered a \\"replacement\\" by fans, the band appears to be turning into a tight, cohesive group.  With that said, 1987's \\"Crazy Nights\\" feels more like a generic album that begs to be better than it really is.<br /><br />The album opens with Paul Stanley belting out a \\"Whooo!\\" on \\"Crazy Crazy Nights.\\"  It's quite possibly the most anthemic sounding single the band released during the 80's outside of Lick It Up.  It's definitely a fun song to hear live, as I had the chance to do in September of 2010.  It's the only song to be played live by the band from this album since Eric Carr's death, and they only started playing it again during the Sonic Boom tour.<br /><br />The next track, \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You,\\" finds the band playing it safe with the popular glam sound of the 1980's.  While the song sounds wonderful and the musicianship is excellent, you just feel as if the band is holding back on the tune.<br /><br />\\"Bang Bang You\\" and \\"No, No, No\\" are next, and they are two of the weakest (and lamest) songs that KISS ever recorded in my opinion.  I'm all for cheesy, innuendo-laden rockers from KISS.  Heck, it's what put them on the map.  These songs, particularly \\"Bang Bang You,\\" come across as a forced attempt at being tongue-in-cheek dirty that just don't work.<br /><br />At this point, the rest of the album plays out like a standard 1980's hair/glam album.  There's really no standout track from the bunch.  \\"Reason To Live\\" and \\"Turn On The Night\\" were both released as singles with \\"Crazy Crazy Nights,\\" and even though they sound quite good, they just do not grab me like many of the other songs released during this part of the band's development.<br /><br />Ron Nevison produced the album and his hit-making powers are felt throughout \\"Crazy Nights.\\"  Known primarily for tight production and having a bead on the current popular sounds, Nevison is responsible for reviving the career of Heart and working with many of the popular power ballad-heavy bands of the 1980's like Survivor and Europe.  It's no surprise, then, that many of KISS' songs on this album sound very similar to tracks from these groups.  \\"Reason To Live\\" is very, very similar to Heart's \\"These Dreams\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />As stated before, \\"Crazy Nights\\" is a good album.  It just lacks that extra something that allows it to stand out from the rest of the 1980's abundant flow of glam albums.  The band sounds wonderful.  Gene Simmons excels on both vocals and bass.  Paul Stanley puts in an always reliable performance.  Bruce Kulick has settled in nicely and sounds a lot like Eddie Van Halen at times and Eric Carr, as always, never skips a beat and does an excellent job.<br /><br />Get \\"Crazy Nights\\" for \\"Crazy Crazy Nights,\\" \\"Reason To Live,\\" and \\"Turn On The Night.\\"  It's a solid-but-safe glam rock album from KISS that could have been so much more.Known primarily for tight production and having a bead on the current popular sounds, Nevison is responsible for reviving the career of Heart and working with many of the popular power ballad-heavy bands of the 1980's like Survivor and Europe.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|Quick to learn, highly portable, and a hell of a lot of fun.  Zombie Dice is easy for anyone to pick up, it's inexpensive, and the game itself is a blast.  Roll the dice to try to devour the delicious brains, but watch out for the shotgun blasts.  Similar to Farkle or Toss-Up, it adds an element to risk: the more you win, the greater your chances of dying.  Great party and family game.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Two people meet through a mailbox.  She is living 2 years before him.  They fall in love through their letters but they cannot meet.      I love this story and have watched it a number of times and will watch it many more.  It is a story that doesn't become old.  Sandra Bullock is excellent and so is Keanu Reeves.  Keanu plays a fantastic lover.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I workout regularly, atleast 4 times a week for 1 hr durations. Since I discovered the 20 minute - Jillian's 30 day shred, I started using it in combination with her other DVDs. I love her 40 min DVD - \\"No more trouble zones\\" as well. I usually do the level 2 or 3 workout on this one. After doing just jillian and eating clean for 3 weeks, I lost 6 lbs and 2-3 inches of my waistline. And love the hint of abs I saw in the mirror. Her videos are really great and produce awesome defenition. but...    I gave her a 4 star rating, because its very easy to injure your knees with so many lunges and jumps even if you follow the recommended form. I have used other trainer's DVDs and all of them pay a lot of attention to proper form, Jillian needs to improve on that. Have had to lay off all workouts for last two weeks to give my knees a  rest and let them heal. I would recommend people with knee problems to really modify or sompletely skip the lunges and the jumps. replacing it with 15 - 20 min walk afterwards might make up for it.    I'm an avid fan of Jillians, and would still use all her DVDs but would skip the segments that might reinjure the knees.
B000002I6X|4.0|the album is great - there are no extras but the album is stills at his 70s best.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|I don't think this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is probably in the top 10.  I would recommend skipping it (unless you want to complete the Tomb Raider/Wanted/Salt trifecta).  Here are some of the reasons:    - Stereotypes:  Russians, CIA operatives, politicians - you name it and they are stereotyped in this movie.  Absolutely nothing new, original, professional or fleshed out.  Absolutely no character development.    - Plot:  I was expecting to spend at least part of the movie wondering \\"which side is she on?\\"  That never happens.  Plot holes are huge and distracting.  Easily spotted plot turns with a final 'twist' that is so telegraphed that it doesn't come as a surprise at all.  The ending screams 'sequel'.    - Acting:  Honestly - if Megan Fox had been in this instead of Angelina Jolie, people would be ripping it apart.  Somehow, Jolie seems to get a free pass and brings 'controlled depth' and 'icy calm' to the character when I saw it more as 'sleepwalking through a role'.    - Production values:  jerky camera work and convoluted camera angles that don't really capture the action as much as give you a headache when trying to follow it.    Overall, the only positive thing is that at least it wasn't a long movie.  I guess if you don't do any character development and rely on stereotypes then you don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  Just patch together a bunch of bad action scenes.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|I selected this book because I like Portia De Rossi. Especially in the last couple years, she comes across as very warm and approachable in interviews. The book tells why that is -- after years of self-loathing and deception, she can be her authentic self. The book is not celebrity gossip and her focus is on her own struggles and obsessions, because I think for a very long time that's all she could see. Very few stories of Alley McBeal, other than how the pressure to fit her wardrobe or look good in her undies exacerbated her weight issues. No stories about Arrested Development other than she was at a point in her life where she wasn't hiding her love of women and told the producers she was gay right away. This book will absolutely not work for you if you want this to be more than the diary of a woman with eating disorders. That's the focus and remains the focus.<br /><br />She asks Ellen to read the manuscript she'd written, the one the reader just will have just read, and Ellen does and says, \\"Baby, you were crazy,\\" and the reader can only nod along. The book makes it clear that Portia's thinking was distorted for a good 14 years and the book is a diary of that. If you happen to own Ally McBeal, you have only to watch the second season when Portia appears and is whippet thin and imagine her hating herself for not being thinner. The episode that really sent her into a tailspin is the one where she seduces Cage while wearing a bra and panties, ribs clearly visible, and with a figure that would make most women weep with joy and become nudists. All Portia could see was an unattractive woman who had to keep fooling people into thinking she was thin, beautiful, and worthy.<br /><br />What I enjoyed was Portia's efforts to bring you into her mind at this time. Of note is that we know people had to be telling her how beautiful she was (is) and yet all she mentions in the book were the insults and moments of insecurity, because I really don't think she was hearing the compliments at that time. (She was told by a modeling client at age 12 that her rear was saggy.)<br /><br />Portia was not afraid to allow herself to look bad -- to write in detail about the binges and purges and, even what I know had to be painful for her, her semi-neglect of her dog. She also when speaking from a place of illness has less-than-charitable thoughts about overweight women, which makes utter sense, but she's still so brave to put that into words.<br /><br />I think that this is an excellent book for young women, because Portia pulls no punches. I'm taking a little off just because her recovery was handled almost as an afterthought and I think that, having read her journey, more of the getting well and more of her subsequent well-earned happiness would have been perfect.t time.

B001AEF6D6|5.0|This movie is so funny and is a laugh a min. The cast is just great. Each one building on each other. Could not stop laughing. A classic, a must have!
B003C1SPX8|5.0|The dvd I received was excellent. It was part of one concert in 1983 prior to Money For Nothing. The hair was only on one camera and was on the last song. The camera shot was used four or five times. Not a big deal. I have three dvd's from  1985 concerts that have really good audio. I guess they are considered bootleg.   While the video doesn't compare to this DVD. it is good enough because the music is the thing. A Knofler fan should buy this DVD.

B0038QGXHW|5.0|I became a fan of Keith Jarrett's years ago after hearing \\"The Melody At Night With You\\", which like \\"Jasmine\\" was recorded in Jarrett's home studio. \\"Jasmine\\" won me over with the first song, Jarrett and Charlie Haden's nearly ten minute version of \\"For All We Know\\". The last minute and a half of this song is simply some of the most beautiful and heart wrenching music I have ever heard. It impresses me on two levels: the interplay between Haden and Jarrett is instinctive and amazing, and the sheer beauty of Jarrett moving up octaves (until you're fooled several times into thinking the song is over when it isn't) is enough to bring tears to my eyes every time I hear it. It seems to me that most of the debate about the quality of this album centers around Jarrett's tendency to vocalize while he plays, his ego, the quality of the recording itself, and where this music stands in terms of both the musician's careers. I would agree that both Jarrett and Haden have made music that is more groundbreaking and challenging than \\"Jasmine\\" both together and seperately in their long careers, but does that make their release of an album of standards pointless, saccharine, and not worth hearing by comparison? In my opinion it does not. This is not free jazz or the \\"Koln Concert\\" album, and it wasn't meant to be! While Jarrett's vocalizations are a matter of taste, (I for one don't particularly enjoy them), they don't detract from the playing on this album in my opinion. For one thing, they are somewhat in the background on this recording due to the microphone placement; I have heard recordings where they are much more prominent and distract from Jarrett's playing. Again, they are present on a few of the songs but not every one, and I have heard worse from Jarrett on other albums. Other reviewers have commented that they don't like the \\"dry\\" recording quality; to me this is another matter of taste. I found the manner in which \\"Jasmine\\" was recorded to be appropriate in that the lack of reverb made the performances sound more intimate, which makes sense for a collection of love songs. Lastly, giving a beautiful collection of songs like this one or two stars on Amazon because you find Jarrett's ego to be a turn off is in my opinion unnecessary as it does not reflect on the music. I have seen Jarrett play live at Carnegie Hall, and he does seem to have a huge ego, a pretentious streak, and a nasty side. However, in the jazz world (or for that matter, any form of the arts) that is not uncommon. Not to mention that while I did not care for his personality the night I saw him, his playing was more than exceptional, and he also gave the audience their money's worth and did seven or eight encores. If you listen to \\"Jasmine\\" at face value, I cannot imagine that it would be a turn off to the average listener. It is a beautiful, pensive, relaxing, and moving collection of songs, and I would recommend it to any lover of jazz.k of reverb made the performances sound more intimate, which makes sense for a collection of love songs.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The Fall.  This is the most artist movie I have ever seen.  It is visually creative, artistically satisfying all my senses were pleased.  The script is intense, the momentum is constant and the layering of the storyline and characters worked very well.  The movie operates in a real time/dream time simultaneously.  This is my most favorite movie.  Hard to believe it didn't make an Oscar nomination, too many people were asleep or distracted by big names.  I heard about it from word of mouth.  Wow!

193413712X|3.0|Picked it up on a whim after enjoying a few of the recent Pulitzer winning books.  Very short, but altogether jumped around too much for me to ever take an interest in the handful of characters that we were introduced to.  When it worked, it was very enjoyable, but then 8-9 pages later it would float off onto a different subject and take my interest with it.
B00001OH7O|4.0|This way also An album that I lost in the old focus in 2007 in 2011 I Signed a contract for a truck and cruze but I and Tahoe but I left this album at home so I would not loose it in a repossession

B000PMGS8G|4.0|The FLASH GORDON serials of the 1930's starring Buster Crabbe perfectly captured the essence of Alex Raymond's comic strip hero. This film managed to do the same thing in 1980. Unlike his 1976  misfire remake of KING KONG, producer Dino DeLaurentiis hit it right on target with FLASH GORDON. But the movie came out in the STAR WARS dominated era and thus wasn't really appreciated until relatively recently; in fact the DVD and blu-ray releases look better than the prints shown in theaters when it premiered. It's only helped to give FLASH GORDON a well deserved re-charge.  The cast is right on the money, giving the whole thing a wonderful tongue in cheek quality that makes FLASH a lot of fun to watch. It doesn't pretend to be more than what it is: not so much science fiction, just a terrific outer space joyride, similar to the equally fun BARBARELLA. The great music by QUEEN is also a big plus. The special effects, while pretty splashy, aren't overdone so they don't detract from the story and characters. Sometimes, as was the case then, the blue-screen process betrays itself, but these minor technical issues don't matter when a film is good in all other departments, and this one is. The costumes and sets are outstanding and they easily outshine other fantasy films from that era.  FLASH GORDON has nothing to be ashamed of, and as an updated version of a classic comic book character, this is one that I highly recommend. You're sure to be taking off with this Flash more than a few times.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|My five year old daughter and I had wonderful time viewing this movie.The values that were exemplified in this film were put forth in a funny, moving manner that still managed to teach life lessons.

6304401132|5.0|This one's a great one. There's a mythology behind this and I think all women are to some extent, sleeping beauty's to be reawaked by thier personal prince with but a kiss. This film touches the soul of every woman out there and we men should step up to the plate and give great kisses to our girlfriends to wake her up from the evil spell of time.
B00471Z3CI|4.0|This is a great classic 80s horror film.  It has the suspense and suprise and the creepy special effects but not the violence and gore of harder core horror. An average family has their life taken hostage by a \\"noisy spirit\\" or poltergeist. All begins mildly with moving objects and voices that only the youngest child can hear. The poltergeist quickly increases the activity to frights in the night and eventually to taking the little girl to wherever the poltergeist resides.  The movie progresses in attempts to get the child back and to reveal the root cause of the poltergeist's presence. Of course, one really only needs to say, \\"Steven Speilberg\\" to recommend this movie.  My 9 year old daughter watched this as her first horror film and loved it. She asks to watch it again and again. I watched it first as a 12 year old and love to watch it again and again as well.

0802473156|5.0|I wish I had read this book before my most recent relationship hit the skids.  It is so important to understand what language of love you need and what language of love your loved one needs.  It is the most important aspect of a successful relationship but one we all too often overlook.  This book explains this in clear and simple terms.  It is a must have for anyone who wants to work on a relationship, engage in a relationship or just plain make a relationship a better thing than it is today.

I'm troubled by the depiction of native americans though. What makes the red man red? I think this is the only set back to the film there's some prejudice there that I'm not happy with. Don't we all wanna stay as children? We all miss our childhoods. This film is by far one of the best films to relive your childhood.
0689865384|2.0|I was recommended this book by a good friend. I was expecting an innovative story with interesting supporting science. I was disappointed.    This book tackles an important issue, peer pressure and focus on physical beauty. The characters, (while not particularly complex), were somewhat sympathetic. (David's immediate infatuation with Tally grated though.) I enjoyed the premise, and the story was interesting. The trouble was, that every time they brought up a new technology I winced and had to stop reading for a few minutes.    The vast majority of the science in this book is horribly wrong. (Although, the science of beauty was correct and very interesting, it was cool to see it applied in a story.)     Most of the gadgets were based on magnetic levitation against veins of metal in the earth. This is possible. In theory. However, a magnetic field strong enough to levitate a person say, fifteen feet in the air, would pull all their fillings out.  The energy required for that would be enormous! Since Tally's long distance board runs on solar panels, this is impossible. Solar panels are not energy efficient enough to produce such a massive amount of electricity. Bungee Jackets and Crash Bracelets have the same problem, although bungee jackets have the added problem of vicious acceleration.     The petroleum eating virus was also hard to take. A petroleum devouring bacteria is possible. A virus works in a completely different way from bacteria. Bacteria works like any living organism: taking in resources and using them to reproduce. Viruses, on the other hand, cannot reproduce without a living host. The concept of them eating the petroleum was impossible. If the author had switched it to bacteria, that would be plausible.     All in all: Good emotion, interesting premise, awful science, okay characters. This is a good book for fourteen and under, but not for older teens or science knowledgeable kids.

6303983812|1.0|This is by far the worst disney movie ever made. I had a bad feeling about it before I watched it. It's probably more enjoyable to children than to adults. I didn't like it for numerous reasons. The tape was in bad shape and it got stuck in my vcr. I had to pull it out and the tape was everywhere. The tomas omalley the ally cat bit was the highlight of the film. There wasn't much of a plot except that the richer cats were hanging out with the poorer cats and seemed to get along.<br />The bad guys were bumbling and predictable. Not much of a memorable film.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Okay so it is a superhero spoof of sorts but it is also serious at times. Warning, if you are totally against 10 year old girls killing people with blades and guns as well as using profanity on a regular basis avoid this movie. Otherwise sit back and enjoy the ride for what it is. Kick-Ass really does Kick every other superhero movie's Ass!
1878424505|4.0|I like this book and have read it about 3 times in the last month. The concept of our domestication was new to me and especially hit home; an AHA moment when I could connect several past experiences to my current behavior and now have the opportunity to start undoing those knots and getting back to my original self by understanding where I got off track in the first place. For that alone I have found the book very useful; but the four agreements themselves are good concepts to absorb and live with/by to help keep you on your path.
B003M0H4NG|5.0|This album is a pretty good \\"brew\\".Good total of various influences. Excellent \\"Jazz-rock\\".  Very unique at the time. Very interesting playing while soloing and ensemble wise. The tunes are very good and varied.

They should be under the genre \\"trailer music.\\" Well, it's probably more convienient classifying it that way. :) Love it no matter what. Thank you.
0786955570|4.0|After being completely disappointed with the new DungeonQuest, and leery of anything 4th Ed D&D based, I finally broke down and bought this one.  The rules were extremely simple (in fact so simple, I wonder if they didn't leave things out).  At any rate, this was the dungeon crawler we hoped DungeonQuest would be.  In this game, the players cooperatively play through different adventures in a randomly generated dungeon to achieve a common goal.  Either everyone wins or everyone loses.  There is no \\"Dark Lord\\" or \\"GM\\" player.  Everyone plays a character, and the party/company of heroes is in it together.  For a first release I would have preferred a more \\"standard\\" selection of characters, but overall the game is very easy to jump right into and the components aid in play greatly.  Finally a dungeon game where we can all play (and die) together.

B000A0GP4K|4.0|This was a really good documentary.  Several big names, places, and events included.  My only gripe is the 2nd DVD had a few 'skips' in it...buy new.     Great view for a rainy day or long night!

B003EYVXSW|4.0|I gave this movie a four star for the imagination!!  When I watched this movie I went in with no! expectations.  I am either dence or too sheltered!!  I loved the stages that their little experiment went.  The end was awesome!!  Changing from female to male, I did not see that one comming!!  This movie proves that playing GOD will never turn out like you thought it would or should!  Everyone that I have told about this movie watched and said they thought it was awesome!!  I think sometimes we expect way too much and are let down.  Don't think just watch.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The whole excitement and point of this show was the mystery surrounding the island and the long list of bizarre happenings that occurred to those on it.  If there was any show that ever promised an explanation this was it and it failed in the most epic way imaginable.  The end answers NOTHING!  The end explains NOTHING!  I still couldn't tell you what the island is or answer any of the several hundred questions I was left dangling with.    The writings apparently thought it was acceptable to make up, entirely at random, the story and that us fans wouldn't be T-d off.  It's The Matrix and Battlestar Galactica all over again (only worse).

6305428522|5.0|The year is 1957, and everyone, it seems, is watching the popular TV game show, \\"Twenty-One.\\"  Contestants can stay on the show for weeks, earning then-astronomical sums of money and becoming household names.  Such was the case for Herbert Stemple (John Turturro), a buck-toothed, blue-collar guy who raked in the money.  Little did the public know that the show was entirely scripted and that Herb was told the answers in advance.  When Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a bright, attractive college instructor came on the show, the producers decided it was time for Herb to lose; he did and Van Doren became the biggest thing on television, even making the cover of Time Magazine.  But he and the show were no match for Congressional watchdog Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) who exposed the show for the fraud that it was.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how exciting this movie was. It's got humor and drama and is filled with tension.  Fiennes portrays Van Doren as a witty, charming Connecticut Yankee from an influential family.  We care about him and suffer with him as he prepares to confess his part in the fraud not only to Congress, but to his trusting father.  Turturro's Herbie is a fascinating, naive, greedy man whose life was ruined by the show.  Morrow is excellent as the whistle-blower.<br /><br />The movie is a wonderful look back at a time when we as a people were so much more trusting and innocent.  This scandal rocked the nation and changed us forever.  This is a great movie.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Apparently, when Roman Polanski isn't accosting young girls he is making really good movies.  Ok, so I've know that for a while (I mean, this is the man behind `Chinatown' and `Rosemary's Baby') but it's always nice to be reminded of Polanski's sharp eye for detail.<br /><br />Watching `The Ghost Writer' made me realize that `Sherlock Holmes' could have used Polanski's restraint.<br /><br />The film revolves around an unnamed ghostwriter who gets landed the job of rewriting the memoirs of British Prime Minister Adam Lang after the previous ghost was found dead (apparent suicide).  Shortly after landing the job, the ghost finds himself in over his head when Adam is accused of war crimes and things around him start to become increasingly chaotic.  As the ghost struggles to make something intriguing and meaningful out of the bore-fest that is this memoir he realizes that finding the truth behind the façade is surely going to bring him close to death.<br /><br />Or maybe it will bring him death.<br /><br />The film certainly has its fair share of twists and turns, most of which are actually probable (which aids in making this experience truly chilling).  I did figure out the ending before it was revealed, which was a little let-down for me since I was convinced by close friends that it was a total shocker (but maybe that's what gave it away...I was looking for it).  That said, it was satisfying, especially the way it is revealed (like I said, `Sherlock Holmes' should have had this detailed understanding).<br /><br />The biggest asset this film has is the acting here.  I've always loved Ewan McGregor, the man with the greatest hair in Hollywood (seriously, no matter how much product I use I can never attain his perfect balance of chaotic control), and it's nice to see him working a juicy role with such nuanced understanding.  I was surprised to see Kim Cattrall tackling something so far removed from what she's famous for.  She should do this more often.  Olivia Williams is effortless here, completely convincing from start to finish and I am in love with Tom Wilkinson and firmly believe he should be in EVERY film, so seeing him show up near the films conclusion really made my night.  Honestly though, this film was all about Pierce Bronsan for me.  I've always liked him, but I've never loved him.  He has excited me with his performances before (most notably in `The Matador', where he really deserved an Oscar nomination) and this is one where he walked away most memorable.  His feverish performance has the right balance needed to create a character you understand almost more than he understands himself.  Most notable was the private jet scene with McGregor.  Watch his face, listen to his tone, and realize that he is telling you everything you need to know even though he doesn't fully understand what he is relaying to you.<br /><br />Stunning.<br /><br />The film is a solid thriller.  It isn't perfect, but Polanski is a refined and perfected director who knows how to create a memorable and meaningful film; time and time again.cing from start to finish and I am in love with Tom Wilkinson and firmly believe he should be in EVERY film, so seeing him show up near the films conclusion really made my night.

B0025VLELQ|5.0|A great movie that I grew up with. Sci-fi fans and gamers will love The Last Starfighter! The graphics where top notch for its day.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|But then again, this movie is kind of weird so I think that's okay.  In fact, I'm probably going to use that phrase a lot in this review since my revelations about this film have all come over me with a strange air of `weirdness'.<br /><br />This may sound weird, but when `Bronson' ended I instantly brought to mind `American Splendor'.  I know, they are SOOOO different, but the one thing they have in common is the one thing that makes them both so amazing; they are odd.  I guess I should elaborate.  They are odd takes on a generic genre.  All too often the biopic (which happens to be one of my favorite film genres) tends to become repetitive.  The same general plot outline is used in the storytelling, and unless the subject is interesting enough on their own and the performances are beyond stellar, they can all begin to run together.  `American Splendor' was one of those refreshing films that took be by surprise because it understood how to do something unique and different with the genre.  `Bronson' does that too.  It breaks away from the norm and delivers something that is odd.  Sure, that oddness may deter some and it isn't without detractors, but the way that the film uses comedic breaks and fantastical interludes and blistering techno savvy music makes `Bronson' stick out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />I gobbled it up.<br /><br />This may sound weird, but Tom Hardy is hot.  Ok, so that isn't weird par-say; but it is weird coming from me.  What I mean by that is that the man is a marvel of physical appearance.  The fact that he is naked often in this film (his battle outfit of choice) doesn't hurt either.  Apparently, if I do 2,500 push ups a day for five weeks I can look like him too.  I started yesterday.<br /><br />Breaking away from my obsession with his body (not an `I want to take him to bed obsession' but an `I wish I looked like him' obsession), the performance he delivers is FLAWLESS.  It's funny because I just got done raving Colin Firth for his marvelous performance in `A Single Man' (toting it as the best of last year) and I'm almost tempted to say that Hardy was better.  The performances are so different, yet they are both so complex.  The way that Hardy taps into the chaotic drive that lays springloaded in the back of Bronson's mind is intoxicating, and the way that he plays to the strengths of the oddness of the script is just spot on.  He really understands how to layer this character in all the right ways, creating multiple personalities that don't feel dislocated but at the same time never feel completely coherent.  It is also a vanity free performance (I mean, he looks amazing but there is not an ounce of validation there), a fearless one, and I always commend the actor who is willing to `go there'.<br /><br />Tom Hardy goes there, and then some.<br /><br />This may sound weird, but the fact that not all of this is true only makes this film all the more amazing.  I know that biopics get lamblasted at times for not staying true to reality, but the fact that Bronson's reality is one steeped in the fascination with fame makes the fabrication of his world all the more pertinent to understanding who he really is.  He is a celebrity, but not the usual kind.  He is the self imagined kind, and so making his world even more macabre helps us get inside his head and relish every moment of it.<br /><br />If you want something out of the norm that will touch you unexpectedly and stay with you longer than most other films, grab hold of `Bronson' and don't let it go!(toting it as the best of last year) and I'm almost tempted to say that Hardy was better.

0765326353|5.0|Don't want to spend too much time writing this up. Enough people have already said how excellent it is. I am a little sorry that I read it right now though; I would rather not have to wait for the next volume. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long. If it takes more than two years, I will definitely re-read \\"The Way of Kings\\". It is too good a story to lose continuity.
B0007OCG56|3.0|I'm not going to lay out the fact that James L. Brooks is one of the best film directors to ever walk the planet, because so many others have already pointed that out and really, most complaints directed at `Spanglish' are based on the fact that it just doesn't live up to the reputation that surrounds Brooks.<br /><br />I came at this from a different approach.<br /><br />Instead of looking at the director, I came at this looking at the star; Adam Sandler.  Now, Adam and I have a rocky relationship.  His early comedic work, in my opinion, was fresh and exciting (`Happy Gilmore' is still a uproarious ride).  His recent work is repetitive and crude.  He has slivers of greatness achieved, most notably when working with strong co-stars (as was the case in '50 First Dates') but he has recently become the worst part of any film he is in (see the dreadfully conceived `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry').  So, watching `Spanglish' seemed like walking into a trap.<br /><br />I mean this is Sandler meets Brooks; not a combination for the most fluid offering.<br /><br />And that is the most disturbing part of `Spanglish', it just doesn't flow.  What starts off like a chaotic comedy that just needs a touch of focus turns, almost too suddenly, into a heartbreaking drama.  I mean, it feels like two very different films.  There needed to be some balance.<br /><br />Ok, so while I'm laying out faults I'll just spill it all right here.  The initial premise is kind of cheesy in a total `that would never happen, would it' kind of way.  Having the whole story told in a college essay submission seems, at a glance, to be inspired, but it isn't, and the way the essay is closed is rather stupid (and watching a group of adults smiling ridiculously over the essay itself got the film started off on a weird note).  The character development, especially within the relationships, is choppy at best.  John, the perfect husband, is too perfect.  It just doesn't make sense.  Deborah is a total mess, but for me she was the most understandable of the characters.  Sure, she was insane and kind of (or more than kind of) irritating but she was emotionally unstable and remarkably human (especially when the film takes that sudden turn and her performance is required to sell us on everything the script cannot).  For me, I just didn't get Flor.  I mean, I got what she was trying to do with her daughter and I respect the intention, but she came off a tad underdeveloped, and her character is the crux of the entire film.  The relationship that buds between her and John is predictable and annoying.<br /><br />Oh, and Cloris Leachman is hilarious, even if her character is BEYOND clich&eacute;d and feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />But, the film has surprising heart.  I loved the character of Bernice.  I mean, she had such depth even if her character was underwritten (Sarah Steele was the star of this show for me).  Tea Leoni was all sorts of manic brilliance here, and the way she sells that sudden scene of destitution was FLAWLESS (in fact, despite being totally out of no where and kind of unbalanced, that scene is the best part of the film and shows so clearly how this film COULD have been had the script been more focused).<br /><br />It tries, and it succeeds in parts, but the overall feel of `Spanglish' is that it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It tries to hard to sell the `funny' in the beginning and then it tries too hard to sell the `drama' in the end.  It comes off choppy with moments of brilliance masked by layers of missed opportunities.standable of the characters.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|My family enjoyed this action adventure movie. Reminds me of The Mummy, Van Helsing & Indiana Jones, just pure entertainment. It's obviously not an Oscar-type movie so we watched it without our critical eyes, otherwise I'm sure we'd have caught a lot of \\"what-the-heck?!\\" kind of things that don't make sense. We thought this film was a wholesome, fun family get-together movie that we could watch over & over again. There's a lot of good action movies that have lame storylines, but hey, we're watching for pure entertainment & this movie fits the bill.
B003VIW8DK|2.0|Rhett Davies usually produces Ferry with an iron fist in a velvet glove.  I think Davies must have really bad arthritis these days.  Some of the more stripped down songs (if that is at all possible) are fine, but overall the gloss it too high and would have benefited from less ala Frantic or his earlier solo work.  I can only hope if that mythical Roxy album in-the-making ever sees the light of day that it be simple by half of Olympia.

1580084621|3.0|Well, I'm one of the odd ones I guess who isn't blown away by the book. It's ok. I've only had it a short while and made two dishes + pastes. They were good, altho not mind blowing and actually some of his instruction is quite vague. The curry dish didn't look anything like the photo i.e. thick, chunkey, very red. Mine was light pinkish, not thick or chunky. I know my way around the kitchen, especially with Asian food, so the jury is still out on this one. In the meantime, I'm checking out other books on the subject.
0811870413|5.0|This book is a labor of love. It's a quest for perfection, for the mastering of a craft. It could be about archery, motorcycle maintenance or watchmaking. It's about bread, and it's everything I was looking for. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is a great series! I missed some of the beginning episodes on Starz during the original broadcast so I bought the DVD. I am glad I did. The story line is very well done and the actors are first class. Because there is a lot of violence in the action scenes and some nudity, the show is for an adult audience. I don't usually purchase movie DVDs but this is one I will watch again. Once you start viewing the series it is hard to stop. I look forward to continuation of the series.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This album really amazed me. This is solid traditional heavy metal at its best. I am a long time Accept fan but I'd rate this cd even higher than 'Balls to the Wall' or 'Breaker'. This album has endless great riffs, very effective rhythm section and anthemic melody and chorus that Accept was well known for decades.   Also many people were worried about the new singer of Accept, Mark. As it turned out, the new singer is just amazing. Some think he's on par with Udo. But in my humble opinion, he is better singer than Udo. Character of voice might sound similiar but Mark has wider range and delivery. His high note delivery is one of the best in the business. I did not give this album 5 star because I am a long time fan of the band. Even if this album was released by a new band that I have never  heard of, I would still give perfect rating score. This album is real deal. To my ears, this album is easily the most impressive comeback album of the decade.

0439023513|3.0|First I have to say that the entire trilogy is just so well-written. Collins is an amazing writer and she created a likeable but flawed character in Katniss who is exactly the kind of heroine the series needed. I thought the first two books were phenomenal. I had high expectations for Mockingjay--and in some ways she fulfilled them. Again, the writing was solid, the characters were real to me, I never stopped liking Katniss, and Gale and Peeta remained those pieces to the love triangle that were so essential. But I really feel like the author went too far. She just stepped over that boundary of making the series too depressing. There was never any danger of there being a happily-ever-after, neatly wrapped up ending--so I think she could have held back a little at the end. When I finished reading the book, I felt emotionally drained and depressed. I wish she had let Prim live. Taking Prim (and killing off all those other children) left the reader in a very dark place. And when you've already been trudging through the darkness with Katniss for nearly three books, ending with a little more hope would have been so much better. I think hope in any dark situation is necessary, how can we live without it? And Collins gave us a little of that--I was so glad Peeta lived. But knowing Katniss would never live near her mother and that Prim was gone forever just felt like more than was needed. Losing Finnick to those mutations was awful--there was so much loss in the series. The end was like the worst sucker-punch of all--killing Prim.     So while the series was incredibly creative and well-written, I have to say that I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I'd hoped. Prepare to be depressed. You have to read it for closure, but I thought Hunger Games and Catching Fire were so much more satisfying.

B001H5X7KC|5.0|Pardon me if I sound like Frasier Crane, but enjoying satire requires a certain intellectual distance. One has to be able to step outside one's normal view of things and imagine them as if they'd been pushed to their illogical conclusions. I'm not joking when I say that the inability of people to \\"get\\" \\"Tropic Thunder\\" or \\"Idiocracy\\" or \\"Starship Troopers\\" is correlated with social problems -- most notably the general stupidity of American society. (Do you think people like Karl Rove or Sarah Palin understand satire?)<br /><br />Whatever...<br /><br />Ben Stiller's approach to satire is not unlike Stan Freberg's -- you locate whatever is shallow, self-serving, or just plain stupid in your chosen subject, then hit it repeatedly with sledge hammer. (This works particularly well when satirizing war films.) The result is some of the most hysterically funny scenes I've seen in a long time. (Mervin Tuttle, in particular, would enjoy this film.) The first 15 minutes -- including the Coming Attractions trailers (\\"This preview has been approved for audiences\\"), and the consequences of Tug Speedwell's catching a rocket-propelled bomb in mid-air, are almost worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Whether \\"Tropic Thunder\\" will go down as a classic in the future remains unknown to this day. But there are precious few films that satirize Hollywood film making, and \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is an outstanding addition to that short list.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian's workouts are tough and very productive; she has a great personality and motivates you very well to stick with it, even when you're hurting.  This DVD is problematic, however, as you MUST sit through a lot of introductory/promotional shpiels before finally getting to the menu and the workouts.  You CANNOT fast-forward through this intro material and must sit there, waiting, while it runs its course every single time you want to work out.  This should be corrected.

044654759X|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a prolific writer who has captured a reading public that devours everything he publishes.  While I enjoy his work, I am not a rabid fan and have probably read about five of his novels over the years.<br /><br />\\"Safe Haven\\" is his latest novel and, compared to his other efforts, a bit on the darker side.  I remember most of his novels being largely sappy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing since sometimes that's exactly what I am looking for) and I know what I am going to get when I pick one up.  This one started out the same and I knew the basic plot line within a very few chapters.  Katie is a young woman who shows up in Southport, North Carolina and keeps very much to herself and has a haunted look about her.  She works as a waitress at a local beach restaurant but none of her coworkers know where she came from or what her story is.  Widower Alex owns the local general store and gets to know Katie when she comes in for groceries and she is captivated by his two young children.  The setup is familiar and you know where this is headed.  As I began the story, I was thinking this was a 3-star read and settled in to watch the story unfold.  While much of what I predicted came to pass, there are a few twists and turns with a surprise ending that actually brought this up another star in my opinion.  Also, someone from Katie's past is a main character and the writing of what is going on in his mind is done so well that it also led me to a 4-star rating.<br /><br />What started out as a \\"ho-hum\\" read escalated into a novel I had a hard time putting down and left me thinking about it after having closed the book for the last time -- Grittier, harder to read, and more \\"meaty\\" than other Sparks' offerings.
0374290024|5.0|This book is so near perfection as would be possible. The only criticism I can think of is the one Boon L. Kwan already mentioned: the maybe overly materialistic view. In the entire book, I noted only one (1) factual error (Rollo was not made king (but duke) of Normandy.)    This book is for readers who like things such as \\"Collapse\\" by Jared Diamond, \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" by Samuel P. Huntington, \\"Ascent of Money\\" (TV series by Niall Ferguson), \\"The Ascent of Man\\" (TV series by Jacob Bronowski), \\"Civilisation\\" (TV series by Kenneth Clark), and \\"In search of the Trojan war (TV series by Michael Wood).
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The Temple Grandin story is very inspirational.  The movie tells her story in a way that shows how important intense and caring education is for people with autism.  The movie also shows how much people with autism can achieve.  So called normal people need to learn how to understand people that think differently, and this movie is very educational in that respect.  I have bought several copies for friends.  They have enjoyed the movie as much as I did.

0307346617|5.0|About 4 years ago, someone told me about this book, and I was instantly interested, but I never saw it in a book store when I was looking and kept forgetting about it. Then one day I get a notice from good old Amazon that it was on sale for less than $7. With my student Prime Membership, I could not pass up this deal. And it was well worth every cent.  The book, as you may know, is a collection of interviews of people who survived a zombie war. It starts with stories of the early days of occasional outbreaks, through the \\"Great Panic\\" that ensued, and ends with the reclaiming of infected territories and rebuilding the world.   If you are looking at this review, you obviously have a \\"thing\\" for the zombie genre and are quite familiar with many movies. And you know the reason why zombie stories are great is the characters and how they interact with each other in a time of great turmoil. And most zombie movies take place during the beginning or during the worst of the zombie fight, with just a few people band together trying to survive. All those stories left me wondering, what about the rest of the world. You know these are not the only people alive (or at least hope not.) This book gives you those stories. It takes you one a ride through different point of view from all around the world, from different cultures. It shows you how the world dealt with the horror. These stories seem real, like you could not make this stuff up. (Although Max Brook obviously did). If you love that human element to the zombie dramas, you will love this book.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|There is no better way to bring in this Holiday season than to purchase Mariah Carey's new Christmas album, appropriately titled, \\"Merry Christmas II You.\\" From the fun, upbeat \\"Oh Santa\\" to the vocally astounding \\"O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus\\" (which features her mom's incredible operatice vocals), this album is a winner! \\"Christmas Time Is In The Air Again\\" is perfect background music as you're opening up those gifts on Christmas morning. \\"One Child\\" is an emotionally charged song, giving glory to God/Jesus, and even if you're not religious (I am actually Agnostic!), you will still appreciate the lyrics and vocal performance. \\"Here Comes Santa Claus,\\" is one of most fun songs on the album - you can't help but groove along to the beat, a perfect song to play while you're decorating your house and tree! \\"The First Noel/Born Is The King Interlude\\" is a great track, soft and warm, with a great R&B twist at the end. \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy\\" is strong track, too - great vocal delivery and clever mix of these two Christmas classics. \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" is indeed an odd song (the Charlie Brown music at the beginning throws you for a loop), but Mariah turns it into a lovely, mellow song. \\"When Christmas Comes\\" is very reminiscent of a song on Mariah's critically acclaimed album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" - lyrics, beat, and vocals are fantastic! \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is the perfect song to end the Christmas album; it starts out subtle, with Mariah flexing her vocal chops, but soon enough you find yourself in a New York City club waiting for the Times Square Ball to drop. Overall, this album is nothing short of spectacular.     If you want to listen to great music and amazing vocals this holiday season, purchase this fantastic album! A perfect blend of traditional and new. 5/5
0439023521|5.0|Of course, I know that there's always something new to be written. But sometimes it seems like everything has been done and so many books are just re-tellings of others. The Hunger Games completely shocked me. It took me to a world I never even imagined in the slightest. A world that is actually incredibly possible at some point in our future.<br /><br />It's the kind of book I don't want to give too much away on because part of the pleasure of it came to me from being totally surprised non-stop. I went into this book having absolutely no idea what it was about and being a bit apprehensive about it since it was labeled \\"young adult.\\" But I'm so, so happy I read it.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is the perfect heroine and a character you'll be cheering for non-stop. Just make sure you set aside some time to finish this book. I stayed up until 4 a.m. literally unable to put the book down. I kept telling myself \\"5 more pages,\\" only to keep reading. It's that good.<br /><br />Just read it. It's quick and will take your mind to a whole new world. Very much worth it!

0061537969|5.0|Loved the story about a family struggle with death, children, and interfering grandparents.  As a lawyer I found the story of the legal drama very realistic.  It skips all the legal stuff because it is told by a dog who makes it clear that he was not in the courtroom.  However, the story of the interfering grandparents and their desires over the desires of the father of the family ring true.  I have been there, done that case more than once.  The vehicle (no pun intended) for the story is the art of car racing, how the race is won and the trials and mishaps along the way, the allegory for the family life.  And all of it is charmingly told by Enzo, the dog.  I heard the voice of my own dog and basically read the story to my dog to get her opinion.  Wonderful, tragic, funny, and fun.  This is a five star read for me.
0439023491|5.0|The first book was awesome.  Left you with a cliff-hanger at the end that made me want to read the second book immediately. I didn't think the second book would be bette than the first but I ended up liking it even MORE than the first one! I can't believe all the crazy things that happen to Katniss.  This series was hard to put down and I read it into the early morning hours.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the two best Agatha Christie books I've ever read (the other being &#34;Five Little Pigs&#34;). Christie's spellbinding story-telling is at its finest as she takes the reader to desolate Soldier Island and through the final hours of ten accused murderers whose crimes are of such a nature that the police cannot bring them to justice. The reader is left as helpless and shocked as the characters themselves as they try desperately to solve the mystery of the unknown avenger before they all die. Christie shifts the viewpoint between the condemned characters, revealing the truth of the accusations and keeping the reader guessing the whole time. The book kept me fully engaged and in the dark until the end. Definately recommeded reading for all Agatha Christie fans and fans of mystery novels!

B003ZJJFKE|4.0|This album ROCKS!  Most of the songs are destined to be Satch Classics - Pyrrhic Vic, Light Years Away, Wormhole Wizards, and God is Crying.  I can't seem to get enough of Wormhole Wizards - that's just something about the song that's intoxicating.<br />There are two or three tunes that do however seem a little out of place - Littleworth Lane and The Golden Room.  They are good - but I've found myself skipping over them a time or two.<br />Great work Satch - Thank you!
0143118420|1.0|I'm shocked at the popularity of this book. I picked up this book hoping it would be a book about how to take care of ourselves and others while relying on God in the process. This book is nothing of the sort. It is about a woman who abandons a marriage that isn't broken, takes on a lover before the divorce is final then leaves him and goes on an expense paid vacation for a year to find herself and another lover. Ladies, does the popularity of this book point to us being this shallow?     Elizabeth Gilbert feels God speaks to her on her bathroom floor and gives her an out for her marriage. Does she ever stop to think that indeed God showed her love in a time of difficulty but He doesn't condone her actions? I firmly believe her misery and trials are of her own making, and not the fault of her husband, her lover, or New York's law. We don't really live in a society that is that self-centered and disposable, do we?     As a busy woman in my 30's I am keenly aware of the fact that if I don't get enough sleep, save a bit of down time for myself every day, have someone to talk to, and take an occasional vacation I am not a good wife and mother and I'm not happy. But thank heavens that is not what my life is. Family, church, work, and community service encompass the majority of my life. And if I didn't have the latter, my life would be as shallow as the author, Elizabeth Gilbert's and I'd be has unhappy as she is, miserably going from one pleasure to the next trying to find myself.     I'm an avid reader and this is the worst book I have read in years. I love books that make me a better person, books that help me remember, and books that are simply \\"mind candy\\". This book falls into none of these categories. This is a book that questions my faith in womankind.

This blu-ray edition of The Sound of Music has excellent picture and audio quality.  It is a big step up from the VHS and even the DVD.  Those who have a Blu-ray Player need to get this movie on blu-ray.  Even if you don't have a blu-ray player right now, but are planning on getting one later on, it comes with a DVD copy.  Overall this is a fantastic blu-ray release for all fans of The Sound of Music.

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I love Clint Eastwood's movies, I've seen all in the last 25+ years. The older Eastwood gets, the more thoughtful.<br />Hereafter is a movie, and psychics and the afterlife, which Clint at 80+ might be thinking about.<br /><br />The action, the main action in the movie starts with a Tsunami in south east Asia. A lead character, Marie Lelay, played by Cecile de France, hard-edged news reporter gets caught in the rising waters, drowns, and has a near-death experience. She experiences the afterlife before coming back to this one. This experience changes her life from a skeptic. The other hero, George Lonegan, played by Matt Damon, is a reluctant psychic. There is also a young boy searching for answers about death. I won't reveal more of the plot.<br /><br />This is a gentle and thoughtful movie, well acted and well directed, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Like why the Damon is so reluctant to help people? Why he feels compelled to tell people all the negative things he \\"sees\\"? I have met psychics who do this on a daily basis, who are much better, much more psychic, who tell their clients more than the Damon character. They are not bothered by having this gift at all.<br /><br />The main action here is the tsunami, in the first ten minutes. The rest is love story with a lot of synchronicities. These synchronicities tend to happen to and around psychics and not to most skeptics. The world (or our experience of it) expands or contracts depending upon our expectation of it (!) I had expected Eastwood would do more with his themes, but he didn't. he chose to stick close the the generally agreed reality. I would have liked to see more hereafter in Hereafter.<br /><br />Actually there is an amazing convergence of opinion from people who have experienced near-death and psychics about what to expect in the afterlife (though not from organized religions).  If you have no not heard of these things you will find this movie fascinating. Very mainstream, really. From all acccounts I've heard, this is a short glimpse of what to expect, \\"you won't be alone\\"...a short glimpse of what to expect, \\"you won't be alone\\"...

0470638842|2.0|Socialnomics takes its name from the combination of Economics and Social Media.  The book is a decent overview to the concepts behind Social Media.  As an instructor of Social Media Marketing (Google Jason McDonald and Social Media) , I am always looking for new ideas and new topics to share with my students.  Qualman has a good way with words, pointing out - for example - that \\"Word of Mouth\\" is becoming \\"World of Mouth\\" via Social Media, but in many ways the book reads more like a New York Times magazine piece than a practical guide to Social Media.  Especially for businesspeople or marketers seeking to leverage Social Media as a marketing venue, this book falls short.<br /><br />Much of the book deals with the now obvious trends in Social Media.  Seeing what your friends like, or buy, on Facebook encourages you to buy the same.  Or, if you are researching a new type of baby carriage... knowing what similar friends recommend is a good thing.  More interestingly, Qualman points out that nothing remains private for ever on the Internet - we all live in Glass Houses - so be careful what you post - both companies and persons.  He also indicates that Social Media is often supportive, or intertwined, with traditional marketing, as in the Saturday Night Live spoofs of Sarah Palin that went viral and also boosted traditional viewership of SNL.<br /><br />So, as a magazine piece or journalistic read, this is a decent book.  I am always looking for Social Media Marketing ideas for myself, my students, and my clients... and here there are good tidbits but no overarching conceptual framework.  The author criticizes Google and pay-per-click advertising and points out how advertising on Facebook or LinkedIn may be more valuable, since it is based on profiles rather than keywords.  Using Social Media for advertising or marketing should have been a major focus of a book marrying economics and social media, but unfortunately it is a relatively minor part of this work.<br /><br />All in all, a good - but no great - read.no great - read.
0609610570|4.0|My Opinion<br />There is plenty of actionable material and lots of ideas to share with the officers of your company (a dynamic HR department, developing a company budget in three days). I don't care for the style and format that the book was written in. It jumps from straight forward discussions to side commentaries by Larry & Ram.<br /><br />The Big Idea<br />Leadership without the discipline of execution is incomplete and ineffective, plans remain only plans. Organizations of Execution have three things; 1) a strong business Leader, 2) execution must be the core element of an organizations culture, 3) discipline integral to strategy.<br /><br />Business Leader<br /><br />Only the leader can set the tone for an organization.<br /><br />The Leader must be in charge of getting things done by running three core processes; picking other leaders, setting strategic direction and conduction operations.<br /><br />Seven essential behaviors of a leader:<br />1. Leaders must `live' their business. They have to know more than just the basics because they have to ask the tough questions.<br />2. Insist on realism. You keep a realistic view of the company by constantly asking questions.<br />3. Set clear goals and priorities. Focusing on three or four priorities will produce the best results from the resources at hand, K.I.S.S.<br />4. Follow through. Failure to follow through is the major cause of poor execution.<br />5. Reward the doers. You have to make clear that rewards and respect are based on execution.<br />6. Expand People's Capabilities. Coaching is the single most important part of expanding an organization's capabilities. The most effective way to coach is to observe and provide useful feedback. Feedback is both what is being done right and what needs to be changed.<br />7. Know Yourself. It takes emotional fortitude to be open to people and information. It takes fortitude to deal with those who are not performing. It comes from self-discovery and self mastery.<br />a. Authenticity. Be real. What you see is what you get.<br />b. Self Awareness. Self discipline and self awareness.<br />c. Humility. Learn how to listen. Admit that you don't know everything. Admit mistakes.<br /><br />Culture of Execution<br /><br />An organization's culture is a sum of it's shared values, beliefs, and norms of behaviors.<br />The inability to act decisively is rooted in the corporate culture. The leaders create this culture and they are the only ones that can change it.<br />Cultural change gets real when your aim is execution. Most efforts at cultural change fail because they are not linked to improving the business's outcomes.<br /><br />The foundation of changing behavior is linking rewards to performance and making the linkages transparent. You want differentiation among options, bonuses, and salary increases.<br /><br />The people process is more important than strategy or operations. A good people process evaluates, develops and plans for succession. It requires integrity, honesty, a common approach, common language, frequency and above all candid dialog.<br /><br />The People Process:<br />1. Companies need to plan out near term, medium term, and long term strategies.<br />a. Hire and train people to meet these strategies.<br />2. The Leadership Pipeline<br />a. Having succession depth prevents employees from stagnating and prevents people from moving up too quickly.<br />b. Talent reviews - Everyone is reviewed against their current job and potential future jobs.<br />i. Four Basic Competencies to measure are: Functional skills, Business Skills, Management Skills, and Leadership skills.<br />ii. They will fall in one of three categories: Good Fit, A Stretch, or Action Required.<br />c. Managers should also do a retention assessment based on compensation, current role, potential role, effectiveness and risk of loss to the company.<br />3. Non-performers must be addressed; coached, moved or terminated.<br /><br />Four Elements of a robustPeople Process<br />1. A culture of high performance, which makes you demand the best from individuals.<br />2. A leader who is not only willing but also ready to question a person's assessment.<br />3. A collegial culture among the top executives of the enterprise, where they hold each other mutually accountable.<br />4. The Human Resource department that is integrated into the business process.<br /><br />Discipline Integral to Strategy<br /><br />At the Heart of Execution; the people process, the strategy process and the operations process.<br /><br />A strategic plan must be an action plan that business leaders can rely on to reach their business objectives.<br /><br />The substance of any strategy is the key concepts and actions that define it.<br /><br />A business unit strategy defines the direction of the unit. Where it is, where it wants to be, and how it will get there.<br /><br />To be effective a strategy must be constructed by those who are going to execute it.<br /><br />Decide on your objectives: what do you want to get done? What are critical issues to understand? Why in the end is this helpful?<br /><br />A Strong Strategic Plan must address the following questions:<br />1. What is the assessment of the external environment?<br />2. How well do we understand existing markets or events?<br />3.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|This film is fresh as a newborn baby! Having seen it in 1960 first time and 2010 the second time I am surprised of its impact, which now at 68 is different from the age of 18. The real difference must have taken place in me and not the film and somehow this difference does not seem to be important. Much more important is the message of the story by Kathryn Hulme, which is so beautifully interpreted in the head role by Audrey Hepburn, other actors and good direction.<br /><br />What made a particular impression on me was the depth of Monastery practises, the language used to express these and the inner world of happenings in there and moreover that the nun chose to get out in order to help those who are outside and to come back to life.

He always longed to be a racer and has human qualities that really sets him apart. All of this is very realistic. Enzo will be your favorite character ever. The literature of this book is also fantastic. Well written and just great! Dog lovers rejoice and read this book!!!!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I had seen a little about the history behind Amazing Grace, the song; but, this movie fleshed it out and furnished \\"the rest of the story\\"..and what a story it is!<br />I had ancestors who were involved with the Wilburforce Commission House/s and it helped me to see what they'd gone thru, getting my genes to me! ;)  Touching, awe-inspiring tale of redemption and destiny.  Can't recommend it enough. A treasure.  The bonus material was icing on the cake.  Truth trumps fiction, once again!
B000PGTPE6|5.0|combination of folk, dixie with a bit of cajun and improviation performed with a lot of juice.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let the Right One In is a rare accomplishment in a genre that has been stale and lifeless for some time. It takes the vampire story and successfully brings us characters that are empathetic, vulnerable, sweet and chilling. Lina Leandersson totally inhabits the character of Eli; making us truly feel for the tragic story of, what I believe, is still an innocent child. For an actor of 11 in her first role, Leandersson is amazing in the subtle nuances that she gives to Eli. Her large eyes exude sadness and unspoken thoughts while an ineffable air shows us why she is \\"twelve, more or less.\\" Kare Hedebrant has not gotten his full due as Oskar, the bullied and isolated boy who finds love, kinship and a soulmate in Eli. Without his convincing portrayal of Oskar's vulnerability and pain, the story would not have worked.    Director Tomas Alfredson takes his time to allow the relationship to build and to show why Eli and Oskar would be drawn to each other. He also successfully uses the landscape and atmosphere to increase the feeling of cold and isolation that draws the two main characters together. I believe the best way to watch the film is with the theatrical subtitles and Swedish language.    Regarding the details of the DVD; the audio and video quality is excellent and the setup gives you a variety of audio options. The features are a bit sparse but, what is there is entertaining. I particularly liked the \\"Behind the Scenes\\" feature, though it was a little short.    I believe you can't go wrong with this movie or DVD and you will quickly fall in love with Lina Leandersson's portrayal of Eli. A unique gem of a movie in a worn out genre.
B003NFM3JU|2.0|The animation of this movie didn't suit my style. I photo realistic style doesn't translate well with kids animation. The story was alright as well. You can't go wrong with Jim though.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|We are truly a hype-crazed society, and I'll admit, I contributed my signature to the petition to get this so-called horrifying film released into cinemas all over the country. \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is proof that a little hype goes a long, long way. To this film's credit, the premise is quite clever and was proof that the filmmakers saw their measly budget of $15,000 not as a hindrance, but as an opportunity. Put a young couple in the middle of a haunting and have them record the nightly occurrences so they can better understand what is happening and figure out how to stop it. Place a few lines at the beginning of the film that set it up as \\"real footage\\" and let the scares begin.    Therein lies the problem as we're all aware of this gimmick and it becomes a challenge to dismiss the \\"scripted\\" nature of the film, especially when nothing of interest occurs for its near hour and a half runtime. The \\"activities\\" which are recorded each night amount to very little when you know that there is some special effect or camera trick being employed. The activities themselves - which range from a door slightly swinging, a creak heard down the hall - just don't have the gravitas they need to overcome the knowledge that what we're watching is fake. Had this footage been undeniably real, it would be terrifying and the subtleties would take on new meaning.    The story also suffers from some pacing issues. It follows a simple structure - the couple, filming while they sleep, then viewing and discussing the night's events the next day, with a little character development thrown in. Unfortunately, since much of the recorded \\"hauntings\\" are so unsatisfying, the time spent on the couple is dull and the viewer wishes for the sun to quickly set so we can see another haunting. The night scenes become a let down as the hauntings just aren't that interesting.    In the final minutes of the film, the hauntings do increase in intensity. It was much needed. Still, the film just doesn't satisfy and it is evident that the filmmakers ignored some major opportunities to terrify the audience: (1) an EVP which is recorded is never magnified or played slowly to actually hear what is said, instead, the boyfriend is content to just say \\"it\\" communicated; (2) the investigation of some image or design burned into a Ouiji board by the entity is kept rather superficial and not given enough screen time; and (3) a story arc involving another young woman who experienced similar activity which ultimately ended in her demise is wholly underdeveloped and underused.    Things that go bump in the night are scary, and I'm certainly not asking the filmmakers to have given us a film of superficial jump scares and constant in-your-face \\"boos,\\" but what was shown just doesn't ever hit the terror bone, at least it didn't for the group I saw it with.
0307454541|4.0|I found this hard to put down. The beginning was a little slow, but I couldn't wait to find out where it would lead. If you are uncomfortable with sexual sadism and incest, you may not find this suitable reading. I thought it was very well done. Not something you would expect to come out of Sweden.
0312600844|1.0|I freely admit I did not finish this book and will not attempt to give it a full review. It was just too much effort to read. If I'm not engrossed by the first 100 pages, I'm not going to waste any more time trying. By that point, I cared only vaguely about the main character, Patti, but not enough to keep slogging thru the incredibly cumbersome prose. Based on other reviews I've seen, apparently a lot of people loved it, but I read just enough to know I'm never going to be one of them.
B00168OIOE|5.0|One of pixar's best movie.. My little sister was actually scared of the villain when he reappeared.
1416594795|5.0|How sad that a book like this must be necessary.  We truly are marching directly into the Neanderthal Age once more.  Hooray for Richard Dawkins who is not daunted by the need and fills it admirably.  It is an excellent book.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Perhaps it's a bit curious that my favorite book is also my favorite movie, such is the case with Interview with the Vampire, and I've wondered whether my love for the story and the themes I connect with so much made me miss some faults with the movie. But the more I re-watch it, the more I am convinced it is a genuine masterpiece that deserves much more recognition than it gets.     From the cinematography to the acting, everything is spectacular. The establishing shot of the San Francisco bridge with the modern city glittering in the background to the music of \\"Libera Me\\" is one of the most haunting and beautiful movie intros I have ever seen. I think the film, even though it has both major and minor differences from the novel, is so successful because it manages to bring to life the style of the novel. Some plots are skipped or shortened in order to fit into the two hour limit, but the frame lingers on precisely those subtle moments that matter most. Louis watching his final sunset, the tear that drops on his hand when he remembers Claudia, his resignation to having lost his \\"last breath of humanity\\" on that balcony in Paris...this is what constitutes intelligent pacing, in my opinion.     The acting is also extraordinary. Kirsten Dunst usually gets the most praise for her performance, as she should, as it's amazing how she handled the material at such a young age. But in my opinion, and I realize not all share it, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are incredible as well. Again, even with the minor differences, I felt that both actors were deeply in-tune with their characters, and gave the material full justice. I would be very surprised if they had not both read and mediated on the book thoroughly beforehand. As a film major, I think of myself as moderately knowledgeable about movies, yet I would struggle to name two more emotionally dedicated performances. It's very curious to me why they haven't worked together again, even just for the commercial success such a partnership would generate.     If there are other film adaptations of the Chronicles, hopefully the same amount of commitment and understanding of the story will be involved. Queen of the Damned, even though there are a couple of things I liked about it, didn't even try to give justice to the books.
B001AR0D4A|1.0|Coming from the man who made two of the best dramas of the 90s (Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile) and one of the best films EVER (Shawshank)...this film feels similar to seeing Shyamalan go from \\"Signs\\" to \\"The Village\\". What a major letdown!!    All the people praising the end of this film should actually go and READ THE NOVELLA!!     What starts as a great exploration of the human condition in the midst of insurmountable odds and horrific circumstances...ends with a slap in the face of the audience...for no other sensible reason than to shock.
B001EOQWFI|4.0|I would give the story a solid B. The overall enjoyment of this movie was okay, but the attention to detail in design was excellent (A+).<br />I enjoy watching the nuances of this movie like the moving lights inside of Eve's body and how the lenses in Wall-E eyes focused.
0553805371|5.0|For 'reality' to be so much stranger than fiction ever could is the best world story available. I LOVE the idea that the universe spontaneously burst upon the scene with no previous design. I'm reading it again, of course.  It is so dense, I'm prepared to read it quite a few more times to absorb all of the information.  An excellent piece of work!

B003WTE886|5.0|Singer/songwriter Taylor Swift turned out a very successful CD with this release; and I can tell why--this music is excellent with songs both catchy and memorable. The musical arrangements are very well done and Taylor is squarely front and center--which is right where she belongs! The liner notes have the lyrics to the songs and incredible artwork; the quality of the sound is excellent, too.<br /><br />\\"Mine\\" gets the royal treatment from Taylor who never lets go of a superfluous note; and the beat along with that melody make this a strong opening tune for the album. \\"Sparks Fly\\" is very well done; and there's yet another gem in \\"Back to December\\" which is poignant, to say the least. \\"Speak Now\\" is quite good and Taylor does justice to other songs like \\"Dear John\\" with that guitar to enhance the tune even more; \\"Mean\\" with that fine percussion and Taylor singing to perfection and beyond; \\"The Story of Us\\" that boasts another fine beat with Taylor singing at her usual very best; \\"Never Grow Up\\" which is another poignant song that Taylor delivers with lots of genuine feeling and emotion; the haunting \\"Enchanted;\\" \\"Better Than Revenge\\" with its aggressive flavor; \\"Innocent;\\" \\"Haunted\\" that really has Taylor opening up and throwing herself into her fine performance; \\"Last Kiss\\" and the closing track, \\"Long Live.\\"<br /><br />Taylor Swift fans will enjoy this new album from her; it's a must-have for their collections. It's also a great starter CD for anyone just discovering Taylor Swift's incredible artistry.

B002HMHRGE|5.0|I love this album. Enough said about that.    I ordered the 2009 version, listed as Sbme Special Mkts label, two times from Amazon and once from Borders. Each time I received the 1997 RCA version, with no indication inside or out that it is somehow the '09 reissue but without updated graphics or booklet to indicate Sbme. I inquired with both Amazon and Borders but no one could explain what the problem is; and I finally settled for what is apparently the '97 version.    Does anyone know the deal?, and has anyone ever actually received the supposed '09 Sbme label version? thanks for any insight.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I was very SATICFIED with my recent purchase. It came on time and they wasted no time in getting my product to me!
B003WTE886|5.0|This is a great solid CD release by the talented Taylor Swift titled \\"Speak Now\\". The CD opens up with a good track/first single/video, \\"Mine\\", a song has great guitar chords & great vocals. The next three tracks, \\"Sparks Fly\\", \\"Back To December\\" & \\"Speak Now\\" : are in the same mold as the opening track in a good way, signaling that Taylor Swift has arrived & her critics better shut-up! Then things start to hot in (from here & then onwards) \\"Dear John\\", a slow solid track with great guitar entrance & great vocals with a sweet melody. \\"Mean\\", a beautiful typical country song with a great Spanish guitar sound. \\" The Story Of Us\\", a beautiful racy song with great rhythm guitar sound. \\" Never Grow Up\\", a slow acoustic guitar track with great vocals & harmonies. Its lyrics are simple but very effective, \\"Hey darling don't ever grow up, don't ever grow up, stay this simple\\". \\"Enchanted\\", a solid track with great guitar chords/vocals/harmonies. It's my favourite from this great CD. \\"Better Than Revenge\\", is a rather my weakest track in this CD. A rocky track, Taylor Swift rather sounding like Avril Lavigne on this one. \\"Innocent\\", a good song. \\"Haunted\\", another great track. \\"Last Kiss\\", an amazing solid slow number, great guitar entrance & beautifully well interlaced violin. \\"Long Live\\", is a closing solid track with great lead/rhythm guitar. Overall, this is an excellent CD release from this talented young artist (a singer-songwriter who seemingly wrote all 14 tracks on this CD!) who has managed to silence her critics with this release, \\"Speak Now\\". A highly recommended listening.
0439023513|5.0|This was as good as the previous two.  I was as glued to it as the other two.  This trilogy is really well written and I'm dying to see what else to come from Suzanne Collins.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Mariah has done what many thought she would not be able to do - she has made a Christmas album that is a worthy follow-up to her 16-year old classic album Merry Christmas.  Though many will probably disagree with me, I actually think this one is a bit better than the first one.  But regardless, this album should be judged on its own merits, though comparisons are inevitable.    The strong points of the album:    Vocals:  These are without a doubt the best vocals Mariah has delivered on an album since the 90s.  There is plenty of full-on belting for fans who want to hear the power of \\"The Voice,\\" but don't expect this throughout the whole album.  Some songs such as \\"Christmas Time is in the Air Again\\" and \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" contain the much dreamy airier vocals that Mariah is also well-known for.  Though some fans might prefer Mariah to just belt through an entire album, the dreamier vocals add a nice balance to the album and really add to the reflective and calming spirit of the holiday season.    Diversity of songs:  Mariah is known for being able to reach out to a diverse audience, and she continues that trend with this album.  There are the fun uptempo tracks (or \\"festive\\") as Mariah would like to call them but there are also beautifully orchestrated ballads, orchestration courtesy of Broadway's Marc Shaiman.  This album has jazzier numbers, funk-inspired R&B and hip hop, as well as a more traditional Christmas feel.  Mariah adds her own personality to the songs without making the album sound too current or different from the traditionals that people know and love.    Original songs:  The original songs on this album are outstanding.  I mean OUTSTANDING!  With perhaps the exception of \\"Oh Santa!\\", a funky uptempo lyrically in the vein of Mariah's classic \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" (also featured on this album), the originals sound like they could be Christmas standards.  \\"Christmas Time is in the Air\\" screams of Sinatra with a jazzy orchestration and a wistful Mariah wishing that we could have the spirit of Christmas with us all throughout the year.  You can just imagine this song being played in a classic black-and-white Christmas film.  \\"When Christmas Comes\\" features a prominent horn section and the clearest and highest belting Mariah has done in ages.  The song has a very old-school soul feel to it ala The Emancipation of Mimi.  Finally, \\"One Child\\" is a beautiful retelling of the birth of Jesus, complete with a children's choir and goosebump-inducing climax.    Duet with Mariah's mom:  The medley \\"O Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah\\" chorus features Mariah's mother, Patricia Carey, an opera singer who helped develop Mariah's vocal abilities growing up.  The mix of Mariah's R&B style of singing with her mom's operatic style might not seem like a match made in heaven, but it works beautifully on this track.  For those who sorely miss Mariah's acrobatic vocal stylings, this track is a must-have.    All in all, if you enjoy Christmas music, Mariah Carey music, or just enjoy a beautifully orchestrated music with stellar vocals, this is a must-have for this holiday season, and I suspect like her first Christmas album, for many holiday seasons to come.
0062502182|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. A good friend recommended it to me, and I was not disappointed!
B0036S4CTS|2.0|\\"One Day\\" has two major players, Dexter and Emma.  The dialogue, particularly Emma's, is fabulously written and quite funny in places.  I liked the premise of the return to the single day throughout the novel to mark the progress of Emma and Dexter's lives through the twenty years they know each other.<br /><br />I do wish these two points saved the day for this book.  Overall the story is just terribly depressing.  Dexter is just a horrible person -- dislikable to the point of making the read unenjoyable.  Is it good writing to make a character so awful?  Perhaps, but not worth the ride for me.<br /><br />I cannot recommend \\"One Day.\\"
B000H9MF5W|5.0|The condition of the book was just as promised.  I received it pretty quickly and I have no complaints.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|...it feels like a classic movie but with Miyazaki's imaginitive story and characters.  The music is fantastic, I listen to the soundtrack over and over.  The story is bittersweet, subtle, poignant, and fills you with nostalgia and longing.  It never hits you over the head with any kind of explanations or messages...it just is...and that's the beauty of this film.  Love it!
1577314808|5.0|This and Eckhart Tolle's follow up book, A New Earth, are both great! I prefer this over the more recent one. I think A New Earth got more exposure and hype because it was on Oprah and such a big Skype discussion for several of her shows. But this one, The Power of Now, was easier for me to grasp and didn't seem as repetitive. A New Earth, basically said the same things this book said, in a different way. The Power of Now is the better read in my opinion. You can also try listening to it on audio book.

0385504225|2.0|After reading \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", this one seems like a cop out.  I feel like Brown was writing it as if it were a movie or that it was going to be made into a movie.  It didn't grab me like the previous ones where I could hardly put them down.  With this one, I felt no urgency to finish, except in the hopes of it being done.  I was disappointed.
B003UYUR10|4.0|Even though it's based on a game, the storyline really comes through in this fantasy adventure.  Jake is terrific in the leading role and the seductive beauty of Gemma is most appropriate (even though she plays an aggressive and arrogant bitch, until the end, of course).  Of course, Ben Kingsley plays the part of the villian to the hilt.  No lack of action in this one.  This was a fun movie reminiscient of the old Sinbad movies.  I recommend it.
B004132HZS|5.0|What can I say about this new tv drama? The term 'brilliant' springs to mind first, along with 'engaging', 'funny', 'serious', and 'compelling'.    This has all the charm of the classic Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist and facinating characters. The people are well played and fit into the stories wonderfully, along with a good script and wonderful directing.     I think the only thing I can complain about is the short length of the series. I was so happy when I found out another series was planned and meant to be out about 2012.    If you haven't seen this series, then you are missing out on one of the few amazing tv shows of the decade.
0439023491|5.0|This was as good as the Hunger Game.  I can hardly put it down.  Yes, I even stayed up so late to get more reading in before I could keep my eyes open.  The story is intricate and relating.  I was totally immersed!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Short and sweet: Please Stan, just keep 'em coming.  I loved the first one and, now, love the second.  Just as Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine, Robert Downey, Jr. is the perfect Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Mickey Rourke has got to be the greatest bad boy, villian and all-around meanest dude of our era.  My compliments to Jon Favreau for another fine effort bringing the comic world to the screen (reality).  I highly recommend this movie.  Get it in Blu-Ray, you won't want to miss anything this flick has to offer.

In a Hemingway-esque turn, they all die in one way or another for a stupid wooden bridge.  Sad and trivial, but epic nonetheless.    The Blu-Ray    Upgrading from the previous DVD box release is worth it.  Colors are bold without being crushed.  Skin tones are accurate. Blues and greens of the jungle are vibrant and inviting.  Delineation of the jungle light from shade to sun is just beautiful.  There are no crushed blacks here. Early scenes on the train as we enter the jungle are thick with grain, likely from push processing the negative a couple stops or, more likely, the result of optical compositing for the opening credits.  Fear not, the emulsion settles, quickly into a consistent and uniform image.  Lens distortions are easily visible, something I never noticed as much on the DVD and detail is surprisingly good for a 50+ year-old film.  The Bridge on the River Kwai Is a tasty preface to what will hopefully be an equally impressive Blu-Ray for Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.    The Film.    5/5  The Blu-Ray   4/5
0141040343|5.0|Beautiful clothbound edition.  It is well made and will last a long time.  I believe the typeface is Times New Roman, with standard margins.  There is a ribbon bookmark in the binding.  I plan to get some more of the Penguin clothbound editions in this set.
1440503257|5.0|I have already tried several recipes from the Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook and have found the recipes easy to understand, the ingredients easy to obtain (in most cases) and the results delicious. I am the kind of cook who generally bypasses recipes that require prepackaged soups or sauce mixes as part of the ingredients. The Harry Potter recipes use mostly simple and natural foods that my grandmother might have used and in an easy to follow procedure. Wands aloft for Diane Bucholz.

B00000I41G|5.0|No technical comments, just listening comments.  Kenny Burrell, Stanley Turrentine and Ray Barretto have combined their unique sounds into an intertwined artful composition of chamber music.
B001383XT8|5.0|Behringer makes it affordable.  This heavy distortion effect allows for sounds like Cream, Hendrix, ZZ Top, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and the like.  A low cost solution to getting a variety of overdrive/distortion sounds at low volume (if wanted).  The case is plastic so don't go stomping hard on this thing.  It may not hold up for professional use but it's great for getting together with the gang.  You can go to Behringer.com to hear some of the sounds it will produce.  Good value.

B0042AEOG0|4.0|Mariah Carey's \\"Merry Christmas II You\\" is as soothing - and ideally suited - for the season as a warm, restorative cup of cocoa. It is cool, classy and uncalculated, confidently delivering holiday cheer.<br /><br />Carey's 1994 \\"Merry Christmas\\" collection - which yielded \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You,\\" perhaps the biggest hit of her career - was sprinkled generously with formal elegance and vocal bombast, although in welcome doses. \\"Merry Christmas II You\\" is not Carey's attempt to recapture that same formula but rather to offer a more festive, relaxed counterpart that complements the first album well. She no longer has anything to prove, so she can afford subtlety.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Oh Santa!\\" is a cute pop record that - quite transparently - revisits the theme of \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\\" With its rhythmic handclapping and vibrant background vocal work it strikes a resemblance to Outkast's \\"Hey Ya!\\" It is endearing, extroverted and giddy-sweet, though it jars a bit with the languid, milky sweet soul that characterizes most of the album.<br /><br />On the likes of \\"The First Noel/Born Is the King (Interlude)\\" and \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" Carey is blissfully understated. She sings the songs with grace, sweetness and maternal warmth rather than the youthful exuberance that colored 1994's \\"Merry Christmas,\\" unleashing those signature high notes only at climactic moments. Those who listen for vocal acrobatics will not find a surplus of them - rather, just the right amount. She also makes interesting song choices - such as \\"Christmas Time Is Here (Charlie Brown Christmas)\\" - which suit this style.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" is so slinky, precious and delicate that it only begins to call attention to itself after a few spins, but it is an exceptional track - another fine original that, like \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You,\\" shows Carey's gift for timelessness as a writer. It is romantic, elegant and soul-stirring enough to arouse emotions without breaking the yuletide mood. \\"One Child\\" is another cornerstone original - a serious moment worthy of working its way into church hymn books. It is dignified, restrained, sincere and devout, with a lovely children's choir.<br /><br />Carey's mother Patricia provides operatic vocals on \\"O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah,\\" which will surprise those listeners previously unaware that her mother's career as an opera singer gave rise to Carey's talent. The elder Carey sounds wonderful, and the blending of both their voices not only invokes sweet sound but the warmth of family.<br /><br />The live rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" is only partially live; some portions (generally, the most vocally challenging) of it are lifted right from the 1994 recording, while other moments are clearly live. It is fine listening, but it is also baffling. The updated version of \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" is almost indistinguishable from the original - good news for those torn between which of Carey's Christmas albums to purchase.<br /><br />\\"Merry Christmas II You\\" is a fine testament to Carey's enduring talent and generation-defining voice. The prospect of a recession-informed Christmas - one where fewer presents will be beneath the tree - is a very real one this season, but the presence of this album on the stereo will go a long way to putting smiles on faces, rejuvenating spirits and underscoring the real meaning of Christmas.he yuletide mood. \\"One Child\\" is another cornerstone original - a serious moment worthy of working its way into church hymn books.

B003VS0CYC|1.0|WARNING WARNING WARNING====if you missed out on the dvd re-release boom of the bush era for movies like these three films, you are in for some misery. it is very clear to me this \\"version\\" of the robocop collection was duplicated without compressing.    these dvds are transfers not remastered, the sound quality is not much better than 2004 mgm fully loaded trilogy, yet this blu ray is bare-bones the films are not  much else worth while. to this day the blu ray industry insists on taking short-cuts  rather than using \\"original vault meterials\\".     i would certainly think paul verhoeven whom directed the original would be disappointed by this version of his sci-fi/action shock-cinema styled classic  which was originally relesed x-rated NOT unrated, Irvin Kershnir(director pt 2) and fred dekker (director pt.3) would be disappointed too. this \\"version\\" is a \\"now take this home because this is all you are going to get for the time being\\" tranfer.    until the blu ray is completely perfected and all short-cut jobs are done away with  i refuse to even own a blu ray player.

B002R5V7MG|4.0|I have nothing to say about the Adams piece, it had no attraction for me.    The Mahler is what I paid for, having seen the television broadcast. This is a crucial piece of music for me in my life, I have heard dozens if not over 100 performances of this piece.     The tempos are undeniably slow, my touchstone is the Bruno Walter performance with the Columbia orchestra. While this is not terribly annoying (esp to anyone who has listened to Klemperer and understood what he was doing), the opening is not well-served by this approach, the arch of the music, especially when we arrive at the horn duets, seems to get lost. However, in the later sections, the seeming exaggeration is what Mahler wrote in the score, the true portamenti are exactly what Mahler wanted, these are often miscalled glissandi, but these swoops in strings and winds are usually downplayed by 21st c conductors. This was part and parcel with the blend of Viennese, Bohemian, and Jewish root music that was in Mahler's mental universe, and they should not be denied. Dudamel wrings every last bit out of the orchestra, and if the pace were little more brisk, this would be the best-realized performance since Walter's. As it is, the playing and recording are so good for a live performance, that I would recommend even with the caveat.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|Lady Antebellum `blew up' in 2010 by all means.  The country trio with enough chops to crossover to an inviting pop audience had one of the biggest albums of 2010 in regards to sales, critical response, and the music industry itself.  Unfortunately, many times, acts like Lady Antebellum get overhyped too much as does their respective release. [[ASIN:B002WIDRM6 Need You Now]] proves to be a solid album by all means - and one of the year's better efforts - though the hype by fans and some outlets may be a bit overwrought.  That is nothing against the group who is a solid and polished collective by all means, but in reality, Lady Antebellum are nothing incredibly `new' to the industry - they are a solid act with a nice, restrained (sometimes too much so) sound that has incredible commercial appeal.  They are an alternative to groups such as Rascal Flatts and The Dixie Chicks (who are starting to show age by music industry standards).  None have to look any farther than first single and opening cut \\"Need You Now\\" to see why this once small group has grown into the ultimate commercial group to beat.<br /><br />\\"Need You Now\\" is the valedictory cut from Need You Now, though it is accompanied by some exceptional competition, surprisingly.  The production work here is brilliant, straddling country and pop worlds making this cut the #2 pop hit it was.  There is superb chemistry between vocalist Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott, who trade off between verses.  The pre-chorus (bridge before the chorus) is well penned (\\"and I wonder if I ever cross your mind, for me it happens all the time\\"), not to mention the classic chorus: \\"It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now, said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control, and I need you now, and I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now\\" Any doubters should be silenced by this exceptional cut that makes the non-country fan want to beg for more.<br /><br />\\"Our Kind of Love\\" is none too shabby itself, changing the pace after the moodier \\"Need You Now.\\"  Here the band adheres to a `country' sound which lessens the appeal to the crossover audience built by \\"Need You Now.\\"  The biggest quibble, however is the length of this cut as opposed to whether it is `country-sounding' or `pop-sounding.'  \\"American Honey\\" silences pundits quickly with beautiful production work through lush strings and superb songwriting once more.  Here, Hillary Scott is the featured vocalist, with Kelley's vocal turns mixed behind her (this happens throughout the album depending on who is truly `featured' between the two).  \\"American Honey\\" is one of many examples of the exceptional engineering of this album if nothing else.<br /><br />\\"Hello World\\" is a bit of a downgrade compared to the first three cuts, finding Charles Kelley's vocals lovely, yet too `sleepy' here at times.  The cut is pretty - don't get me wrong - but it just does not feel as inspired as pre-eminent cut \\"Need You Now.\\"  Hillary Scot does not enter until nearly the 2:00 mark (mixed in the background for the most part). Only the dynamic ending truly atones for the lack of \\"oomph\\" with this cut.  \\"Perfect Day\\" atones for the missteps of \\"Hello Word\\" with a more driving groove and up-tempo feel here.  Also bowing in \\"Perfect Day's\\" favor is the brief duration at 3:20 and the production work.<br /><br />\\"Love This Pain\\" is solid, though a shade less enjoyable than the very best cuts.  Here, the highlights are the refrain and the superb bridge.  \\"When You Got A Good Thing\\" is the next noteworthy cut, however, giving \\"Need You Now\\" its first true taste of competition as the best cut.  This cut is a nice stripped-down ballad that features superb country instrumental ideas and straddles the line of soft-rock.  Again, songwriting makes a cut like this effective - not to mention some superb guitar playing by Dave Haywood, whose role can not be underwritten in the instrumental aspects of this album.<br /><br />\\"Stars Tonight\\" is a mid-tempo cut, that like the general pattern of this album does not stand out as the best, but is solid for the most part.  The vocal mix between Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley is spot-on as always. The track itself is enjoyable, but not revolutionary and is saved by the addition of a chorus backing Scott and Kelley's vocals near the end.  \\"If I Knew Then\\" again saves the day for a track less satisfying preceding it.  The six-feel is wonderful and a nice change of pace for the trio.  The songwriting is among the best of the album, yielding some wonderful lyrically driven moments: \\"Cause love only comes, once in a while, knocks on your door, and throws you a smile, and takes every breath and leaves every scar/speaks to your soul, and sings to your heart...\\" Like \\"When You Got a Good Thing,\\" it is one of few tracks to truly rival centerpiece cut \\"Need You Now.\\" \\"Something `Bout A Woman\\" and \\"Ready to Love Again\\" are solid, but don't feel as relevant or solid as the best cuts from Need You Now.<br /><br />All said, Need You Now is a good album that for the most part lives up to the hype that currently surrounds Lady Antebellum.  As stated prior, the hype is a bit much and this album is NOT without its flaws.  At times, the album sags and relies too much on restrained productions and songwriting conceptions that make the songs somewhat `same-y.'  Luckily, [[ASIN:B002WIDRM6 Need You Now]]  is packed with enough memorable moments and well crafted songs to atone and counteract the less remarkable moments and that is the mark of a group with considerable musicianship and a knack for marketing.  Solid and enjoyable effort that should the group several Grammy nods.l pattern of this album does not stand out as the best, but is solid for the most part.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle has an outstanding voice that takes you by surprise.  We really enjoy listening to her CD I Dreamed A Dream.  The background music was great and it was nice to hear and understand the words.  We are looking forward to her Christmas album.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|This is a well-made little belt-pouch.  It has a belt-strap and front cover that are held down by velcro.  It has a 3 inside sections and a side slot that will hold a short pen.  It is very durable.  I have used it to carry a small digital camera.  It holds the camera and a cell phone, and just a little bit more.  Although it is a good camera case, on most days I use it as a combination wallet/cell phone case.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|I want to start off, by saying this is a wonderful conclusion to the toy story trilogy.    I picked up the four disc set from walmart today for $25.  I think my favorite stories by pixar would be the toy story movies, a bug's life finding nemo, and wall.e  I like them all, but those are the highlights for me.  I really liked the situations the beloved characters were put into and had to solve.  The story of Lotso, and his attitude reminded me of Jessie and prospector from toy story 2..  The quality of the transfer was excellent! Though currently I don't own a surround system compatible with blu-ray disc.  Right now it's not a big priority though even in stereo the audio sounds great, the picture is clear and crisp, good contrast good clarity.  Ken and Barbie was a classic touch as well, Barbie was introduced into the bunch in #2 and #3 gets Kent.  The one Character I wondered about though, was Bo Peep, everyone else was in the movie except her.  Was this mainly because she didn't belong to Andy?    The ending was extremely touching as well.  I liked woody's heart change and in his own way, encouraged Andy to donate the toys to Bonnie. I like how they all ended up together at the end with a new care taker who loves toys.    A bit off topic here, but Some of the bad movie reviews i Read on here seem like people just spouting off,  I have an A.S. in broadcast, and while live tv and film/animation differ many of the essential principles are the same.  So I look at a movie or show with a professional prospective and unbiased attitude,  I want to see if the producer and director's take on the story can be understood without hinting, basically how well can they tell a story, One of the most important elements in the industry.  If there is no story flash video and effects mean nothing.    Pixar has always been able to tell a good story, so has Walt Disney, true some better then others, but I haven't seen a movie I haven't liked or understood after watching it a couple times.  That's also a good point to make, don't expect to get everything the first time around in a movie or show, There are details always missed.    BTW I missed this in the theater, so i never saw it in 3D, but 3D isn't a major thing for me right now either.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Wow. Ummm......That's time I spent of my life I'll never get back. The Teletubbies are more terrifying to me. Man that sleep walking is terrifying stuff. Oh and watch out for that shaking chandelier, eerie footsteps, and door that closes on it's own! Oh the horror! Even when they tried to kick up the action in the end it was lame. Total yawnfest.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|A thought provoking film, \\"Invictus\\" is a film about the effort of Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, to bring South Africans, both black and white, together to form a new nation. This film cannot help but move the viewer's mind and heart.    Both Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman turn in the best performances of their careers to date. View, contemplate, enjoy.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|This is a fantastic album, thank you so much Mariah.I would say maybe its even better than the first christmas album.  And im a hardcore fan of Mariah since the early 90s.  There are songs that make you cry like \\"one child\\" or \\"o holy night live\\", cry because you are so impressed with this voice of an angel.Especially these two songs are very touching. And then there are songs like \\"oh santa\\" and \\"auld lang syne\\"that make you feel really really happy, they are like a natural drug and make you wanna dance ;).It feels warm and lovely listening to this cd,its like coming home after a day full of stress ,sit on the sofa and drink a cup of hot choclate (which you should do while listening to it by the way ;) ),you forget all your stress of your everyday life,really.So relaxing.What a great album ,just listen to the samples, the only thing i personally dont like is \\"charlie brown christmas\\".And that \\"all i want for christmas is you\\" is really 95 percent the same than in the 90s,i expected some more changes,this was a bit disapointing,you almost do not recognize any difference.Well ,i think this is because the song already was complete,you can not make better whats already perfect.  Merry christmas in advance to everybody ;).I live in germany and i think when it comes to christmas you americans have much more soul,tradition and the feeling for christmas than germans do.I dont know if someone ever told you that,but its the truth!Enjoy it,dream and relax while listening to the album!

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Good price from Amazon, as always. It was a personal must see for me. Robert Downey has really made Tony Stark his character. If you liked the first one, you will enjoy this one as well. Cameo by the late DJ AM was nice. Scarlett looked hotter than ever. Samuel L. \\"Mothereffin'\\" Jackson steals the scenes. Go get it, all I can say.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Mariah has the best album out It has been on repeat since Oct 27th the day it came in the mail and I was screaming my head off..LOVE ME SOME HER!

But, I love the fact that I can get some of my favorite shows, or in this case what will soon be one of my favorite shows on amazon.  The show was great.  Really started liking the characters right off the bat and am excited to see where the story goes.  I am not familiar with the graphic novel, but will definately check into it after watching the show.  Can't wait for the rest of the season.

It reunites half-brothers Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller (with Haller's two ex-wives prominently featured) and with both Harry and Mickey doing what they do best.

B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|This review refers to the King Kong (1933) Blu-ray release in book packaging.<br /><br />This has to be the best release of King Kong to date.  First things first: as far as I can tell, the content is identical to the restored DVD release of recent years.  Anyone wishing to upgrade will find this worthwhile.  I have read a number of comments that an upscaled DVD is just as good as this hi-def Blu-ray - I disagree.  There is a noticeable improvement in sound and picture all round,.<br /><br />If you like the Warner Bros \\"books style\\" Blu-ray packaging, then this is one of the best.  There is more informative text than we are used to with other \\"book\\" releases and lots of artwork.  The book packaging itself uses the same original poster artwork as the previous release.<br /><br />King Kong was prevously released in an exceptional tin edition with lots of other goodies such as a facsimile of the original programme.  If you're a real fanatic and have room on your shelves, you'll want to keep that as, here, you only get the deluxe packaging as a \\"hard\\" extra.  Meanwhile, this should be the definitive release of a classic film for many years to come - at least until the next mass-market consumer home entertainment format is developed!

B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is the best show currently on tv.  THe 3rd season is their best so far.  THis is worth buying for sure!!!
B0049SEX02|5.0|As I sat and watched this particular episode I had to admit that in my most humble opinion, this is the best show on tv. Why would I say that? First, it's never boring. So many shows seem to drag on with the storyline with not anything new really happening. Not \\"The Vampire Diaries\\". The show and the storyline is always fresh and never boring. The writers do a excellent job. I was literally in awe watching this episode. Second, the acting is superb. I mean they continue to surprise me every week. Forget the rest because this is the best.
B004A8EI9M|2.0|I know my at&t connection is fine but the streaming video is bad, it skips and stalls. This doesn't happen in my netflix account. The content is good though, amazon just blew it off.

B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Bruno Mars is a hit making machine!  After co-writing #1 hits for B.o.B. (\\"Nothing on You\\") and Travie McCoy (\\"Billionaire\\"), Bruno Mars released his first album last month and jumped into spotlight himself.  \\"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\\" is chock full of potential top ten hits and is a lot of fun, but will mostly appeal to the ladies.  This was probably the charming Mars' well thought out intention.      Born in 1985, Mars' grew up in Hawaii in a musical family, surrounded by both pop and traditional hawaiian songs.  His music is mostly upbeat with hints of reggae and island folk music. His genre is a mix of R&B and Pop that is very \\"in\\" right now.  Mars has said that he was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince and Elvis and you can hear traces of all three on the album.        The album title \\"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\\" is meant to appeal to everyone.  There are doo- wop songs for the girls and hooligan songs for the boys.  The album is actually a lot more doo-wop than hooligan and even the hooligan songs aren't that rough.  This album was not meant to be a heavy, intense trip, but a light-hearted, fun journey.  It was a bit surprising that there were no rap or hip hop songs on the album, considering the performers he has been writing for.  However, the songs on this album do sound like the catchy, fun-to-sing songs \\"Nothing on You\\" and \\"Billionaire.\\"    \\"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\\" is mostly a collection of  feel-good, happy, love songs.  Mars' trademark falsetto voice and lively guitar playing does not disappoint.  The recurring theme is that Mars falls hopelessly in love and is not afraid to let it show.  Mars likes to make girls feel special and appreciated.   Any girl would want to be Mars' girlfriend and probably will buy the album for the way it makes them feel.  \\"Just the Way You Are\\" is the #1 song in the country right now and \\"Grenade\\" is in the top ten.   The lyrics in \\"Grenade\\" are overly dramatic (I would go through all this pain/Take a bullet straight through my brain/Yes, I would die for ya baby),  but the rhythm keeps it from being taken too seriously.   In \\"Marry You\\" Mars adds chiming church bells and makes it sound like an old Motown song, but it is fun and every girl probably wishes her boyfriend would sing this song to her.  In \\"Our First Time\\" Mars pours out a  romantic ballad.  Guys will enjoy listening to this song with their girlfriends.  \\"Count on Me\\" is a catchy folk tune (\\"You can count on me/Like one, two, three\\") that sounds like he's strumming a yukele and you can hear his island influence.  The song is easy to remember and sing along with and will probably be the next big hit.  The hooligan song \\"Runaway Baby\\" is the most fast paced with a kick to it, but still doesn't come off as a hooligan hit.  \\"Talking to the Moon\\" is the darkest of the songs with very haunting vocals and melody.  It is a depressing song and seems out of place with the rest of the happy songs, but shows Mars' vunerable side.  A favorite is \\"The Lazy Song\\" which has a great beat and fun message for guys who like to think \\"I'll just strut in my birthday suit/And let everything just hang loose.\\"  \\"Liquor Store Blues\\" has a great beat and talks about some stress Mars is dealing with, but it doesn't come off too serious.  There is a strong reggae influence on this song.  Bob Marley's son, Damian Marley, makes an appearance giving the album an extra bonus.  Bruno saves the best for last with \\"The Other Side.\\" This song is by far the best hooligan song, featuring Cee Lo and B.o.B.   You can hear Michael Jackson's influence from the first beat.  The song and lyrics gives us an idea of the \\"other side\\" of Mars (\\"and quite frankly I've been going insane in between my eyes/I really can't explain what I feel inside/If you knew what I was, you'd run and hide\\").    Overall, this is an easy to listen to and enjoyable album that should sell very well.  For this album, it seems his goal was to score as many #1 hits as he could, get lots of radio play and lots of female fans.  At times, the album teeters on the verge of being sappy and corny, but Bruno's recent cocaine possession arrest may have helped give his wholesome personality and reputation more street edge.  Some people think this was a planned stunt to bring out the hooligan side of Mars that doesn't make a full appearance on the album. This was probably another well thought out intention.  The music industry thinks the arrest should do little damage to his promising career.
B003ELKNHM|5.0|I bought this special edition n I totally love it!!! I think this album is one of the best Bon Jovi's albums! All the tracks are very powerful and energic! This special edition came with a really beautiful new packing, laminated tour and new photos of the band! You have access to The Bon Jovi Virtual Tour Experience that show you exclusive photos and additional live audio track! As a huge Bon Jovi fan I totally recomend it!!!!
B000002MG1|5.0|The band reinvents itself in which they concentrate on designing a studio production and it achieves perfection. It's somber folk-pop with dominant acoustic instrumentation. Even when Peter Buck turns on the juice, it's usually hushed for accent purposes - almost providing a counterpoint. John Paul Jones has some kind of way with string arrangements. Mike Stipe is at the top of his game. There's not a bad song here. The ominous-sounding instrumental strengthens the more it's heard and it seems strategically placed. \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is their anthem at suicide prevention. Several top that cut. Its antithesis, \\"Try Not To Breathe\\", is probably my number one pick that I perceive as a stirring tribute to Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Having said that, there's also the sincerely atypical tribute to Andy Kaufman of afterlife's uncertainty, \\"Man On the Moon\\". Then how about their most haunting, dirge-like melody, \\"Sweetness Follows\\"? It's the healing power of time after experiencing the death of loved ones. It's the natural order-of-life song. And I can't forget the transcendent, \\"Find the River\\", which suitably closes as a glimmer of hope for the possibility of something better beginning. They make clear that hope is the best company for pain and loss in its different phases.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|What else can I say that hasn't already been said about Iron Man 2? I was waiting for this movie to come out on Blu ray right after I finished watching it on the big screen. This movie has the perfect amount of action and humor to make it still enjoyable after the fourth of fifth time watching it. The special effects are not too \\"out of this world,\\" so I like that this idea of Tony Stark and all of his gadgets (cell phone that hacks computers, real life projections that can be manipulated like real items, jarvis etc) can be real.    Overall, this was a great movie and a great purchase to add to my Blu ray library!
B003CIG7AE|3.0|I own other Band of Horses albums and I do enjoy them. This album doesn't quite compare and feels like an experiment by the band to change their sound. Infinite Arms is missing the intimate, \\"you are there,\\" style of mixing found on the other albums and uses more of the typical top 40 overly-compressed sound that's on everything these days. The sound isn't bad, it just doesn't have the dynamics and that makes the music sound unnatural. This isn't a horrible album, I just didn't enjoy it.

B000EF5NAS|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out, and 19 years later the feeling is still the same. I loved the scene where Evelyn is in her carr at the Winn Dixie and the car with the 2 young, model snob types take the space from her. As they're walking into the store, she confrotns them and they tell her, \\"Face it lady, we're younger and faster!\\" Towanda emerges and she starts to ran the back end of their car with hers. The scene continues when they run out and ask her what's wrong with her. She tell them, \\"Face it girls, I'm older and have more insurance!\\" Who hasn't wanted to do that? Who hasn't felt that way at least ocne in their life?! The scene also continues into this hilarious scene with Jessica Tandy. This movie is a classic and worth every penny. And if you can't afford the movie, rent it! This movie is great!
B003VQM2M4|5.0|I couldn't make a better mancookie if I'd baked Nick Cave from scratch!  (although he'd like his baker naked but for apron, high heels and a rosary...all the better to defrock her with)       His latest side project is part garage band, part Krautrock.  Warren Ellis on electric bouzouki is a joy and had me clutching my face and grinning big. The boys can still impress and \\"Heathen Child\\" is dirty, sexy proof (Fripp attending).  I couldn't even breathe during \\"What I Know\\" (i felt like i was eavesdropping), \\"Kitchenette\\" was vicious and hilarious, and Palaces of Montezuma is melodic and romantic and will get all men laid.  He's working his new, stressed out car salesman hairline to great affect. His voice is both unsettling and soothing.  All the barking and growling makes a girl want to beg, you just can't remember what for.  He has the good taste to include an underlying sorrow in every love song.  The desonant chords (think Rock of Gibraltar) seem there as a warning to women that even good, solid men are hopelessly flawed.  A clear-eyed member of his own sex, he once likened men in their 50's to \\"lumps of meat batting at their genitals like apes.\\"  Ahhh, the poetry!       Cave remains broad and can call Stagger Lee a mofo in one song yet bend to retrieve a lady's fallen glove in another and it all feels authentic.  He is everything women dream of. Charming, brutish, tender, ecclesiastic, and self-deprecating.  There is no fantasy you couldn't tell him, he wants to hear all.  He loves women.  He is intelligent, primal and NEVER obvious.  He made reference once to (the spectacularly Syphilitic)John Wilmot which explains why his command of language is not only sexually terrifying, but clever regarding...\\"tone\\".  Not WHAT you say but HOW you say it.  An exceptional writer, playwright, composer and lecturer.  A renaissance man. A beast. A lover.  An answered prayer to be sure!  He respects his Muse and never pimps her out.  He is better with time and is still edgy and as razor sharp as his suits.  Nick Cave doesn't miss a trick...he sees and says everything.  Thank God!!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|This could be the best Resident Evil movie of the whole saga so far.  Resident Evil Afterlife is packed with lots of nonstop action and for the first time real scary moments making the saga get into the horror genre, which you could experience in the game, if you have played the games; the first RE movie had some scares but they were absent on Apocalypse and Extinction parts.  I jumped out of my seat a couple of times with some unexpected scary attacks of the undead.  I want more of this... so take notes for the fifth part.  The movie RE Afterlife is very well paced, taking care of the characters development.  And finally Resident Evil was presented in 3D which could have been the best movie presented ever with this technology, the effects were astonishing, there are no words I can use to describe the sensations they produced.  I can hardly wait to get my 3D DVD format on December... Resident Evil Afterlife delivers and for all fans of the game and zombie movies RE Afterlife is Eye Candy!!!
B003EYVXT6|1.0|I'll keep this short and sweet, suffice to say that the trailer for this movie made it look incredible; The reality of the situation, however, is that this movie is ill-conceived, poorly acted, horrendously filmed and overall just a terrible movie experience. With massive potential and an otherwise excellent cast, this movie fails to deliver on every level, despite a high-paced sci-fi thriller trailer. You'll certainly regret gritting your teeth and waiting for the end of the movie in the hopes it will actually deliver - it only gets worse. I put this one in the same bin as ANY movie directed by Uwe Boll, Code 46, and Gigli. Stay clear!

B0040QDMBE|5.0|Ha-Joon Chang, Reader in the Political Economy of Development at Cambridge University, has written a fascinating book on capitalism's failings. He also wrote the brilliant Bad Samaritans. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times says he is `probably the world's most effective critic of globalisation'.<br /><br />Chang takes on the free-marketers' dogmas and proposes ideas like - there is no such thing as a free market; the washing machine has changed the world more than the internet has; we do not live in a post-industrial age; globalisation isn't making the world richer; governments can pick winners; some rules are good for business; US (and British) CEOs are overpaid; more education does not make a country richer; and equality of opportunity, on its own, is unfair.<br /><br />He notes that the USA does not have the world's highest living standard. Norway, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Sweden and the USA, in that order, had the highest incomes per head. On income per hours worked, the USA comes eighth, after Luxemburg, Norway, France, Ireland, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands. Japan, Switzerland, Singapore, Finland and Sweden have the highest industrial output per person.<br /><br />Free-market politicians, economists and media have pushed policies of de-regulation and pursuit of short-term profits, causing less growth, more inequality, more job insecurity and more frequent crises. Britain's growth rate in income per person per year was 2.4 per cent in the 1960s-70s and 1.7 per cent 1990-2009. Rich countries grew by 3 per cent in the 1960s-70s and 1.4 per cent 1980-2009. Developing countries grew by 3 per cent in the 1960s-70s and 2.6 per cent 1980-2009. Latin America grew by 3.1 per cent in the 1960s-70s and 1.1 per cent 1980-2009, and Sub-Saharan Africa by 1.6 per cent in the 1960s-70s and 0.2 per cent 1990-2009. The world economy grew by 3.2 per cent in the 1960s-70s and 1.4 per cent 1990-2009.<br /><br />So, across the world, countries did far better before Thatcher and Reagan's `free-market revolution'. Making the rich richer made the rest of us poorer, cutting economies' growth rates, and investment as a share of national output, in all the G7 countries.<br /><br />Chang shows how free trade is not the way to grow and points out that the USA was the world's most protectionist country during its phase of ascendancy, from the 1830s to the 1940s, and that Britain was one of world's the most protectionist countries during its rise, from the 1720s to the 1850s.<br /><br />He shows how immigration controls keep First World wages up; they determine wages more than any other factor. Weakening those controls, as the EU demands, lowers wages.<br /><br />He challenges the conventional wisdom that we must cut spending to cut the deficit. Instead, we need controls capital, on mergers and acquisitions, and on financial products. We need the welfare state, industrial policy, and huge investment in industry, infrastructure, worker training and R&D.<br /><br />As Chang points out, \\"Even though financial investments can drive growth for a while, such growth cannot be sustained, as those investments have to be ultimately backed up by viable long-term investments in real sector activities, as so vividly shown by the 2008 financial crisis.\\"<br /><br />This book is a commonsense, evidence-based approach to economic life, which we should urge all our friends and colleagues to read.agan's `free-market revolution'.

B003Q6D25K|5.0|I'm a horror junkie so it takes a lot to scare me.  Paranormal Activity got to me just a bit.  It's just the juxtaposition of middle class normalcy with a demonic haunting.  Everything is understated and the tension builds to a shattering conclusion.  I had to see PA 2 just to see if they were able to sustain the terror that the first movie had created.  I was not disappointed.  This is actually a prequel to the first movie as you find out at the very beginning.  The filming this time is mostly from home security cameras with a few bits from a hand held camcorder.  Things start slowly with just a few bumps being heard in the night.  The only person to notice anything is the Hispanic nanny who tries to warn the family and cleanse the house of evil spirits.  Of course, no one takes her seriously.  And things begin to get worse (who could have guessed?).  I don't want to give any more away but I will say that this is the first horror movie that I have ever seen which actually scared me so bad, it brought tears to my eyes.  If you have a weak bladder, you should probably wear your Depends.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the last 10-15 minutes of this movie could be dangerous to your health if you have a bad heart.  Of course, it probably didn't help that I went to a midafternoon matinee on the day after Halloween.  There were only 3 other people in the theater.  I had a whole row to myself in a dark and mostly empty theater - believe me, it's not the way you should watch this movie.  It's definitely a worthy successor to Paranormal Activity, in fact, I think it's scarier.  Kudos to the writer(s) and director of these movies.  An original horror movie is a rare thing and they have now given us two.  So, fellow horror fans, don't miss PA 2.

This novel is infused with history and so much more and it incorporates knowledge of Ireland as well as individuals who surround her. Colm makes it possible for the reader to connect with characters. Brooklyn: A Novel is a story of inspirational change and alteration, this is a story of the 1950's, affection, and change. Toibin is able to alter his prose in order to accommodate each character and create interesting language. Brooklyn: A Novel is a wonderful adventure story detailing the search for belonging and a quest for love. Although the novel takes place in the 1950's it contains a universality that transfers to every individual, we each find a little bit of ourselves in Eilis' character.

B003Z0BSU8|4.0|Andsnes is a reasonable pianist, suited to listeners who want Rachmaninov to stay on the rails; it's no surprise that his reputation is england is higher than it is in the U.s. I tend to tilt to this side of the Atlantic. When there are fire-breathing Russian virtuosos on the order of Kissin, Matsuev, Volodin, and Volodos (they are two people), I can't go into raptures about Andsnes' vaunted taste and reserve. That's precisely what doesn't work in Rachmaninov, and his lack of intensity is particularly unsuited the the Third Cto., which needs as much display as possible to carry it beyond long stretches of fairly empty doodling and noodling. Andsnes realizes this, and I must admit that he finds considerable power and drive at the heart of the development in the first movement. It's not Russian thunder, but it's thunder.<br /><br />I speak as someone who doesn't particularly favor either of these concertos. For those as loves them, andnes's scrupulous musicianship is undeniable. I've always been astonished at the wandering, rather pointless unfolding of Cto. 4, where only the wistful, hesitant slow movement offers an interesting reprieve. Rachmaninov even lost his gift for melody, which was a strong support in the two middle concertos. For me, only Michelangeli in his classic 1957 recording on EMI salavages the Fourth. I should say that EMI's sound is solid, the piano is a strong instrument, and Pappano conducts with feeling, although his musicianship is a bit generic compared to the real thing form the best Russian conductors.

Too bad they sounded canned and bass-less like that. It would have given it 5, if it wasn`t for the mentioned reason.<br /><br />All the other sounds was very good in my opinion. The subwoofer had good bass when we heard music, explosions and a flamethrower.<br />The dialog from the Center speaker sounded natural and not canned or anything hissing sounds. The surround speakers was used in every situations it was needed.<br /><br />And that was a lot. There was some nice directional effects also. I heard motorcycles, flamethrower, helicopters, gun fire and so on. As i said the surround speakers are very active. I didn`t expect them to be used so much to great effect.

B0021L8V1Q|2.0|Not being a comic book reader I have little background on the Iron Man franchise other than watching the original movie after hearing rave reviews from many of my friends. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Iron Man movie and it had a good combination of action, humor, wit and a good chemistry between the actors. After watching the sequel, Iron Man 2, I'm sad to say that the careful balance of the first movie has been eroded in favor of an over-the-top experience.<br /><br />The basic plot pits the son (Mickey Rourke), Ivan Vanko, of a Russian physicist who assisted Tony Stark's father in building the Arc Reactor (used to power the Iron Man suit) against Tony Stark. At it's core, Iron Man is a basic revenge story. Though oddly the movie spends little time exploring and building that aspect of the story. In a few short scenes Ivan manages to build a fully functional arc reactor and sets on his quest to kill Stark. Iron Man 2 goes on to start so many concurrent plot lines that it's difficult to follow. There's the budding love story between Stark and his assistant turned company CEO, Pepper Potts (played by Gweneth Paltrow); the surprising arrival of Samuel Jackson playing Nick Fury in a clear set up of a future Avengers movie; political pressures by the US Government to take the Iron Man suit, the ascension of Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. Rhodes who becomes War Machine; and many other subplots that go almost nowhere.<br /><br />From the beginning I couldn't shake the feeling that Iron Man 2 was a quickly conceived cash in on the popularity of the first movie. All the action sequences are are spectacular but completely over the top. The intro to the movie for example has Iron Man jumping out of a military C-5 (why when he can simply fly under his own power?) onto a stage of choreographed dancers. The first movie featured a careful build up to a spectacular finale against one other robotic suit. Iron Man 2 throws an entire army of robotic combat suits against Iron Man... and then one more fight against Ivan. Tony Stark's battle against alcoholism is reduced to an ill conceived source for comic relief as in one scene Stark is drunk and using his suit for skeet shooting indoors. It's disappointing that the darker side of Iron Man wasn't explored and instead used for laughs.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 isn't without some entertainment value and it's certainly a better sequel than both Spiderman 2 & 3 in my humble opinion. Though I hope that any future Iron Movie undergoes a major overhaul similar to how the Batman movies were reset.ght against Ivan.

1400064287|4.0|Book Review: Made to Stick                                           Vincent         In this book, the two authors want readers to know how to make their ideas stick. Firstly, authors inform us what stick means: ideas and thoughts are understood and remembered by audiences. What is more, ideas and thoughts will have a long impact on audiences' minds and change their ways of behaviors. There are six aspects we have to keep in mind if we want our ideas sticky: SUCCESSs (simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, and stories).    --Simple: It means you have to find out the core of an idea. Also, you need to make it become compact. Authors use proverbs as a good example in the first chapter.   --Unexpected: Authors want to handle the question that how do ideas get people's attention and keep it. In their opinions, they can use surprise to get attention and interest to keep it. After finding the core, if we are eager to make ideas stick, we should pursue the counterintuitive about the message. Then, we should express our ideas in an unexpected way in order to break our audiences' guessing machines. Lastly, we should refine their failed machines (very important).   --Concrete: Compared to the aforementioned aspects, concreteness is easier to carry out. Authors use many vivid examples to tell us what abstraction and concreteness are. I do love the brown eyes, blue eyes example. In order to make our ideas sticky, we had better to use concrete words and images so that we could let our audiences know exactly what we want them to know.  --Credible: I am pretty sure that you do not want to chug a glass of water that filled with a billion bacteria in order to make others believe in you. Without letting your audiences believe you, it's impossible for you to stick your ideas. Authors give us two good keys to solve the credible issue: external credibility and internal credibility.  --Emotional: An idea, which contains the four characteristics above, is not enough to attractpeople and make them act as you want. You have to inject emotional value into your ideas. Authors give advises to us: the power of association, appeal to self-interest, and appeal to identity.  --Stories: We can make use of good stories in order to make people act because good stories include both simulation and inspiration. What is more, we don't need to invent good stories as we do for the \\"simple\\" part. What we should do is just to find good stories that fit our core ideas.      Some advertisements of shampoo in China are good examples of \\"simple\\". These is no doubt that every kind of shampoo has several advantages over others, however, marketing guys have no chance to express all these advantages due to the strict time limit.  What the marketing guys do is that they focus on the core of their products: Head & Shoulders is good at removing dandruff; Clairol is using herbal ingredients; Pantene is good at making hairs smooth while VS is for professional usages. It's very easy for consumers to choose the suitable brands because of these advertisements.      Baidu, a corporation that offers searching engine service, had a good advertisement that highlighted the \\"unexpected\\". At that time, Google threatened Baidu's market share a lot in China. Baidu needed an excellent advertisement in order to express its advantages. Firstly, Baidu got its core of idea: as a Chinese searching engine company, it was better than Google if people wanted to search for Chinese. Then, it gave audiences an unexpected clip in its advertisement: a Chinese gifted man of letters is competing with a foreigner for a girl's love. What they are competing is Chinese poetry. This made audiences feel unexpected and they didn't know what would come next. Finally, this advertisement refined audiences' failed machines by using some ingenious Chinese poetry to express the core idea: Baidu was way too better than other searching engine companies in the sphere of Chinese. When audiences saw this scene, they would know the core idea, also, kept in mind that Baidu's advantages.    Someone is naturally born creative genius, however, many others are not that lucky. By reading this book and keeping SUCCESSs method in mind, in my opinion, every person is possible to create profound sticky ideas.
0694003611|5.0|My 2 yr old son loves this book and loves going through and looking at the pictures. We ask him where something is and he finds it in the picture. Entertains him for quite awhile. Its not too long of a book either so it holds his attention perfectly.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Just what I expected.  The order was promptly taken to my hotel.  Very happy with purchase.
B002ZG9968|3.0|My review of this movie will be jaded, because i will watch any movie(good or bad)starring Alex O'Loughlin!!!  The movie started out pretty interesting and then puttered out with parts that were not funny and very silly.
B000X107GI|5.0|I buy the CR 2032 batteries for our garage door openers and now a bathroom scale. So we use about 3-5 a year, and I always went to the supermarket or drugstore and paid up to 5 dollars apiece for them.  NO MORE!  Ordered from \\"MYBATTERYSUPPLIER\\" here on Amazon, and paid about 50 CENTS each.  About 8 days later I received a strip pack of 5 batteries, just as pictured in the item description. I am very impressed with the price and product, and the retail stores just lost some more of my business.<br /><br />The battery life seems to be fine.  The only issue I have is the oh-so-slow pace of regular US MAIL.  Even mailed \\"First Class\\", my white envelope of batteries arrived eight calendar days after the order, which seems a bit long.  Usually, envelopes arrive 2-3 days after mailing within the US. But patience is a virtue, all good things come to those who wait, blah blah blah.  Stocked up on batteries here, and saved 90% off retail-- I'll wait.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|I purchased Years 1 and 2 and enjoyed the extended versions with the deleted material put back in to the movies.  Years 3 and 4 are just the standard versions already released but at a much higher price.  The deleted portions are added, just like the standard version on a separate disk but not in context, they should have been assembled into the movie.  Save your money and get the standard versions as this is just a WB rip off.
B001QUL73W|5.0|Dmitri Shostakovich has long been one of my favorite composers, and his 4th-11th symphonies are some of my favorite works from the 20th century.  The 11th, however, for me is right behind the 5th in terms of excellence.  This is music of power yet gloom.  The uneasy sounding first movement always sends a chill down my spine.  I can very easily picture a cold Russian Dawn, with silent rifle barrels ready to fire if necessary.  Even though Shostakovich attached a program to this work, I certainly feel like it could be \\"absolute\\" music.  The last movement is absolutely terrifying, with its loud percussion and screaming brass.  Maestro Petrenko coaxes some magnificent playing out of his orchestra, certainly on the level of the other mainstream British ensembles (London Symphony, Philharmonia) and probably some of the continental orchestras.  I never felt for a moment that his music was banal, and Petrenko certainly got a lot of conviction from himself and his orchestra.  Naxos's recorded sound is also very good, if not excellent.  For those looking for a Shosty 11 on a budget, this is the disc.    Bravi tutti!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I've always liked American board game like scattegories, jenga, risk, uno, clue and scrabble.  Although I liked them, I only play games like once a month with my friends.  Settler of Catan was my first European boardgame and it opened a new horizon and now I play eurogame regularly.  It demands more thinking and requires less luck, so for someone who want a rewarding challenge, Settler of Catan is a perfect initiation to Eurogames.
B002QB1910|5.0|Rihanna's hit pop album, Rated R, showcases her true artist abilities through her music.  She has a distinct writing style which allows her to convey her feelings about the Chris Brown violent attack through her album.  Rihanna did this in a way to show the young adults who appeal to her music that no one should be able to break you down.  She shows her vulnerability as well as her irrefutable strength. The album opens up with \\"Mad House\\" symbolizing Rihanna's somber period and putting you in a dire position.  \\"Wait Your Turn\\" conveys she is moving on playing life by her own rules.  In \\"Hard\\" the lyrics state \\"They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever, No pain is forever, Yup, You know this.  Tougher than a lion, Ain't no need in tryin', I live where the sky ends, Yup, You know this.  Never lyin', Truth teller.\\"  Through these lyrics Rihanna indicates she does not care what the media says, and she knows she is in pain now but she is resilient and will always tell the truth which will put her on top.   \\"Stupid in Love\\" suggests she thought what they had was love but she now realizes thats not love.  In \\"Rockstar 101\\" the lyrics voice \\"Big city, Bright lights, Sleep all day, Long nights.\\" which is revealing the idea that you can get away with a lot in the city she is in.  \\"Russian Roulette\\" exemplifies her vulnerability, it is very personal, it grabs you, you can feel her heart beating.  There is extreme passion and fear displayed in this song.  \\"Firebomb\\" reveals she knows now that she is over Chris and it is blowing up in his face, like a firebomb.  In \\"Rude Boy\\" Rihanna explains that she is just going to have fun and be with people even though she does not love or have feelings for them.  \\"Photographs\\" looks back on the relationship she had with Chris.  It expresses her true sorrow and pain of lost love.  In \\"G4L\\" Rihanna is toying with the idea of revenge.  \\"Te Amo\\" expresses her unquestionable love even though the relationship is over.  \\"Cold Case Love\\" uncovers the crime that was committed that leaves their relationship without an ending.  \\"The Last Song\\" closes the album by announcing \\"It's time to turn on the last song.\\" and undeniably informs her teenage listeners she is through her pain of the past, she is coming out of her darkness, there is light ahead.  She is starting a new road where she is open to love and life.  This song ends the album immaculately by clearly transmitting the implication that she is over Chris Brown and is going to live life by her own rules open to love.
B00000DRA9|4.0|The reason why I say this, is because, once scratched, even a tiny bit,it will cost you another CD.  But otherwise noted it's one of the best music's I have ever listened to.  If you buy one keep in good shape.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I purchased the Turtlebeach Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset in August 2010. As of September 15th or so, the right channel became noisy and crackled with distortion. As of now November 2nd, there is no sound at all in the right channel which makes this headset a useless paperweight. Since the time has passed to return this item to Amazon.com I'm stuck with a gaming headset that doesn't work and cost me over $80.00. Maybe I got a defective headset but the end result is a product that didn't work right for very long.<br />Don't bother with Turtle Beach headesets, there has to be a better product out there. Or at least one that is backed up by the manufacturer (and Amazon.com) so that when the product FAILS, you have some means of redressing the problem! An unhappy purchaser of the Turtlebeach Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset!
B001DTPZNY|3.0|In the special features of this DVD, Steven Spielberg remarks that when Harrison Ford first ran the idea of a new Indiana Jones movie past him, he told the actor that he had *moved on* beyond this series of films. It would have been infinitely prudent had Spielberg remained steadfast in this profoundly clear assessment.<br /><br />I've seen better fight scenes in a 1930s B-western film... but I'm getting ahead of myself. The point is that Harrison Ford wasn't precisely a young man when he made his first three Indy films. And as this movie unfolds for the viewer, it becomes notably apparent that he was far too old and rickety to be making yet another in 2008. What in the world were they thinking about?!?<br /><br />This film is little more than a fairly heinous and unashamed re-write of [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]], even to the point that the producers clung to the now-hackneyed John Williams *Raiders* theme/filmscore, with not the slightest hint of an update. In *Raiders* this soundtrack was uplifting and triumphant -- but here it comes off as dated and silly.<br /><br />In *Raiders* the stunts and events were just plausible if one allowed his or her imagination to joyfully stretch just a bit for the sake of completing the Hollywood magic... totally acceptable. In this instance, however, Indy survives unscathed a full nuclear blast by leaping into a 1950s vintage refrigerator. Through a repetition of similarly moronic gags, the film takes on the flavor of a *Bullwinkle* cartoon minus the great humor of the latter. These antics are openly slapstick but they suffer from clich&eacute; and familiarity and the overall story, a tenuous one at best, breaks down as a result.<br /><br />For me though, the greatest insult was to one of my favorite actors who was grossly mis-cast here into an inappropriate role: Cate Blanchett [[[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]]]. She plays a stereotypical ruthless Bondish-type Soviet scientist. Even though she yields a valiant effort, even she cannot surmount this witless dialogue and artless direction. Thus the role served only to diminish her sterling career.<br /><br />The film-makers also shamelessly re-introduced a wrinkled and aged *Marion Ravenwood* [played by Karen Allen]... unforgivable.<br /><br />No, this movie isn't exactly hateful. It just comes off as a lame idea and equally as Hollywood good-old-boy senility. It's clearly the worst idea that Lucas, Spielberg, and/or Ford ever spawned and represents a direct slap to the previous three Indy movies, all of which were really First-Class..<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! So, what does this yarn involve? Well, it's actually all about a discovery by one of Jones' associates of advanced aliens having invaded an ancient South American tribal culture -- but they don't call them aliens. The producers felt that it would be a superior approach to assert that these beings came from another *dimension*, even though the beings ultimately exit the planet in a flying saucer!<br /><br />The tale transpires in the 1950s and Indy (who discovers along the way that he has a grown son, vignettes of Captain Kirk in [[ASIN:B0000683DH Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]) faces the Red Menace of the Soviets rather than his former pre-World War Two nemeses -- but it's still the same story. Even *The Ark of the Covenant* garners a flash of a cameo appearance, (which is perhaps the only really humorous moment during the entire film.)<br /><br />I see that used copies of this DVD are being hawked for ninety-seven cents plus a fiver for shipping and handling on Amazon. Thus, I highly recommend that you check out your local public library's copy before you lay out that sort of cash for this slug of an action flick.typical ruthless Bondish-type Soviet scientist.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I am a Mom to 2 with Aspergers. I bought this movie to share with our church members who then shared it with the kids that my kids attend church with. The movie was a way for others to see my children in a different way/ The kids who watched it where able to see that things that my kids do are Not to meant to hurt them, etc.<br />It helps them understand things better and it is not just a Mom taking up for her children.
B00288KNJU|4.0|I picked this up on a whim - we don't have children but sometimes enjoy children's movies.  I was looking for Tim Burton's new \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and picked this up at the same time.  I was an early fan of Tim Burton and really enjoyed \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\".  Before picking this up I asked myself what \\"Nightmare\\" would have been like without Tim.  I shouldn't have been worried - I liked this much, much more than \\"Alice\\".  Even more than \\"Nightmare\\", for that matter.<br /><br />There was something about this movie that was completely mesmerizing - I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.  It was delightfully dark and quirky, but the word that fits it best is \\"creepy\\".  The \\"horror\\" was subdued, almost Hitchcockian, which contrasted greatly with some of the more elaborate/extravagant scenes such as the elderly sisters' trapeze act.  The 3D works well but the colors weren't as eye-popping in the Other Mother's Universe with the glasses on as when watching in plain 2D.<br /><br />A lot has been written here about the plot and the characters so I'll skip most of that.<br /><br />Even though this obviously didn't have the emotional depth or ambiguity of a great film aimed at adults it was still captivating and one of the best movies I've seen all year.
B003WTE886|3.0|I love Taylor Swift, her Fearless CD was probably my fav. This one seems to me like you are listening to the same song throughout the entire cd! Just my opinion!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The movie has the same heartfelt warmth that it always did and was a perfect gift for my moms birthday.     It's just too bad I bought it from a guy who lives 5 hours south of me but takes 2 weeks to send it. If there was a blacklist I'd post this person with pleasure. \\"Gataycony\\" enjoys shipping at the latest date possible and making it arrive at the latest day possible. How does a guy in the same state, so close by, and gets his money the day it was purchased, take so long to send it out?

0345505387|2.0|Whilst I adore Diana Gabaldon's Jamie and Claire series, and have read them over and over again, I found The Exile to be, quite frankly, a waste of money.  I don't think you'd really know what was going on unless you already know the story, and the pictures of Claire, particularly, I found to be bizarre, looking like a cheap hooker most of the time.
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|I'm a fan, I can't think of much from studio Ghibli that I haven't really loved, full disclosure. I think the animation and character voicing in Ponyo is exceptional, the story was too much like the Little Mermaid which inspired it and certainly this isn't as original as Spirited Away. Still it's well worth your viewing time.
