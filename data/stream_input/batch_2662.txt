B00CGPPMKU|5.0|So I downloaded this as the free app, and I've been having major fun with it since, especially in the Continuous mode, which is quite simply amazing. I also got it for my iPad, and I was more than happy to shell out the extra 99 cents to activate the Continuous mode for that device as well. Couldn't be any cooler, highly recommend.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am having a wonderful time exploring E-squared. Pam Grout gives you 9 easy do it yourself energy experiments. Its a fun and easy book to understand, you'll  be amazed at what you prove your thoughts to be capable of!
B009MYARIK|2.0|After breaking up with her boyfriend, Richard, Lottie agrees to meet an old friend/flame, Ben.  Lottie's sister Fliss, knows that Lottie does crazy things whenever she is in a crisis, so becomes upset when Lottie informs her she and Ben are planning to tie the knot. Fliss develops a plan to ensure the marriage is not consummated and can be easily annulled. This book chronicles these attempts by Fliss. I have read and enjoyed many books by this author, but this one just not cut it for me For one thing, I found Lottie, one of the main characters unlikable. She came across as ditzy, flighty and too gullible to be true. I also found it difficult to believe Fliss was editor of a magazine, based on her actions and this completely inane plot to stop her sister from consummation her marriage. It was hard to believe any hotel could treat guests the way they treated Ben and Lottie and stay in business. Many of the antics they did were just too farfetched to be believable. This could be a beach read for anyone who really wants to laugh and see just how far someone will go to achieve a goal. However, most of the book is too silly to believe and could be construed as a waste of time.
B007TS6H9O|5.0|Her favorite cutie is Niall Horan of One l Direction... It was the perfect gift, because she love's the video!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good mystery, again with plot twists and an ending that you would not expect. The characters are like chameleons
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|the game is very... interesting. it is very hard ti get the hair in the right place and hard to cut theright amount of hair. I would not reconnect it but is is a okay game and great for little kids
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Where zombies meet Blair Witch Project. Well made Spanish movie. Beats the movie Quarantine because it actually has a story line.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This was one of my first experiences in learning about global warming and since watching it I have found the eerie truth behind each of the predictions coming true...sad to say
0307950654|1.0|I hated this book. PD James is usually a solid, dependable writer, but here she seems to be writing outside of her oveure (channeling Austen?).  The prose is leaden, and clumsy.  I purchased this novel because I thought the concept was clever.  Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  Don't waste your time or money on this.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked this very much altho it was not truly a five star read...very predictable but I'm sure the movie was cute and warm....
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very engaging and entertaining would give it a AAA+.  The puzzles were challenging but given time you can solve them.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Sort of hard to follow the characters but generally was an easy enough read...however it didn't depict Afganastan as vividly as The Kite Runner.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game did not provide enough instructions on how the game is to be played. So i did not get it.
B003B02PFO|3.0|Very shallow story but making a point about the underlying values we put on appearances for appearance sack. Sadly true
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Dont waste your time if you are older than 14 year old . Worst movie of the year .... Terrible stupid story and acting
B008ASGP3U|4.0|A good book to read quickly and a good lesson in geography of Scotland etc...Fast paced but lacks a lot of depth
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is the cutest movie!! I orinally saw it in the theaters and have recently seen Despicable Me 2 which is also a hit! I'd definitely recommend this movie to young and old alike.
B00821OX98|3.0|Just another so-so war story set in the future with alien opponents who look a bit like large ants. Predictable, so-so acting, so-so costumes, so-so sets -- you won't see it on any Oscar or Cannes feature list, that's fo' sure!  Better than watching laundry turn in the tub, but not by all that much.
B003SI6C4O|4.0|I chose to watch this movie mainly because of Denzel Washington, and he did not disappoint! Honestly though, I really needed to watch it twice to really understand what was happening. Would I watch it a third time?? Yes, and a fourth time and fifth!
B00BR476TG|3.0|The movie is brilliant, the photography luminous and truly glorious, and the tale one well to enjoy and ponder over. This &#34;extended preview&#34;? Definitely will not spoil the film's immensity for you -- all that it reveals is a lotta turbulent water with a ship goin' under with almost all hands. The only bearing this teaser might have had on the film was ...... well, I'm not sure. I found it hardly applied to the flick at all, and certainly, I repeat, hardly touches the scope and reach of the film at all. I wouldn't buy!
B000SL1P9G|1.0|I live in region 1. This product is useless to me. Wish I'd known this was a region 2 dvd. It wasn't stated on the product info page.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everybody outdid themselves this season. This remarkable story just flew to new heights with superb actors and actresses even more accustomed to working together & pinging off each other, a great script, an enormously loveable setting, and costumes & photography to luxuriate in. LOVED this second season, each scene, each word, each complication along the way. Well, well done!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game for those who enjoy object search games. Enjoyed playing thru facebook,  now can enjoy on my kindle. All will enjoy.
B00003CXRM|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies i would recommend it to a lot of people its a good movie you should see it
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I like DC comics. Green Arrow is a good hero. I would recommend Arrow to everyone who likes DC comics.
B00004XQ83|5.0|i love that old timey music. lol its a good cd and i recommend it to any one who liked the movie enough to want to but the cd
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait until the next sequel comes out.  I am enjoying the style of the author and the history facts.  Sometimes confusing with all the different characters.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Love these games for PC and had quite a bit of fun working on this one while on a recent trip.  Not bad at all!!
0738727326|5.0|This deck is one of the most beautiful tarot decks I own.  The pictures are absolutely stunning and a very accurate depiction of the card they represent.<br /><br />Definitely get the book with the deck.  It's worth the extra couple dollars as this deck is slightly different that others I own.<br /><br />Also, you may wish to invest in a box for your cards as the one they come in is not made for reuse.<br /><br />Overall it's very much worth the cost.  Absolutely stunning artwork, and a fabulous deck.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game gets you to think outside the box, and sometimes you can benefit from taking a break and taking a new approach
B003YL4LYI|4.0|If you read the series you obviously have to read this. It feels more like a filler book. Its the necessary info and background to set-up whatever is coming next.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The loss of Vince Flynn has been a loss not only to his myriad fans but to our country. A patriot full of wisdom and profound insights and understanding of the political machinations of our once great Republic.  unlike his previous novels, one senses here that he was rushing some  the narratives. after all, why would he not have a sense that this might be his last work.<br /><br />But still another great story. He left an unpublished work.  I can't wait to read it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read, really enjoyed it. just wanted to rate the book so others can pick it up for a good read.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Many interesting facts concerning the history of Tesla's accomplishments and the struggles he had to endure.<br />The introduction was too long and not really needed to enjoy the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was exciting! It held my attention ! Was hard to put down. I would recommend this as a &#34;Must Read&#34; for summer!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome App for the horse lovers out there. If you love horses this is the app for you!! It makes you feel like you actually own a horse. In this game you can show your horse and many more things but most of all you  can bond with your horse.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|I managed to survive only about 150 - 200 pages of this 1000 page extremely tedious boondoggle and finally gave up.  I could find no humor or point to this bunch of gobbledygook.  I tend to read a wide variety of books and consider myself to have an eclectic and accepting sense of taste and humor.  Even if I make it partially through a book that may not find myself initially crazy about, I'll usually tend stick it out and find some type of reward or something of emotional value by the end.  However, I could stomach no more of \\"Infinite Waste\\" and it is one of the few books that I permanently deleted from my Kindle library to never be seen again.  You'll be lucky if you make it through the forward section where they find some poor lost soul to write about how great this piece of junk is going to be....May the Force Be With You!
0425263916|4.0|\\"I'm caught up with you, Eva.\\" With his head tilted back, Gideon pulled me down for the sweetest of kisses, his firm lips moving gently beneath mine. \\"I'd kill for you,\\" he whispered, \\"give up everything I own for you . . . but I won't give you up.\\"
B009KEN87O|5.0|Game is as much fun as it used to be.  Recommend to anyone who played video games like these back in the day.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase of this movie. I bought it for my 2 year old but I think I watch it more. Thank you and I am happy. Will do business again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed the writing in this book, Landay does know his topic and knows how to make it real for his readers.  The author's way of making his characters so relate able  and the circumstances so believable is what makes this a unique novel.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to family and friends.
B0000256VK|5.0|What can I say about Avalon that all of these chatty, erudite blokes haven't already said?  That is it is my number 1 Desert Island Disc?  That Bryan Ferry is a genius?  That \\"To Turn You On\\" turns me to mush?  The music is haunting and beautiful, the lyrics captivating and intelligent, the whole is more than the sum of its parts?  This is how good Avalon is:  when I was in hospital recently for an extended stay, I ordered a new copy from Amazon to play on my laptop because I missed it so much.  You must phone me, you know me, when things go wrong...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded for free and could not put it down. Whole family fell in love with this game and downloaded it on their readers and phones. It's been over a month now and we're all still playing.
0425263924|3.0|Gideon Cross.<br /><br />Those two words ought to stir your quiver, girls. If they don't, then you need to begin here ([[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]]), continue here ([[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel]], which I just realize I have never reviewed ... must fix that). You need to connect with Gideon Cross, who puts the MAN in man.<br /><br />For reals.<br /><br />As a caution: this review will include information from the first two books, so if you haven't read them, stop what you're doing and READ THEM. Then come back, read this review, and go get a copy of Entwined with You.<br /><br />When last we left Eva and Gideon (le swoon), they were facing their next step together after Gideon murdered the man responsible for abusing and terrorizing Eva. This one picks up right after that, as our happy couple navigates those stormy waters.<br /><br />The murder pops up here and there in this book, and the threat it poses for Gideon and Eva looms over them throughout. Other issues come into play as well, and by \\"other issues,\\" I mean, \\"too damn many.\\" At one point, Eva even wonders what else can happen to her and Gideon, pointing out that every time they start to gain some equilibrium, something - or someone - comes on the attack.<br /><br />I had issues with Eva in Bared to You. I thought she took off running too quickly, and I could not see what Gideon found so attractive about her. In fact, I asked Sylvia Day that very question on Twitter and was told that Gideon saw some of himself in Eva. Both were victims of sexual abuse, both were protective of their hearts, both enjoyed some frisky relationships in the past.<br /><br />In this book, I finally came to love Eva. She is firmly on Gideon's side, and she appreciates him and what he brings to her life. In one scene, she reacts with her typical knee-jerk reflex, but as she examines what has pissed her off, she comes to see that Gideon wants nothing more than to protect her and make her happy. The \\"old\\" Eva would have taken off and run. This Eva sticks around.<br /><br />Oh, she does run at one point, but not so much from Gideon as from herself. She isn't fleeing their relationship or him, but rather trying to make peace with a mistake she believes she made.<br /><br />We continue to learn more about Gideon and Eva, and we continue to love that hunka hunka burnin' love that is Gideon Cross.<br /><br />Which brings me to the sex scenes.<br /><br />Strap on your vibrators, girls. It might just be possible that Sylvia Day has outdone herself.<br /><br />There is loads (no pun intended) of hot headboard rockin' in this book. One particularly memorable interlude takes place on Gideon's plane, and it is shattering. He and Eva rock headboards, walls, nightclubs, bathrooms. No place is off-limits, and thank goodness for that. Gideon connects with her through sex; he needs sex with Eva because he believes theirs, for all of its rawness and fierceness, is pure. It cements their union. When Eva wants to burrow into Gideon's core, when she wants to help heal him, she does so through sex. She understands its importance to him.<br /><br />And, of course, his stamina is a fantasy that makes Christian Grey grind his teeth with envy.<br /><br />As hot as the sex scenes are, though, the rest of the plot disappoints. There are WAY too many things going on, and they do nothing but serve to muddy the story. I get it, Sylvia Day. You want us to keep reading. But trust your characters; trust that you have created two people we care about and want to continue to read about, if for no other reason than their scorching sexy times. You don't need to throw all these different loose ends at us to keep us reading. Good grief. In this one alone, we have a surprise pregnancy, a potential Russian mob connection, a suicide attempt, extortion by sex tape, and an illicit affair between two former lovers. It's too much. Pare back to what matters: Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />The good news is that it looks like we might be in for a fourth installment in Gideon's and Eva's story. The bad news is that it does have to end sometime.<br /><br />Published on cupcake's book cupboard.<br />@VivaAmaRisataews is that it looks like we might be in for a fourth installment in Gideon's and Eva's story.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|A beautiful book that cuts you into pieces in ways you can't help but love. Incredibly complex and breathtakingly simple all at once. Wonderful.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|The dynamic tensions among well-developed characters make these episodes more interesting than superhero shows that rely only on pyrotechnics and computer -generated effects to involve their audience
B00D2K40WY|1.0|This app sucked! Wouldn't work unless you buy full version & let service have your credit/debit card on file to bill. Deleted immediately.  Yet it still won't go away after deleting! My girls were very bummed out.  On original kindle fire, this was never a problem. We downloaded this app with the new 7 in kindle fire hd. My suggestion is to purchase an amazon or kindle gift card to use instead. In order for others, kids, or self under influence of something, you have to set up a purchase safety code, thank goodness. I just have to keep it close by.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS! It doesn't go away!
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|I have bought this book and I really liked it.<br />I also recommend &#34;how to maximize your potential&#34; which I consider the best of all.<br />Great information that brings light to our soul.<br />Fully recommended
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is just simply amazing. It gives readers a new perspective of life and shows the true of an  adolescent seeking for where he truly belongs. I give this book a five star rating and would highly suggest people of all ages to read it. I can't explain anymore how well written this book is you would have to read it yourself
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good fun game. Would recommend to anyone. Love the upgrade system and the easy play. Just wish there were ground fights.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is the first game I have purchased after free play. It is hard to pull myself away from the game. Enjoying it very much!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I will start off with saying that I will continue to read the series but I am disappointed with the author for extending the story where it could have ended. I think the books was great and on par with the first 2, I just think that after this book it will feel like a bad high school relationship.<br /><br />The writing style is great, the characters lovely and the storyline is starting to get a little thin, but worth reading
B00APYKXFS|1.0|I wish i knew what to do all i know is red guys cant be shot down blue guys can. Red guys can kill you blue guys wont. Way too many red guys not enough instructions how do i play this god awful game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Unexpected fun; especially for a free App.  I look forward to the next update.<br /><br />Why can I not just give the rating without forced to write small essay on this App?
B00012FXAE|5.0|as collector of good series movie;the actor cast is very important;the fantasy;the creacion'originality....is the mustimportant factor to considering on make the decision if this movie  deserve or not....to be part of a seriuse collection;and definily...this movie is a giant for my collection
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved the story. My granddaughter and and I have watched it a couple of times. I passed on to my daughters it watch with their daughters
B00CS74W0C|5.0|It's just unfortunate that the waiting for these books is insane. Reading the second book in October and the third book in June is ridiculous. Now learning I have wait for two more books who knows when they'll be out. Sucks because the story is actually great, it makes Sylvia day seem selfish, and also insensitive to the readers and story. My advice is to just wait until all five books are complete because it will annoy you the way they end, and not having information on when you'll even read the next one.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|...frankly, High School is hell. Anyone will find someone in this show they can relate to, or at least certain aspects of one or more characters. Then there will be the people who will remind you of your best friend(s), you &#34;crew&#34;, and of course - you constant personal pain in the arse. Oh yeah, he or she is in here too.<br /><br />It is definitely a more mature audience show, IMHO, but one not to be missed. Thank goodness for it being available on Prime - otherwise I'd be shelling out the bucks to watch episodes. That in itself means it rates 5/5 in my viewing book!<br /><br />Hey, in some ways, it is like therapy... a chance to work out some of those left over issues you have buried since graduation... because they will certainly surface at some point or another. Hopefully, though, it will lead to a better understanding of your HS peers... and not to popping the guy who gave you swirlies in 9th grade a black eye at your 25th Reunion...<br /><br />hehehe. ENJOY!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a nice way to pass the time and its a good challenge. Sometimes the puzzles are a little cryptic and the logic is questionable. It also never explains what the items are and they can be a little hard to see on the screen. I still cannot wait for more.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|This movie was disappointing.  I like the actors. They did a great job, but the plot was not interesting.  There were huge gaps in the psychological aspects of the characters.  Lessons could have been learned, but the film just opted for action ... not thinking.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|i like it but since the update i can't see my Facebook friends scores anymore and it is linked to my Facebook so idk.. I still play it but I don't like not seeing my friends scores to beat them ..
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Jiro Dreams of Sushi was a very Zen Piece.  I enjoyed it very much.  It was a glimpse into a very unusual life.
0345349571|4.0|I bought Barbra Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror\\" ages ago, and it sat there on the shelf looking at me reprovingly all this time. I kept meaning to read it, but as a Tuchman book deserves the appropriate frame of mind and attention, I kept putting it off. Finally, I decided I could not take those looks any longer and dove right in. The book's self-explanatory subtitle is \\"The Calamitous 14th Century\\". Tuchman picked a rather obscure French nobleman by the name of Enguerrand de Coucy, and through his life (which was remarkably long for someone living at that time) recounts the horrors of that century: the Black Plague, the Hundred Years War, the internecine Papal wars, the persecution of Jews, riots, uprisings, rebellions... you get the picture. Tuchman being Tuchman, the account is detailed yet gripping, studious yet readable. I didn't enjoy \\"The Distant Mirror\\" as much as I enjoyed \\"The Guns of August\\" (arguably Tuchman's best book) or \\"The March of Folly\\", but it was still a book that kept me up long past my bedtime. If only all historians knew how to write like Tuchman.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I love the way Julia Roberts was able to make each moment comedic. The story is interesting, the scenery is gorgeous, and the romances are real.  This is definitely a movie that every woman should see.
0374533555|4.0|Daniel Kahneman is an economics Nobel prize winner. His groundbreaking work, with his colleague Amos Twersky, paved the way for behavioral economics. \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" is a book that is supposed to summarize most of Kahneman's work over his illustrious career. The book's central theme is the existence of two modes of human thought: system 1 - the fast and instinctive mode; and system 2 - the slow, more logical, mode. Throughout the book Kahneman strives to show how we are \\"slaves\\" to system 1, even though we believe we are rational, logical beings. He brings many examples and describes some of the studies he conducted. Although his writing is much less \\"popularized\\" than, say, Dan Ariely, this is still a book that can be enjoyed by the uninitiated (like me). There are many \\"wow\\" moments that makes us realize how little we understand our thought processes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Somehow, this British drama is very engaging.  I was so surprised.  The characters really come to life, and you will find yourself intrigued with their everyday problems.  I can't wait for Season 4!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Overall this game is not bad. Good design and quite easy to play with not too much in your face need for in app purchases.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|The cute graphics, the little nicknames, the shout-outs to familiar faces from the Bible, and the references to capital sin (among other things) makes this game one of a kind.  I am a practicing Catholic who managed to scoop this up when it was a FAotD, but really, I would not mind having to pay the paltry sum standing between me and this game, and I recommend you all do the same!  At the end of their license disclaimer, they mention that this is all in good fun, with no offense intended towards Christians or otherwise, and they succeeded, no offence will be found here! (That is, unless you abhor playing the guy who got us the 10 Commandments and freed the Israelites).  While mummies that can drown (who knew?), parting multiple rivers and seas (or the same rivers and seas multiple times), and Egyptians that keep pursuing in boats (that fire sorcery upon your people) may not be true to the Bible, they are by no means tainting my knowledge of the Bible or Church history.  This is a silly and entertaining app, with enough spice to keep it fresh and tasteful for a good, long time! Enjoy!
B005C0DHEY|4.0|This documentary was not what i was expecting. As it went on I became more and more interested in the film. As a resident of Pennsylvania it opened my eyes as to the consequences of fracking. I had no idea as did the people in the documentary what fracking can do to the environment. I have always had the attitude that fracking is helping us, but after seeing this documentary my eyes have now been opened to the consequences of the process. I guess if they did the fracking away from communities maybe it may be different, but to do it in these people's backyards is just irresponsible, I am a devout conservative and have been gung ho on drilling and fracking, but after watching this documentary I have a different opinion on the subject.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|So not what I was expecting but boy did this book touch me<br />If tough subjects bother you then this is not the book for you but it's real and still awesome
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This was a fantastic movie with incredible visual effects that make you feel like you are engulfed in the tsunami with the main characters. Great acting and a story that, if you have any heart in you, will drive you to tears.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I like it. You have to listen to it a few times for some songs to grow on ya. Overall a good album in my opinion.
B000HZGNHW|4.0|Fun move great car chase done the good old way no CGI. All those little cars, Mini Coopers and Fiat 500 are fun to watch. The ending will leave you hanging!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A nice challenge without being frustrating. This app tests your memory as well as testing your skills of deduction. I found it to be a pleasant way to while away some time and I look forward to new levels.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|She watch it everyday. She like it very much 'cuz it's family oriented. I like it too so when I'm home and she's watching it I join her.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I thought this would be a great idea, but every time I try to log in ever since I downloaded the app, it tells me my password is not valid. I have tried every option for getting it to work, but to no avail.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Every once in awhile a good book comes along that you savor like a good meal. The Secret Keeper was like that for me. The characters and their complexity elicited both subtle and robust flavors that blended into the story and kept me wondering what the next course would be like. The genre of historical fiction and mystery kept me intrigued. I like Kate's style of writing.  Strong vocabulary words that had just the right amount of challenge woven together with descriptions that allowed for imagination and insight. She treats her readers with respect for their own intellects and doesn't throw in insipid turns of phrases as though they were window dressing meant to impress but lacking substance. There are a number of good themes and issues embedded in this story that will inspire lively discussion. I felt very satisfied as I finished &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; and am looking forward to another good read from Kate as I've just discovered her as an author and find that I want to read more of her books. Well done!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Hotel Transylvania is a great movie. I love it so much. This movie is really funny, and it has a great story with good morals. It also has a bunch of lovable monsters in it like the werewolves Wayne and Wanda, Dracula, Mavis, Frankenstein's monster, and many more.  This movie is perfect for Halloween, and I highly recommend it.
B001LM1456|4.0|Despite how bad the other movies may have been this whole cake movie was good. It ties in with the other marvel movies very well.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Twisted and heart wrenching. A tough one to put down once you have started.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app! It's well worth the download!! accurate, vercital, trust worthy, and easy to use. keep up the good work!
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|The most amazing movie ever!!! Actually shows you what soldiers go through when they get back from Iraq or Afghanistan. And what its like for their families too.
B008JFUOWM|5.0|if you've been following this franchise I think you won't be disappointed. Sure, there were a few scenes where many might go \\"yeah...right.\\" For instance for me the latest Die Hard was the worst in the series despite the constant accion. It seemed like they expected too much of my suspension of disbelief. With this one, sure there were some superhuman feats not to mention a VERY long airport strip but the film overall was very entertaining. Despite some things that some people may find it hard to swallow I think if you've enjoyed any of the Fast and Furious movies you should enjoy this one as well
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is a great series that has intrigue and historical value.  A little &#34;soap opera&#34; but fun to watch.  Better than most tv out there.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Really enjoyed the books but if there is another one you need to let people know.  Kind of left a few loose ends.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|This is just plain good music that I can let my mother or my children listen too. Definitely will buy more of her music.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It starts very interesting, unique. It sets the mood for a dramatic post apocalyptic story. I liked the setting, most of the characters, even the desperation this books goes with.<br />Just like climbing stairs, after the initial enthusiasm, comes the difficult part. And here the book started dragging, I was advancing very slowly. The things were happening painfully slow, the descriptions were long and often unnecessary (imho).<br />The last part gathered speed tho'. Going closer to the ending made me curious to see what would happen, the story became interesting again. The actual ending was good. It left many questions unanswered, but being part of a series, that was to be expected.<br /><br />It's a book worth reading. Not much action in it, so if that's something that appeals to you, you may be a little disappointed. Not much science in it either, don't expect that.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Adelle has done it again. Lover her voice and the melody. Nice to hear and listen to someone that keeps her music all age appropriate
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome game no matter the age. Love Perry and the door levels are fun to. Highly recommend the game lots of fun
1583334386|5.0|One of the 10 best books I have ever &#34;read&#34; (or heared). I liked so much that I had bought two printed copies to give as a gift. Very practical and well written.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew Evans is a handsome , rich, powerful, successful playboy. He's a love 'em and leave 'em type of guy that can't even be bothered to learn the names of his conquests. In short, Drew is a jerk. Yes, the hero of this romance is a big, fat a-hole and yet I fell truly, madly, deeply in literary love with him. Why would a sensible, intelligent woman fall in love with an incorrigible womanizer? Well, Kate Brooks an up and coming investment banker hired by Drew' s firm might be able to answer that one. Because not only is he drop dead gorgeous but so self effacing as to be cute instead of sleazy and oozing charm from every pore. He's also a self described mama's boy, will slay dragons for his little niece and loves his family beyond reason. He will put his career at risk for defending his woman against sleazy advances and do anything and everything to make said woman fall as helplessly in love with him as he is with her. In short, Drew Evans is the bad boy we would love to hate, in fact we should hate, until he does or says something so incredibly sweet and romantic that you will forgive him anything.<br />When the story begins we find Drew sick with the \\"flu\\" but shortly we realize that the flu is nothing but the physical manifestations of a boy who has had everything come easy to him finally turn into a man. A man who suddenly finds<br />that who he wants most in the world may not want him back.<br /><br />I must admit I was pretty apprehensive about buying this book. Even with all the glowing reviews I was really unsure about an author , a woman, being able to realistically pull off a man's POV. But boy did she ever! This is one of the few books that has ever made me laugh out loud. It is funny, sweet, romantic and sexy as hell.The love scenes are steam up your windows hot. It isn't' t very often that I find an author who can pull off humor, angst, romance and sexy love scenes all at once. Tangled is a keeper, a book to 're read again and again when I need a smile on my face. Well written, romantic with a hero to die for and a heroine you can root for. It is the perfect contemporary romance and one I highly recommend. A warning though: do not start this book before bed. I finished it in one sitting at four in the morning! It is that kind of book. Highly recommended.my face. Well written, romantic with a hero to die for and a heroine you can root for. It is the perfect contemporary romance and one I highly recommend.

B0082A3HTQ|5.0|Like the film and loved the soundtrack. To inspire or just listen. A great sort of different kind of musics
B00D739JE0|1.0|Honestly,I dont even own the album.I was a Megadeth back in the day and there last few albums were hit or miss.Heard samples online and sounded okay but in my opinion,a little soft.<br /><br />But I am not complaining about the music itself.It is the price.I cant believe they are charging at least $20 for the deluxe edition.I was in Best Buy today and it was $13 for the same thing.And first thing I thought of was I can get it cheaper on Amazon maybe.So got on I was blown away that it was this high.Why pay $20 plus shipping when you can get it for $13?<br /><br />All I am saying is shop around before buying this on Amazon first.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Another family friendly movie.  So good to have these offerings for moms, dads, kids and their grandparents, too. Love, love....
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The premise and story were cute and had promise. The language was horrible, with no redeeming reason. It was so bad that it ruined any hope I had for enjoying the movie.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I picked this game for my son, but the poor boy has no chance because I am hooked.  The waves are short enough to keep me entertained, but challenging enough to keep me coming back.
0761169431|5.0|This was the best price and has lots of projects... enough to keep a Star Wars fan busy for quite a while.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the zombie genera for a long time and really like this fresh spin on the zombie apocalypse story. Who knew a zombie love story could turn out such a great movie. It's probably not Oscar worthy, but still worth adding to your TO WATCH list.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Had to wait MONTHS for this book to come out, then circumstances prevented me to wait another whole WEEK!!! Alas; I finished it and it is AWESOME!!
B002BBJ52U|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, although halfway through I realized I had actually already seen it before. I'm not sure if that speaks to the memorability of this movie or just my ability to keep track of what movies I have seen.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|My goPro ocean videos came out really great with the reed filter, but man, treat this thing like gold because being plastic, it scratches.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This is a pretty good movie. I have not read the book, so I can't comment on how it compares to that. It was beautifully done, kinda reminded me of the Alice in Wonderland movie that came out a few years ago. I enjoyed watching it and also liked the music used too.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this show.  I did not care to watch it until I saw it available on Amazon.  I love it so much.
1401907725|5.0|Have to be careful to really read the booklet inside to explain more clearly what each card means.  I picked one card that scared me to death because I misunderstood its message until I went to my clairvoyant friend who explained it in detail and told me everything was okay.  Kind of like the Tarot card of Death--the Death card doesn't always mean someone is going to die--and the card I picked in my angel deck didn't mean I was going to die either!  So take the time to REALLY search the meaning of each card!  I don't have time to use them daily, but I have Doreen's book of Angel Numbers which I refer to daily and find easier and quicker to refer to.  I don't use the Angel Oracle cards correctly because I don't use them daily.  I prefer the Archangel and Ascended Master Oracle cards which I use when I have time and feel a particular need to consult them.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|A wonderfully sweet romance.  The characters are well written and the plot is compelling.  I was sucked into this story and read it in one day!  Megan has a sad history, but is starting over fresh when she moves into her recently departed brother's home.  The family next door makes her feel like family and, honestly one of the things I enjoyed most about this book are is this wonderful family.  Todd, her neighbor was her brother's best friend and feels compelled to protect her.  I loved the way their romance unfolded, simply too sweet for words!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0089CLOZQ The Inadvertent Thief (The Thief)]]
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual, Stephen King put out an incredible novel.  Covered a lot of things you never thought about regarding the pros and cons of messing with going back in time and changing &#34;wrongs&#34;.  Sometimes bad things happen for good reasons.  Lots of food for thought.  Also a great story without a lot of gore, so even people who don't read Stephen King because he's too &#34;gorey&#34; will like this one.
B00C1C0WCQ|3.0|There is no doubt that Jeff Goldblum is a worthy actor, but he just can't go it alone in this dino flick. Minus many of the other characters that made the first movie so great (read: Sam Neill, Laura Dern), and combined with the hackneyed, boring plot (the usual corporate fatcats trying to get rich by walking over the rib-bones of everybody else blah blah), this movie blends into a tired list of other B-movies like Moth-Ra and I Was A Teenaged Werewolf, and not even a Master Shlockmeister like Spielberg can save it.. Except that Moth-Ra was actually a pretty good move. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a waste of time.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie warms my heart and reminds me what Christmas is really all about without cramming the Christian religion down my throat.  The TRUE meaning of Jesus and Christmas are about love and charity and helping those--of ALL faiths, or none at all--in need--not about the Christian religion or toys.  Don't blame commercialism at Christmas--commercialism starts in the individual heart--not in the stores.  The stores only make a profit once a year and that is at Christmas so you can hardly blame them for making a big deal out of sales and deals at Christmas time.  As long as you keep the purity of the true message in your heart--and this movie helps you do that--you'll be able to cut the stores some slack and remember that there are other religions who have holy days also during the so called &#34;Christmas Season&#34;.  Christ isn't the only reason for the season.  Keep him and all others in &#34;Christmas&#34;!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This is the worst app I have ever bought.  It did not work, and multiple requests for help from their help feature were ignored.  Many others have also had this experience.  Do not purchase this worthless app!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I first saw this when my son introduced it to me a few years ago and laughed myself silly.  It never gets old!  Definitely one of my two top favorite movies!  If you love British humor, you'll REALLY love this one!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Second time around for us..we really enjoyed it.  Good acting, fun story line, and interesting. Not usually a fan of series but this one was certainly way better than a lot of junk on the air today.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Took it on vacation and weighed a LOT less than the heavy Stephen King book I had downloaded into it!  Read a lot on the plane, in the hotel rooms when not sightseeing, easy to carry and operate, very easy to purchase books and download to it, and I am totally new to this Kindle stuff!  Don't get it without the &#34;pencil&#34; though!
B00005N6KG|5.0|If you like something that is very lightweight, sounds very good, and you cannot stand to have those stupid in your ear things that pass only fallout you will like these headphones.  It looks to me like Sony is phasing them out so I bought a half a dozen pair to last me for the next 20 years.<br /><br />I wish Sony would make these headphones with a microphone so I could use them with my cell phone as well.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|One of the best alien movies of all time. I enjoy it every time we watch it. A must see.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|I really liked this movie, I will definitely watch this again and again. Violent & bad language. Not for children
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Every track is quite good..this is what I love about Fall Out Boy.  If you want some music to get you pumped up,this will do!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this  ap.  It really helps to keep accurate track of power remaining.  It's a simple this but I missed it when I didn't have it and you can't beat the price!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great show! We are almost caught up and Amazon Prime has helped us get caught up. Sharply written showing the contrasting lifestyles between the Lord his family and the servants of Downton Abbey. We are hooked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson loves this game and has tried describing it to me. I finally understood the only way to truly understand was to play. So I downloaded it and love it.
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|It is a great story and shows more exiting characters into the Star Wars Universe such as Ashoka Tano and Captain Rex, but also develops existing characters such as Anakin Skywalker by giving him an apprentice
0142420891|5.0|When I originally bought this book, I honestly didn't even bother reading the description. I loved the first one and I assumed I would like the second. I was surprised that, instead of being written by Mia, it was written by Adam. I actually liked that a lot because, although I am a girl, I feel like there aren't that many &#34;romance&#34; books written by the male and I loved that new perspective.<br /><br />Pros - New voice, in-depth personal discovery for Adam and Mia both, discussion and explanations that explain both main characters, rather than just talking about himself, not too repetitive (the first one was a little repetitive sometimes), brings in the first book but focuses more on the in-between this and last book and this book's present time<br />Cons - Mia seems like a totally different person (having been in her head for the last book, you really felt like you knew her and what she was thinking, but she seems totally different and almost disconnected to people unlike in the first book, where even in a coma she was thinking about others)<br /><br />Overall, I think both books can really give a message to readers - young adults and even mature adults. Mia's experience in the first book is so unlike any of us could possibly imagine that it takes us to the raw emotion of loss, but Adam's experience takes us to the same place - is loss of life more hurtful than the loss of love? Sometimes yes, but sometimes no.<br /><br />I was also shocked to see Gayle Forman has another book published in Jan 2013, and another coming out in November (this series is unrelated to this one I believe). A writer than can write three books in one year is definitely going on my &#34;watch&#34; list.<br /><br />Great buy and amazing read! Going in the classroom library.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had a little trouble getting started since the instructions were very vague but once i got going it was fun &amp; challenging.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Love Dan Brown books makes me want to travel. I am always on the edge of my seat. I also very much enjoy the art history.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|For a few days it worked fine, but then i suddenly slept through it. I tried making another alarm, no good. Overall i think this app is for light sleepers
B00BQ1D7X4|1.0|This cd was worse than anything I have ever heard Jerry do. William can better than Jerry. They need to give him the position of front man. I do not recommend this cd to you if you are a fan of Layne Staley!!!!!!!!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought this the same time I bought my other case from Verso that is interchangeable.  I haven't really used it yet, but I did try it on my case and I like the way it looks.  I think it will work nicely for me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|He was the best.  If you love action then read his entire series of books.  They will not disappoint you.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|As usual, Darius cranks out an album full of soon to be hits.  His heartfelt lyrics, coupled with his artistic ability make this album exceptional. I hope he plans a trip to Anchorage, Alaska soon so I can hear him in person. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this album.
0062238868|5.0|I read the negative reviews and the only boring part of book is in the front where he tells he can't give away mission secrets ( it at front of all their books rightfully) Its a human interest type book but it is also enlighten to the way people over there look at Americans. My favorite part is where he says he is not fighting for the Iraq people but for Americans and his fellow soldier that are trying to prevent the violence from coming to our soil. Thank you to all of Our Military.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! Highly addicting and totally fun. I wasted a whole day playing this game and I didn't mind at all. I would go through again trying each weapon and building up and up and up to the max until the end. I wish there were more levels and weapons. Hopefully in future updates there will be. I got it sometime ago and played a bit and then forgot about it. It was a treasure to find again on my device and play over and over again. Why did I wait so long? Please update with new content. More levels, more weapons, more bosses and more FUN! Such a throw back to old school video games I grew up playing but much more fun and better!
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Works well and as described, would recommend this product to future buyers, well made and priced right for this item.
1419702238|4.0|Met all expectations..,The book was in good condition just as stated on the discription..I will for sure be buying here again 😊<br />Thank you!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|sent email for help in downloading this app not sure as to why its not downloading I have a Samsung Galaxy
B0089K7DGW|5.0|I love this show! It's so addicting! My wife and I  have to watch a show at least every other night.
1932100660|5.0|This book is a must read for those who wish to improve their quality of life AND learn answers to some vexing health questions.  Such as why is heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and more, so prevelant and not responding to mainstream medical care. Many people support many Illness societies to raise more funds for research to lessen the suffering of friends and family suffering from common deathly dis-eases. Read this and spread the word!
B000EUDAWG|5.0|totally awesome my grandson loved it works good but doesn't go on the carpet very well other than that it is fine
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This follows the book very well, whoever did the costume and set design has my praise. Well worth watching, even if you have not finished reading.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|READ THIS:  This game keeps me busy and entertain...Times goes fast!!!!!!! Don't wait...get this game. You must use your brain to solve and find the way out for the next level.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|There are no hints for this game, which is ok, but...... clues are so small, and difficult to see makes some rooms almost impossible.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|can not wait for the next episode, can not stop watching until every one has been seen. I love this show even though I do not usually like zombie movies.  the plot is so good and the characters are so well played......
0855329483|5.0|I just love doing ribbonwork embroidery and this book is a great addition to my reference library, being full of great ideas and cleawr pictures of how to do the stitches.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always played solitaires since childhood and when computer age came along and came with the computer games,this is one of them I look forward. to play
B000001GXC|5.0|Berlin Philharmonic, great orchestra, this recording up to their usual splendid standard.  Would recommend the product to anyone wanting to learn about classical music.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I have given my review about the spider solitaire,and my review will be the same...played since childhood and love it when it came out in computers
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Both my husband and I loved the 1st and 2nd Season, which was given to us as a Christmas gift.  After we finished watching them, I immediately ordered the 3rd Season.  We are now anxiously awaiting the 4th Season.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this app no glitches no pop up adds its Super Fun and totally addictive I will asssure you this game is worth downloading :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In playing Can you Escape,  you have to explore every possible space to find your clues to escape the room. You have to use your clues to open the door to move to the next room. Most exciting game that I've played. Awesome puzzle! Didn't want to put it down. Great game!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book is worth buying!!! It's Amazon ans I'm looking forward to the second book in the series Scarlet<br />.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book these characters are very interesting.. but it left me wanting more...when will the next book be release
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great great great great I can not stop like i am hypnotized you should get this awesome game LOVE IT!
B008NMT684|3.0|This app suits a 3-year old best, but it will quickly make them lose their interest because of the free app's limitations in terms of puzzle offerings.  A paid version must be bought in order to open the app's full offering.  Puzzles don't vary so once the kids figure out how to play it, they'll soon lose interest.<br /><br />On the fence whether I can recommend this or not.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Dr.Panda is the greatest. I get all the free games. I put all of them as favorites. I play all of them all the time.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|It's actually my kid who loves this game app.  He's 6 years old and he absolutely loves everything about Sonic the Hedgehog.  When he first saw this game, he's not impressed because he's accustomed to seeing Sonic run at hyperspeed, not moving fast vertically.  But when he got hooked on it, he can't stop exploring what the game has to offer.<br /><br />Graphics are awesome, giving justice to the Kindle Fire's HD capability.  The challenges are very engaging and uses the Kindle's accelerometer by tilting so Sonic can jump from side-to-side.  It gets a bit harder as the player goes up in skill, thereby keeping them challenged.<br /><br />Can't think of anything right now that may improve this app further but once we stumble upon something I'll definitely update this review.<br /><br />Recommended for 6-year olds and above.
B00CAJP0ZO|2.0|Looked forward to this CD coming out, but once it did, I wish it had stayed away a little longer
0307352153|5.0|This is an absolutely outstanding book, and one of the best I've ever read!  Susan Cain does an extraordinary job breaking down the walls and stereotypes of the \\"unfortunate\\" introverts and replacing our ideations with examples of their assets, influence, and necessity.  Cain is successful in transforming our stunted beliefs through her very well researched and extensive examples  to convey the power of introverts to a society that is unappreciative of their value.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the enormity of research that went into the making of this book, Cain cites almost 300 notes and references throughout the book - a majority of which is cold, hard science and scientific experiments which back up her claims.  Her research alone displays her authority on the topic, and as a side note, if you have yet to hear her TED talk, it is well worth your time.<br /><br />I consider this book to be an absolute game changer in the business world and one that will revolutionize the debate on extroversion vs. introversion.  I highly recommend that everyone grab a copy of this book as I believe it has the power to change your perspective much in the same way that it has mine.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received a free copy of this book from the publisher, WaterBrook Multnomah, as a part of their Blogging for Books program.  I was required to write an honest, but not necessarily positive review in exchange for this copy.  All thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own, and all excerpts are taken from the book reviewed unless noted otherwise.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What else can you say. Always an action packed movie. I love it. Goes on par with the later Tomb Raider movies.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I was pleased to see a character with a good moral heart among the dregs of the legal society.  Not often to see a feel good movie anymore.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The original movie was good, but put it on 3D and WOW. Spielberg did a great job on this one.
0762449306|4.0|Cute! I love the light up feature and the details on the figure are very precise and accurate! I keep it on my desk and it makes me smile.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|While this \\"book\\" is a reasonably good read, it is very short and stops abruptly, as if a single book were chopped into smaller sections and sold piece by piece.  I' not ordering the rest because I do not want to encourage this kind of scam.
1846573807|5.0|The quality of my products have been awesome. The person I bought the fifty shades series for loves it and can't put it down or stop listening to it. Thank you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game. challenging but not so hard its frustrating.  story line is interesting. worth the money. looking forward to the SEQUEL!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game I play it for hours and hours would strongly recommend it for all ages totally addictive and hard to put down kids will adore it
B00597A6NU|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. It stayed close to what I believe to be true of the real Memphis Belle and crew.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game relaxes my mind.  Very addictive, and fun!  I  really enjoyed it , I will recommend this to my friends to play this game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a great time waster!! Lots of Fun making your Village but would like to be able to share with friends on GameLoft LIVE  and see their Villages on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Will not allow me to Login just keep giving me &quot;Please Wait... Frustrate user
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love this game.Each game is a speed round,so lots of fun trying to complete the game within the time limit
0865479410|4.0|Well written, entertaining, and informative.  Burkeman essentially makes the point that we cause ourselves misery by trying to escape it, or by lying to ourselves with positive thinking.  He explains the history and psychology of this paradox, with his personal experiences interjected as examples.  He treats negativity objectively, without pretending that its proponents are perfect.  The only problem with this book is that it is supposed to be about happiness, and the author never takes us that far.  Happiness is more than the absence of suffering.  This book does an excellent job discussing the relief of suffering, but does not discuss how, where, or why to find pleasurable activities.  Enjoy this book as a remarkable stress reliever, but never expect it (or anyone, or anything) to cure all your problems.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This will be inspiring to young kids to get involved with sports and clubs not just political (probably not a good idea to get involved in political stuff). This was by far on of the Best books I have read. Great job by John Grisham again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyable read. Was a good summer book. Great sequel to the hunger games, it was well connected and kept me interested the whole time
B009O2XY12|4.0|Fun game. You don't have to pay to keep playing, but when you run out of your five lives you have to wait an hour to earn another one.... which is a tad too long! But very addicting.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I am amazed how this app works--I put it up to car radio speakers and it identified many songs=very useful and fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|Im currently on version 0.7.1. The best mobile game there is!! Its getting better and better with each update. Soon it will be just like PC!!
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|This was an intreging movie which held my attention throughout. We had no streaming problems with this movie which is unusual for us.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|For stars for being engaging and holding my attention. The thought of Mickey Haller being on the prosecution side of the aisle and using his defense experience to craft a case was a great twist. Anyone who likes fast paced, thought provoking stories will enjoy this.<br />It's a quick read and great for a plane ride. Don't start it if you have urgent things to do. They will be put aside so you can read.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I had wanted to read this for a while, i finally broke down and bought it. I wish i had done so sooner! It was better than I expected!
B00AW57L96|3.0|I did enjoy this book and it is written in a way that you can quickly get through it but it wasn't anything to write home about!
B0002234LS|4.0|Good movie with a pretty good story line. Cheaper on here than any other place i've looked. I can't complain.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I saw the show twice on Broadway - once in previews, once shortly after the official opening, but before it won a slew of Tony awards.  Go see it, but if you can't get to NYC, then get this CD and be prepared for a lot of great music.  Cyndi Lauper shines in her first effort at writing a musical and the performances are fantastic!
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Simply put this album is phenomenon Joe really put his all in this album while I still listen to songs from the good, bad, and the sexy I feel like this album is different he is still the same Joe making music for the grown and sexy but he is using instruments that instantly pull you into the music like compromise the bass pulls you in and his vocals are always the best. I knew that Joe would deliver because that who he is I also love the fact that he is always singing R&B not switching to Pop but is staying the same way that he came out 20 years ago but with more maturity.My favorites are Magic City, Baby and its a tie between More and Love and Sex. So once again if you are looking for something real and authentic then this is the album for your ears to hear good job Joe. From a real Joe fan keep making R&B music so that it is not forgotten.
B00AACBXIG|4.0|The lens hood is well constructed of high quality plastic.  It fits the lens a bit snug, but does what it is intended for and offers a bit of protection to the end of the lens.  Over all, I am pleased.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Good story but left you wanting more! Theo will make a great judge someday. His parents will be very proud!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I'm a Tom Hanks fan, and maybe I just didn't, as the storyteller requested, give it enough time, but I just got tired of bouncing through such disjointed scenes and trying to keep up with the story. Also, just a little too much yukky stuff for my enjoyment.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The book was better than I thought I think everybody should read this anytime and I recommend that you read it.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I liked it better than my husband did. He said what some other reviewers did --- that it didn't compare well to the other Die Hard movies, but I hadn't seen them. Some action movies have me leaving the room --- people aren't just killed, but are killed in violent, graphic, make-me-watch-each-twitch detail. This wasn't one of those. A story line you've seen in other places, but one worthy of repetition.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Based off of a graphic novel of the same name, it got a complete makeover.  An aging Batman has again put on the cape and cowl to reclaim a city who has forgotten him.  It bring backs some old favourites, the Joker, and Two Face, and it introduces some others.  Very gritty and very well done.  I can't wait to purchase part 2.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Watched it on a night when we didn't want to have to click through commercials and then click back because we'd gone to far. Just really needed to rest, and this movie fit the bill. It was fun.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|The film follows Lincoln and the fate of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery.  A war weary Lincoln struggles to pass the Amendment during a lame duck session of Congress, while still fighting (and seeking peace) to end the American Civil War.  It excellent movie and an outstanding cast, you will not be disappointed if you are a fan of American history.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I think I may have grown immune to language not meant for children, so there may or may not be some words in here that would make it unsuitable for small children, but I know it wasn't one of those movies that makes you want to offer the scriptwriter a dictionary and say, &#34;Look! You have other choices!&#34; It was a good story, with a good ending.
0061692042|5.0|It is part of the depth of this great American novel,  that it is called \\"Canada\\"  and that it deals with the life of an American expatriate living at the time of telling the tale in Windsor Ontario,  where he has spent most of his adult life.<br /><br />The story begins where a number of Ford's tales do,  in Great Falls,  Montana.  There Dell Parsons and his sister Berner live with their parents,  a retired Air Force officer and his wife, ill suited for him and as it turns out for the fate that awaits her.  Soon enough father and mother have robbed a bank in the next state over and are quickly apprehended.  The family falls apart.  Berner runs away to California and has only intermittent contact with Dell and none with her parents it seems,  and Dell is taken to Canada by a friend of his mother to escape life as a ward of the state.  There he is the ward of Arthur Remlinger,  another refugee  from the States, and Dell gets to witness Remlinger murder two ominous figures from Detroit before he gets what he wishes for most:  simply  enrollment in high school, and from that point on,  his life subsides back into normality and out of the hot mess that his parents had created for him. (His mother is long since dead, a suicide in a Dakota prison.)<br /><br />The story is striking enough,  but is topped by Ford's vast and sensitive insight into human character.  These are wounded and incomplete people,  perhaps the characters Dickens might have written about with a 21st century sensibility.  Many are grotesques,  in a more modern analogy,  from a Faulknerian perspective.  But all ring true,  and I found Ford's depiction of them penetrating and memorable.<br /><br />Ford has written much about these United States,  in the Bascombe trilogy and elsewhere.  But this is his finest achievement to date.  I believe it bears more than a little analysis and comment that his main and most lovable character,  his insightful narrator, finds it much more comfortable to live outside our borders, if only across the bridge in Windsor.  Much of what the book talks about is crossing borders and boundaries, geographic, psychological, criminal.  Dell can only manage to deal with and talk about his upbringing from the refuge of Canada.  He is perhaps the last young American to escape  if only poetically to Canada from Vietnam and its progeny of war that haunts and harms us to this day.<br /><br />What does it say about us that this Great American Novel is called what it is?borders, if only across the bridge in Windsor.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|I use this to identify music that I don't know or can't remeber either, or both, the title and the artist. It's uncanny how quick and accurate Shazam really is. My music collection contains both modern and older selections with some going back to the 30's and 40's. No matter how obscure the selection Shazam seems to know it.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Right now, I have to say, this album is the soundtrack to my summer of 2013. I can't recommend it enough. Yes, it's different from most of Daft Punk's previous albums. It's a little more disco and less electronic. It's not a bad thing. The tracks are also pretty varied, but without coming off as disjointed. Good album. High recommendations.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I always liked Tina Fey's humor on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" - she was definitely one of the best ever to sit at the anchor's desk.  I also liked her nerdy sexy look, which Fey would have us understand did not develop overnight and relies on a lot of help to achieve.  The Fey you get in \\"Bossypants\\" is eerily similar to \\"30 Rock's\\" Liz Lemon.  She's a bit neurotic but also rather opinionated, and she doesn't care what you think about her unless you don't like her, in which case she's sorry.<br /><br />\\"Bossypants\\" is loosely an autobiography, in the vein of David Sedaris.  In other words, it skips around in time and cherry-picks interesting stories from Fey's life.  I actually read the newest Sedaris book at the same time as \\"Bossypants,\\" and both authors share the same observational type humor that often relies on cutting/hilarious descriptions of people and their foibles.  For example, Fey's stories about working at a Chicago-area YMCA often revolved around her deskmate, Donna, whom she describes as \\"an enigma wrapped in bacon wrapped in a crescent roll.\\"<br /><br />If you've seen Fey's comedy, then you know what to expect.  \\"Bossypants\\" is very funny but also fairly poignant at times, especially when Fey discusses her daughter.  She also clearly is proud to be a female who succeeded in the male-dominated comedy culture.  Some readers may get a bit tired of that message, but Fey never takes herself too seriously -- as soon as she builds herself up as a pioneer of female comedy, she'll depict herself as foolish or petty.  All for a good laugh.<br /><br />Note: This review is for the Kindle version.  The transfer to e-book seems to have been done carefully, and I did not see any obvious errors that would affect the reading of \\"Bossypants\\" on Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and gets you thinking! Very creative, and I love the puzzles.  Granted, it sometimes gets frustrating...but I feel accomplished when I make it through!
B004YF6MHW|1.0|Camera pictures upside down no matter what I seem to do horrible on my kindle hd and I used some of my free coins for this...not a happy camper what can I do to return this get my coins back
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed working through the levels and solving the puzzles. Puzzles made sense not random actions. Fun and not frustrating to do.
1469220725|3.0|This book was a let down to me.  I was so pumped when it finally came out, but although it was okay, it just wasn't what I had hoped after reading the first two of the series which were awesome.  I think the ending is what I disliked the most....It honestly seemed rushed.  Apparently Sylvia Day intends to write another book to spin off of this, but I don't know if I will be staying on this ban wagon.
4789004546|5.0|Easy to carry around and has lots of detail explanation of Japanese grammar. The print is a little small but its definitely worth the money.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I loved this movie! However, redeeming the code for the digital copy was a nightmare and trytin to redeem the &#34;free&#34; movie ticket was a total failure on Disney's website. I'd recommend going with the Blueray/DVD combo only and skip the combos including digital copies if the price is lower. The movie itself is the reason for my five-star rating.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I liked it okay. Would like to see a few more levels because it has lots of potential. I would recommend it for those who are looking for something different.
B0002234LS|5.0|Excellent.. I'm absolutely smitten with Johnny Depp so this was exciting to receive
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the first app I have ever paid for.  It was worth it.  I love how I can sync my gmail calendar, and be able to see it on my kindle!  This has helped a ton with keeping on the same page as my husband.  Wonderful.  Thank you!
B009GENZ12|1.0|I must warn you that this review contains a massive spoiler.  So please don't read ahead if you don't want to know what happens.  On the other hand--if you want to save your sanity and a few dollars please do read ahead because I will tell you exactly what happens and why you shouldn't even bother renting this film.<br /><br />It's socio-political commentary on why poor people are bad, but rich city-folk are good.  I.E. Jessica Biel is kidnapping the children and giving them to a \\"tall man\\" to sell/trade/give to super rich people who want kiddos of their own and who live in big fancy cities--because we all know that trailer trash and poor people are THE ONLY people in the world who drink and beat their kids and can't provide for them.  This, without a doubt, was the single worst social commentary on the state of \\"poor\\" versus \\"rich,\\" in this country. It was made, I guarantee, by some yuppie, Harvard, elitist grad who had little better to do with their time--OR by someone who was raised in coal-minin' country and who wished they could have been raised by the guy down the street who had a porsche instead.  What a bunch of sociopathic mind-babble.  Also--apparently--if you're from Appalachia, or Ky...or anywhere else with stereotypes of wearing no shoes and living in a broken down trailer, then you can't possibly be educated or be worth anything in the world.  Nevermind those of us who do happen to live in the country, or rural area, and who have master's degree's, par example--and who still aren't getting paid enough to put beans on the table for our kids because we're pop-culture professor's--nope...just not good enough for Jessica Biel who will come snatch our kids in the night and sell them to city folk, 'cause city folk don't drink, or smoke, or beat their kids at all.  What a load of whooey.  Save yourself money and don't buy this elitist piece of crap, unless your last name happens to be Bush or Rockefeller--then I suppose it will serve your ego quite well.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Different than what I thought it was like. Very touching and shows how we need to have compassion for everyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so cool because it is challenging and easy at the same time. I reccommened everyone to get this game because there is a 100% chance that you are going to LOVE it!!!!!!!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It is much better than tv series. Exciting enough with many story lines. i cannot leave it once started reading.
B00BRUYQFC|2.0|Very repetitive. I am glad that I bought it when it was on sale otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.
B002M87W2W|4.0|I have seen this movie several times in the past and just wanted to see it again.  The movie and quality met my expectations
B00APYKXFS|2.0|I can only describe this game as unconstructive chaos. I never knew what was hoing in right out the gate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book rocked me to my core. One of the top 3 books I've ever read in my entire life.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It definitely keeps me occupied. I also like the sounds because it makes me feel like I'm really doing something. Lol!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|A slow tortuous read that I invested way too much time on hoping it would improve.  Not worth the effort to struggle through.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have played magic for years. This game seems to have all the right elements, easy controls, and enough of a challenge to make it fun. Haven't gotten too far into the story line yet but so far I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a very fun game. I have enjoyed solving each room puzzle to proceed on to the next room. it is a very d<br />enjoyable way to keep boredom away.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is exceptional.  The characters are so rich in their dimensions and the story lines are woven together masterfully.  I especially like how the stories are not told in a day to day fashion (like daytime soap operas), instead they show the passage of time and how that influences the characters current lives.
B00004T9VY|4.0|great classic album from the college days.  just wanted it again but I have probably bought it 5 times over the years.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was by far the best book in the entire series. Stephanie has introduced a vampire like the world has never known. It is so refreshing they walk by day, and garlic is once again just a spice. Lol. I was hooked on vampires when I first saw the original \\"Bela\\" do his thing.  I read \\"Salem's Lot\\" and became truly afraid of the dark. \\"The Lost Boys\\" saw me thru my goth period, with fitted porcelain fangs even. SEXY! \\"True Blood\\" gave us romance, but nothing compares to the true, unbreakable love between these two. Her characters are still rich and detailed, and she didn't leave me feeling like somethings missing.  I had become so immersed in this story, I started to adopt some of their gifts in real life.  My driving is better,  and I swear I can read my husband's mind now.  Lol.  Please, open your mind and truly ENJOY this remarkable tale. Well done Stephanie.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|I enjoy learning about other cultures and have often wondered why some societies seem to do better than other's.  Guns, Germs, and Steel goes a long way to answering my question.<br />Three stars was my choice because I felt some of the info was repeated.<br />You have to enjoy anthropology  to get the most from  this book
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is sorta fun when you're bored or if you need a break from other games. It's not bad at all.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Best game ever except for the fact that u cant create EVERYTHING on this app which is why i aint givin it no 5 star rating
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Great acting & script...refreshing plot.<br />Like a book you can't put down you eagerly follow from one episode to the next.
B0063GORYU|5.0|have always loved the game and it is great to have on my kindle.  do wish it was a little harder
B0079J28NW|5.0|I have the VHS and the Blue Ray is far superior. It's great for grand children. Our 3 and half year old granddaughter left her week long stay singing Yellow Submarine and All Together now.<br /><br />Included with the disc are 16cm by 12cm transparencies of the carton characterizations of the four Beatles.  Also included is a 16cm by 12cm sheet of stickers of the individual Beatles, the Glove, Jeremy Hillary Boob, the yellow submarine, LOVE, The Blue Meany, and a group shot of the Beatles.<br /><br />There's a booklet (16cm by 12cm) with the story and pictures of the making of the movie.<br /><br />It's great DVD to have if you are  Beatle fan and/or grand parent.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|So much emotion in the sound. The band really gives you the feel that your sitting on the top of that tree in their artwork book. They give a light, airy, and almost mystical happy feel to alot of their songs. They also have the ability to make some harder sounds, but they really can put my imagination to work, or put me to rest with the rhythms.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Wow, did they ever bring back a fantastic classic!  Fantastic graphics, super story line, and SCARY!<br /><br />Heck yeah, it was good.  Really enjoyed.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|It's rare that a book manages to capture your imagination, touch your heart, and teach you something about yourself and humanity. This book does that, and much more. Interweaving lessons on family, religion, logic, and compassion, Speaker for the Dead entertains you while it teaches you, much as it does with its own characters.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is exactly what our youth needs to read.  The authors tells the story in a manner that it feels like your right there.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end!  I cannot imagine how much time went into the research for this book.  Thank you Mr Makos and Mr Alexander for a very enjoyable book.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show an character progression. Builds on a terrific first season and takes you more into their world and struggles. Definitely a must watch.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The characters in this movies are so hilarious that you should definitely visit the bathroom before you start watching lest you pee your pants! Set in the 50s, a daring young woman decides to write about life from the perspective of the black maids. The stories that emerge are both touching and hilarious--also shocking. I can't believe our country was at such a low point with regard to equal rights during that era. The only downside to this movie is that sometimes the characters' true to life accents can be difficult to understand, especially if you are hard of hearing (my husband could not understand half the dialog). But if you watch the movie more than once, you'll get most of the dialog the second time around. Loved this movie!
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Good acting, good storylines. Always fun. Less gory than some seasons. More character driven. Deb is finally getting some realistic spunk.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Totally loved it!! I just wish they would make the narrator sound happier or something!! I love One Direction!! Their all perf!!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|this game is cool you go threw different leveles they start of easy ends hard I have not finished the game yet
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Got the free version first &amp; loved it so much bought this full version.  It has more sounds &amp; features, including special headphone required beta waves which are great for boosting focus or relaxing while drowning out the noisy world around you.  Highly recommend this app!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is truly an amazing book, it gets that touching spot in your heart. It is definitely worth reading, one of the best books I've read.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I felt obliged to finish this book, despite being continually frustrated by the jarring and constant changes in POV, because of the price. I didn't read Kite Runner, and perhaps this is the authors style of writing, but personally I do not have the patience for it. Repeatedly, I was drawn in by well-developed characters in an interesting plot only to have to start over when the author would switch to a new mystery character leaving me guessing what was happening, to whom, and when. I would constantly lose interest and, like I mentioned, the only factor driving me forward was the fact that I paid 13.90 for this book. Also, the ending was extremely anticlimactic and I didn't even realize I had finished when it ended. It seems this authors loves to keep his reader guessing and while it was a sad story, it didn't elicit much emotion from me. However, what I did find interesting was the Afghan culture presented. Beyond that, I would not recommend this book.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|The Amazon.com review says it best -- no matter what the movie content is, Tom Cruise gives it his undivided attention. He aims to entertain & he succeeds. I have not read the Jack Reacher novels (altho I think I will now) so had no issues with whether Mr Cruise was physically right for the part. He delivers on the action sequences, he adds a nice touch of humor to the proceedings, he swaggers w. the authority required of this character & refreshingly does not sleep with his employer even tho there is some heat between them. He can be classy or crude as the situation requires & when he walks thru the crime scenes he actually looks like he is thinking things through --the dialogue is snappy, the villains are a believable combination of low-life stupid ,no- nonsense killer & behind-the-scenes creepy/lethal & the car chase is awesome.  I went into this movie with no expectations other than knowing that Mr Cruise almost always delivers the goods & I enjoyed it more with each viewing. I am not quite convinced that the main actress is right for the part but she grew on me. And the other supporting actors are excellent. Tom don;t work with no slackers!! For an \\"actioner\\" this movie has a good blend of quiet scenes, real conversations & macho action that moved the plot forward w/o being waaay over the top.When the action happens it feels integral to the story & not tacked on just to show off the stunt work. The opening scene is ,from what I have read from Army/Marine sniper memoirs, chillingly accurate in its professional detachment & matter of fact methodology. It should bother you & it does!! It's good to watch this movie more than once because once you know the plot you can go back & enjoy seeing how it all gets set up every step of the way. Hey -- this movie kept me involved & entertained for 2+ hours & made me want to see it again to catch what I missed the first time around --that's what I want in a movie of this genre & that's what this movie delivered.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game but it is fairly easy. I'm hoping with more levels coming it will get more challenging but I am enjoying it so far!
B000FC11JW|5.0|Some language and examples are dated, but the observations and techniques remain completely relevant. For example:<br />  - First- and second-level managers nowadays usually don't know anywhere near as much as their people about the job's true challenges and solutions.<br />  - It rarely works to try to make a person something that he/she simply is not. Capitalize on people's skills instead of trying to manufacture skills in them.<br />  - If a person has a major weakness in his role, don't try to fix the situation by splitting the role with another person who has complementary skills and weaknesses. Both will struggle. Things will most likely worsen.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Helen Mirren was the cherry on top of a fantastic cast of actors. All the action and humor I've come to expect from a Bruce Willis flick. Definitely a nice watch!
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Even better in HD. Story and affects hold up well. Streaming works perfectly. Will definitely be watching more movies this way.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app does not disappoint.  I converted from apple devices to Samsung and have loved the android apps.  There is no noticeable difference in the apple Kindle app and the android app.
0307277887|5.0|My daughter received most of the series for Christmas and has enjoyed them very much.<br />Of course the books live up to the reader's high expectation; my daughter highly recommends she does warn, though, that like many other books that spin off a movie or television series the books are not simply the written version, but a completely different feel all together. The first season of the television series is only loosely based on the first book, and from that point there are extreme differences in character development, storyline, etc. As per just about any other book/film sharing same title and basic storyline-- approach with an open mind and appreciation for the art (whether it's film or written).
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Very well constructed story, more personal revelation than murder investigation. A harrowing narrative of an unremembered childhood slowly revealed into consciousness, with all the pain and small moments of joy relived.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. It was a lot of fun finding the clues and where to use them. Can't wait for update with more rooms.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Even the Nazis were capable of love.  The basic theme of this story is doing bad things sometimes come home to hurt you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Definitely an improvement from Temple Run.  Better graphics, better challenges and still very addicting.  Interesting choice to have one big monster chasing you, instead of a pack.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have read every Psy/Changeling book and this one is one of my favorites. She is adept at placing subtle hints that bind all of her stories together even though each can be read individually.  I cannot think of another series I have liked better than this one.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I enjoyed this so much I just want to turn to page 1 and start all over again! Told as a series of interviews, World  War Z chronicles the events that led up to, during and after the Zombie War. Max Brooks has written a hugely entertaining story, a mix of humour, tragedy and action that is all too believable, that is if we ever were to experience a zombie apocalypse! His characterization of the interviewees was excellent, each one had a separate &#34;voice&#34;  and I was able to visualize each of them.<br />Even if you're not into the whole zombie thing , this is still a great book, as it examines how we as a species deal with threats to our existence, often with kneejerks, and quite ineffectively, but ultimately with success through sheer dogged determination, while also studying the way that traumatic events change and scar the participants.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|*Ridiculously hard to see what is going on with default settings.<br /><br />*Ridiculously hard to play with default shake setting.  Two fingers is easier.<br /><br />*Ridiculously hard to play the game.  Reversing the gravity gets you killed as often as not.  A waterfall of enemies on about level 14 is pretty much impossible.<br /><br />*Ridiculously hard gameplay.<br /><br />*Ridiculously repetitive repetitiveness.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this app. Very addicting I have to find the next clue to move on. Its 3 am and I'm still playing.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I've never read anything in connection with the orphan trains that were used in the US in the early 1900s, so the book description interested me.  I ended up really liking the story and its two points of view.  Very interesting topic.  Great, quick read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Easy to use with great pictures! Free app has a variety of pictures. Can be habit forming! Highly recommend for all ages.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I always enjoy Hosseini's stories.  This one has so many characters, almost too many.  A few of them seemed unnecessary and disconnected from the others.  This was certainly no Kite Runner, but I did enjoy it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is one of the best hack n slash games. The only problem u have is u can not buy health potions with coin instead of diamonds. That costs to much and takes forever to get diamonds in the game unless u pay for them. This needs to change then the game will be a 5 star game.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I have all three uk versions. and Christmas in no where... I hear season 4 is out in January on pbs. when will it be on blue ray, since pbs cuts it so bad.?
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I totally enjoyed watching Season 1 of the Tudors. The acting is especially good along with the sets and clothing. Looking forward to the other three seasons.
0062127241|5.0|I love his remarks about their experience at Woodstock.<br />When the movie first came out , it was the Who scene that was the best ever.<br />They were at their heights and appeared like the true gods of rock.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I've never played Mahjong before getting this app. What I especially like is that, while it was quick to learn, as I continue to play I find myself working out strategies to improve my success rate as well as reduce the time it takes to coplete a game.<br /><br />It's  favorite of mine!
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|Great opportunity. Let's me check out new authors. I will be following some of their other writings. I know they will be worth paying for.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|OK maybe not ICE cold, that was a bit of an exaggeration.<br /><br />I have an Intel Core i5 3570k sandwiched between an MSI motherboard and a Zalman Coolmax CPU heatsink fan, and at the turbo frequency of 3.8 GHz my CPU runs at ~57 degrees C at full load.<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not have a compilation of temperature test result comparisons using stock heat sinks or thermal pastes, I'm just reporting what I currently have. I was told this was the best paste, so I bought it and have yet to regret it.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Withings is the only monitor I found that does everything well. Alert functions and real time interaction worked flawlessly. I would recommend.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Didn't know what to expect from this album, but it is a truly AWEsome evolution of the band's sound and creation. True to their roots, but innovative and fresh in many ways. Driving beats, gorgeous melodies/solos and divine breakdowns that'll get any headbanger crushing their skulls on the dashboard!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have only used it once and it seems to work fine.  nice that it is free and will use it more later on when i get more time.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|If I am bored I play it but most of the time I don't play because I love it! I would recommend it for the fans of temple run but I will admit I like this better than temple run! Most I am sure will enjoy the change of countries!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent story of endurance and courage.  Recommend it to all.  Very well written and easy to read.  A little slow going in the beginning as we are educated on the life of Pi Patel ad a child and the characteristics of the zoo animals.  Moves quickly after the ship sinking.  All in all....a very good book.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love waking up to my alarm clock in the mornings. I wish I could wake up to my favorite music in the morning. I LOVE MY ALARM CLOCK!
B0049VZ222|5.0|A lot of my friends were into this show and I thought, oh bah zombies who cares.  Also, I am not into horrow movies and the tv frightening me.  But, I was hooked after the first episode!!!!  This show is SUPER well written, acting is top notch and the story os VERY compelling.  It will hook you no problem.  Yes, there are undead walking around being creepy but at its heart the show is about human nature, survival and family.  I am telling everyone who isn't already hooked to get on board.
B007SXB498|5.0|How funny people are.  Some follow blindly the dictates of the times,  some actually think about what is going on in other people's lives.  Great sense and great sensibility, too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is good for when your broad !! You can buy players and more it is really awesome you should buy it.  : )!!
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Took a while to get rolling but then had me hooked for a fantastic ride.  Looking forward to the rest.
0060581808|4.0|Educational as well as fun and interesting.  This is the second book of this series I am reading to my 7 year old and he loves them!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr Alexander was not long out of his NDE when he penned this work.  He writes with a clarity the is indicative of one who has been awakened much longer.  A good work by a good man.  Surely there will be more to come.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I take my Motorola Xoom everywhere with me it is nice to be able to see items on Pinterest while shopping.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Great actors brought to life in an impeccable scenario make Downtown Abbey worth every minute. Shifting from movie-like presentations to theateresc scenes the production surrounds the colors of English nobility both questioning and complimenting its habits. In this area it adds plots of all sizes from war to daily life struggles.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a super fun mind bend! Please please make more rooms! Can't wait for the next challenge! Challenge
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I could not get it to work on my Kindle.  You had to put an activation code in that they sent you.  I would never activate even though I attempted to do it numerous times.  I finally took it off the Kindle.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|Very good new breakout star!  She has a nice voice and an appeal to all ages.  We recommend it!  I love it!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I got through level one, and on level two, I cannot figure it out at all.  It is too frustrating.  If anyone has any tips, I would be glad to have them.
1891252089|5.0|I have been using this book for years and it is my primary guide for Ashtanga Yoga.  Most Ashtanga books show someone in each pose as if anyone can just pop into it.  Nice to have a goal but for the less flexible that isn't really very useful.  That is where David's book succeeds where others fail...there are step by step instructions and photos for each asana to help people who can't just get right into a pose.  Many of the poses I will probably never be able to fully get into but with David's starting points it gave me way to get started.  Over the years I have found that I am progressing and this book helps you move along in each asana.  This book makes what Pattabhi Jois says about practicing...\\"practice and all is coming\\"...more accessible for  average people.<br /><br />One thing I should add is that I learned the primary series from a great instructor but for the last six years have lived hundreds of miles from the nearest Ashtanga instructor.  Ashtanga Yoga by David Swenson has really helped me keep my practice going.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The combination of deceptively simple writing, memorable characters and deep, malevolent strangeness makes for an unforgettable experience.  Nothing can ever provide an outsider with the reality of what it's like to live in North Korea but this book comes as close as we may ever get.  It's as close as anyone would wish.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this<br />one.  I love the M1Garand.  One of my favorite guns from WW2.  I hope that the updates keep coming and they include more weapons from that era.  The simulation of the firing is good and really accurate.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I initially downloaded the album to my iPod and plugged it into my car stereo.  Played it from start to finish several times.  I think the songs on this album are probably more melodic than in past albums.  I always like to hear at least one song with Dave M. talking/singing thru his teeth and grumbling about the political system and Dave E's killer 5 string bass -- got my serving of that in Dance In The Rain and Beginning of Sorrow.  Perhaps not as robust as We The People from the previous album (13), but enjoyed it nonetheless.<br />The Blackest Crow and Don't Turn Your Back were unusual with the banjo and more classical sounding guitar.  Probably some Chris B. influence what with his academic music background - I hope Dave M. uses more and more of Chris' talent on new music.  I enjoyed it all.  The Thin Lizzy cover song Cold Sweat was a surprise and a decent rendition.<br /><br />The current Megadeth lineup is absolutely perfect and the best they have ever had in their 30+ years.  I hope they can all stay healthy and together for many years to come.<br /><br />Buy this album !!<br /><br />Rock and Roll !!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|great acting by all those involved, especiall Daniel Day Lewis<br />great history of our country's toughest period<br />should be watched by anyone interested in our country's history
1451695195|3.0|Not that great of book.  It sort of gets like a Carlos Casteneda book near the end.  I don't really think he even had a near death experience.  I think he was really sick  and got better but I think his experience gives no new info.  I know everyone thinks this was great but I came away with nothing new.  If you like this sort of thing then you will like it.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Great movie, great music. Brings back good and sad feelings of the late sixties.  It was incredeble the way they hooked up the scenes to the music
1594204217|3.0|Good book  but Pollan repeats himself a lot even within a paragraph.  It seems an editor should have pointed this out.  Had the duplication been removed the book would have been a little shorter.  Most readers would understand the concept if presented only once.
B00847KFDS|4.0|like the cd, great mix of old music, collaberating with other good entertainers. Would recomend this music to any John Forgerty fans./
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie touches you in unexpected ways.  It draws you in and makes you care about the characters.  Perfect for a date night in or a gathering of friends.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need more levels but other than that quite challenging and entertaining. Addictive too. Possibly a little more challenging for the addicted puzzle solvers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Took me awhile to figure it out, but once it finally gleaned on me how to play, it is fun!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This by far the best mouse I have ever purchased. I got this mouse to use with my gaming computer and I can honestly say it has far exceeded my expectations. If you need a Laser Mouse for a gaming computer look no further.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Can't get enough of the minions...<br /><br />Good story, entertaining for the whole family and the minions are hilarious.<br /><br />Ages 13, 11, 6 all found parts of the movie they loved.<br /><br />Will definitely see part 2.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS A ROMANCE ABOUT TWO YOUNG PEOPLE FALLING IN LOVE, BUT ITS ALSO A MYSTERY INTERTWINING THE CHARACTERS IN WAYS YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another highly praised Tarantino flick which is well deserved of its awards. I'm not really sure how Daniel Day-Lewis beat out Jamie Foxx for Best Actor. Lewis did look like Lincoln but Foxx was more believable to his role.
B008602KQI|1.0|For those who wanted to see, the Hunger Games you would have to wait an hour and eight minutes for it to start. Their are so many foolish notions in the film. Such as someone having enough time, while being chased, to completely camouflage himself in order to hide from those who are trying to kill him. The worst of it all is that the min character isn't even a real winner, every time she is about to die someone is always there to save her, you got to love convenience. And for the action, it's like to a roller coaster on a weekend. You'll have to wait in line, be on the roller coaster for a few minutes, and have to wait in line again. Funny enough, The beginning and end are the only real action scenes. Everything else is just a long filler to make the film seem long.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I bought this for my son to use on his Kindle Fire HD and he really loves it. It makes it so much easier to use the Kindle and he says that when this wears out he will definitely purchase this same item again. I am glad I made a good choice, it made a good gift.
0345528581|5.0|you will get in shape in ways that just aren't possible with free weights.  the biggest difference i notice is a much higher consciessness of my body and how it relates to the world around me.  my body feels very useful.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've been using the Anker Car Charger for a couple of weeks now. The charger was simple to connect to the car's port and fits in very snug. The charger has performed exceptional thus far, no issues charging my Android phone and my girlfriend's iPhone. Don't know how I went for so long without one. With my long commutes it virtually eliminates the need to plug my phone in when i'm at work or home to charge.<br /><br />I'd recommend this without a doubt to anyone looking for a Dependable and High Quality Car Charger.
B00BESJYAY|2.0|We could not get the movie to play through our xbox. It kept shutting down saying amazon was having a problem. We ended up watching it on DIsh. The movie was great. disapointment is with Amazon not movie.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|In my personal opinion, this album is my second favorite by 30 Seconds to Mars. It did the same thing their first album did for me, it made me dream up of amazing, dark and beautiful imagery. Angels and demons, playing out an epic tale of love, the unknown, and bloody fights. I love music that makes me imagine such things.<br />Anyway, this album is also pretty unique and cross-genre musically. The song \\"Pyres of Varanasi\\" has the construction of dub step, and \\"Conquistador\\" is very energetic rock. Jared Leto's voice is awesome, as usual.<br />But, if you hate electronic music and wish the band was still playing psychedelic, industrial rock than don't get this album.
1452110581|5.0|Not as cutesy as the title might imply.  A fun gift for the cat lover with a sense of humor.
B0084WTF5M|5.0|riveting....<br />Well written....narration was first class.I will recommend...The story held your attention firmly to the finish..THE DEPTH OF THE STORY IS RIVITING..
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This series is fun, fast paced and addictive.  I came up for air after the fourth one and have not started the fifth.  Resistance is futile.  I will probably buy it today....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got temple run and I loved it. then as I was searching the app store I saw TEMPLE RUN 2 it. looked cool so I bought it that was around a year ago but I still play temple run -and two!
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|I am familiar with Kaufman's work, so when I know he was writing such a book, I knew I had to get it, and I wasn't disappointed.  This book provides a simple, easy-to-follow guideline that will help you be good at anything you want to learn.  Get it if there is anything you want to learn but feel you don't have enough time
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Great movie from a time when dialog actually mattered (and was well written)! Sure it's dated, but I would like to see some of today's &#34;stars&#34; try to match wits with Katherine Hepburn.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game I have a kindle and it is so much fun my sister have this game to she said that it is very fun to.
B005HESLUA|5.0|I think I was only in 6th grade when this show first came on TV, but I really liked it. Now that I'm older, I appreciate it even more. Captain Janeway is awesome!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. I use it often. Very simple easy to read calculator easy to use the buttons are big for us with clumsy fingers .  It a must  downloaded and its free!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Never has anything been written like this before (well, except for the other Monty films and serials)!  Just really love it!
B004YF6MHW|4.0|At the Google Play store it is still in the 4.1.1 version. I am disappointed with a pour resolution, but the most advantage of this application is a great free family of the extra applications.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is another great continuation of Gideon and Eva's story. Yes, it will leave you wanting more.  There are still the unraveling of emotions and more that needs to be known. To explain what I mean you must read.  Writing this makes me want read it again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Free version of this application is still very popular, but there are many levels of the game that is impossible to play with that version. Paid version is that!!!
1781162646|4.0|This is a coming-of-age story and a mystery rolled into one. The writing is good, which is typical of Stephen King books, and it's an easy read (at less than 300 pages, it is much shorter than most of his works). I would recommend it to all King fans, as well as those who are not.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Really funny, great for cat lovers! Is sort of short but it is a book that you can read again. Good for anyone who wants a laugh!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James is the Tom Peters of our new century.  The ideas James presents in this book are similar to the ideas laid out by Tom Peters in the '80's and '90's, in many if not all of his books.  Tom's ideas were developed in the context of work within larger organizations, I.e. how can corporations and those within the corporate walls adapt to the new technology and paradigm shifts we were seeing then.  His key concept was &#34;The BRAND Called You.&#34;.  James takes the concept a huge leap forward by not only adapting it to the real opportunities available today, but also by empowering individuals to break the corporate shackles that rob them of any chance of achieving personal, financial and spiritual fulfillment.  As we say in Texas, &#34;Atta-way-to-go!&#34;. Thank you, James.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love that I can access my books from my phone. But I'd love it if I could access everything on my Kindle like my pictures & music that I have in the cloud. I have a cloud app on my phone that I wish I could access my music. But overall, I love tjat I can read my books anywhere I go, even if I forget to take my Kindle with me.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series is the best I've read.<br />It combines imaginative fiction with a little dark magic, which makes for an entertaining read.<br />I found myself deeply engrossed in the book and found it difficult to put it down.<br />I'm anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.
0060794410|5.0|I have listened to this book twice now, and am working on helping my team implement some of the principles he outlines in this book. They are sound and timeless, and he does a good job of laying them out. I also enjoy his enthusiasm for the principles taught, and how this shows in his narration.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|I read the reviews before I got this FAOTD, and I kept seeing people say that this game is terrible, but those reviews are garbage to be honest. Get this game if you like fast paced overhead shooters. The controlls are polished and the gameplay is tough. A few times played and I was making it to phase 20+. That being said the music needs a little work and just a thought perhaps a musically reposponsive background and the option to import your own trans would be awesome.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I've tried using other email apps on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" for my Yahoo! account, but they lack in functionality in comparison to the \\"Real McCoy.\\"  One crucial function that trumps all other apps is its send/receive speed.  When you're chatting with someone by email, time is of the essence.  I have sound and display notifications set up for my Yahoo account, and when tested side by side with about five other email apps, Yahoo! always notifies me immediately of the email.  Also, the ability to just swipe from the left and access the other folders (such as Sent) that are synced with my Yahoo! account is another time-saving feature.  The only reason I'm not giving it a full five stars is because of the default small size print.  I have not found a way within the app's settings to permanently set the print to a larger size.  You can change the size every time you write an email, but I find that annoying.  Also, I would like the ability to change the background to black with white text (a lot easier on the eyes). Lastly, when I hit the Return key after I've created my subject line (because the space is so small before the signature line) the app closes out to the Kindle Fire's homescreen. Otherwise, this app is the best I've found for ease of use with my Yahoo! account.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Great story of perseverance, courage and grace by a man with a stutter who became King of England, his wife and his incredible speech therapist.  Experiencing this movie brings to mind how incredibly fortunate we are that this honorable man became King and was a beacon of strength for the English people and the Allied Forces during WWII.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Read through this book in 2 and a half days and I'm ready for her to continue the series. I liked 50 shades but it ended with no place to continue. This has so much more to go and I love that. Keep writing Ms. Day and I'll keep reading.<br /><br />P.s. I have already read all of her other books.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Wonderful story, characters, actors, and the drama of the greatest racehorse that ever lived, winning the triple crown--with the third leg, the Belmont Stakes, in a time and margin of victory that has never been approached.<br /><br />We watch this movie often, easily once a week.  Last night we watched another movie, winner of Oscars,a dark movie, and then followed that movie with Secretariat, to reaffirm that which is strong, honorable and courageous--that which is uplifting in our lives.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is just amazing. Unlike lots of first-person shooters on Android, this one has tons and tons of weapons, attachments, customizations, and gamemodes! Get this game before anything else! I personally like multiplayer the most, but singleplayer is pretty fun and unique as well!
B00AKKGX4W|1.0|I usually devour books like these pretty easily, as if they're little bits of candy, but I couldn't finish this one,and I tried a few times.<br /><br />Milan does not ride the rail well in judging when enough history is enough history. In some places, I felt as if I should 've been taking notes like this was a textbook.  Too much history.<br /><br />I didn't like the characters, either. I just looked through the book and I already can't recall the hero's name. He was well-enough developed for a serious, political sort. I started off liking Minerva & came to dislike her very much. Her change is too dramatic. I especially didn't like her when she played off his near-rape of her & turned it into a sex scene.  He throws her against a wall & starts pulling up her skirts to have his way, and she gets turned on & plays Brer Rabbit (oh no, don't give me your cock. I don't want that). What a horrible message for female readers. I couldn't & wouldn't continue at that point.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game for both myself and my children. Until it performed an upgrade. And ever since it has caused my Kindle to freeze up periodically. Annoying.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed every bit of this book and was very happy with the outcome... I would not have wanted it to end any other way.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|EXCELLENT PRODUCT, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED, THE SELLING SENDING THE PRODUCT AS THE APPROVED THING, RECOMMENDED TO THE MAXIMUM, WITHOUT MISADVENTURES, THE PRODUCT PERFORMS THE BETTER THING
B006PKQQJS|4.0|Only one problem there's nopony in this game only people like my good friend twilight sparkle saw when she went back and retrieved her crown back. But besides that if you asked me how I liked it I'd say Eeyup (like my brother)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Long after other games bore me I'm still surfing.  Tons of fun changing locations it is better then temple run or any running game. Bounce surf fly collect gold bang into trains light posts road guards collect flamingos Eiffel towers it is fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved Season 3! Can't wait to see future episodes. My son laughs at some of the &#34;english&#34; words that have now slipped into my vocabulary. lol
125000098X|2.0|I was looking forward to this next installment of the series having loved the first two books. I got half way into the story and just lost interest. It may have picked up toward the end but I don't believe in continuing a story I lose interest. It won't stop me from reading other books by Archer. I guess I prefer stand alone books over trilogies.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It's the best show I've ever seen in my entire life!<br />It has been a while since I first started to watch it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but fun game. Rooms are not too difficult but make you think. Cant wait for more levels to play!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|what can i say about a mouse who is a chef? really awsome i rented this movie and i wanted to own it very funny
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|What a crappy vacation!  A dream vacation tuned into absolute horror.  While watching, you will think - could I possible survive this?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive and hard to put down. I got my husband and daughter hooked on it. Was only disappointed when I reached the end. Can't wait to see more rooms!
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Nowhere near as good as the first Sherlock Holmes but it is watchable. Won't order the third one if they make it.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|bought the movie when it first came out but lost it over the hears,  Enjoy being able to purchase it online and see it right away.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish minecraft would update more often or just add everything off the full version<br />Please notch and more herobrine notch you are awesome please do this for me
B0070YDOT8|2.0|I have this app on my iPhone and Kindle Fire.<br />I prefer playing on the phone because it is faster and doesn't freeze. I even have my own wi-fi band still runs terrible on the Kindle Fire.<br />Other than it not running up to Apple on The Kindle, this is a very fun and addicting app.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|I have been curious about this movie ever since I read somewhere that Channing married the costar in his first movie, Jennie Dewan, and he'd first met her while filming this movie. So when I saw it at the store I decided to watch it. I enjoyed the movie. It had a positive theme to it and wasn't over-the-top when it came to violence or crudeness, though I had the sense that something bad would happen at some point. In the end the main characters from the poor neighborhood decided to do something better with their lives. I love movies containing themes where young people want to improve their situation rather than letting their poverty destroy their future.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|No eye-popping revelations in this calculator, but it provides all I wanted it for on my Kindle.<br />Have used it frequently.
B003ITIQ88|4.0|Whenever you watch a movie about a dog you realize what remarkable animals they are and how they really deserve the title mans best friend.  This movie is based on a true story that took place in 1920's Japan. This movie modernizes and Americanize the story, but I believe that it catches the essence of the story. Hachi's story is similar to other dogs loyality like fido in Italy and Shep in the U.S, which is a story of loyality and honour that comes from a dog that owner bonds with.
B00B2QA646|2.0|Anna is a 'fixer' for her brother's marriage - torn by his infidelity to wife Dolly. Meanwhile, Dolly's sister is pursued by two suitors, one being a landowner and the other a dashing military man; she goes for the latter, but he then falls for Anna and eventually marries her. Dolly ends up with her previous #2 pursuer. And on and on and on it goes - a bit confusing at first, but that problem is quickly overcome by boredom.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|I chose this movie for the action. this movie is true story in some countries (underdeveloped countries) like Africa and others.
0439023513|5.0|I purchased this item as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. the item shipped and arrived as promissed, and in perfect condition.<br />thank you.
B000WEMH3C|5.0|This cover works great for the price you cant beat it will last for a few years the only thing you may want to do get some small diameter rope to rape around do to wind likes to lift it off
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Great  book! She  makes a  lot  of  great  observations  and  awakened  in  me  opinions  I  was  not  fully  conscious  of.  I  especially  like  her  statement  about  news  coverage  on natural  disasters  and  the  distraught  homeowners but  if  it  we're  her  she would  be  unaffected  because  she  has  digital  copies  of  pictures  and  little  to  no  possessions...  and  many  other  great aha  moments  for  me.
B001NAT05W|2.0|This was not a good movie. It doesn't do justice to the original character. If you want to see excellent versions of Catwoman, watch \\"Batman Returns (1992)\\", \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\\" or play \\"Batman: Arkham City.\\" DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE...even if it's free on amazon-prime. IT'S THAT BAD.<br />  Catwoman is not some ridiculous super-powered vigilante who looks better out of costume than in it and is followed around by DJ scratches and hip-hop soundtracks like in this movie. It's not even Halle's fault the movie is unpleasant; she's actually the best thing about it. But if you want to watch a Halle Berry movie, skip this. Go watch X-Men or something.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|One of he finest films made. The cast the story everything worked. Reminiscent of movies past where there is a beginning and middle and and end. They dont make movies like this anymore.
0449011917|5.0|This book on CD was the best thing to bring on our trip to the coast.  We never even noticed the 14 hours go by as we drove.<br />The naarator is truly talented and has a huge repertoire of voices.  Very entertaining and a wonderful story!!
B000SW2F8K|4.0|This is a fun and perfectly acceptable chick flick for when you are feeling in a light mood. I especially liked the mythology incorporated into the movie. It gave it a unique twist.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great graphics. Smooth game play. If you love the card game. You will love this. If you want to learn how to play the card game this will teach you how.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love love love love love this show .... And being able to find the episode that I missed on amazon was awesome ... Thanks for a great experience
1400052181|5.0|had fast service, great condition.. would order thru them again... book is one Im excited to read.  its an interesting topic
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Love the game I just wish that the game file was smaller. They game is over user friendly. The best magic game I have played yet.
0425263924|5.0|The third book was every thing I wanted and more. I am glad we are not done yet with Eva and Gideon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game. Love trying to figure things out!! Could be a little less complicated though...the numbers,colors,and shapes are hard to remember
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I loved this book. Brought back a lot of memories and made me think deep about a lot of things.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a really fun game to play and it is challenging but still really fun fore those who like stuff that`s hard
0345803507|4.0|Well, I'm a bit conservative, so I hit a glitch when it came to the &#34;Red Room&#34;.  However, I continued reading and am happy that I did.  This book was a gift to me and arrived in a very timely manner, and well packaged.
B00746O3X8|5.0|IT IS EVERYTHING THAT I ASK FOR . PRICE, COMFORT, USEABILITY ALL IS WHAT I HAVE TO HAVE TO DO MY JOB. MY NECK DOESN'T HURT ANYMORE, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DROPPING MY CAMERAS DUE TO THE SAFETY STRAP THAT HOOKS TO BOTH CAMERAS. I CARRY 2 CAMERAS AND THE USEABILITY OF THIS HARNESS IS GREAT AND EASY TO USE..  AT THE END OF THE NIGHT AT THE RACE TRACK I AM NOT TIRED FROM USING PRODUCT.  I RIDE A SCOOTER AT THE TRACK WHERE I WORK AND WEARING THIS HARNESS I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY CAMERAS GETTING DAMAGED.  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use my 7 year old can even play this. I like how one tap card go in place.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun fun fun! Feels more like 3D challenge!  People get a kick out of me \\"moving\\" with the game! Perfect game for waiting rooms!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|One could tell by the gore that this is a Quentin Tarantino film, but he seems to have toned it down a bit compared to his previous films, so overall it was a pretty good movie.  Its 2:45 running time and I never felt like it was dragging.
B0036G1T78|5.0|This is a classic one of Redford's best. Although dated it is scary to think how certain Govt Agencies could and so work. Faye Dunaway is beautiful AA always but shines in her performance. Nice to have access with Amazon instant movies

0062255657|5.0|I wish everyone could read this book. Essentially, it is about the things you know and notice and cherish and fear as a child. And the disappointment when you realize the world is not the safe, idyllic place you wanted it to be. How that realization feels as though your heart had been ripped out. But if you let it, a new heart will grow. And if you sit for a while, on a bench by a pond (or in a hammock in the backyard or on a stoop above the city) ... and just let the thoughts and memories float around, some of those things may come back to you. And you will find joy in the little things that delighted you as a child. The things which are so much more important than the stuff adults think about. Because really, you are still a child. No one is ever grown up on the inside.<br /><br />Gaiman talks to us about all of these things in the form of a delightful, and slightly frightening story with the most real protagonist I've met in a long time.  Along with the narrator, you will feel confused, curious, happy, frightened, despairing and ultimately, healed and whole again.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|After the, in my opinion, ackward first single 'My God is the sun' I had a bad feeling about this album because that song sounds like it's copy-pasted together with way to many breaks. I feared the whole album would be over produced and needlessly difficult but that is not the case. It is slower and rocks less than other QOTSA albums but it's still very good. The second single 'I sat by the ocean' is the best song on the album. Not the best QOTSA album but definitely worth buying.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has helped me stay in the Word! I used their Bible reading plans and did the Bible in 90 days... That one was a bit intense so going to try one of the year plans this time, but I do love it!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Concept for the movie is interesting but the movie doesn't live up to expectations.  Wish it had been a little better.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I grew up on Die Hard. I remember watching the first one when I was a kid. Yes I saw it when I was a kid and no I never went on a shooting spree or committed any other acts of violence, but that's a different discussion. I loved the first one. Still do. In fact I have enjoyed every Die Hard, parts two and four a little less but still found entertainment from them. This one however left me wanting. Sure John McClane has become something of a super hero and is no longer the &#34;regular cop&#34; in the &#34;wrong place at the wrong time&#34;. This began in Live Free or Die Hard. However I still enjoyed that one a lot more then this. The &#34;main&#34; villain was forgettable. The action scenes are way too CGI'd. And the &#34;jokes&#34; just aren't funny. The story seems to be more about McClane's relationship with his son then about the villains and the danger they pose to the city/world. That's fine except this is a Die Hard movie. Well it was supposed to be anyway. I give it 2.5 stars because there were some good ideas in the film, they just never capitalized on them.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Wonderful animated video...a true classic. Loved showing it to my wonderful niece who laughed all the way through. Tinkerbell steals the show!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I'm not going to explain the show or specific episodes. If you are looking at this there is a great chance you already know what to expect. What I'm going to talk about is the remastering they have done. It is AMAZING! I have the other seasons on Bluray and this is not any different. The picture looks as if it was filmed yesterday. You can see details you never knew were there! That's not always a good thing, on some episodes, like in the first season, you can clearly see the stunt doubles. You can also see the makeup lines on some of the aliens. This in no way makes the show any less enjoyable. One thing I was very impressed with was the remastered special effects. They &#34;blend in&#34; great with the show. I was worried that it would be painfully obvious that the special effects were done this year yet the show was filmed in the late 1980's-early 1990's. That was not the case. It is almost seamless! If you love HD and ST:TNG get this ASAP!
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Richard Donner's Superman resonates with me like no other superhero film.  I was 10 years old when I first saw Superman: the movie. It's a FUN movie, filled with instantly accessible and likeable characters.  Clark Kent is the product of his powerful and wise Krypton heritage, and his innocent, character-filled Midwestern adoptive parents.  He has god-like powers, but has a humility that grounds him in the most admirable of ways.  His Kryptonian father has sent him to Earth with presumably all the knowledge and wisdom of the Kryptonian civilization encoded in crystals.  All of this power and knowledge Clark uses to protect and inspire the people of his new home on Earth.  Of all Superman's powers the thing that resonated most with me was a statement he made in a conversation with Lois Lane.  He said he stood for truth, justice and the American way.  Lois, then joked that he would be fighting every politician in Washington, but then comes the kicker, Clark responds, 'Lois,  I never lie.'  That's something I can do!!  I thought.  I can be like Superman by always telling the truth!  This is something that has never left me after all these years.  What a beautiful thing for a film to affirm and inspire virtue in children and adults alike.  Of course there is the perfectly diabolical and yet hillarious portrayal of Lex Luthor by the incomparable Gene Hackman, along with his henchmen, Otis, and Miss Tessmacher.  Everyone in the film, right down to the extras was wonderful.  The effects, well, I still love to watch the opening credits, and there are moments where the flying really seems to work, and there are others where it doesn't.  The set design borders on spectacular at times.  Effects in a film are important for bringing the audience into the story, while lapses can cause us to momentarily disengage, but great effects never of themselves make a film memorable.  There is so much to love about this film that it's easy for me to lovingly overlook any technological shortcomings.  Perhaps someday it will be possible to improve those sequences where the effects kill the illusion.  Some moments in the visuals aside, Superman in a nearly perfect movie, that I highly recommend to anyone.comings.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this down!  The plot has so many turns you can't figure it out and is a surprise past the end!
B0065CCM76|5.0|I have listened to this SO many times since purchasing that I am afraid my devices are going to overheat!! LOL
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 7yo autistic son LOVES this game. Encourages thought and hand/eye coordination with good graphics and sound effects. A spin-off of the &#34;Wheres my water&#34; game (Which he loves also) he has mastered the basic game to the point where I have spent real money for the expanded edition. Keeps him involved without knowing that he is learning good skills while having fun!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very easy to see, use, and play. I am a self-proclaimed Mahjong addict. I try all of them. This edition is great.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Good concept for the people with a mean streak. Kill the world with a plague. Once you have the details down, an easy game to play: if indeed it IS a game. More like a terrorist training tool.  Gets boring after the second go-round, very limited graphics although the random &#34;Headlines&#34; from the world news service are funny. Like alot of other games, you can spend real money to unlock special traits speeding the plague along. Not recommended unless you are tired of the &#34;Smurf's&#34; game!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Ok, I'm going to give some readers TMI here.....but I have chronic insomnia and other medical conditions that make sleep impossible. When I finally get to sleep, if I do, I have trouble getting up. I have to set....yes, really, 9 alarms. Well, now 4 of them are through this app. LOVE it. Just LOVE it. Love being able to put different music with each alarm. The musical alarms cut through the others.....Thanks!!!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game sounds so cool I'm getting it ! Like right now it's downloading ! Can't believe I've never heard of it till now ! Well it's done downloading so yay !!! Gonna go kill me some zombies with my canine friend ! :)
B009VSW15Y|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD (with built in cam) did not come with a camera app installed so, had to find one. Love this.
B008I43DYU|5.0|It helps when I'm shopping for groceries or helping my granddaughter with her math problems.  I like the easy to read numbers on the screen.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I actually learned some things (if this movie is factual) about Hitchcock and Psycho. This is a good weekend movie.
B007N85POS|5.0|It helps stimulate my mind. I'm 70+ yrs old, and I need challenging things to do when I'm sitting around.  I hate knitting!
B007R14E70|5.0|Groundbreaking documentary that captures the true essence of Madonna at this point of her career. Enjoy it every time I watch it like it was the first time to see it.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This game is ok for passing the time.  I prefer the Majung Delux HD because it's more of a challenge.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Minnie has so many secrets in her past, and Robert is a charming duke with a hidden agenda. Goats, workers' rights, Darwinism, an alphabet primer and amazing attraction... what a story!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its fun to play but it's takes a lot of game money to do anything.  I wish the cost was at lest a little lower.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It looks time effectively. Really all I wanted it for. I'm not much of a game person, I rarely play games but so far I'm amused
B00C061I3K|5.0|Very differ from their other albums. Tunes are a mixed of old and new rhythms. There is a track that has a story that mixes this all very well. Can't go wrong with Daft Punk!
0345529057|5.0|Love. love, love these books.  Normally, I would resell books, but I am going to keep this set.  I can see myself rereading these several times.
B000SC245E|4.0|It was simple to install. Item works great. However the printer needs the belt record/status to be reset before the printer will stop prompting that the item needs to be replaced
B0096HFOZO|5.0|This is a really good book. My favorite part is when the twits get the shrinks. I'd definetley refer this book to a kindergarden class or a 5th grade class. Hey, it's for all ages!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very addicting game. When i first got it, i was up from dusk to dawn playing sub surf.
B00594XOZU|5.0|My friends all have cell phones but I don't :'( I have  a kindle fire and my parents like that it's free.  :D so I can text my friends. Yay it's just an amazing app overall LOVE IT
B00CJCHJ3S|5.0|It's been over a decade since the bands last great album, popped it on once it came in the mail.<br />Let me say I've listened to all of the bands albums and I have to say this is probably second only to alive or just breathing and the vocals and overall sound were superb.<br /><br />However I am skeptical if this was recorded digitally and then just pressed for vinyl, believe me there is a lot of vinyl out there that was recorded digitally...  But my setup is not complete yet as I'm using a temp turntable (as I need a preamp and a amp(will be using Pioneer's SC-79 and a tube amp for the front speakers)) I have the debut carbon which is great but the platter mat that it comes with is... crap as it collects far to much dust..<br /><br />Anyways this album is awesome, listened to it twice since I got it on Friday.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|When I read &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; I stayed up all night to get to finish it.  This book certainly has a more diverse set of characters, as it weaves together several overlapping stories.  However, many of the themes are the same.  Love and loss, the power of family to nurture or to hurt, the impact of war, and so on.  While there were a very disconnects along the way, this book is filled with memorable characters, most of whom exhibit very human flaws.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love that this App tells me how long I have to play games, music, text, play movies! Great App upgraded from the free battery HD.
B001N9BGGY|4.0|I love all of (3) of these films by Julie Deply!  Highly recommend watching them in order, and within a short time period.  The first film, Before Sunrise is how they meet, this film takes place 9 years after they meet, and the 3rd film Before Midnight, is in theatre's now.  Even my husband liked them....so they are not just chick flicks.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I almost like this app better than being on the computer for Facebook. Great App still use it every day.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Her voice is magical. The album is very moving; it makes me sad her life was cut short. Makes the album more special.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I was particularly interested in Damian Stevenson's take on Ian Fleming as I have been researching his role in 1940 myself for a sub plot in my third novel. I'm amazed by the amount of secret material still buried in the government archives about operations mounted during the second world war and have always suspected that Ian Fleming's role was far greater than previously explained. Mr Stevenson  has demonstrated through his own diligent research that this is indeed the case and, from my own more limited enquiries, I know that there is far, far more yet to be revealed.<br />Cleverly, the author has laid down a marker for a whole series which could end up as a new James Bond type film franchise with the real inspiration for the role as the central character. There is no doubt that Operation Armada reads like a film script and, though I have no specific knowledge of the author's intentions, I suspect that is the real thrust of this novel.<br />Certainly, the period detail is sumptuous and Fleming's character, habits and personal preferences are very well laid out. The writing is stylish and very much in the mode of a young Fleming who, as I'm sure we will discover over this series, was responsible for some of the most imaginative operations during this war.<br />James Bond fans will already know how fantastical some of his exploits seem even in an age where we take new technology for granted. In Operation Armada, the author reveals that this technological war was already well established by equipping Fleming with advanced weapons which some historians might believe were only on the drawing board at the time. However, all weapons have to be tested and, in the atmosphere of intense secrecy surrounding new developments, experimental prototypes needed someone to take those risks.<br />On a rare sunny day in the UK, I finished reading this by the side of my pool, vodka martini sans olive close to hand though, with health and safety in mind, it was in a plastic glass. HowFleming would have laughed at my cowardice. I don't suppose he would have been too impressed by wind turbines either!<br />Keep this up Mr Stevenson. We need to be reminded of a time when real men weren't afraid to be heroes and, through Ian Fleming, you have the perfect vehicle to stiffen our spines.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I just love the lyrics of all the songs. I bought 2 copies. One for car. One for home. Yeah I know ... don't have a disc burner! But the album is just so powerful for me.  It's been playing in my car for months! I love Katharine McPhee's voice. It just seems like so many of the songs are directed at me.  I bought both Seasons 1 and 2.  So I have the whole story which really ended beautifully.  Very happy purchase for me
B00CWY76CC|1.0|In all of the games I have reviewed this by far the worst  it wouldn't let me do anything sorry to the the people that made it but it is a peace junk ):  on my kindle Fire
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I did not find this series until the end of season 3 and so scrambled to get them all....I love it and look forward to it coming back to PBS soon.  The price was good - better than what I paid for Season 3 at Walmart......
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It was recently acquired. It has not been used much. It operates as a basic 4. Function calculator is expected to operate.
B007SGM084|2.0|I normally read murder mysteries, but was persuaded by a couple of friends to try this trilogy.  These 3 books could have been condensed into one - there is a lot of filler.  The sex scenes were very hot, but aside from that, it dragged.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its kind of hard to figure out . but once u get it its pretty fun. the directions are aa little vague. u have to click on every thing. once u find an object it helps opening other objects
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|Absolutely love this mivey. RDJ does not disappoint. <3 very nice movie to watch with the girls while having a glass of wine
B006AN78XS|5.0|As many have stated, this film is Woody Allen's love letter to Paris.  If you love the city, you will love this film.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I blew through this book in no time because I couldn't put it down. I read it at every possible opportunity.<br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it sort of petered out at the end.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|I purchased this book last night, stayed up later than I should reading \\"just one more part\\", picked it up again over breakfast, read it on my breaks at work, and finished it a few minutes ago. It captured me from the first page and held me 'til the last. I would highly recommend this book as a good read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very entertaining, great workout for your mind. I would highly recommend this game for all ages. Give it a try!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This movie was a very pleasant watch. I enjoyed the fact the profanity was kept to a minimum. Chris Hemsworth was extremely good in his portrayal of Thor. The vast majority of the acting was strong and played with passion. Special effects simply enhanced what was a thoroughly entertaining movie. A great watch for the entire family.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel. The action started out quickly and didn't stop until the end. I thought it was going to be the same formula as the first book, but it wasn't. It was exciting and kept my interest throughout.
0060794410|4.0|I ordered this for the staff that reports to me. The performance of the group has been good for the past few year since I have taken over but we need to take it it to the next step/stage. Good is ok but great is better.
B00821OX98|5.0|I enjoy this sci-fi program but way too busy to see it normally.  As a prime number, I relish the opportunity to see the show when I have free time ~ fire-up the 'ol Kindle Fire HD, setback, relax, enjoy.  The plot is rather predictable & I've seen better action sequences but for some reason, this program drags me into it. I find characters compelling in their determination against impossible odds.  Also, the series brings some realism since it takes place in greater Boston Metro area. I live it, hopefully you will too.
B00AEBB8XS|4.0|I have not seen this movie in years, I enjoyed back when it came out and couldn't pass it up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can not stop playing it<br />It's amazing<br />U SHOULD GET IT<br />AWSOME<br />I HAVE NOT READ A BOOK  THE WHOLE SUMMER BECAUSE I AM PLAYING MINECRAFT!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|We bought this for our 2 yr old and he is obsessed with this movie.  Which is fine by me because I really enjoy watching it with him there are tons of cameos from all of the video games I used to play as a kid.  I have watched it at least 30 times and still catch subtle things that I missed the previous 29 times.  If you grew up playing video games and going to the arcade then you will not be disappointed with this movie.  Also the bonus features are pretty neat.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I like knowing that if I do something on the computer (win 7 os) I can still send it to my tablet (android jellybean os) with no problems.  It is like the perfect bridge between devices!
B00457WZEI|4.0|Read the book while on a cruise. It was an intriguing story, and I understand the popularity. The book was clearly written for a younger audience, so it was a quick read. It was a breath of freesh air to read a story that was clearly focused, and did not resort to a lot of &#34;filler&#34;. Enjoyable for all ages.
B000000XB9|5.0|These tunes remind me of growin up in the 70's. Pops would play CCR, Janis, Doobies,Clapton and so on...thanx pops!
B009GX6600|1.0|Very well written series. Characters work together very well. Hope they never change the team. Wouldn't miss an episode. Gibbs holds it together.
B000000XBC|5.0|Still one of my all time faves...my son likes them too! ( 13yrs old) reminds me of me and my pops...thanx dad!
B000O77SRC|5.0|I figured that since I needed the whole series and my Die Hard was getting old and looked it from playing it so much, that I might as well get a new Die Hard, too.  The price and shipping were very good.  Thank you.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|I think we can safely classify this as a dark comedy. A friend of mine made me watch this movie after it came and I'll admit that I didn't have the highest expectations because I didn't know much about it. Once I saw that it starred Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer my expectations rose a little. But after watching this movie I absolutely love it. This movie is so clever and witty and the story is fantastic. Each actor plays their part very well and some of the scenes between Downey and Kilmer are hilarious. Just that fact that Val Kilmer's character is a private investigator called Gay Perry (for obvious reasons) helps make this movie funny. One thing that I liked about this movie is the way that it sort of makes fun of itself and movies like it. If you haven't seen this movie you should buy it now. Especially at a price this low for a blu-ray, how can you not buy it?
B000O78KW4|5.0|One more excellent Bruce Willis' Die Hard Series, and I love this one, too.  There is something about Bruce Willis that makes him a great actor.  The price and the shipping were just right.  Thank you.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|This was a movie that we decided to watch cause we were in the mood for a bad movie. Something that is so bad that it's funny. We were surprised when it turned out to be a great movie. Jason Statham does a great job in this movie as he does in all his films (even the ones that are just okay). The entire cast performs quite well. The story is even pretty good. It's a limited concept so there's only so much story that can take place but I think the did a great job with it. It was never going to win any Oscars or anything but if you're in the mood for a good action movie this is a movie that you should see.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book seemed so much longer than the others. Seems to have created more stories rather than closing the loop on several others. With no word in the release of the next book, this should have answered more questions. It's almost as if he were forcing new story lines because the editors said so because they were not ready for the story to end.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I had heard a lot about this series but was avoiding it for some reason. Then I got Prime and decided it was time. And boy am I happy. This is a really good series about alien invasion. It would have been nice to have a little bit more about the before and during portions but it still works for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is one of the best game I have ever played but it takes a really long. time to load
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the fact that you have to figure what it all is for!  Very stimulating for the mind just want more levels!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I can't stop playing, I want to meet the owner of the manor, keeps you entertained  I wish it had more objects to to find
B00514HDNW|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much, I actually thought it was very fun and easy to read. Powerful and provocative, but mostly at the end! Slow to start, but revealed information as needed and with only enough to keep you coming back for more.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love the charging battery meter. Let's me know how long it will take and how much time I have left.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The movie is good. The plays (local and Broadway) are excellent but it is all due to this indispensable classic! Read the ebook on the commute and enjoyed this classic and timeless treasure all over again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully written and photographed, you'll love these upper-crust British families and the people that serve them.<br />But, the writers don't always know when to cut back on the drama.  Sad and beautiful.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great find and I want to tell you not what I expected at all. When reading you will feel a wide range of emotions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Basically, you go around the room looking for hidden items that open or give clue to how to unlock other items around room. Every item found is used for something within the room, which leads to the discovery of another item, with the ultimate goal of retrieving the key to escape the room. There's only 10 levels. Pretty good game. Insufficient in instructions though.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you like the Twilight Series and the Hunger Games Series you will love these books. They are exciting and action packed with complex characters and a great story line. You will not be disappointed. HBO has done a great job adapting the books but it is not the same as reading the real thing. If you have watched the show and you are caught up through season three, I recommend starting at chapter 25 of book three. The Red wedding is nothing compared to the rest of book three! After you are finished go back and re read the first books. You pick up a lot of story detail that you missed in the tv series. Enjoy! Great read!
1781162646|4.0|I really enjoyed Joyland. The setting and the characters conjured up many fond memories. It was part ghost story, part crime story and part love story in under 300 pages.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|If you like the stories written by Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb, J.V. Jones, Patrick Rothfuss, Jim Butcher (Codex Alera), and even George R. R. Martin, then you will like this novel -- a lot. If you prefer D&D, assassins and mage type stories with lots of action, then this story is not for you. Not that Way of Kings doesn't provide lots of action, it does, but much of the tension is driven by the questions rather than the brains being splattered on the walls.<br /><br />This world is rich and complex with an ancient history that is not explained with huge info-dumps. Instead, the world is revealed as the characters experience things and the reader must try to piece things together. Everything is there, you just have to work at it a bit. It's not like Steven Erickson's Malazan series where he just throws things at you and expects you to keep up, but there are certainly a lot of strange things and unexplained situations that you have to figure out. That's good. It keeps the reader actively involved in the characters and the story. It's a very alien world and that might be off-puting for some people. But those that stick with it are richly rewarded.<br /><br />The characters are rich and deep. There are quite a number of important characters, but not so many where it is difficult to keep the names straight.<br /><br />There are very few negative reviews for this novel, but mostly what I see is that it seemed like the book is \\"padded\\", or that the author spends too much time bouncing around in a character's head rather than doing things. I can see how some readers would think this way. However, I've read the book three times now and have no such issues with it. No, we don't have imminent death every single scene, and most of the chapters do not end in a cliff-hanger, so those people who crave that kind of stimulus will think this novel is too slow. I felt the pacing is good. There is always something important happening that keeps you interested.<br /><br />Overall, I expect this series to entertain me as much as The Wheel of Time entertained me. I am eagerly awaiting the next book in this Stormlight series.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|WARNING: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR APPROPRIATE READERS BY THE ARAA (Amazon Review Association of America) BUT DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.<br />Let me just say, I was really excited about this movie. I'd known about the movie for a while and was looking forward to it as the next great super hero movie. I was sadly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I liked it! It was a fun movie. As a thrill ride, I'd give it a 4.8. Sadly movies aren't and shouldn't be rated or made to be fun. Filming is an art, the purpose being to create a well crafted story and a new world for the audience to escape to. It should be fun, but it shouldn't be about fun. Anyway, before I go to far into films, back to Man of Steel. There were a few main things that bothered me about the film.<br />  Firstly was the insistent action! Oh my gosh! I have never seen so much destruction in a movie. MOS blew every other action movie before it out of the water, even Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I don't mind action, in fact I love it. What bothers me is when it won't let up and I walk out of the theater wondering if I watched an action flick or video game brawler. The over the top action was pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie accept to get our testosterone running. It took away from the story because I was consistently thinking, \\"How are they going to pay for that?\\" The finale battle decimate almost all of Metropolis, the terra forming laser beam striking pretty near to the Daily Planet, yet in the final scene, we see the city all back to normal within, I'm assuming as they never give you the time lapse, a month or so. How on earth could a city recover from that much damage and that much death that quickly? It doesn't make sense.<br />  The acting wasn't bad. It wasn't the great either, but it wasn't bad. The two actors who stood out were Henry Cavill as Superman and Michael Shannon as Zod, mostly the later. They both embodied their characters perfectly. Amy Adams, Lawerece Fishburn, Kevin Costner and Russel Crow all disappointed me with their lack of emotion. The leads me to another problem: there was no emotional appeal in the movie! I expected that with Christopher Nolan being on board there would be some pretty sad scenes in the movie. When Superman's parents have to send him to earth I expected to have tears in my eyes. Instead the actors were so emotionless that I felt disconnected from them. If your audience isn't feeling and emotional connection, then there's something wrong with the film. An I'm sorry but Johnathan Kent being killed in a tornado trying to rescue a dog? Lame!<br />  The finale problem, and this is the biggest one, was that I think they missed the whole point of superman. In the trailer and the movie we keep hearing Jor-el saying the Superman would be an ideal for the people of earth to strive for. The comics and original movie showed Superman just like that. He was marvelous and majestic! He was the epitome of perfection something we could become if we tried hard enough. They alluded to that, but missed it completely. If I were any of the people in the movie I'd be afraid of Superman seeing the death toll he caused by throwing the enemies threw buildings, causing enormous explosions and copious amounts of destruction. Beside that, Spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />SUPERMAN KILLS!!!!!!!!!!!! He kills the bad guy in the end! What's up with that? That was one of the things that made superman so great was that he would not kill. Yet here he is killing the bad guy! You may say, what was he supposed to do? Maybe knock him unconscious and get him into the phantom zone... Perhaps the screenwriters didn't even need to end it that way! He also steals some clothes and stealing is never, ever, ever justified.<br />  When I saw the trailers for MOS I thought \\"Hey, this isn't going to be a movie chalked full of action! It's going to be a movie full of heart, story, and the majesty of Superman.\\" My siblings have pointed out to me that I never complained about the action in Transformers and they've pointed to the fact that I can't wait to see Pacific Rim. My response? Superman isn't supposed to be like that. You don't walk into Transformers with a criterion more than, \\"I want to see some action!\\" You expect that from those kind of movies. You don't expect that from Superman, especially with Christopher Nolan writing the story. Overall, it is undeniably enjoyable. However, it was also very disappointing.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Became a hero with my grandson after giving him this set!  Great for the money.  All the disks were fine and he loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great horse app to play for fun. It is very simple to play too. Kids can even learn about how to take care of a pet.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Fascinating account of training and battle action of a sniper. Chris was shot to death while helping a fellow GI, so book was also a tribute to his life.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is very entertaining and I love the many options it has. The salon part is interesting and a surprisingly long process! I highly recommend this wonderful app!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a very handy tool to have.  We use it to view items from computer to our big screen.  Thanks
B002WJI66C|5.0|this is really good plush, not too big not too small. i highly recommend this item, and its really funny
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show ever....cant wait for season 4! I was shocked by Season 3s ending.  Please dont let it be true!! This series is addictive.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I like this movie very funny in parts.  Not a movie classic by any means hence the 4 stars but still enjoyable.  Look for the cameo by Ron White.  Watch the blooper reel at the end you don't want to miss it
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I got to create my own music for people to listen to! Amazing app!! Recommend to all those dj people out there!!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Excellent, complex plot, descriptions generally and particularly of Oslo are interesting. Nesbo's talent is extraordinary.  I look forward to his next effort.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I love this game.  Great graphics, intuitive controls, great game.  I like the strategy portion of it where you have to decide what to buy at each stop to maximize your return.  The racing itself is a blast.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great application for solitaire great for those long commute.easy to setup and play.nice graphics and response time while in play.
0875428940|5.0|Love the beautiful colors and pictures, though I wish the would have stayed with the original designs a little more. I would buy again.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Huge ERB fan and read the series many years ago. As a rule, I don't hold movies to the same standards I do the books. The film should stand on it's own and deliver the plot in its own unique visual way. So while Burroughs is my favorite author I went into the theater with cautious optimism and walked out very happy and extremely entertained! It has actually caused me to search for my old paperbacks in storage so I can enjoy  the original printed story one more time.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Movie is a good easy watch. Do not expect brilliant acting and very deep plot. This is a leisurely Friday evening movie with your kids.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|The movie was great. Action, romance, heads getting bitten off, who wouldn't love that?!! I would recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Martin's song of ice & fire has everything thing from magic, fantasy to adventure. Too excited for the next instalment, you just get sucked into the story.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|I thought I would like this but its too busy with trying to shoot and double tapping the red missiles and dodging enemies all at the same time. There really isnt a way to make it to the next level. too much going on at the same time. deleted it after 5 mins.
B003VANOFY|5.0|After seeing some of my friends satisfied with this headset i decided to give it a try.<br />Very comfortable and very good audio quality, some people have reportes problems with the mute or charging of the headset (the charging connector is a bit hard to snap on, but otherwise hasnt presented problems to me)<br /><br />It's feels like very good value for it's cost.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|If you are not into pop music, then you wont even get past the first screen. you get just enough coins to eliminate the first couple of letters and to get one letter placed in the puzzle. The moment to go back to the main menu, you lose what letters were given to u to solve the puzzle and u have to start from scratch, but with out the coins returned to your account. This meaning you would have to spend real money to get coins. All the while you ask urself, when does the fun begin?
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Put this with your copy of Sandlot and The Princess Bride.  Besides, everyone should know what the &#34;Truffle Shuffle&#34; is.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Interesting characters. Kept me guessing until the end! Would recommend for anyone who likes to read. This book is a perfect quick summer read!
B003E6LC6I|5.0|It was as good as the first season. I love the mystery to each one!<br />Will keep watching to the very end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cant wait for more levels! Challenging but not over the top impossible like similar games Ive played. Could not stop playing until I completed it!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Beautifully written book. I was immediately immersed and could not put it down.  Riveting story set in North Korea.  Highly recommend
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun game to play with little ones or let older kids play by themselves. There's a lot of reading, but my 4 year old enjoys it.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|hard not to laugh at the dupes giving 5 stars to this thoroughly debunked fraud. more and more of their bubbles are bursting at least.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book practically ruined my vacation. I just couldn't stop reading it. Great to finally find another author that can do that to me....it's been a long,long time.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This was a beautiful and sweet story that everyone should read. It's about love, loss, heartbreak and the glory of 80s rock.
B0031R5K68|3.0|The Lost Symbol is an okay page turner - but at times the puzzle solving and the amount of lecturing happening by various characters becomes tiring. Not a book that I would give a second glance. Not at all as good as Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code.
1439102813|4.0|Wonderful book but, heartbreaking.  The reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is because it deals with such a devastating disease and I've experienced it personally.  It's just sad..........
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This was a truly amazing piece of music. It is powerful and really makes you feel the mood. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />Edited: The soundtrack really makes the movie and adds to the overall feeling of the movie.  The songs are powerful and commanding with tones that are similar yet different from his other work.  I bought this after seeing the movie and feeling moved by the scenes and the story with the music.  I love writing while I listen to soundtracks and this is in my top five of soundtracks that I listen to while I write.  I find it calming and helps me focus and with the style of writing that I like to this soundtrack helps.  If you like soundtracks I honestly do believe that you will like this piece of art.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|Like his Shadows of the Wind, immensely enjoyable. It's a special treat those who know Barcelona, with Montjuic and the streets of the old part of the city providing the setting. Again, it has books within the book. Beautifully written.
B001EBV0OY|2.0|Revenge is a dish best not served - and Shawshank wants to use it as a &#34;redemption.&#34;  For Tim Robbins' character's suffering, he receives quite a worldly reward, and no spiritual redemption at all.  Disappointing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A lovely time of which you see no example around today, except for movies and television. Class is more hidden today.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Intriguing.  Interesting.  Some of the language a bit difficult to understand.  Worth the cost and time.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best puzzle game I have ever encountered!  A lot of fun and challenging but not frustrating.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves a good intriguing puzzle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was the best season so far, however all seasons have been great!  I never thought this would be the type of show that I would love to watch, but there's just something about the simple family life and family values that sometimes get missed in today's fast-paced age.  It's a calming show to watch.
630575067X|4.0|need i say more? i don't think i need to say anything else. but i need 7 more words awesome!!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|excellent movie. Spielberg movies are always the best! Superb direction and Daniel Day Lewis gives one of his best preformances
B0097HSS4M|4.0|working on trying to use this one but I'm smart I can do it.  Nice for us Sr. citizens thanks
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app I recomended For every body, it is real y helpfull echen You triángulo to Getafe some ideas to find something
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Great gameplay and comedy. Not overly serious yet very deep and detailed interface. Very.much like a FF game with music, gags and grit. Very comparable to chrono trigger, dragon quest and FF series. Never takes itself too serious yet still keeps things interesting as the story unfolds. Huge map, towns and villages galore. At this price its a steal. With tons of pop references this is a game where you cant wait to see what happens next. A+
B0062QRTKA|3.0|Swipe finger across the water to part the waters, move layers back and forth to let the staggered people make it through without drowning while trying to drown the bad things trying to get you- all in the timing. Not really any bugs that I could see, but FAOTD is all I would pay for this. It just got way too hard past level 1, when they started adding enemies and layers of weapons. Not for cell phone screen like Samsung Galaxy SII Epic Touch (which is actually pretty big for a phone).
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Recommend this book to anyone, especially those that have had the good life in a FREE Country, like the USA.
0062014102|5.0|William james write about the variety of religious experience possible within a person's life... Unlimited and possibly based on the nature of mind.<br />This book expands the nature of mind and consciousness, into a theory of everything, including tying it into a theory of the physical nature of the universe. It is slightly obscure but explores what tenured scientists would only speculate into but never dare to publish. Hard to test are these hypothesis. Thus, this book appeals to open minded people. it is a great step towards explanation of miracles, and consciousness's true nature in the universe.
B001DF68MA|5.0|When I opened the box, the seat looked very small for my daughter. Was a little concerned that it won't fit. Installed the seat anyway. When I finally tried my daughter on the seat, it actually fit perfectly. Btw, my daughter is 3 and she weighs about 14kg. The seat did not obstruct my paddling motion which is great and I could cycle comfortably. I think a lot of thoughts have been put into the design of the seat. Very pleased with the product and would recommend to anyone looking for a front bicycle child seat.
B005RUUUAI|2.0|I was disappointed in night time shooting of so many episodes in season two.. it was very hard to see any thing during these episodes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game some levels are easy and there are others that you really have to think. I love to play games that help me to think more.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was not a book I couldn't put down but was like an old robe when I would restart days later- comfortable and not willing to rush out of it. Enjoyable read.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|\\"You don't understand. There was something in the woods and I think it's in here with us now.\\" Looking to finally get their friend Mia (Levy) off of drugs for good a group of friends head out to a remote cabin in the woods for the weekend. A gross smell leads them to a room full of dead animals and a strange book. While investigating the book one of the friends unknowingly unleashes an unspeakable horror on all of them. It has been a long time (around 15 years) since I have seen the original trilogy. From what I remember the first two were OK but the third one, Army Of Darkness, is one of the funniest movies ever. There were a few call back scenes to the original in this and from what I remember this is a little better, but still really nothing but gore and blood. There is a few scary parts in this, but with all the gore and blood it distracts from the overall horror aspect I was going for. To me when you just slice up people that is not horror. Other then that though I do have to say that this is a rare remake that is just about as good as the original. Overall, horror fans will love this, I thought it was just too much gore for it to really be scary. I give it a B-.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|It is very good movie. The acting is very good from all the stars, Particularly james Stewart, cary Grant and katherine Hepburn. The movie is witty and very funny.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|I bought this book because it is required reading for my 16 year old granddaughter this summer.  I have read it before but reread it again.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Having seen Yossi and Jagger, I was really eager to see the sequel, Yossi.  Eytan Fox is one of the most brilliant directors on the planet.  The stories he creates with minimal budgets are so true-to-life ... so honest, that they are universal.  No matter what country, what language, what sexual orientation, his stories have impact.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller again plays Yossi, ten years after Jagger died in the earlier movie.  He has sublimated his feelings into a medical career.  While successful in his career, his life is wasted.  The first half of the movie shows us a static and unhappy life, but Knoller's skill as an actor keeps us engaged.  A chance encounter with Jagger's mother (who doesn't recognize him) seems to reawaken him.<br /><br />The scene where Yossi tells Jagger's parents about his shared love with their son was heartbreaking.  Yossi's bottled-up emotions come to the fore and Jagger's mother's curt response to his confession reminds us that a son's gay love isn't always welcome.<br /><br />En route to Sinai, Yossi picks up four soldiers heading to Eilat.  Yossi decides to stay in Eilat (reminding us of a promise he made to Jagger as he lay dying), and in the succeeding days is seduced by a gorgeous young soldier played by Oz Zehavi.  The second half of the movie has a lightness and sweetness that is so appealing.  Zehavi is as charming as he is beautiful.  It takes all of both to melt Yossi, but he eventually succeeds.<br /><br />I read in an interview that Fox intended the ending as a gift to Yossi.  It's a gift to him, certainly, but to all of us as well.  Redemption from grief is possible and a new day and new love can be found.
B0094GAVMS|5.0|Easy to read, interesting and highly educational. Great acquisition for someone doing comparative research on trust law. Kindle version is perfect for easy content access.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show. I was surprised. Tried it because I was bored and I couldn't stop watching it. I wish I wouldn't have been behind the times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's awesome when you want to mess around with someone's horse and you have a horse called beauty and you can feed your horse carrots
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm such a fan of this series! I was really disappointed in how the 3rd book ended - however, a lot can be said for the element of surprise :)  I am excited for what is next for Eva and Gideon! Ms. Day does a fantastic job of creating and writing this series. I'm a fan for sure.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is great, from the graphics to the enemies to the towers. Ironhide has outdone itself in making great td games.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|This album is very accessible because the music and the singing is more in familiar territory. Candice has evolved into a very talented singer and Ritchie has thrown in his fair share of lead work that we so look forward to. Troika is a gem and the Temple of the King is a bonus. Love Carry on… Jon, the best lead work to date. Never a dull moment....
B007ZD17XO|2.0|This game continually freezes up at higher levels and then asks if u w as my to change back to casual mode instead of expert since u can't get enough points.  Can't get points when your one minute timing and frozen for half of it!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I hated the ending!!! It was totally disappointing to lose Matthew. Another death after birth was &#34;over kill.&#34; Overall, an awesome series! I look forward to more.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This is like the only zombie game that I like and it used to only be on the Apple app store but it's finally on the Amazon App store thank you
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|I read this book in a vacation, when I wanted a page turner to read. I enjoyed it but to be honest, I expected more. The book is a page turner till half of it. The plot is interesting, the caracthers are misterious and interesting enough to keep me reading non stop. However, after half of it, it kind of loses that something that makes a book a page turner. Part of it was because the introduction of some unprobable caracthers, the sentimentality, which was totally out of place, in my opinion, and the silly romance. Besides, the end left too many unanswered questions. Maybe that was the author's goal, not to answer questions on the book and I was just frustrated.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It's terrific to have it on my little tablet. I do wish I could control the brightness and tone of the screen a little better, but other than that I love it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Been a big fan of the game for years, and I'm glad it came out on the kindle so that I can play it when ever I want.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|this file program for my kindle fire works fine. i have no complaints and this program is easy to manage.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Amazing read!!! Couldn't put the book down!! Full of love and hope and new beginnings!<br /><br />This book is a must read!
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|i guess i was hoping for a little bit more with this app, even though this version is &#34;free&#34; i would like to have seen a bit more from it. had that been the case it might have enticed me to want to purchase the Full Version. but it IS a good start.
B001EC0OMM|1.0|The movie was very good.  However, the streaming of the movie stopped half way through.  I had to wait and start the movie later the next day. This was my first experience with renting a movie through.  Needless to say I was very disappointed with the service.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Liked it but not a  as much as the previous 2.  Was expecting more from the characters.  Ending left me flat and not anticipating a Book 4.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I usually play adventure games but it's the puzzles that I really like - so Quell keeps my interest. Over 50?  Exercise your mind a bit it helps!!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|How do I remove this game from my Kindle? I don't like this and want to remove it from my Kindle permanently.
B009X2CUYA|3.0|I like Kate Morton, and this book kept me entertained. The plot was interesting and the characters well written and had depth.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This was a pretty good movie.  Actually more entertaining than I expected.  Can't wait to see the new one coming out soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it.. the movie didn't do it justice.  So glad I read it...I had to keep reading the series.  Finished it in a few days. .. easy read.  :-D
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I am seventeen and my self image is horrible. I feel like everyone stares at me for that. I get told I am super pretty and I have never accepted the compliments. I finished this book a few days ago and started doing what you did after you got with Ellen: letting yourself know that you can eat whatever you want and knowing that you can have some tomorrow so there's no need to scarf it down. Thank you for doing this, allowing all of us into your life. Your book also helped because I am trying to come out to my family, problem is, they're all super Catholic. But again, thank you.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Good movie if you just want something romantic and cute and a bit predictable. It's pretty similar to the book I think.
0345529057|4.0|I am a really big fan of the Game of Thrones series and I've watched all the episodes that have come out so far.  The bad thing is that I watched the show first and now that I'm reading the books I already know the important parts and most of the little parts are boring to know in the books.  The author gives you a lot of small minor facts and details that you wouldn't care to know like the color of Sansa's shoes or that Jon felt cold in the north without fire... kind of common sense.  The book is a good little read too at 900 pages and fine print.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I love this movie, very entertaining. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are fantastic. I, even, have MIB 2 and 3. I enjoy scifi.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun to play. I can play for hours. The only issue I have is if your game gets deleted off the kindle you lose everything you have earned except your high score so just name sure you don't delete it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It is okay if you like puzzles, bored and want something to do while passing time. However, the puzzles are so easy you can complete them all in a flash.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great read!  I don't read as much as I used to since I usually fall asleep but this book kept my awake and interested.  I had a very long wait at the airport and this book helped the time go fast.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|After seeing the movie I always wanted to read the book. It has a fairy tale quality but it doesn't read like it's for kids or anything, it's a pleasing and surprising read, even if you're familiar with the story.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of the best books on Lincoln and the Civil war.  It gave me a much deeper appreciation of Lincoln and the men around him.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I had a friend that read this in middle school and the title just stuck in my head, years later I read it and I'm intrigued, I can't wait to read the second book, or for the next 5 to come out. Definitely recommend, this is the start of a great series.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|I did not have these CDs, just vinyl.  Great music, from a great band!  Highly recommend!  Buy this now, if you can!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun. Enjoy your time with this creative defences game. It makes you want to kill zombies all the time. Go forth my samuri friends.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is the best game of all time i am on the tiger shark<br />It is the cool game ever
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics, very enjoyable. Hard to believe it is a free app! I give it five and a half stars!!!!!
B003XX2PCW|4.0|I wasn't familiar with this band at all when I bought the album. I liked the sound of the samples and frankly, the cover and title intrigued me. I'm glad I went with my instinct because I can't stop listening to this record. It's beautiful and strange. The music has this timeless feel to it while still feeling very exciting and new. The singers voice is just incredibly interesting and a mix between forlorn and reflective. At times, there's a playful quality in his voice that hinges on romantic. The themes of the album seem to be about getting older and how to connect with friends and loved ones. My favorite songs are \\"Memory Boy\\", \\"He Would Have Laughed\\", \\"Basement Scene\\" and \\"Helicopter\\". It's not like anything I've heard despite hearing some influences (mostly, early 60's pop radio kind of dreamy stuff) and anytime I put the vinyl on, I always want to stop what I'm doing and listen to it. I've listened to the album from front to back about four times already.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game!! So much fun to play and I am having a load of fun playing it! Never thought it was going to be this much fun
B00BRR66SA|2.0|Some of the songs are decent but overall I've not enjoyed listening to the album. The songs go on forever and divide themselves into aimless sort of jams that do not seem to stop. I also thought Timberlake's voice (the Prince-like highness) grew tiresome after awhile. I tried to play it several times and just couldn't ever get into it. Not for me!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These are are pretty fun. Definitely helps to pass the time. Pretty entertaining. Easy enough for anyone even kids to play.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app. was very helpful during the fourth of July storms. I am in the panhandle of Florida and it allowed me to keep up with the storms progresses.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great great awesome the best strategy game on kindle bar none absolutely a blast to play hours of fun for everyone
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really love this game. It's very fun and there is always something to do, not too much waiting around like other similar games. It's definitely worth giving a try and it's free too
B0089XH38M|2.0|There may be some problem going on with this. I downloaded it twice. The first time it never showed up on the device or in the Cloud, though I synced several times, rebooted, and reset. My account said I had it, but neither Cloud nor the kindle showed it. I deleted it and tried again...same story. Haven't heard back from Amazon about it, but it's the weekend, so I don't expect immediate response to my email. I downloaded something else a few minutes later, which came down fine, and I have plenty of memory left (22+ G) so I don't think it's a problem with my kindle itself.<br />  Anyhow, it was a free download, so there's nothing lost. I just thought I'd alert folks who might try to download it this weekend.<br />  Then again, maybe there's something I'm doing wrong. Any suggestions?<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon got back to me. Turns out the product isn't available for the Fire HD yet, though it showed compatibility on the actual order page. Question answered.
B00005NRN9|5.0|My wife loves cirque du soleil, this is her favorite so far. While the videos are good, you have to see them in real life. It's awesome. While I'm not a girly man, I love a live performance.
1451695195|4.0|Very interesting! Some of the medical jargon was over my head, but that's OK.  Of course, there are questions that can't be answered until I get there.
B0036SUQWA|5.0|Great acting and crazy story. I also recommend the book Psychopath Test that is written by the same author of the book this movie was based on.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Loved the five book set because of the richly developed characters.  Very disappointed in the ending.  It appears the author is only setting up for another book.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|One of the best Disney animated movies ever.  It has comedy but also a message that most of us have to grow up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the graphics for this app.  they are really detailed.  this app is also fun and easy to use.
B0061QD88S|5.0|I love this movie.  Every child should see it to understand that even animals have feelings.  The adventure is fun too!
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|For all the puzzle-lovers out there, this is a great app to have. My son will play on this one for an hour at a time if we let him. Lots of different styles of puzzles and sounds for reinforcement.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It was a fast read but the story is powerful!  Reading the events from a personal perspective brought home to me - a Navy wife - how much we owe these soldiers.  I highly recommend it to all!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I feel sad having finished this book. The characters and storyline leave me yearning for more. I feel as thought have lost a dear friend having finished this remarkable book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good time filler, it's fun and I really like it! It's like taking care of your own horses! For all ages!  If you download this add daisylucylove as a friend!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter really love's the game. Great game to teach responsibilities. Also about reaching goals. Smooth game play as well
B009A882D0|2.0|Unfortunately, there were too many songs here I had never heard.  I should remember that sometimes nostalgia overcomes reality.  I had to have my daughter put my favorites on my mp3 player, since it didn't seem to be formatted for that media.  I wish there was something that would tell you that the cd was not mp3 compatible before you bought it.  This is not the first cd that I had to have help to transfer.  Not being very computer-savvy myself makes it difficult for me to choose and use music cds.
B00AG297GK|1.0|It's tragic that movies like these are even financed and approved for public consumption. I guess it's billed as a comedy but it may have elicited a yawning ha-ha moment throughout the 18 minutes I was engaged in attempting to view the movie. Don't bother to waste 2 hrs of your life in this garbage of a flop film.
1451626088|5.0|Once again, Phillipa Gregory has made history fascinating.  I especially like the fact that I can trust the facts in her books, since she is a reputable historian in her own right.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game certainly challenges your brain on a constant workout of your mind. You must be patient a good problem solver to move to each level. I cannot wait for more tasks to do and opening more doors.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is cool! it a real mind stimulator lol. kinda nice to get a game where you dont run around killing and stuff.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entire series is incredible cant wait for the next book.  Sylvia Day is a great author who keeps her readers turning pages.
B00005JM1F|5.0|My husbands looked in a the stores around Houston and nothing so I find it on here for fathers day and he was super excited and watches it all the time.  great fast shipping thank you
1616550414|5.0|Really an increadible book, full of Zelda info and nuggets.  Fun as a collectable and/or just for a very interesting look at the series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Only hope I don't have to wait another year for the next episode.  Are there really 2 more books?  YES!!!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I didn't expect much from this movie but had to watch it since the sequel was coming out. I was pretty shocked by hoe good it actually was... The voices were not very recognizable as the people cast as them, which was pretty awesome because it didn't let the (voice) actors' identities get in the way of the story. I wouldn't say everyone needs to see this by any means, but I would recommend it if someone asked. The story was pretty good, as far as cartoon movies go, and it was enjoyable enough.
1781162646|5.0|Once again Stephen King does not disappoint.  He's truly the master of the macabre.  Joyland is a joy to read.....scary, mysterious, and suspenseful.  Everything I've come to expect from Mr. King.
B007X4N0DU|4.0|I'm suprised that this is actually good. Their past few efforts have been weak. This band is a religous band. I'm not saying theres anything wrong with this, but it's not for me. However, this album from start to finish is actually really good. That being said their hey day was a couple of years ago.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great - just a few runs through the ceramic slot keeps a sharp edge on the knife.  I will order more as gifts.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Last album was better, but still really good. After reading about how and why they reunited I have more respect for this band. I did give in and I purchased this album too. It's very heavy and less pop oriented then the last album. Over all though its really good. Still miss Laynes vocals as he is irreplacable. This album along with the other album still feel like Jerry Cantrell solo records to me. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as I own his solo records as well.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I play this frequently, but the ads are very annoying. Some of them you cannot skip and have to return to the home page and re-enter the app before you can play. Even so, I still enjoy playing the game.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I am so thrilled that I have two beautiful albums of this precious artist. Saw the film and raced to order this album. Am not disappointed. Mellow and enchanting.<br />Just a pleasure to listen to.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|seems to work well and has no problems as of yet and have used it mostly on my Xoom. I plan to use it in the future
B005S9EJ46|5.0|when this movie first came out the hype was really quite extensive  and this made me leery because the more a movie is hyped  usually the crappier it is.  Thus it was ages before I actually saw it  in fact it was on a cruise  and I was pleasantly surprised.  Then a few months later I was visiting a friend who had it  and so I watched it for a second time  and this time it was GREAT.  Finally I watched again the other day and it was FABULOUS.  The cast is stunning  and for once  the GREAT cast makes a GREAT movie.  So often  the huger the cast the worse the movie  but in this case the CAST are ALL superb  acting is sensational  expect tears ...there will be some....no sex no violence no car chases  just a wonderful WONDERFUL story.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun game, but needs more levels. No technical problems. I will change my review from three stars to higher when they add more 'rooms'.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I've purchased, used, and reviewed many iPhone 5 cases. I fell in love with Spigen screen shield products first and thought I would give their cases a try - I was not disappointed!
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles in this game are great and challenging! I like the rotating option. The only thing that needs work, is if my tablet gets turned, the add turns too and never turns back. So it covers up a portion of the puzzle and the pieces. I have to completely exit to fix it.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Heinlenesque....beautifully written, an ageless story almost biblical n it's morality. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and so will you! I wish he had written more Tuf tales....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really worth the read, it'll make you laugh while you're crying -- welcome to Green's world! Quite the eye-opener, it's quite heartbreaking, but ut would kill me to know you haven't read this beauty. I suggest buying four copies and bringing them everywhere!
B004LROMWU|5.0|Its an interesting series, i've watched most of the season plus whats on tv and will order the whole series to keep to watch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You may need to take brakes from reading this in order to stay sane, as it really toys with your emotions and makes you question a lot of things about yourself. I love it and suggest it to a more mature audience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The era was what I liked.  The clothes they wore blew me away.  The castle was beyond words.  For a mature audience.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The second installment of The Selection really kept me pulling my hair and biting my nails! A few tears will be shed in the reading of this book ;)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun free demo game. Somewhat challenging. Overall a good game to pass time by during a bathroom or commercial break.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son bought this app for his kindle fire. He enjoys playing it and making the different cars to drive.
0060873175|3.0|The first few chapters were compelling, and then something happened. It fell off the suspension of disbelief shelf onto the caricature of a what this could have been had Crichton survived to complete it. Sadly the book falls into the realm of silliness with cookie cutter characters who'll play off each other in efforts to detail the scientific marvels they're tangled up in. As a science fiction spoof this could have worked, but it takes itself too seriously, and falls flat. Michael Crichton was an extraordinary talent, and the publisher's efforts to squeeze the whatever crumbs they could to make a buck is pathetic.
B000OJFV3S|5.0|This wonderful production highlights the monster that Henry VIII was and the role of all parties from the gentry to the church in their respective grabs for power. This is a very entertaining show to watch and adds a dramatized human element to the horrible man, Henry VIII.
1451695195|1.0|I just finished reading Esquire's August issue detailing the back story of this book. Not only was this neurosurgeon plagued with professional issues, he was reported to have been up to some unwholesomeness that would get most docs--I am an MD--in some deep water. His selective recollections highlight inconsistencies in his personal, and professional career and his account of his trip to heaven. Something about fussing with records, operating on the wrong vertebrae, and maybe a half dozen lawsuits in under a decade suggest this scientist engage the science of finding anew career. Why not take a stab at the bestseller list? Sure enough, there are a lot of true believers who buy into the notion that: \\"My gosh, a neurosurgeon must have some privileged knowledge,\\" right? Yeah, that and a hefty back log of issues to deal with, a few connections, and a wife with an MFA in writing. He had to split Boston and hasn't seen the innards of an OR in years--but the guy got his book out there, and a stint on Oz, Oprah helped--probably more connections than a shady Iranian nuke plant--will get you a book deal that's a sure winner. Next, the movie--On Wings of Suckers. This is exploitation of a rotten kind, and gives neurosurgery a bad rap. Bad juju.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Perfect! It met all my expectations as far as quality and quantity. It was as good as on the big screen.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This movie is a very good adaptation for a fractured fairy tale.  I loved the spookiness of it plus the humor that happens from time to time.  Edward is adorable.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Learned a lot and enjoyed it but feel like I need to read it a second time. He jumps around a lot and it is often difficult to figure out
B0027ZGPDC|5.0|We had seen this one before but it was nice to be able to watch it again.  We love this one,
B004GJXQ20|4.0|This book was good to read and very interesting.<br /><br />There were some rare times where I got slightly bored and had to push myself to keep reading and the there were many times where I could not put the book down!<br /><br />Can't wait to get reading the next book :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Great way to work your brain.  I like all the puzzles. Can't wait for more levels to become available.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great for women who are pregnant<br />Hannah loves to play with minecraft and I'm very happy because Hannah loves to play on her kindle even when I tell her to stop playing with her kindle . She loves to play with Annie. Annie is Hannah's bff
B00CRW2066|1.0|I may as well have bought this from evil iTunes, because Amazon wouldn't actually let me download my music without installing their proprietary music player on my computer.  The album is really good though.  I've only had a chance to listen to it once, from my phone, because I have to install this ridiculous program though instead of just having my mp3s for use on the player of my choice.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I don't know of any other software item that does what this does. Used a version of this when I used the palm pilot years ago.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love nice non stress games. This one is awesome, really love it. The pictures are beautiful and the music is very relaxing.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Its the best and i tell all my friend to download it because even if you dont have a phone you can tex.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the scenery and the details for the period! It has me hooked on finding more programs with this quality of stories with depth and not just the on special effects. Thank you
B008602KQI|5.0|After hearing many comments, finally gave in and watched, and thoroughly enjoyed.  Jennifer Lawrence is a sweetheart.  Hope to see more of her.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|...  Seriously! I stayed up late for this one.  What a story, and what characters - not just Allen, but all of his friends, too.  A fun fancy.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This book was very easy to read. I liked the story and felt that all the characters were described well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice easy game to relax with and you don't have to think very hard to play. Just started so I hope it gets a little harder.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I was looking for a calendar that I could install on my Kindle Fire for organization, and now I've found it. I had already noticed it on Google Play, but when I found out that Amazon had it available for Kindle I decided to give it a try. Jorte Calendar offers me the same opportunity to stay up to date with important dates and tasks on my Kindle as I do with my phone. I like being able to add events on my Kindle when my phone is out of reach. The big plus is that unlike Google Calendar on my smartphone, I can change the color and font on the calendar. The features are fun to play around with. All in all, if you're looking for a calendar for your Kindle Fire or any Android device, give Jorte Calendar a try.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|DVD is flawless.  The show is the best I've ever seen.  Cant wait for Season 4.  Will eventually want to own all seasons.
0062255657|5.0|Simply fantastic!  I am very new to the world of Neil Gaiman.  I have only read Anansi Boys, which I liked, so I wanted to give this one a try.  Gaiman grabs you right from the beginning and captures your attention.  Four chapters into the book I was forced to put it down for the evening and I found myself wondering what was about to happen.  The book is written as a recollection of a childhood event.  From the start of the story Gaiman takes his readers through a world of supernatural wonder.  Lettie Hempstock, the young girl who leads us through this supernatural world is a beautifully crafted character that is easy to fall in love with.  She lives with her mother, Ginnie Hempstock, and grandmother, Old Mrs. Hempstock.  When Lettie leads the boy into another world strange things begin to happen.  I don't like to reveal spoilers, so will not continue on the story line.  Having only read one other Gaiman book, I cannot compare this with his other works.  I can say that this book was well worth the short time it takes to read.  It comes it at only 181 pages and might even be considered a novelette.  There are some adult situations and some language, but there is no other reason to say this isn't suitable for young adults and older.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I wouldn't change a thing.  The writers, directors and producers know what they're doing.<br /><br />The DVD is perfect and I enjoy the extra features a lot.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Not full-length in what I have tried so far.  Will likely return the movie.  It is over-priced, in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and entertaining game that kept myself and 7/year old nephew occupied for the evening.  Hope there are more levels soon.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|quick shipping  a great old classic i know my grandkids will love it as much as i did  loved it on bluray
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has every  relaxing noise you could ever need!  I bought for an out if town trip and now use every night
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I so enjoyed the descriptions of Africa. The daily adventures were of great humor. What a nice change of pace for reading
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Really enjoyed this heartfelt story and search for the real Sugar Man. Love the South African scenes and the mystery surrounding this artist.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|At first I liked it then it would freeze up. Now when I get power-ups coins or keys it only gives half of them. If I win 2 it only gives 1. If I win 1 it doesn't give you any. What gives?
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Great SIM. Good graphics. Only problem, the same as F18, is that the flap lever is covered by a system icon on the Kindle Fire HD's screen and is inaccessible 99% of the time.
1781162646|3.0|I like Stephen King and most of his stories.  This one is a good paperback type story<br />that is easy to read...put down...and catch up later without forgetting the characters.<br />I've read ones that I liked less that this one, but it seems not up to Kings earlier books.
1610390938|4.0|This book convinced me of the usefulness of RCTs (randomised controlled trials) in economics. Banerjee and Duflo muster up empirical evidence to show that there are marginal dents we can make in poverty. They do not oversell their point - this is not a Sachs/Easterly/Collier polemic - and perhaps the title is misleading. There is nothing \\"radical\\" about the authors' proposals. Indeed, they caution that there is no easy fix to poverty.<br /><br />\\"Poor Economics\\" has received well-deserved accolades, and I have little to add in this regard. I therefore make critiques of their work along three lines. First, Banerjee and Duflo do not properly discuss RCTs' limitations. Second, there is a lot of unexplored territory that the authors do not suggest. Finally, the book underestimates the impact of politics.<br /><br />First, RCTs have important limitations, like their consideration of externalities. For example, a program that subsidises fertiliser in one village can harm farmers in another one that did not receive fertiliser. RCTs do not often measure the impact of externalities like this. This is a major limitation that the authors brush over.<br /><br />Second, there is a lot of unexplored territory. For instance, I am surprised that the authors do not suggest exploring financial cooperatives. The poor already have informal social networks to coordinate the use of funds - so why not formalise this through a cooperative? Financial cooperatives can become good complements to microfinance. This is just one of many unexplored areas.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Banerjee and Duflo gloss over politics' pivotal role. Although RCTs can make aid more effective, aid itself can never radically reduce poverty. Massive poverty reduction only occurs when people overthrow elites and start implementing democratic reforms. The authors retort that marginal gains can be made on the political front - this is disingenuous, since their 18-country dataset does not includetruly undemocratic regimes (like DRC and Afghanistan). Instead, their 18 countries are fledgling democracies, where marginal gains are possible because there is sufficient slack. There is a reason we cannot conduct politically-based RCTs in countries like Cuba. Ultimately, elite control of economic and political institutions engenders poverty.<br /><br />These criticisms are not meant to suggest that the book is mediocre - every economist and policymaker should read \\"Poor Economics,\\" and I highly recommend it to those interested in development. In fact, this should be development students' first port of call, and I will be using this book to teach students. Nonetheless, one should be aware of its limitations.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Honestly haven't used it yet, but with so many reviews entered why should you care? Make a note of that.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|Loved this movie so much I went to see it twice. I Normally don't go see movies that I already seen in theaters twice but this one I have, I'm thinking about seen it again for the third time before it leaves the theaters. Good action with a little humor in it. Jamie Foxx \\"Great\\" playing the president he crack me up especially wearing those Air Jordan Tennis Shoes. And Channing Tatum playing Capital policeman \\"love him with his fine sexy self\\" especially when he had his shirt taking off during halfway through the movie one thing I had too say is, he is HOT,HOT,HOT!!! And his daughter Emily played by Joey King, She Got Girl Power!!! stole the show. Overall good movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love how this game keeps me guessing. It definitely requires quite a bit of problem solving skills and some deducing
159463176X|5.0|Well written with that gut-tearing feel of truth.  All this author's books provide insight into the values and struggles of ordinary people.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I like the app on my kindle sort of. The main problem is that this is the third time I was nagged with a please rate this app pop up. So here it is 1 star. For a paid app that nags for a rating.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I must say, this is by far the best sophie kinsella book Ive read! Its such a fun read! I thought \\"can you keep a secret\\" was fun, but this one takes the cake. All the characters are well developed, the writing is on point also! Totallly loved it! Waiting for her nextn book :-)
B001NOQI3U|4.0|I had always wanted to see this and never had I was not disappointed. Very well written and very good acting.
B00BGPKCO2|1.0|The author tries to be original but succeeds only in being unrealistic. The he delivers a non-Hollywood ending that has him (no doubt)falling asleep proud of his departure from the norm.<br /><br />He (and a number of authors) must never fly more than one time zone because if you read what they write about 'jet-lag' you will believe that it is not that you must adjust to new dawn-dusk times, it is that just getting on a jet that causes fatigue.<br /><br />This writer, for example, has a character rubbing his eyes with the palms of his hands. Try it. It is impossible.<br /><br />His depiction of \\"bad managers\\" in work situations is totally unrealistic. I believe he does it to deliver another possibility of the villain in an attempt to stop the reader from figuring out who the real bad-ass is.<br /><br />The book is a bore.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Really liked that the transformers could change on the fly (while moving). I would say that this one is the best in the series so far.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Harvey is a hunk and everyone is smart...We love it all!  Interesting, intelligent and engaging.  A real &#34;look forward&#34; item!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, 2 of my favorite actors, join forces again on MIB 3.  The easy going nature of Will Smith/J versus the straight-laced approach of Tommy Lee Jones/K always makes for great comedy.  Josh Brolin makes a great addition as a younger K and his performance really dovetails into TLJ, which is crucial when playing the same character at a younger age.  The storyline is a good one and the writing, especially with J's personal twist at the end, is great.  Highly recommended.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|We got this game for our daughter's 6th birthday. It is a great game for families and super simple for kids to understand. It also helps kids build strategy and creativity skills!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Fantastic film telling the inside story of the hunt for Osama bin Laden.  I know the film generally is a moral tale about the horror of torture.  The CIA seemed to gain more overall through chess games (tricking detainees, threats of deportation to Israel, etc) than actual torture.  However, I think the story could have been more complete with a perspective on the fear impact of OBL on the nation, then the relief upon the announcement that he had been killed.  That said, it's a powerful movie with a powerful tale to tell.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|I love it! I love it! I love it! What more is there to say? Extremely good new music is rare, but this is some of it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|What can I say if you think you would like this show you will.  Acting writing set (best of all) or the costumes, spot on in every way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and challenging that I couldn't stop playing it I love it I just wish there were more levels so I can play them it's awesome you should get it
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was very pleased that this film was being made, but I was a little disappointed at its darkness and violence throughout.  These overburdened the hope, light, and humor expressed in Tolkien's book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the specific level 8 challenges makes you use Facebook. I don't use any Facebook things. Please change this challenge. I'm saving my money to get Brody. And Brody cost ALOT. 380000 coins, to be exact.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just got this game to kill a little time and I cant stop! The levels get more challenging every time. A real brain teaser :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It is a fun game. You get to choose what combination of cards you use, from different creatures with different abilities, enchantments for those creatures, and/or random spell cards. It's an all-around good game. It has good graphics, an interesting storyline, and cool gameplay. I like the randomness of the draw, it makes for interesting battles.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Arthur c clarke never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />Top of the line science fiction infinitely imaginative and ultimately depressing in my mind.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, fun, fun. An amazing game to play!  It keeps your attention to detail. You will spend hours trying to figure it out.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|As heroic as Lord of the Rings; far more subtle than Game of Thrones; welcome in its lack of judgement.  The third time you read all ten it will make even more sense.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book was confusing at the end...Did Bruno and Shmuel die? Did Bruno's Dad die?<br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Is there a sequel or series?
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love the series and I enjoy using amazon to watch episodes. It loads very quickly and with great quality.
B0086700CM|3.0|Until I arrived the age of fourteen years, I really enjoyed play games an all that stuff, after that I gave up on playing internet games, they have lost all the interest to me. That's precisely why I don't like this apps, it's not that I don't like it, it's just that it bores me to death.
B005721W9O|5.0|Galaxy Quest is a great movie!  It's really funny and it is a family friendly film with great actors.  Classic!!!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I must say that I had a lot of trouble to be able to download this apps, and I will tell you why, even before I let you know my point of view regarding the functionalities of this apps. I had lots of troubles trying to get this apps because Amazon didn't gave permission to get this apps through their due to my geographical area,so because I live in Portugal I can't get this apps through Amazon site, secondly because I had a hell of trouble trouble to be able to find a solution of getting this apps, and the solution that I found out, was to randomly download a variety of s***ty apps in order to get my hands on this apps, and when I finely was able to get my hands on it, I must say that the hard work compensated it, and mainly because it's very well organized browser, in searching options terms, but also because it comes allong with a variety of software that it is essential for the correct functioning of this apps, and that is precisely why I love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun, makes you think as well as having fun. Very creative, hope they make can you escape. 2 .
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|The mainly reason I am so disappointed with this apps it's mainly because I thought it was like surfing on Google chrome and it isn't,  besides the point that the it doesn't come with basic software programs already installed, like adobe flash player, or any adobe software, which makes it pretty poor in advanced navigation system. The advantage that is presented to us is multi apps that does possess, which makes it very independent from the need of of one's having the need of downloading specific apps access them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to read & just flick to turn pages. I don't have to squint to read it though the Android pages are considerably shorter than my kindle. Seamlessly stays synced to my kindle.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|When I first got my hands on this apps I was not sure if it was going to be another major disappointment or not not like some apps that despite their weren't not at all, but after I downloaded it, it had revolutionized the way I saw Facebook, and pretty much using, it's very simple,and has no difficulty on managing it, actually it's almost the same thing of how we use Facebook on the internet, and I like it very much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it!  makes you pay attention.  and think about what you are seeing.  only have done the first level, but know I will enjoy the rest!
B005COO1X6|2.0|BUT..... this book is soooo short it's more like a magazine story.  Way, way short but great story line. I will start looking for the number of pages before I buy again.
B0000266T2|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums ever of theirs. I would be hard-pressed to choose a favorite, but this one is great,
B00CWY76CC|3.0|So fun but once I got to level 7 I went crazy my parents even tried. Couldn't do any thing every level is so easy until level 7.unless u r smart don't get the game level 7 is so hard
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A most enjoyable read.  I am awed by the ending.  Hope he writes another.  Have read everything so far and have never been disappointed.
B000W9399S|5.0|Quick reading, great characters, and am ready to start diving into the rest of the series.  Fabulous find and highly recommend
0446547638|5.0|I call this a \\"can't put down\\" book.  it has romance, mystery, love and violence; all of these elements perfectly woven in this well written novel.  since it contains morality, i have recommended it to friends and family.<br />Jane gleason
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|Having been a James Bond fan since the inception of this series, starting with &#34;Dr. No&#34; in 1962, this is one of the best yet. Although Sean Connery has always been my favorite in the role, I equally love Daniel Craig.<br />Known for the opening gambits in these films, this is one of the most exciting yet. Zooming motorcycles across the rooftops of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul and turning into a train chase was thrilling to watch. The action is nonstop.<br />I watched it first on a plane ride to South Africa and promptly rented it on my return.<br />I simply had to purchase it for my 007 collection!<br />The Academy Award winning song &#34;Skyfall&#34; co-written and sung by Adele certainly adds to its spell.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Although I enjoyed it, it had language, gore and nudity. Witch's flying through barbed wire, a warning about diabetes, and a worm curse......classic!!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Watched movie with my 22 year old and 20 year old daughters.  We had the best time, and cant wait to see part 2 in theaters!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The sound level was off. The parts with conversation would be really quiet, so I increased the volume. But the explosions would require a lower volume. Very annoying. Overall, the movie itself didn't disappoint. Very enjoyable, definitely Disney made.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Wow, that's all I can say.  I love the story that peeled away like layers of an onion.  Gripping, real page-turner stuff with lots of twists, some you never saw coming.  But the ending?  Oh Ms Flynn what happened to the ending, there was no justice and it sort of fizzled out.  Very unsatisfactory ending, but super read all the same.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a really enjoyable game.  It was a bit short but I can't  reduce my rating because of it.  This is one of the most visually beautiful games I've ever seen.  I love puzzle boxes and this game makes me want to own that box!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game for young and old.  I got the game on kindle and then my nephew started playing it and got hooked.  Now he's got it on his cell phone.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I saw this on Top Free Games so I downloaded it. Finished the game in a half an hour! Great puzzle game and challenging enough that I completed what I'd set out to do: waste time. Contrary to other reviewers I feel it's very similar to 100 floors.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Director tried too hard to make the scenes look like historical portraits resulting in a dark movie. We found it annoying.<br />Dialogues are at times hard to follow because of mumbling from the actors. DD Lewis performance was good.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|...but unfortunately, certain aspects such as how long it takes to grow things, are more appropriate for a teen or adult. As you progress through the game, this is just another app that wants you to spend money in order to fully enjoy it's perks. It becomes impossible to complete goals without either buying &quot;pearls&quot; or dedicating a great amount of time to a GAME that ultimately leaves you empty handed. If you are trying to teach your children the merits of reaping what you sow, or that patience is a virtue, you're better off planting a garden with them. If you're looking for a game to keep children occupied, this isn't it and finally, if you're a teen or adult looking for mindless entertainment, this will indeed keep you entertained much like the Sims, or Farmville, etc.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This was such a good thriller.  From page one to the end.  Never knew which was this would turn, the anticipation to get to the end was killing me.  This should be a movie!  So much going on so many twists, couldn't put it down.
B004TI5N38|4.0|A very intriguing story about the ownership of our most desolate continent and  political ploys with Argentina and China.  You will be glad you read it.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|The world ignores the signs of global disaster and the next thing you know there is a world wide zombie (closer to rabies) pandemic. The incubation period is 12 seconds, yet somehow the infection was able to be transmitted by airplane to the entire world. I am still scratching my head on that one.<br /><br />Brad Pitt,who is now a family man, must save the world to save his family. There is some background noise that would indicate the zombie outbreak might be caused by how man destroys the environment and ignores the signs (global warming, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) The world is thrust into anarchy, while the military exists.<br /><br />Brad must look for the original virus somewhere in the world to find a cure. We discover N.Korea is unaffected because they pulled everyone's teeth. Israel is unaffected because they have a great wall around their country, but apparently cold isolated places like Greenland are infected. The only reason I point out these inconsistencies is because the film writers went to great length to make the film realistic. Oh yes, if you have a lot of people on a ship, they share beds and sleep in shifts.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film more as a pandemic film than a foot dragging, flesh eating, living dead, rotting zombie film, because that is what it was. I would say if you don't like Brad Pitt, don't see this film. There is very little screen time that doesn't show his face. Should make for a good video game and a decent sequel.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle game. It definitely is a time sucker. I loved it. I recommend this game for people looking for.a puzzle game.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Beautifully crafted suspense thriller. I've read all of Ken Follett's work and this is right up there in his top three.  Wonderfully layered characters, a creepy isolated island, a stranger during war-time.  It's got all the bells and whistles and will keep you flipping the pages into the wee hours of the morning.  One of my favorites.
0425263924|5.0|Review of the reviews and No spoilers review of the book.<br /><br />I have read many erotica novels from various authors, R.L. Mathewson, Ella Fox, Kristin Proby.... Even the terribly edited Fifty Shades series a well as many others. Although I enjoyed others very much, Sylvia is probably the one who entertains me most.<br /><br />When I read the other reviews before purchasing the book I was turned off. Essentially allowing the negative reviews to make me not want to read it nor the remainder of the series. I buckled and purchased it last week. I AM SO GLAD I DID.<br /><br />Some of the reviews tell of certain words being used to describe our sexual parts. Guess what? IT'S AN EROTIC/ROMANCE NOVEL. Sex and the romance are key here so it doesn't really matter that she used a certain word... What matters is how good it was delivered and polished off, pun intended. I also read a few reviews of people upset about the series being expanded......  So? That means more! That means more of Sylvia's great mind unraveling for the masses sending a sexual charge through the world of readers. The reviews that turned me off initially were the ones that said that it was terrible and nothing like the first two books and that our lovable Eva and Gideon had lost their way. I'm going to put myself out there and say these reviewers are out of their dang minds with nonsense.<br /><br />As far as the series goes, I certainly will read it no matter how far she takes it. I'm excited and can't wait to see what happens next. So, Sylvia, my dear... HURRY UP! I'm also waiting on your next chapter of the Renegade Angels series. Yummy. Make. It. Happen!<br /><br />Back on topic. The books is deep. Not just sexually but romantically and developmentally of the characters. We see many things change in their (all the characters) lives and see how they adjust and go about living their lives all while including steamy, delicious sex.<br /><br />Let me sum this up. This genre of books isn't for everyone because lots of people are prude and unable to open up and \\"let go\\" and just get into it. If you liked the first and/or second book you will like this one too. JUST READ IT, and review it yourself!
159463176X|5.0|This third novel by Hosseini surpasses A Thousand Splendid Suns.  It is beautifully crafted and touching throughout.  The complex interconnections of characters seems effortless and engrossing.  Hosseini's portrayal of the Afghan people makes their lives and struggles accessible and familiar.  A highly recommended read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very cool keep them coming<br />it has kept me searching for hours. i can not wait for the next level
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun. At first I thought it was going to be boring but now I am addicted.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Can't beat Stevie's N. style...unequivocally addictive, memorable...nostalgic...<br />(Would recommend to anyone who enjoys great sounding music...not sure?<br />&#34;Try it you might like it&#34;...?!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's really fun but it needs caves and to update more but I do like it  because it has everything it needs to make a good sandbox game
B000002LFZ|5.0|Can't beat Stevie's N. style...unequivocally addictive, memorable...nostalgic...<br />(Would recommend to anyone who enjoys great sounding music...not sure?<br />&#34;Try it you might like it&#34;...?!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The first book was great. But by the time I got to this one, I couldn't even finish it. WAY TOO boring.
B00BY8DFRW|4.0|This is Purple's most Purple album since Perfect Strangers! A must have for Purple fans and for those who are just casual fans too!
B000PHVZNE|5.0|Fast service and a great movie.  Tom Hanks was exceptional in the moive.  His emotions and his character held you every step of the way.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Sean Patrick's short book on Nikola Tesla is less of a biography than a treatise on what makes a true genius who has a lasting impact. It appears that Patrick intended it to be an introduction to his other books on the subject, to get you to buy them as well.<br /><br />The book begins, not as a biography as one might expect, but with a definition of \\"genius\\" and an analysis of the milieu that causes someone to make a significant impact in the world. After a full chapter, we are introduced to Tesla and his fascinating story. I found it most interesting and left me wanting more. I also found the connection and conflicts between Tesla and the likes of Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan to be very revealing of their personalities and weaknesses.<br /><br />We owe a great deal to Tesla for our modern technology. This is a story that needs to be heard and taught in our history and science classes. I just wish this book went further in detail on his life and his thought. But for a free book from the Kindle store, this is well done, well written, and worth reading.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Our entire family actually ENJOYED this movie.<br />Definitely better than the first Wimpy Kid movie.<br />Rented the movie from Amazon...and watched it 3x in 24 hrs!!!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I love a great thriller and this one was a pleasant surprise! I really like it when you're watching a movie & didn't see the twist coming! Kind of dragged in the beginning; thus the four stars. All of the characters played their parts well. You won't see the villain until later in the movie until things start to unravel. Better than I had expected it to be and well worth watching!
B00BHO70L0|5.0|I love Evangelion ever since I started watching it 15 years ago. Therefore I am very happy that Hideaki Anno decided to upgrade the<br />series with new graphic and scene along with new storyline. I recommend everyone to get it.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Worth owing the CD. This soundtrack has renewed my interest in music. Original and classic. I would purchase this again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just as intriguing as Season 1! Christmas finale is fab. Cant't wait to watch Season 3, just wish it was also free.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I think every one has family issues in our past we have to deal with that may not be pleasant. The story has change of character and a happy ending I loved it.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I adore Lady and the Tramp, and I just couldn't let it go back into the vault without purchasing it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Okay, I know this maybe hard to understand, but this book has brought me a long way and has taught me so much of how to be a good person. Just please note; this book is Not for young kids. What I mean is 4th grade and bellow shouldn't read this, because they would just make  fun of the amazing 5th grade boy, who has a cleft pallet. But if your  in  fourth grade and your ( no offence ) an awesome reader, READ THIS, LIKE A.S.A.P!!! I'm in 4th grade, and I read this. Just saying. I hope this helped!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Superb for the price! I only hope that Sony does not stop making these - just in case the pair I have breaks.<br />I also own MDR-V6 - the bass is somewhat more pronounced but the 7506's still offer more detail.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|After reading a bunch of bad reviews for this game I decided to check it out. An in game tutorial would have been nice, but it also didn't take me too long to figure it out on my own. Collect yellow, avoid red and just try and stay alive. The gravity part is what could have used the most explanation. Until if figured out that it is used to push the red away I died a lot more often. I figured out the best play style is to use &quot;two finger&quot; method so I could control my shop with one finger and tap the screen with another any time I was in trouble. Overall this is an enjoyable game, it's just nothing amazing that would get it the last star. Not bad for a faotd.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|No need to even give this a lengthy review, it's just hands down the best depiction of what it really takes to be the absolute best at what you do. This film showed the  strong and great bond between two friends that holds such high regards for each other. The undeniable respect and gratitude as well as the continuing shock and awe that each present always making them proud more and more of the other individual. I really think this was a film about how to build nurture and hold on to a relationship based on admiration, talent, and just real unconditional love.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great University humor and character development...love the quirky personalities of Sheldon and all. I enjoy the juxtaposition of physicist and video gamer, comic book collector; the scientist man and the playful boy. As I continue to watch I cannot decide who I like the most. Leonard is my original favorite, then I became attached to Sheldon, now Howard is being incorporated into that group. Penny, Raj and Berny are easy to love and that voice...you know...Howard's mom...what a kick. Love the show and appreciate the work involved in highly scientific lines...brilliant!!!
0143116371|5.0|The man, the man, the man, that's all i can say he is the one that does it all and captures it all in a way that presents beauty in all of its amazing forms while never leaving out the most important elements of his subjects. The use of the natural elements as well as  feeding off the subjects energy creates an undeniable correlation between fashion,art,style,and, the human connection. The simple truth is that we are  all more alike than different and seeing that in the most  beautifully curated and  wonderfully captured shots since Bill Cunningham and the Times Style section as well as his other publishing work with big name publications.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Just  downloaded and went to open and play....so excited. First thing it tells me off that the app requires an additional 98MB of space to work/play....say what?!?! For me, not impressed. Taking my 99 coin<br /> loss and deleting the app. VERY disappointed at the deception.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I really enjoyed this show and it is one of the few shows that is not available on Netflix what is on Amazon Prime
B000FCKC4C|4.0|So many jewels of inspiration scattered throughout this story for anyone seeking their own destiny.  Excellent storytelling and great read.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|the movie won the Oscar,not much you can said, sit a great movieand enjoy,excellent seller,very happy with this transaction, A++++
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is fantastic!  The story of a family and it's servents living in a house together.  It's set in the early 1900's.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Written for a young audience, I was a bit skeptical at this choice for my book club.  I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity of the characters and thoroughly enjoyed the irreverence with which the &#34;cancer Kids&#34; treated each other.  Dry humor and very engaging.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|This is an okay adaption of the comics staring Thor.  It was interesting how they had SHIELD show up in the movie.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I liked this game. Probably more then my three stars show but I just didn't think it was worth 4.99.  It wasn't that complex an  pretty easy.  The games were easy and the HO were easy.  I did like it but it cost away to much for what I got.
0316056898|5.0|I bought it in a bookstore after judging it by its cover. I's a glorious read. I didn't put it down for hours until I had finished it. Caused quite a stir with my roommates as I took up the whole couch and laughed myself silly. We need a million Tina Feys but I thank God that we have this one. Every woman needs to read this book. Yesterday.
0786275391|4.0|A lovely read, recommended by my beautiful French friend who read it when she was young. Will be good for my younger daughter too
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book kept me intrigued. Lots of suspense and unexpected events from one chapter to the next. No boring chapters in this book!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Solid 4.5 stars. Brilliantly told and this is a book I will recommend over and over. I hope this story is required reading for honours English students every where.
B00881VLCE|4.0|the play is easy on this app.  but I don't play it much.  More choices of pictures would help.  Kind of for children.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really enjoying reading this book. It was an interesting book with quite a bit of twists. It was a great read.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Kept wondering what others saw in the book that I was missing to put it on the best seller list for so long.  I'm going to reread the end since for some reason I can't remember how it ended.  I may also skim  through other parts of the book.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|pretty good game. few minor glitches but nothing really affecting gameplay. its a pain to get it to install on the first edition kindle fire. had to factory reset just to get it to download
B004HMQ7AE|5.0|This is the third time that we have watched this movie!  We loved the<br />interreaction between the characters and the entire story of Johnny<br />Cash acted out by Joaquin Phoenix.  He is an excellent actor and played<br />the part very well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game is a lot of fun and challenging.  takes some thought but not so much that you have to be a rocket scientist.  I just wish there were more levels.
B002XXPNXG|4.0|Clean wholesome movie and a pleasure to watch.  We would recommend it to anyone<br />interested in having a nice quiet evening at home watching a movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I absolutely love this show! From the first episode I've been hooked. Recommend to anyone looking for a brilliant series to get into
B001QJUX24|5.0|We love John Wayne and have seen all his movies except this one.  It is an<br />&#34;oldie&#34; that's for sure but we enjoyed every minute of it.<br />I
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Love this show so much! I only started watching recently and I am glad I went back and watched the first season. Definitely recommend!
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|I love this picture frame. It is a perfect gift. I know it will be displayed on the wall for all to see.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After watching season 2 I didn't think I could like this series anymore! I was dead wrong. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I will just say how much I loved this season. The only draw back was how slow the last few episodes were. I was a little disappointed how the season ended. I thought the season would end in a bag, but alas it did not. Definitely recommend to everyone!
B00094OBS4|1.0|PAL format requires a different DVD player.  This should have been in the description.  I cannot watch it.  Other movies note their region code.  PAL format should be too.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This series is very good! The characters are very well developed. I enjoy seeing how the times were back then and the advances that were taken to keep places up and running for the future.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Really enjoyed the third installment if Gideon and Ava. Had it preordered months in advance and it certainly didn't disappoint!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Have had this for movie for years. Decided to send a copy to my daughter for her birthday along with others.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so much fun to play wen you are bored, on a road trip, or just for fun! I would definitely recommend getting this game!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I think it is awesome because I like the part when you dress up and do the make up.I also like the part when you clean the pimples off the girl face I also like at the end when they show you're pursing and you get to take a picture of you're girl.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I deleted it the second I got installed it. The controls are off and  very much confusing to be at least. I would not recommend it at all!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'm a Rush fan going back to the 70's.  This CD reignited my passion for this band and I can't wait for the blu ray of the concert tour.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great But........After I Downloaded It To My Kindle I Got To Use The Facebook App So It Downloads Fine And Uses Fine. But then I got a different connection and it started acting slow
B008XKSW7M|1.0|It was a pretty stereotypical chick flick that had me reaching for my iPad within 20 minutes. My wife fell asleep.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it! Hope I do not have to wait as long for the next book as I did for this one. Fabulous job Sylvia, keep it coming as I love Eva & Gideon.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I like this season it was very entertaining and keep me in tune on the episode. I liked It very much.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|This is a free game.free games are cheap and unafishent but this game is so cool and so much fun I give a 5.5
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed every episode of each season.  I learned more about British aristocracy while watching these shows than I ever realized!
B0090RSYVG|5.0|It's hard to find things for Loki fans, and this was a perfect gift!  Whimsical and it won't fall apart.
B002O2THRO|4.0|Redford, Mia Farrow, Bruce Dern and a great back up cast make for a wonderful production.  I highly recommend it
1932735410|4.0|I studied Rita's book and the PMBOK for a few months and did the questions in this book a LOT.  It got me ready and I passed the PMP first try but I felt the questions in this book were written differently than the PMP exam's questions were written.  All in all, this book is great but I'd like to see the format of the questions change to be more like the style on the exam.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I bought this for my son's collection.  He has watched it over and over. So glad I could find it here.
1603580557|5.0|Doesn't matter what field, if you want to think &#34;bigger picture&#34;, then you need to start here. Meadows' primer on the subject--from parts to leverage points--will cast a whole new light on how you think things are interrelated.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I bought this for my son's collection.  He has watched it over and over. So glad I could find it here.
B005HED11Y|5.0|These remastered episodes look fantastic and are so much better looking than even the original broadcasts, which I watched as a kid. I will watch all of the episodes.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very cute! Fun and funny. Love the minions. The bad guy is my kind of bad guy. A real feel good movie.
1781162646|4.0|not the typical king story. still a good read. great characters that were intertwined beautifully. a not so scary story,
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|It had some good people in it and I'm always up for new takes on fairytales, but the writing was terrible! Some of the lines that I think were supposed to be intense or sexy or scary came off as funny. The whole thing was so cheesy and trying too hard to be like the Twilight movies (which are also cheesy but in an enjoyable way).
B008MVPHOS|5.0|This are great to wear working around the yard! They are very easy to clean. The mud come right off.<br />I love these things.
B003OUXECE|5.0|This book gives you an inside look at the workings of Rapture from both Bioshock and Bioshock 2.  You'll notice the echoes of the game all over this book and get a clearer understanding of why everything fell apart.
B00005RDSM|3.0|The DVD came nicely packaged and the disk looked like new. When I placed it I'm my laptop it wouldn't play,  but it did have a file containing it,  making me think that the person had coppied the movie, and violated the fbi copy rights warning on the dvd. I was able to play the dvd on a regular dvd player and the movie would always skip during one scene during the middle of the movie.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it.  When I get around to it, I'll definitely be getting season 2.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Never got it to work. Never got any other FB apps to work very well either. Better to just go to FB on the web, an app is unnecessary.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|It was really enjoyable from beginning to end. I love how it was told from the maid's point of view.
B001MTENOC|5.0|I found this book confirms what I had already learnt.  As this is a subject which I have always found interesting and already read many books on the same subject.  Most of my friends whi have read it share my opinion
B00D6M86RS|1.0|Purchased this app for my Kindle Fire, and it will not install. Contacted Amazon, followed their troubleshooting instructions to a &#34;T&#34; and it still will not install. Wasted 99 cents.
B004YF6MHW|1.0|It only takes pictures upside down! The video doesn't work also! I am furious! Way too much also! I got a free camera app to replace it and it works a lot better than this expensive poop
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This back pack is well made and can hold a lot of camera accessories. I have a Nikon D7000, 3 lenses, battery charger, battery grip, flash unit, 3 lens hoods, and camera manual in this back pack and there's still room for more items. IA can also attach my tripod to the outside of the back pack. The inside comparts are padded and very easily arranged to fit your accessories. I highly eccommend this product for anyone who wants a way to store and carry their camera and accessories in a compact case.
0307887960|5.0|This is the easiest diet I have ever been on.  I am very satisfied not constantly looking for something to eat!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! I didn't think it would be as fun as it was. Definitely looking for the full version......
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Waited for this game for ever got it when it came out for android and loved  it so no  i have it on the kindle.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The story was good. I sort of got tired of the way they tried to make this &#34;Oz&#34; different, yet the same as the one with Dorothy. However, I kept reminding myself that it was a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts.<br /><br />Nice visuals and special effects. The effects were spectacular. Loved the bright colors and fantastic imagery. At times it was overwhelming, but very beautiful. The little porcelain china doll was amazing.<br /><br />Kunis, and Franco, were both wrong for their parts. Kunis cannot play either &#34;nice and innocence&#34;, nor &#34;wicked and cruel&#34;. Her brown eyed, sultry beauty just can't do that roll. No matter how much witch's makeup they use. Franco's smart ass grin, and mannerisms just didn't seem right on a wizard, either. Michelle Williams, was an awesome, and beautiful Glinda, however.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for children. Adults will also enjoy it.
B009R659L8|3.0|Have read all Mary Higgins Clark's books as I actually met her about 35 or 40 years ago at a PTA meeting at our daughter's school in Northern New Jersey.  Have enjoyed them all, even if they kind of follow a formula.  Familiar with all her locales, and it is a really quick read.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a fun, challenging game of the old school arcade variety.  If you loved Space Invaders and Galaga, you'll love this game.
B000QE1U9K|4.0|It was a pretty good Alien movie. Sigourney Weaver is great in the 4 movies and she captivates the movies. Full of action and suspense.
B000HZGBLA|5.0|Angelina Jolie was good as Lara Croft. It is fun to watch her and not have to try to solve it myself!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I always enjoy Morton's books and look forward to the next one. I love the twists that she puts on each novel.
1572814349|5.0|I loved this tarot from the moment I first saw it. Excellent quality of the cards and comes with a very complete book. Lovely box too.
B005544TRQ|5.0|New and provacotive. Kept me wanting to watch episode after episode. Story lines are great, characters are all unique and human. Plus Meghan Markle is straight up beautiful. Can't go wrong.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was very well written.  The story had great twists and turns.  I found the end to be anticlimactic.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|There can be only one explanation for such a pitiful excuse of a movie. A rich and famous father trying to promote his kid's career.<br />A ship carrying an heroic general and his kind of wimpy kid crashes on a futuristic abandoned Earth. The kid must move his ass and recover a rescue beacon (which of course is the half of the ship that crashed far away..) and avoid being killed by an evil animal that tracks humans by their fear, and has been the most brilliant idea that some alien race of morons has been able to come up with to wage war to humans.. I wish there was more to say, but that' s pretty much it, and all done in the most cliche', wooden, boring acting possible... Ah , no, I forgot to mention that these futuristic, interstellar travelling humans, besides not being able to conduct their own ships also fight these \\"fear tracking beasts\\" with blades. Forget about firearms or maybe the classic lasers.. I guess that would be so unfair.. :)<br />Unfortunately, it's gonna take much more than a stupid, superficial, nonsensical and above all, mortally boring flick  like this one to get the general public accustomed to the idea that Jaden Smith is actually an interesting, proficient and charismatic actor..<br />But there' s still hope.<br />If it has been done for Will Smith, it can work for anyone.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Super cute movie, my 3.5 year old loved it and can't wait to see the second movie in theaters.<br />Quality was good and clear, good price!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is a humorous action adventure book with a Greek mythology twist. Rick Riordan did a great job with this book!
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Meg Ryan and Romantic Comedies seem to be as synonymous and genre defining, to me, as Riddley Scott and Science Fiction.  I am actually not typically a &#34;Romantic Comedy&#34; fan however, this film is very fun.  Hugh Jackman is both believable and charming as a 19th century &#34;man of privilege&#34; stuck in the future (21st century New York.)  Meg is a hard working career woman who is a romantic at heart, although she has become cynical from being hurt by previous relationships.  (I can definitely relate to her character.)  Liev Shreiber is great as the genius/comic relief for the film.  He is such a good dramatic actor, it is nice to see his comedic side.  Hugh Jackman's character also has some highly comedic moments, and Breckin Meyer is also enjoyable as &#34;Kate's&#34; younger brother, the actor.  I love the time travel aspect of it, which is most notably enjoyable during the opening scene, although Jackman's character definitely keeps the &#34;period&#34; alive throughout.  Just a fun film.
0312966199|5.0|Again, can't go wrong with Herriot.  Family, critters, love, laughter and tears all wrapped up together in a wonderful story!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Even though it is still a fairy tale, I very much enjoy this slightly more believable/realistic version of this story.  All of the actors play their parts well, with Angelica Houston taking the proverbial cake as the evil step mother.  I usually enjoy Drew Barrymore's films.  This one is no different.  This is probably my favorite of her films, actually, with 50 First Dates coming in second.  Overall a highly enjoyable film.
0312965788|5.0|Highly recommended to all animal lovers in your lift.  Can't go wrong with James Herriot.  Wonderful, warm story line! Great.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is a very very good game I really liked the find it games and the cut scenes. Allison the guide was very helpfull
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game once my kids showed me how it works! It was fun and challenging at the same time.  I can't wait for more levels. :)
B0094BB4TW|2.0|My sister and I both have a Kindle fire HD. Her Facebook has the status emoticons and I don't. I have tried deleting the app and reinstalling and still nothing. Why???
B004KZOXJA|4.0|I enjoyed this first book, a little slow going but an interesting world to get involved in. I am getting book 2!
0142410314|4.0|This is a classic, I don't think there is anything new for me to say about the book. Just wanted to state that I have a &#34;prime&#34; membership with guaranteed 2-day delivery.  As a 4th grade teacher, I needed that 2-day delivery.  These books arrived late. Just thought others should know.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I never read this in school for some reason. Decided it was time and I am very glad I gave it a shot. Very enjoyable reading. *S*
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Such a great CD!  Kind of reminds me of the early Dave Matthews' Band stuff.  Just makes you happy listening to it.  This AI winner does not disappoint!
B005FFW46S|4.0|My husband and I both enjoy reading about the Disc World. Terry Pratchett has such a way of turning real life into a funny new world with his series. Some of the characters carry over from one book to another, but each can be read on its own too. My husband describes these stories as modern day activities with a medieval twist to it. Always a good read that makes us laugh out loud at times. Highly recommended. *S*
B006GLLXXK|5.0|I enjoyed the down to earth approach to this sci fi series.  I can't wait to see this seasons shows.
1781162646|5.0|Awesome story. Stephen King has done it again! Great summer read, it will have you hooked from the first chapter.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Much better then the weather channel app. More accurate and better radar. Easier to read and navigation is good.  Would be happy to pay for this service.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie brings into focus the degree to which the citizens of the DDR (former East Germany) were enslaved by their own  government.  It is another reminder of the evils of communism.  We cannot give our government too much power.  We must find a balance between collective national security and individual liberty.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 ways to pass time and have a blast doing it! Highly recommend downloading this app and start enjoying the fun!
0553593714|5.0|The first maybe 50-100 pages of this book were slow. There's a lot of information that you'll find useful later, and a lot of events that set the stage for the rest of the book (and the series). The characters are rich and wonderful and the imagery is immersive. When you finish this one you won't be able to not read the next. And the next, and all the rest after that- only to get mad at GRRM for not writing the next installment fast enough.<br />He writes epic fantasy that the average reader and fantasy reader alike are unable to put down.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This move was well done, not only was  it perfectly cast it was well played. Fat Amy is the star of the show my kids love her.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Nice graphics, fun game if you enjoy the Candy Crush kind of thing. Becomes VERY challenging as you get further into the levels. Good way to spend time.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|I loved 'The language of flowers'.  It was heart warming and captivating. I did not want to leave this book and was intrigued from beginning to end. The plight of the main character was unusual and the way her story was told was clever. The concept was unique and this was a refreshing change to the books I have been reading lately. This was the sort of book that I didn't want to end.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Thus book was very well written, and I couldn't put it down until I finished it! I definitely would recommend this book for people in high school or older because the subject matter is a little intense. But overall, I LOVED this book!
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I HAD ALWAYS LOVED THE BOOK SO I MUST SAY THAT I WAS USUALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE MOVIE VERSIONS UNTIL I SAW THIS ONE. ROMEO AND JULIET WAS ANOTHER FILM THAT I HAD TO SEE DONE WITH AGE APPROPRIATE LEADS THAT LET YOU REALLY FEEL HOW VERY YOUNG THEY WERE WHEN THEY FELL IN LOVE. I JUST LOVED THIS WHOLE MOVIE.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Well Done!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE CASSETTES AND I COULD NOT RESIST GETTING IT IN CD FORMAT. THERE IS ALWAYS A FEAR OF THE TAPE COMING UNDONE ETC..ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN TOO DISABLED TO COMPLETELY JOIN THE MODERN UP TO DATE WORLD AT LEAST I KNOW I HAVE IT ON CD.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|I love it thank you have a nice day! God Bless America! Have a good time yes? ok why not
B00004TDTO|5.0|I AM GLAD I DID NOT SEE THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS YOUNG OR I MAY NEVER HAVE LEARNED TO SWIM UNTIL MUCH LATER IN LIFE. AS A CHILD I SPENT MY TIME ALONE MOST OF THE TIME AND I LEARNED TO SWIM IN THE OCEAN OF MONTEREY AND I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF SHARKS. AFTER SEEING THIS IT WAS LIKE AFTER SEEING PSYCHO AND NOT WANTING TO TAKE A SHOWER WHEN I WAS HOME ALONE. THE ACTING WAS SUPERB!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game that can literally keep you entertained for hours. Almost as good as temple run 2. You should play it.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|The game is fun, but the right turn button is in a horrible position.  The menu tab and right turn arrow are side by side, which causes issues.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|It's fun to go around the world. Puzzles are fun too. Thanks for a great game. Safe and happy travels!
B005DC68NI|5.0|If you are thinking about self publishing for Kindle, this is the best place to start. It covers the ground, its up to date, and the author knows what he's talking about.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I rated it high because I played it on face book and now I'm happy that I can play it on my Kindle.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This one of the best series to every grace TV. The bonus features are excellent for those diving in a second or third time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the character of Katniss Everdeen.  It ends somewhat abruptly with lots of unanswered questions . . guess I'll find out in Mocking Jay how it all turn out!  Good read.  Hard to put down!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This one of the best series to every grace TV. The bonus features are excellent for those diving in a second or third time.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|After watching the previews for this movie I immediately did not want to see it.  I assumed it was going to be the typical hokey, predictable, mainstream manufactured garbage like 80% of all movies made today targeted at the mainstay soccer mom audience.  Stick a couple of popular celebs in there and viola.  My wife forced me to watch this, it was her turn to pick a movie, and I have to say this was excellent.  Who wants to see Bradley Cooper face anymore really?  But I'll tell you he wasn't annoying.  Good casting, good acting, nothing over done.  A tad predictable, but what isn't these days.  Even Robert Dinero, who jumped the shark on the meet the Fockers was good.  Highly recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This application works like the best battery application that I have every used either in a computer, android, or Amazon kindle. I recommend this app to anybody.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So simple to use and seemless integration with all my devices and helps me stay organized! Where have you been all my life?
0723257639|5.0|A perfect gift to celebrate the arrival of a newborn, or the reaching of an early birthday, this collection is likewise appropriate for children as old as 7 or 8 who will want to read and reread the 23 titles on their own.  There is a wealth of literary richness contained within the \\"little books\\": an incomparable artist, Beatrix Potter was likewise a gifted storyteller.  To be read aloud (again and again); to be looked at and pored over; to be given special space on a bookshelf; to be treasured in memory for a lifetime, this series of  books for young children (and the caring adults in their lives) is without equal.<br />\\"Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were---Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter...\\"  So begins the familiar first of the 23 volumes, each of which is conveniently stored here within an attractive, sturdy box.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Me and my daughters absolutely love watching this together! It is a very suspenseful series. we can't wait to watch the next episode!
0205313426|5.0|Basic and essential, this volume belongs on the bookshelf of every<br />student and of all writers.<br />There is a reason why The Elements of Style endures as a dependable<br />reference and a helpful resource.  Own a copy and you will discover its<br />strengths.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I love this series and I can't even tell you why! I hate blood and gore and all the sound effects that go with it, and this series has plenty of it. Yet I continue to watch it episode after episode totally glued to the television watching it. Its not just a lot of dead people walking around aimlessly like you would see in an older movie about zombies or anything of the like. It's about human beings having to start all over again in a world that seems so hopeless. It's about people trying to survive in a world that no longer has any law and order, a world where you don't know who you can trust, a world where there doesn't seem to be any place to rest, a world where you have to engage in all that blood and gore or you will not survive. In fact I think this series is written so well that during one of their six month breaks I started watching it all over again from the beginning and was just as captivated as the first time I started watching it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I recommend app. It kept me busy, challenging but not too difficult.<br /><br />I had to escape so I could get to the next level!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved American Gods and decided to give this book a try as well. I liked it more. If you're looking for a creepy fairy tale best told by a dying bonfire, then this is the book for you!  There is enough reality in the world and not nearly enough magic.
B002J2PB10|4.0|I liked the atmosphere of this movie in the beginning through the middle.  I wanted to know what would happen with Kurt Russell.  There was genuine suspense and just that Tarantino feel to the pace of the movie.  It was a good action flick.  I was less impressed with the ending.  I think it felt a bit forced and it was a foregone conclusion after a certain point.  I wish it could have had a darker ending.  Overall, it was well worth my time and money.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|I love this movie. It was great. The only thing what i think was, the sound could be much louder
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I liked this better than Django Unchained which I consider his second best recent film.  This movie is the type that people who love movies want to see.  The whole film was a ride and I didn't want it to stop.  Tarantino could have made this 4 hours and I would have been on the edge of my seat the whole time.  This is the type of movie that I hope someone, Hollywood or Independent, can produce at least one of per year.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|But got 3 stars for living up to the Die Hard blow 'em up tradition. It may be time for better writers!
0321356683|5.0|If you have to code in Java, you should pick this book up because it contains best practices.  Even James Gosling (created Java) said he needs this book.<br /><br />There are two books that I strongly recommend for software engineers (especially if you have to use Java but don't like it): this book and Java Concurrency in Practice.  Everything else you need to know can be acquired through an online copy of the Java language spec and a few other links on Oracle's site.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|I like bad movies but this was awful...yes the title of my post says it all, I like bad cheesy movies but this movie had no redeeming qualties
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is super fun and just challenging enough not to be too maddening.  Love it.  Can't wait for more levels!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show has surprises, one after another! I have loved every character and storyline! It's a must watch for all! You won't be disappointed!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I just started playing &amp; I can't stop. I really didn't want to pause g as me to rate but I wanted to let others know how much fun it is. Would write more but ready to resume play. Fun game!
B000L9EKL0|5.0|One of my favorite Gene Hackman movies, and the action sequences are very good.  It sheds a good light on the American Navy.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am biased because I love Star Wars but this is the best Angry Birds yet. Love seeing the birds dressed as the Star Wars characters. Otherwise similar to previous AB games.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|interesting characters and keeps me drawn in to continue. I wanted the second book not knowing there was a first<br />so I am starting with the first one.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|I can't find the six star rating...<br /><br />Seriously, though - the Coens at their finest. Thoroughly enjoyed by many of those in the non-square community.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|This is required reading for anybody wondering what day to day life is like in North Korea.  After reading this, I wish there was more I could do to help the North Korean people.  Unfortunately, it is an isolated society and providing aid is almost impossible.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A great movie from a really thoughtful TV series.  Fillion is excellent in a Harrison Ford role of every-man pulled to do his best.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had no idea how wonderful this show was! I never watched &#34;The Good Wife&#34; during the regular season and totally discovered it through my Amazon Prime membership. Now I am obsessed.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is my favorite of all the cut the rope games. Excellent app. Highly recommend.  I can even play on my smart phone.
159463176X|3.0|I give it four stars because Hosseini tells the most beautiful stories.... but he tends to stray in this book. I love the stories, but this one just doesn't come together like his first two did. If you like Hosseini's first two, then it's worth the try.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another of her great books.  She is a master of suspense. Cannot wait for her next one. I really enjoyed.
1582701709|5.0|inspiring and very motivational. your mind will be opened to opportunities you never saw before. time to take action now
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't seem to put this game down. Just when I think I know what to expect, there's a new twist! It's definitely a work out for your brain. Get this app immediately!!
0307744434|5.0|I wasn't sure how good this book was going to be until I read the first few pages and became hooked. It was different, interesting, and a great read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age village is an amazing game that keeps me occupied for hours. No more &quot; Are we there yet's&quot; on car rides.
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|Game looked great but after paying $6.99 for it it won't download even after removing apps and restarting my kindle fire hd I want my money back
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book is basically a copy cat of fifty shades of grey. I read the first 2 books and started to read this one and couldn't make it thru the first chapter. Too many similarities!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! One of the best bingo games I've tried thus far. You can play as a guest or play on facebook with your friends! My only complaint is why is it harder to gain blue chips as your level gets higher....other than that GREAT BINGO GAME...!!!! Try it and you'll see.........
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very well done. It told it how it was in the day, without being morose about it. Not all white people were cruel and mean, and it brings that out too, but does give just a glimpse of how it was...I grew up through those years and in The South, it was sad, but there were good times as well as bad. It was a different world back then.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is fun and a very addictive game. I can't seem to stop playing!!!!!! It's easy and fast pace....it's almost as trying to type....!!! Get it!! Try it!!!! You will love it!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It makes it you really think. It always keeps me wondering what next...<br />My daughter really likes doing these with me. I like the challenges.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Very rich and complex characters, plenty of surprising plot twists - draws you in so that you want to keep reading.<br /><br />Definitely a book for adults not children though.
0345529057|5.0|I had previously read the first book, but it had been quite some time so my copy had been lost and my memory was fuzzy at best.<br /><br />When I saw this great deal for the first four books together, I bought it without hesitation. As a huge fan of the television show, I can say that these books are an incredible supplement to fans of the show. While most people would often refer to the books as being better than film/TV adaptations, the Game of Thrones series is so closely related that it's almost hard to distinguish. I could actually picture each page as the appropriate scene from the show.<br /><br />The dialogue is nearly identical, and it just adds more detail and more understand to parts of the lore that were difficult to grasp in rushed episodes each season. With the similarity between the series being so tight-knit, I think I will actually just wait to watch each season before reading the corresponding book, so as to not ruin any dramatic scenes.<br /><br />If you love the TV show, or fantasy writing, pick these up. The writing is great, and makes for an easy read even for those who despise reading.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The beginning of this novel is awesome. But half way through is a little dry. However, the ending is something a reader would never expect. Three quarters through and the plot thickens once again.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I didn't know it was legal to sell such worthless apps. I guess anyone who knows how to lable an app can make any outrageous claims and sell them as if they work. More legal than robbing your neighbor but about the same morally. Just take a box of crayons and draw a tv set on your wall...it will work just as well as this app.<br />I am ashamed to admit I bought this app through Amazon
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I tried this on my Dell Latitude laptop - did not work.<br /><br />I tried this on my Replay XD action camera - really really low volume. The built in MIC on the camera was much better.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|was good, consistent quality would have been more appealing, but movie was acceptable nonetheless.<br />i will rent a few more to evaluate overall streaming quality before passing judgement.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was just difficult enough to keep me interested without getting frustrated and bailing out before the end.  It's a great adult mind challenge!  I would love to try more puzzles like these.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Was impressed that a majority of the key elements in the books were transferred to the movie series.  Thought the films were well done.
B00782O7NE|5.0|I knew, from the very first time I saw this movie, that it was extraordinarily special.  It's absolutely timeless and classic in every way.  I rank it right up there with The Wizard of Oz.  You can watch it 30 times and still enjoy every minute of it.  One of the greatest films of all time.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Took awhile to download to my kindle...  I'm an old school player so not sure of a couple abilities but loving it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I didn't need all the add-on's of more expensive sets so price was right.  There were no glitches and good viewing/visual quality.
B005TKD6NY|4.0|Norwegian Wood is pure Murakami but without the supernatural elements found in most of his other books. That said, his prose and dialogue is very familiar - classic Murakami.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|If you're a fan of the genre, you'll enjoy this movie. Hands down. This is a seriously solid horror film and does the one thing I enjoy when watching horror and action films. To induce a reaction that I can't control. There's a scene where a machete goes through a wall and on the way out, it drags on someone's limb. Pretty obvious what they were doing, but I found myself saying \\"guhwaaaaahh!\\" and cringing.<br /><br />Acting was solid. I enjoyed that this movie only used the original as a rough guideline and there were plenty of nods and similarities in any case. I wish there was more information about the necronomicon. But maybe there will be more films.<br /><br />My only beef***SPOILER INCOMING***)is that the main character has almost no development in the movie. Also, while I do believe in strong female characters, why did we have to ruin the Evil dead series by making the junkie sister the survivor? There are plenty of movie already out there that are pro-female without having to destroy a franchise? I knew something was weird when the guy you think is the new Bruce Campbell didn't seem as much the focus as you think he'd be. The way this was done was kind of off-putting as in the end no one in movie was memorable. If you wanted the girl to live, you should have developed her throughout the movie so I'd care. She's fighting for her life and I'm busy being stunned and shocked that she's the last one left. I have a theory about this, however.<br /><br />So at the end of the movie you are left without any real investment in the \\"main character. You sit there, stunned; wondering what WTF is going on. Credits roll. Then there is talking and at the end of the credits you see a familiar face. Hell Yea! I honestly hope this was just a chapter and not a true \\"reboot\\".
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you enjoy The Big Bang Theory this is a great value.  All episodes from season three are included.  There is nothing to special about the &#34;extras&#34; or bonus features.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far the best book I have read in a while. I couldn't put it down once I started. Must read.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|The book &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; which was translated into our language I already read. This movie I watched last week. I think there is not different, almost the same. I am glad to know this movie filmed at England nearby the location that Emily Bronte inspired to write this novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really fun. my 4 year old loves helping solve the puzzles.  some of them are a childishly easy.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|The art is great the game play is smooth its also easy to catch onso far ive not had to spend money to win the matches
B008383GE8|5.0|now this is a really terrific book, some good physics in it.<br />it is explained very well, sets your imagination going,<br />nothing means heaps here, very well presented, i reckon.<br />me again,<br />rob clode<br />up in th mountains eh!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Cunning funny and deep, A type personality lawyer drama mixed with romantic intrigues and clever one liners... Perfect recipe for a great show. Very good quality for a TV series
B000089RVR|5.0|White flag...WOW!!!! That song is AWESOME! I enjoyed all of the songs. Beautiful voice and a keeper on my CD shelf.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|this movie is too predictable that there is no surprise in it, the characters are flat and the pace makes anyone sleep...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great really enjoyed it. Wish they would hurry up and make new levels. Definately gives you a challenge.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Not sure how this one has gotten positive reviews.  Movies are subjective I suppose.  Over acted, ridiculous ending.  Save your money.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|My grandson and I watched this together, even though he had seen it before, all in preparation for the upcoming sequel. The minions make the movie! Loved the effect the girls had on Gru. Looking forward to seeing DM2 next!
B004I4H8QS|5.0|Great bit of unrepeatable music history. Clapton went on from here to become one of modern guitar's greatest musical icons.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Had to introduce my grandson to this one. All the characters are fun, especially Cerrano and Wild Thing. And having Tom Berenger in the movie as a grounding factor made my heart sing. Great movie!
B00C8YOIR2|4.0|I have to admit, I'm not the least bit into this vampire-romance craze sweeping through the literary world. Hopefully it will burn out soon and we can get back to proper fantasy. That being said, Dead Medium was like a breath of fresh air. Who doesn't like ghosts? The beginning reminds me of classic Stephen King, with a strange mist sweeping in. Yet instead of a haunting, terrifying ride through the underworld, Peter John delivers a humorous tale of poor Margaret. The characters are well developed and the prose flows easily. I enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to anyone seeking something new. If anything, I now view cats slightly differently...
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a good video, but after doing each level for a week, it gets a little boring. Level 3 is pretty challenging. It just depends if you work out regularly--for those who do, the first level will seem easy.  Also, you won't get &#34;shredded&#34; unless you are doing some kind of nutrition plan along with this video.
1439152799|5.0|The final denouement of THE DISTANT HOURS has left me thinking this must be the most original writing piece I have had the pleasure to read in quite a while! You know you have discover an exceptional novel when there are so many twists and turns to the plot you hold your breath, leaving you with this feeling of awe at the scope of the author's imagination!<br /><br />There are countless adjectives one could apply to describe Kate  Morton's novel, from intriguing to momentous, a phenomenon in this day and age when so many novels feels spieled in a minimum of time but I will emphasise singular! This is one book you will be loath to put down!<br /><br />Written with elements of an epistolary novel (the poly logic type which creates a dramatic tension throughout the plot), the novel alternates betwixt the late 1930's, the 1940's and the 1990's.  The plot line is to be experienced for its originality as nothing will prepare you for its final phase.<br /><br />THE DISTANT HOURS with its discerning cast of characters, each cleverly described, will remind of the saying: \\"All is fair in love and war'.<br />We have a compelling Milderhurst Castle with its moat filled in, Percy, Saffy and Juniper, the three spinsters sisters in residence, their reclusive and eccentric father, Raymond Blythe, a writer with his best seller 'The True History Of The Mud Man' the pivot of the story.<br /><br />Multi layered, this haunting story involves also a young evacuee and a missing person in wartime, and finally our narrator, the young editor/publisher who stumbles on her mother's mysterious past which seemed  strangely connected to Milderhurst' s deep secrets and its inhabitants...<br /><br />Spanning decades and fabulously rich in historical facts and suspense, this novel depicts the true extent of friendship, love, hate all carefully intertwined with loyalty and duty.<br /><br />Australian author Kate Morton has definitively earned 5+ stars for this interesting novel and I am eagerly looking forward to read her three other novels (as well as whatever she can come up with!)<br /><br />Note to Readers: This review was not requested and therefore represents ONLY my opinion!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|We bought this for our 3 year old for her birthday.  We have the same show saved on our DVR, but it nice to have a hard copy for traveling.  Nothing keeps her occupied like Sofia.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very nice...challenging the brain, keeps you sharp....love it.<br />I think that this is a lot of fun,and I would like to get more free downloads like this one.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Am delighted to own this DVD.  After many viewings, it still makes me laugh out loud, ridiculous as that may sound.
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan never disappoints.  I've read almost all of his kids' books as well as his Tres Navarre books.  Please keep the stories coming.  It is heartening to know that a person with this much imagination has taught so many of our children.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|One of the best books I've read recently, I literally could not put it down.  Will be looking for more by Shilpi Somaya Gowda.  Highly recommend!
B009G3T01M|5.0|Start to finish, it is completely worth the price of admission. So many great songs.  I have a hard time picking just one favorite.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great entertaining game<br />Great for all ages-nice graphics-pries are steep though. I'd rather pay for the game and not have to buy in game items
B00991TCOG|5.0|This girl is an experience in many ways. If you see her videos you will have to own this CD and you won't regret it.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|We loved every minute of this entertaining movie.  This is the third time I've seen it and it's still funny. Fun for the entire family. Can't wait to see Despicable Me 2.
B008M4MB8K|4.0|Layered, textured performances by a great cast, can be haunting and presents some moral questions which still are studied even today in movies like Cloud Atlas.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I have seen a lot of horror movies but this one---I am afraid to walk through my house right now.  It scared the h--- out of me!  Ethan Hawke is an amazing actor and the mother was excellent as well.  You knew the movie wasn't going to end happily--but wow.  Like I said, I have seen a lot of movies and they generally freak me out for the duration of the picture---but this one will stay with me.  Holy.  And, you have to watch on the computer or someplace where you can easily replay spots because there is so much in many of shots--it's easy to miss.  I don't usually write reviews---but I felt compelled to say that this movie is unequivocally one of the scariest films I have ever seen.  I am still scared---and I don't scare easily.  Geez!  Seriously--I am afraid to go to bed.  And the psychological aspect---that the images are gateways and of course the viewer is entering that gateway....Frightening.  Terrific film and well worth the rental price.  It's an intelligent, well done, symbolic, well-directed, well-acted, well-written, and scary film.  Shudder!  And seriously, keep a light on.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|A well put together documentary.  Kept me engaged and disgusted the entire duration.  I am planning a community showing of both Gasland and Gasland II, because I believe EVERYONE needs to see how this disaster called fracking affects everything and everyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|See the post-apocolyptic world through a dingy lense. Until the next cleaning this is the only view that exists... and it's not a very nice one. This is a can't put down book full of twists and turns, lies and secrets, love and death. An absolute MUST read.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I really am impressed with his work. He Finally sounds like he found his way after hitting the big scene.
B006K1IIHA|5.0|I saw the first 10 minutes of the first episode at a friend's house when I stopped in for a visit. I was hooked instantly. As soon as I got home, I looked it up and watched the the rest of the episode. With every episode that followed, I only loved it more. I had already seen Cumberbatch as Khan and Freeman as Bilbo. I was amazed at how well the actors portrayed these characters. From the slightest detail of Sherlock's observations to the emotions of Watson's interactions to the drama and action they mix in perfect quantities, this series has to be one the best I have ever seen. I recommend this show to anyone that appreciates a good mystery, a good detective, or just a dramatic, amusing look into a high-functioning sociopath. Actually, I'm forcibly convincing every one of my friends to see it, and they're getting just as much into it as I am. I thought House was a convincing mystery-solver and Robert Downey Jr was a great genius/maniac. Then I saw this \\"modern\\" Sherlock and I'll never find someone that can compare again.<br />As for the hard-product itself, the combination of both seasons onto a single blu-ray set wasn't difficult considering it's little more than two trilogies of movie-length episodes. I was also pleased that they included the special features on the discs. I've found that \\"double-features\\" often lack the bonuses of a \\"single-feature\\". The problem is that European products (and therefore BBC) are generally formatted in PAL, whereas the typical United States products are NTSC. I believe this is the \\"region-lock\\". When I tried to play the disc, my TV showed an error message claiming that there was a resolution issue. There was none; my Magnavox NTSC blu-ray player simply couldn't read the PAL format. I have heard a rumor that Sony is either making their products region-free, or that their players can support either format. Once I get my next paycheck, I'm going to get a Sony blu-ray player to test the theory. In the meantime, I'm keeping the blu-ray, even though I can't play it just yet. I'm still enjoying Sherlock online.
1932100660|5.0|very well written and presented with data you cannot argue with.  It is a shame larger hospitals, corporations, and government are spinning information to increase their financial livelihood versus our well-being.  A must read for everyone of all ages.  As consumers, we have the power to demand changes from these large entities.  Becoming informed is the first step.  This book does just that.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Where does he get these  totally believable storylines from? &#34;I just make 'em up see&#34;. It's sci-fi at it's best. Dealing with the complexities of man as he adjusts to his metallic servants being part of everyday life.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|It's a good game, but I beat the levels that they offer so far so now I have to wait for the creators to create new ones. I hope they come out with more sooner than later.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I used to hate reading when I was younger, nothing interested me at all, then I read this book and never stopped. It's a great book for grade school kids and now that I'm older I still love it and I continue to read his continuing series the heroes of Olympus. You should get this book because it's fascinate ok my and amazing
B0059WTMLW|5.0|If i miss the sudoku in the paper one day, I just open this app and I have any level of difficulty that I feel like doing that day!!  Great app!  If you like sudoku, you will love this!!
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|This is not in my opinion one of Sabbaths better albums.  However, being a huge fan of Ozzy and of Sabbath I gave it 4 stars because it is good and I did enjoy it.  Just didn't feel it was worth 5 stars.  Their reunion album a few years back was better.
B00991TCOG|3.0|Like the style and form of the music, but its downside is that it doesn't vary. But it is a new artist and with time I think that will improve.
0066620996|1.0|This is the worst book written about how to move your organization forward. Not worth the paper it is written on. If I could give it a negative star I would. I gave it one star just to show I rated it.<br /><br />The examples the author gives don't hold water and are less than worthless. \\"If you don't have the right people on the bus, then you have to get the right people on the bus.\\" What a load of garbage.<br /><br />And here's the crux of it, the reality is that sometimes you have to take people out of their position and replace them. However, employees come in all skill levels and personalities. And sometimes you have to work with what you have. You've got your high potentials, the steady eddies and those who lag behind. And if you're always off looking for the next best thing, everyone in your organization would need to be fired. Case in point, the methods described in this abomination are divisive. And highly functional teams are more important than trying to make everyone a superstar.<br /><br />The book places no value to your employees, because you're always trying to replace them.<br /><br />My suggestion is to get out of your chair and lead. This book is on the level of fantasy, like the fountain of youth. It is a thing that doesn't exist. Great organizations exist because of ordinary individuals who become extraordinary by having a vision and making the organization great. But they inspire others by leading and they do it by having an attentive ear to what employees are saying. Communications is a two way street.<br /><br />You can't find greatness in a book. You have to do it.<br /><br />By someone who knows.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The demo was so much fun that u had to have the full game. Now u am playing both multiplayer and single campaign
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This is a classic, if you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it! It is fantastic!
B006QPX7UI|4.0|I watched Gettusburg again on July 3, the sesquicentennial of the famous struggle.  The movie tells the story based on Michael Sharaa's Killer Angels,  I love Jeff Daniels potrtrayal of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Martin Sheen as my great Uncle Robert E  Lee.  Terrific movie
B004DMTCNM|4.0|Highly improbable plot, but interesting nonetheless. Lots of action packed scenes and hardly a dull moment.  If you're looking for some entertainment, this might fit the bill.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The game is very fun to play for all experience level of players. I would recommend this game. Great buy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fun looking for hints. check it out if you have the time. yup yup yup what what!? yes sir. would play more but there are no more levels.
B00D7JQJFG|3.0|I bought it for my iPad's Kindle app. I was very disappointed to see that all pages contain large white borders on all sides which makes the actual viewable area smaller than it should be. I can zoom in on the page but only in pre-defined sections and to a fixed scale (no pinch zoom) within the white borders.<br /><br />This would be fine for e-magazine, but for an &#34;art book&#34;? This is seriously disappointing.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I clearly need more instructions, I have solved a puzzle but haven't been able to do anything else.  It may just be me, I love puzzle games so maybe I can find someone to tell me what I am doing wrong.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So far this has been a fun game. Not too easy but not so mind boggling it becomes no fun. I turn off all sound effects and music on my games so i can not say whether those items are good or bad.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|makes you think about life, love and the pursuit of happiness. I hate that I have to write a review. but good movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|From the acting, set (I mean it's a castle, come on!), costumes, EVERYTHING (well maybe not the story line!), its over the top fantastic!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Actually bought this for my adult son.  He loved it and so did my grandson. Especially the Blu-ray version.  Great action.
B009CWWFD2|4.0|I'M READING IT NOW AND SO FAR  I AM ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH.  I HOPE IT CONTINUES TO BE AS ENTERTAINING UNTIL IT'S CONCLUSION.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watching Downton Abbey is like watching life as it should be.  There is much to be learned from this series for all.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|More unlockables. More fun. All you do is just run from a stupid fat guy. Put in more stuff. Then it will deserve at least 3 stars.
B009NX50DM|5.0|Good collection of great actors and supporting cast. Saw it new in 1970's,  mini's a little dated.  Big Brother seems to have been around for quite awhile.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|What can I say, she has done herself great, this is above all, the best I have ever heard her, and, once you hear this album, you will know that it is her alone that made ABBA as great as they became. Love it.

1452113432|5.0|Little Paris Kitchen itself is a really nice book, recipes are very interesting, very easy and very tasty.  Cant wait for her next book.  Love John
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I bought this movie for my collection, and since I had already seen the movie I did not immediately watch it when received. I opened the disk last week and it would not play. Unfortunately it is now beyond the return/replace period, and I also have thrown away the shipping/package slip. Lesson learned to always check the disk when it is received.
B00CFA222M|4.0|This is a good movie with some CG violence.  Good for the whole family but younger kids might find it scary.  The CG is excellent
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This is a great movie and excellent production. The assault on the compound scene appear to be very accurate on consistent with the best book on this - Manhunt.
B007CIIBJK|5.0|This is probably not a classic but I just loved the story line as it is so relevant to what our soldiers go thru coming home.  i am the wife of a military officer and know more than maybe some.  Also loved the setting and the little boy  and everything.  I have bought the DVD.  We can use more stories with ordinary people involved.  I am tired of all the violence in so much of our entertainment.  VERY HARD ON YOUNG PEOPLE AND SENDING TERRIBLE MESSAGES!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very fun and quite challenging. It's nothing like 100 rooms. It's a trillion times more fun. I highly recommend this game.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|We downloaded this and tried to watch several different videos, without luck.  I would advise you download a different app.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|i Also got a feel for Australia and the Aboriginal population. After reading a few Harry Hole (hoo-leh) novels, I finally got to read about his earlier years.  he is a likeable but frustrating man, turning to alcohol despite a vow of sobriety.  The novel is very exciting and suspenseful.  The characters are colorful and unusual, almost too unusual to be believed.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I'd like how the history evolves, it is capturing intriguing and interesting.  It is science fiction in the future in a world destroyed by a disease.
0452295548|5.0|The biggest challenge for my wife has not been the physical limitation as much as the emotional ones.  She was always the strong go getter and now she feels betryed by her on body.  Progress is vey slow and she needed more than me and her girls to help her understand that she is not alone in this.  This book takes you down the road that is not well known or understood.  I highly recommend it!
B0047WJ12K|2.0|Don't watch this movie after a busy, noisy day. It will make you very grumpy! The timeline was difficult to follow -- back and forth in time. While the dream state could have been interesting, it wasn't done well.
0670024813|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and informative books I have ever read.  At first glance, it appears to be another leftist rant from academia as modern societies are described using the acronym WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich & Democratic).<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book is generally objective and the author does a good job describing the advantages and disadvantages of modern and primitive societies.  The book gives plenty of information about these societies and it is up to the reader to decide which is better or what could be done to improve modern societies.  Diamond finds positive and negative aspects in both.<br /><br />For example, we have conquered starvation but have developed cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, mostly from our modern diet of too much sugar, fat, and salt as well as our sedentary lifestyle.  These diseases were unknown in primitive societies.<br /><br />We have increased our longevity but may be enjoying it less.  There were no such things as loneliness, anonymity, and stress in primitive societies where everbody knew everbody else and the main activity was finding food every day.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is a lotnof fun blame keeps you wanting to keep playing, its over all a great free game
1400049628|5.0|Pretty good book to have for general survival tips, etc. Not a fictional sort of zombie book like World War Z but totally useful and good for what it is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book pulled me into this world of Panem, but this book weaves a part of me into the complicated threads of their story and lives. I love these books and will continue to recommend them to anyone who I meet.
0451232852|5.0|Follett really knows how to tell an interesting story.<br /><br />Wish I had gotten a paperback with bigger type, but the book is fantastic.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I gave this a 4 because when I try realms it always says no open slot in the day over all great game
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Seems great.  Would definitely recommend.  Colors<br /><br /> and levels are of good quality.  Not technically hard.  A good choice for starting out
B008M0NDOK|1.0|Delivered on time and in good condition. I was very disappointed in this product because it only worked on a few apps. It's not amazon fault but the company that created this product. The buttons are not as flexible and way to tight for great use. I would not recommend this item at this time.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Reading this book was just like watching the series. The physical descriptions of the characters in the book don't exactly match with the actors who got the parts... but remember when &#34;everyone&#34; thought Daniel Craig was going to be a bust as the next Bond?? Yeah, they were wrong.  And the actors in the tv series do capture the written characters very effectively.  I'll take the time to read the whole series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Enjoyable app, great graphics, I can't own my own horse so it's fun to watch my horses run around at my convenience. When playing online, too many ads interrupt but it's captivating and good clean fun.
B003JA7P5G|5.0|love the show love the story line. I accidently bought this but its ok. its good stuff. love it a lot
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed this quick read! Very entertaining and interesting story. However, at times the narration was unrealistic. I had a hard time believing an astronaut would talk or write like the narrator. The use of profanity seemed excessive and immature, especially for a professional, who likely has multiple advanced degrees that require technical and scientific writing. The narrator's intelligence and resourcefulness came through incredibly, and I enjoyed all of the effort the author put in to devising technical problems, and then developing solutions. I am looking forward to more work from Weir!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was an absolute great game all around. Worked great on my Kindle Fire and was well worth the money! Make another like this! I would pay to play games like this all day long!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app perfectly organizes all of my subscriptions and news sources in a manner that offers a high level of customization, yet is easy to use and nice to look at. The interface is incredibly smooth and fun to work with. No probs at all.  Even .gifs and videos import seamlessly, which has been somewhat of a problem at times for other apps like pulse and flipboard that I also use for the same purpose.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|This game is like temple run but you can't slide down.  I enjoy it and if your waiting for this game NO NEED TO WAIT ANY LONGER.  If you could actually pass stuff, I would give it a 5 star rating but other than that AMAZING.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this product.  I like that you can mix the sounds to create something specific for you. The loops are done nicely that it is not distracting.  There are plenty of sound options to choose from.  I've used the biaural sounds also.  It takes a little getting used to but once tweaked to your liking, I think it does help you sleep/concentrate better.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game you have to use your brain. Unlike most games that are all about killing this game makes you think!!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|While the game is great..the only way to get anywhere is spend money and lots of it. I admit I have spent more than I should have only to have my Fire mess up when I on level45 &amp; I had to do a hard reset. I lost everything and have to start over... there should be a way to keep the game data. Also they need to lower the cost of things
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This can has definitely gotten so much better than number 3 from graphics to organization and definitely a great story
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love all things Doctor Who and have been going through withdrawals now that we don't have BBCA. This purchase was to help me be patient until Netflix updates. But now I want to know more about souffle girl!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Enjoyed every minute! Watched 3 times now...once in theater, once at home by myself and once with my daughter. Great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it. Wish it had more levels but can't complain for free. I would definitely pay for a  longer version. Puzzles were great and a nice distraction while cooling down from some yard work.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Just the information you need to maintain the life of your battery, simply the best app I have found for battery maintainance.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is really fun and spooky. Generally, I like point and click adventure games, but I'm not a huge fan of the whole hidden objects part of most of these games. This one was heavy on the adventure and lightish on the hidden objects. A great story and well designed game.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The artistry of this movie is exceptional -- from the directing and acting, to the cinematography and special effects. The story is really an allegory that leaves a viewer pondering the nature of survival, and the ways in which the human mind adapts to loss while overcoming almost insurmountable odds.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun and addicting very easy to play as well. Wish you could collect gems faster without paying for them but that is how these games stay free.
B001AITH50|5.0|One of the few movies I've missed with Brad Pitt.  It was a late night treat.  TRy it you'll like it
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Zimmer's great streak of  powerful scores continues with &#34;Man of Steel&#34;...<br />Like his work for &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; trilogy and &#34;Inception&#34;, he assembles a collection of distinctive motifs that not only compliment the films, but make great listening on their own.<br /><br />Zimmer goes for a intense percussive sound for this score. Heavy drums, aggressive guitars and a great solo violinist punctuate the orchestra to create a a powerful, distinctive sound.  He forgoes the expected here...no parade-ready horn-heavy fanfares that have been heard in the past with this hero...but the result is just as epic.  Like the film itself, this score stands apart and defies expectations.<br /><br />Listen for the great work of drummers and percussionists from around the world (see the liner notes for details)...while it's heard throughout the score, try track two &#34;Oil Rig&#34; for a real aural highlight.<br /><br />The album also features a second disc...a &#34;sketchbook&#34; of themes from the film and the trailers...all and all, a great listen.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Well I bought this a while back and finally decided to rip out my board to slap it in. It was a bit of a pain to install being so big and only having two hands but I managed and it seemed to go on tight enough. Put the board back in, fired it up and dead quiet even though it was around 80f in the computer room. Started out at under 30c on a AMD 1090t 6 core and is running 43c on the chip and 27c on all cores surfing and typing right now. Still dead quiet, quieter than the other fans in the case and running about 1000 rpm on the fan. I can probably get it cooler if I play with the settings in my bios but very happy as the stock cooler was very noisy once the room got this warm or warmer and it was like a sauna in here and it could barely keep the chip cool when all 6 cores were loaded. For the money this thing is great, just make sure your case has the room to clear it and that it wont block your memory or anything important. I'm using a older Stacker original full tower case and it has room to spare.
0785168109|4.0|As with earlier volumes, it features an extreme, complete look at the art behind the movie. As for the book itself...this one's pages are really warped within the binding, giving a &#34;lasagne noodle&#34; effect to the pages.  Cheapens the look of an otherwise handsome volume.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I'm glad this was faotd. It's really fun but much too short. I found it to be challenging enough. I finished in an hour though.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|I really like this game but it keeps cutting off on me it would be perfect it if just stayed on. Other than that its fine.
B008JFUMDS|3.0|Now You See Me (Louis Leterrier, 2013)<br /><br />The last time Louis Leterrier and Morgan Freeman got together to make a movie, the result was 2005's Danny the Dog, released in America as Unleashed. It's widely (if you define \\"widely\\" as \\"critical reaction as measured by both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes and public reaction as measured by IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes\\") considered Leterrier's best movie by a country mile (as of this writing), and this reviewer is not inclined to disagree; I adore Danny the Dog something fierce, and much of Leterrier's other work (two films in the Transporter franchise and remakes of The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans) are epitomes of the brainless action film; what sets Danny the Dog apart is its fearsome intelligence. And when I saw a trailer for Now You See Me and noticed it was directed by Leterrier, I had hopes that same intelligence would be back, and so I wandered out to see it despite it having a trio of my least favorite actors currently working in Hollywood all in starring roles: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Mark Ruffalo. And even there, there was a mitigating factor: the one time I have so far been able to stand Jesse Eisenberg on a screen was in Zombieland, and his co-star there was Harrelson, turning in his best role since Natural Born Killers. Whaddya know?<br /><br />Sadly, the high hopes I had were not all realized, though I in no way mean to imply that Now You See Me is not Leterrier's best flick since Danny the Dog. It is that, and it manages to be a slick, fun little heist film despite some woeful casting choices and a script (penned by Boaz Yakin, responsible for such timeless classics of motion pictures as Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) that managed to avoid any semblance of character development. If Leterrier has re-teamed with Luc Besson, who wrote Danny the Dog, they might have come up with a movie just as good.<br /><br />Plot: as we begin, four street magicians, Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), his former assistant Henley Reeves (Wedding Crashers' Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) and grifter/prestidigitator Jack Wilder (Warm Bodies' David Franco), finish up various performances and discover tarot cards with a date, time, and address in New York City. When they get to the apartment, they find, in the words of a famous space traveller, \\"something wonderful.\\" Fast-forward a year later, and the four of them are now known as the Four Horsemen, slick TV magicians headlining Vegas, looking like run-of-the-mill David Copperfield wannabes until the final trick of one performance, where they appear to rob a bank... and when the folks at the bank (located in Paris) open the vault, well, 3.2 million Euros has vanished into thin air. Needless to say, this draws the attention of the Las Vegas PD, in the form of Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), who quickly finds himself paired with a gorgeous Interpol agent from Pairs, Alma Dray (Inglorious Basterds' M&eacute;lanie Laurent). The Horsemen left some clues to their next performance, to be held in New Orleans three days hence; can Rhodes and Laurent, with the reluctant help of professional debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman), head off the Horsemen and their millionaire backer Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine)?<br /><br />When the movie is good, it is very, very good. It's beautifully shot, and I'm intrigued by the fact that what should have been perfectly standard thriller shots seemed like they shouldn't have been in this flick and were thus a surprise (for example, the rooftop of a building in New York City; how many thrillers have you seen that in? And yet it seemed brand new here; much credit to co-DPs Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong). That takes some doing, and it's more impressive than the movie's magic tricks. Woody Harrelson turns in his most affable performance since Zombieland, and I almost, almost didn't hate Mark Ruffalo. Now that takes some doing. On the other hand, Jesse Eisenberg has made himself a career, rather like Tom Cruise did, of getting up on a screen and playing Jesse Eisenberg. (I am still convinced the only reason he was so good in Zombieland is because the screenwriter wrote the character specifically for him.) There's  enough good acting here to balance out Eisenberg, but he's still annoying. So maybe the complete and utter lack of character development that I think has been addressed in every review written on this movie to date is actually a good thing; if this script had tried to delve into Eisenberg's character, we may have gotten more of him. ** ½isenberg has made himself a career, rather like Tom Cruise did, of getting up on a screen and playing Jesse Eisenberg.

B005DOJ68K|5.0|I knew Tom Fogarty personally so CCR's music has always had a special place in my heart.  I love this album.
B00D5O7BPU|3.0|Great sound effect using Kindle fire but some places to click are very hard to see and hit the wrong spot  takes a while to get used to and if you like good sounds then it is okay but I give it a 3 star.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I've seen Bob Seger in concert and this album is just a very nice remembrance of a great time in my life. I love to sing along with the songs. This is a great album to play when you're traveling in the car on the road.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|i abslutey love this game. great fluid story line, addicting, a MUST HAVE and you CANT BEAT THE PRICE!!! by far my favorit  game kindle has to offer.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very detailed book about Dr. Alexander's journey to the afterlife and his attempt to explain it neurologically.  A very thought provoking read for those interested in a glimpse of what lies beyond this life by a scientist.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It is patently, sadly, glaringly obvious that Steve knows absolutely nothing about guns, Dallas Texas, the American people,  or anything else West of the Hudson, and worse, doesn't care if anyone knows it.  He apparently spent a few months in that island of liberal stupidity, Boulder, Colorado, 40 years ago, and figures that was good enough to define the rest of the United States.  I liked the book, as I like most of what he has written, but Lord, when he drops a clanger, how it does ring!<br /><br />I would suggest that he do what John Steinbeck did, in 1960, and take a drive, a long drive, across the United States.  This nation is on the verge of a Revolution, and someone should document why.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Crossed went back and forth between Cassia and Ky. It felt a little lime they tried to squeeze another book out of Ally. Sometimes it doesn't make much sense because it goes back and forth. It can be a little hard to understand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very addicting game. the entire family plays it. I like that the game changes often.  definitely recommend to all our friends.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|This has been my favorite CD for the last 6 months. Love his Scottish soulful voice. I have played it over and over again. The arrangement on the CD gives you both slow melancholy tunes or full on get groovin' tunes to move and dance to. I purchased it after it had been out for a couple of years, but love his music and his voice is to swoon over. Yummy!
0307271080|5.0|At last a story about real Africans---not some Western fantasy of super poor rural isolated people.  Her observations about Americans were spot-on!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun to play. Makes you think without unnecessary road blocks of frustration present in many other similar games. Liked how the hints helped guide, without totally giving it away. Great balance. Also loved the beautiful graphics and interesting way puzzles interacted. Soothing to look at. Keeps one focused enough to forget your everyday worries.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The pace of this app is balanced. The tutorial is helpful without dumbing it down. So far very enjoyable with a variety of activities. Recommended.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is a great move. It's one of the best movies from Adam Sandler!!! My kids watch it over and over. There is something for everyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You should really try this game. Its fun and challenging at the same time.my daughtet and I have had a lot of fun seeing which of us could escape first
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This app is a great way to enhance your photos and share online. I love  this app and use it all the time. I highly recommend it!
B005DJREGQ|3.0|It really seems to be a clone of ABC's Suburgatory but the producers of Awkward decided to increase the risqué factor by having the actors swear (but bleeped it out) and simulated teenage sex scenes. So in the end it looks like they took ABC's Suburgatory and tried to push it towards what you'd see on HBO. Not original but not horrible.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is a blast. The graphics are amazing!!! This is by far my favorite temple run game!!! My kids love  it too.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I tried it out it worked pretty good this just the very beginning.one thing I don't like you gotta type in the web site.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm loving pintrest!!! It's easy to use and is a great way to save all the amazing things I find online. You can organize everything. I use it whenever I am planning a party or girl scout activity. There are so many great ideas!!!! I'm a fan for sure.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is nice game. I especially like the \\"touch\\" feature and the automatic finish. It's a great way to kill time while waiting for something. Any others available?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 6 year old absolutely loves horses. It's easy to use and so much fun. My daughter likes to do the different activities to earn coins to buy her horse items. Very awesome game!!! I would recommend 5 and up!
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Classic western with strong performances by all the actors.  One of Mr. Eastwood's best westerns.  A modernized &#34;Shane&#34; with some interesting twists.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I like how simple it is to use and it helps me stay organized on my different pages. I recommend using this app!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|didn't think that I would enjoy this movie as much as I did.  Tom Cruise's character was more than enjoyable and action was very good!
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I have been listening to ABR for 3 years now, And I love their music! Must get this album!! It has a different style to it.
1454901276|5.0|I've never read a Peter May book before and was unsure what I was getting into.  I thought it had a slow start but soon realized it was leading up to how the island worked when the main character was young.  Really enjoyed some of the funny stories.  It was a well thought out book with a very twisting end.  Can't wait to read the next book.  I think I'm a Peter May fan!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was one of Stephen's best! The suspension see e and the drama were superb. I found myself loving and hating the characters. Lastly, I loved it because it did NOT have the ending I wanted!!!!
B009LDMJBU|5.0|After some ordinary, but good albums, Eros is back with a really great one with a lot of good songs, like we used to know from his early days.
0345529057|5.0|I love this series. Those books are small and light, easy to take. Have a lot of fun reading it.
B003SNKBXW|1.0|Atrocious editing - could not get beyond the MANY mistakes of spelling, punctuation, weird sentence structure to even begin to enjoy the book. What a shame Amazon let this one slip through
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|If you liked season 1 & 2, then you must watch this as well.  Season 4 is the last they will make and if you are this far you are committed until the end.
0679805273|5.0|This book says it.  Like a yearbook.  This is really good reading.  Makes a student think about his /her future.  My daughter got this book while my grandson was in elementary school.  He is having all of his teachers sign it.  Like a yearbook.
B002C949KE|5.0|Great, research supported discussion that gives great insight to the human perspective.  Lots of practical applications!  Very entertaining and easy to read!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|why does every app I buy have the best characters locked? am I right? other than that it's a good game
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Have used this and have not had much of a problem with it. Could be better on pdf files who reading.
0345803507|5.0|Unbelievable author...know I would read others.  Was quite a series of three.  So often felt like I was 'in the book' myself.
B00AEBBA72|4.0|This is a &#34;must have&#34; for spooky story lovers or Halloween afficionados. Depp is Depp -- he does his best to catch the quirks of every character he plays, and Ichabod Crane is a quirky guy! Christina Ricci has matured from Wednesday Addams into a beautiful and talented Katrina Van Tassel. The original short story is enriched well and loaded with the best talents from Miranda Richardson to Michael Gambon and more. Not for those who are weak of stomach; there is some blood, but it's well-balanced with scenes that tap into the fear and tension of the story without the gore.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Producing a movie born of tragedy takes sensitivity and getting your facts right in order to make something good. With this movie, something was made very, very good.  The acting is superb, details are spot on but best of all, you can really FEEL the tragedy that took place. Special effects were life-like and sucked you in (literally) from the moment the tsunami swept the family apart. I held my breath, willing the victims to survive and cried more often than not. You feel for every single person and your heart breaks at the forces that nature can bring about leaving so, so many lives changed forever. Watts & McGregor were at the top of their game but Tom Holland stole the show. A few parts are a tad stomach turning but rightfully so.  I rented this initially but will buy it to watch again and share with family and friends.
