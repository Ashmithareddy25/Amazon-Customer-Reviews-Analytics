B008Y2FRFO|1.0|DO NOT BUY! I think this game is pointless. All you do is drop coins and you lose them fast. And if you want more coins, you have to buy more or stay on the game for hours and hours! IT GETS ADDICTING BUT DONT FALL FOR IT!!!
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Extremely good look at the world of autism/Asperger's .  The narrator is a teen with autism and makes you see what his world is like. Probably most interesting to readers who know someone with an autism spectrum disorder, but a fascinating read because of its unique perspective on the dysfunctional family.<br /><br />I liked it for its orginality and understanding of the human condition in general. It was not really a mystery despite the title, but I couldn't put it down.
B005EVVPUE|5.0|Great nostalgic concerts, at a very reasonable price, and extremely fast shipping.<br />I would have liked it better if the 2 concerts weren't only a day apart, which makes them very similar, with the same set list.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The premise and storyline behind this book is really good and the author is an excellent writer. Too badthen that he has completely missed the true meaning of suffering. This could have been an amazing story but is really just another book on the shelves.

B001VLBDD0|5.0|I ordered this 2-disc DVD, for [[ASIN:B001VLBDD0 Terminator 2: Judgment Day]], because I was replacing our old VHS. According to this amazon page, this 2-disc set has the Theatrical release and the Special Edition Version of T2, both in widescreen.  The 2-DVD set I received had only the Special Edition Version on DVD. The 2nd disc has the Theatrical Release, but it is NOT a DVD. It is to watch on your computer using some fancy application that I don't have. So it didn't work on my computer. I returned the DVD because I thought they sent me the wrong one.<br /><br />[Please note the version of Terminator 2 that I linked above. Amazon has a bad habit of putting a review for one edition/version of a movie on every page of every version/edition. It can be difficult to figure out which version someone is reviewing!]<br /><br />After I sent back the wrong version of the movie, I ordered it a second time, again from this page (as linked above). The second time I received the SAME thing. So WARNING! You cannot watch the Theatrical release on DVD. And the EXTRAS shown on this amazon page are different from the extras actually contained on the 2-disc set they'll send you.<br /><br />That said, I decided to keep the second set, even though I tried to contact the seller, through amazon's contact seller feature, twice to ask what's going on, and they never bothered to reply. Beware of Mighty Silver! There is no customer service there, and they don't care if you got the wrong item. Incidentally, amazon doesn't care, either. They'll give you your money back, but they're not changing the page.<br /><br />Now that my rant is over, I'll review the 2-disc set I received - twice.<br /><br />The first DVD disc has the Special Edition Version of the movie. Your viewing choices are to watch in Dolby 5.1 SurroundSound, Dolby Headphones. You can also watch it with a fantastic Commentary Track, and with either English or Spanish Subtitles.<br /><br />The differences between the Special Edition and the Theatrical Release are that several deleted scenes are added back in. To tell the truth, I like the Theatrical Version better, but maybe that's just because it's a beloved movie in our house.<br />Added scenes that I noticed:<br />1. The T-1000 leaves the scene of the wreckage of the giant tow-truck he used to chase after T (Arnold's Terminator) and John on the motorcycle. New: Firemen are cleaning up the wreckage.<br />2.  In the psychiatric hospital, Sarah is sitting on her bed in her cell. New: Sarah has a dream sequence with Reece seemingly visiting her. (According to the Commentary Track, the idea was to tell some past story from the 1st movie. I think it's open to interpretation whether she had a vision or a dream.)<br />3. In the psychiatric hospital, the doctor has just stopped at Sarah's cell, where she's doing pullups, and he's talking about her with his guests. New: Two guards enter Sarah's room and use truncheons and tazers on her to get her to take her pills. It's a brutal scene.<br />4. T and John have called the foster parents' house, and realize they must be dead. Cut to the T-1000, changing back to a policeman from the shape of the foster-mother (skewering the foster father). New: T-1000 goes into the back yard and kills the dog. He takes it's collar, and sees the name &quot;Max&quot;. He realizes T and John tricked him.<br />5. They have pulled the police car into a closed service station, where T and Sarah sew each other up. New: John asks T if he can learn. T says that he can if they pull a switch in his microprocessor. Sarah opens his head and takes out the chip and is going to destroy it. John stops her. (According to the Commentary, this was deleted for timing reasons, but both Cameron and Wisher really miss it. They love how it shows Sarah's mistrust and confliction with T.)<br />6. T busts the window of an old station wagon to steal it, then they are on the side of a road and Sarah is eating a sandwich in the station wagon. New: In between these two scenes, John takes T to get food at a food trailer and tries to teach him how to smile.<br />7. Traveling South in the station wagon, Sarah asks T about Dyson, and T replies that he has extensive files on him. New: Scene changes to Dyson working at his computers at his gorgeous seaside home. His wife wants him to stop for some family time, but he is too excited, working on a revolutionary microprocessor.<br />8. They stop at Enrique's in the desert to weapon up. New: Sarah tells Enrique they should leave tonight, too, and he responds angrily. In the underground weapons locker that John and T opened, there's a longer conversation between the two.<br />9. In the final scene at the iron works, the T-1000 has just reconstituted himself after the liquid nitrogen freezing. New: As he passes a striped steel barrier to enter the building, he puts his hand on the barrier and his hand and arm turn striped and stick to the bar. (Per the Commentary, this had been the first thing to show that he had been &quot;injured&quot; and wasn't working quite right.)<br /><br />COMMENTARY TRACK:  I thought this was one of the best commentary tracks I've ever listened to, and I've listened to a lot! It was recorded on 2/10/2003 with commenters James Cameron, director and co-writer, and William Wisher, co-writer. This was the first time Cameron had recorded a commentary track for one of his films. They cover everything, from special effects to acting to subtext. Two of my favorite comments:<br /><br />At the very beginning, when the T-1000 comes through from the future and is kneeling naked, Cameron comments: &quot;We did digital winky removal here. Apparently it was not complete ... I remember seeing a bill for digital willy removal. I want that money back!&quot;<br /><br />When someone asks, who is your favorite kick-a$^% female character, my answer is always Linda Hamilton in T2. She is not comic-book and special effects, she is the real thing. In the commentary, Cameron says that Linda didn't just work out, she did weapons training. And, &quot;Linda could really run. Like a panther.&quot;<br /><br />Also, at the beginning, Cameron mentions how when he first approached Arnold Schwarzenegger about T2, Arnold wasn't enthusiatic. He &quot;wasn't at all sure&quot; that it was going to work for him to play the good guy.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br />1. &quot;No Feat But What We Make&quot;. This is a 24 minute short on Terminator 2's &quot;role in the rise of digital special effects&quot;. Comments by James Cameron (T2 writer-director and director of &quot;The Abyss&quot;), Dennis Muren (ILM visual effects supervisor), John Knoll (ILM CG supervisor for &quot;The Abyss&quot; and Co-Creator of Adobe Photoshop), Steve Spaz Williams (ILM animation), Mark A.Z. Dippe' (ILM CG Supervisor), Stan Winston (Special Makeup and Terminator effects), Peter Jackson (director &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). Cameron and Knoll talk about how the water alien psuedopod, in &quot;Abyss&quot;, was a leap of trust in CGI, because nothing like that had ever been done in film. Then, in T2, what Cameron had was a $100 million dollar film dependent on CG, when it had been done only once before in a film and then for only one 9-minute sequence.<br />2. &quot;T2: On the Set&quot;, an 8 minute production shot montage. Interesting stuff, like the model shots of the tank truck, carrying liquid nitrogen, sliding down the street.<br />3. &quot;High Definition - Theatrical Version ROM&quot;. &quot;This disc contains the complete theatrical version of the film in Microsoft Windows Media 9 series, payable in high definition and 5.1 sound exclusively on your PC. The resolution is higher than standard DVD format.&quot;  Didn't work on my computer.<br />4. DVD ROM. &quot;Play this DVD in your computer to access the T2FX Studio and other ROM features powered by Interactual Software.&quot; Didn't work on my computer.<br /><br />ZERO stars for an amazon page that gives false information.<br />ZERO stars for Mighty Silver, incapable of fulfilling your order from the amazon page.<br />FIVE stars for the theatrical release, now if I could just get a DVD of it.<br />FOUR POINT FOUR stars, rounded down to FOUR, for the Special Edition Version of T2 - it's not as tightly constructed as the theatrical release.<br /><br />ADDED LATER:<br />I did get a single-disc DVD of the theatrical release. I don't think I can give you a link to the amazon page, because it is not fulfilled by amazon. Rather you order from individual sellers and pay shipping.

0345803485|5.0|I have not read any erotica before this series. I keep reading all the reviews that say the writing and dialogue is sophomoric. I think it fits with the characters, these are two people in their early and mid twenties. I've also read that the plot is completely unrealistic, did everyone forget that this is fiction? It's fantasy, it's supposed to be outlandish.<br /><br />However, I found the characters personalities to be likable and realistic. She's a smart and naive young girl, and he's a dark brooding young man. The problems they have in their relationship are like any young people starting out, not with the same contexts, but the same underlying principle. Communication issues, her desire to be with him yet keep her freedom, her independent personality refusing to be lavished with gifts... I think it is a perfectly sweet love story.<br /><br />Onto how it saved my marriage. After our two year wedding anniversary my husband was diagnosed with a serious illness. I could have lost him. While I was still trying to figure out how to be a wife, I was thrown into the role of caregiver. For two years I assumed that role, and then found it difficult to change back. Reading this book reminded me of the feelings I had for my husband before we got married.<br /><br />The sex scenes are not gratuitous, but their frequency and sponteneity fit with the mental issues Christian is trying to deal with. And as far as her ease of orgasm goes, not all women are the same. It is completely believable that she would explode at just the touch of the man she loves so much.<br /><br />I didn't read this book as an escape from my real life, perhaps that is why I'm not as critical of it as others are. I would love to have the life painted in it, but I know this is just a novel. Overall, I thought it was a superb mix of young love and passion. A fantastic read.

034580404X|3.0|I bought it to see what all the hype was about. I read it and would not keep to re-read, since I do re-read books. I could have condensed this down to 1 book, but where would the money come from then? I recommend save your money and buy this second hand if you must read it, or borrow from a friend.
174179403X|4.0|This is a review for the 4th edition of the Lonely Planet \\"Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan\\".<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a positive review. To put it in perspective: I have not used the previous editions of this book, or any other travel guides for the region. I travelled all three countries in two weeks, actually using the route (Tbilisi, Baku, Seki, Yerevan, two monasteries, Tbilisi, Kazbegi) suggested by the book for such an endeavor, even if decided independently from the book.<br /><br />The LP proved to be quite useful, in particular when it comes to the maps and information on transportation (departure sites and times). Of course, some timetables change, so if you tend to plan tightly, try to inquire ahead of time. The map material was generally sufficient, though sometimes slightly inaccurate, which may also be caused by the vicious construction activity particularly in Georgia. A separate map for the Kazbegi area would be helpful. It would be nice to have some information on hiking Debed Canyon in Armenia.<br />It is almost essential for information on some sights, as occassionally there is no or very sparse information in English at the actual sight. So if you want to read a little about the history of the place you are looking at, the LP provides some. At this point, I would like to make a suggestion for future editions, though: Some of the sights *do* have information in English, sometimes more elaborate than the LP. If the intention is to keep the book at a reasonable travel size, one could leave out information on the sites that do have their own and include some more info on the sights that don't have a lot for people not knowing the languages of the region. The way things are now, the history sections in the LP are quite brief. The writing style tends to be slightly sarcastic, which seems to be a matter of taste.<br />I would also include a little more information on the languages, in particular the alphabets for Georgian and Armenian, respectively. I printed those out separately, and while I did not have time to learn the Armenian alphabet, I did learn about 60% of the Georgian (the most important letters), which is extremely helpful when reading road signs for locations (often in Georgian only) or menus at non-tourist eateries. (Tip: Print out a few essential words, such as Tbilisi, one, two, three, your name in the original script and transliterated. Learning the letters by memorizing a few common words makes it a lot easier and more fun. Also, you can make the locals happy if you learn a few words such as hello, how are you, my name is ..., and thank you.) For the most important locations, the LP does include the name in Georgian with the description of the place in the book, but I believe it wouldn't hurt to do this with almost all locations.<br /><br />Here are a few more specific issues:<br />The marionette theatre in Tbilisi at the time of writing only has shows on Fri, Sat, and Sun. This is not posted outside the theatre, you need to ask an employee. There seems to be no operational post office in Tbilisi (or Georgia in general). We and multiple other travellers had no luck finding one at the various suggested locations. Train 372 from Yerevan to Tbilisi leaves Yerevan at 15:15 in the summer; the train number may be different as well. There is no overnight train to Tbilisi. Mugam Club in Baku is closed on Monday nights. To get to the main bus terminal in Baku, leave the subway at 20 Yanvar, then take a bus to avtovagzal (about 20 minutes).<br />The exchange rates for Dram (Armenia) and Manat (Azerbaijan) are incorrect.<br /><br />The hike up mount Kazbeg to the glacier takes a little longer than the LP seems to suggest. We left Gergeti at 10 am, spent about 30 minutes at the monastery, and then climbed the mountain with essentially no breaks. We had very little to carry and overtook almost all other hikers, which were, without exception, multiple day hikers trying to climb past the glacier. Yet, at3:50 pm, being within 500m of the glacier, we decided to turn back without having reached it, in fear it might get dark before we hit the main road again. I estimate it to be a good 1h 45m - 2h from the rest point at 2960m until you reach the glacier. In total, we hiked for 9h 45m, including a few 5 minute breaks, but did not make it. Be aware and start at 8 am. Bring water. Note: We are in our early 30's and in decent shape, I run 8 miles a week, my friend swims 2 or 3 km a week, both at a decent pace.<br /><br />One final note: I also bought the 'International Travel Maps' map \\"Azerbaijan & Armenia\\" [[ASIN:1553411056 Azerbaijan & Armenia 1:560,000 including inset of BAku and Yerevan]], which also includes a good portion of Georgia (except Kazbegi). I cannot recommend this map. The transliteration of names into English is quite bad, to the point where you cannot recognize them sometimes, and names in the original scripts are not included. Further, some towns and villages are shown on the map that don't seem to exist, while existing ones are excluded. In total, I found the small maps within the LP a lot more helpful than this map. The best maps at various scales are available from Geoland (in Tbilisi and online: geoland.ge).<br /><br />Addendum 01/26/13: We experienced very little corruption or attempts at double-crossing. The occasional taxi driver may claim that you agreed with him on a price of 50 Manat or Lari instead of the 15 you clearly remember, but in the two cases we experienced this, we firmly repeated the originally agreed upon price once or twice and the attempts were stopped (one of the taxi drivers even made a slightly embarrassed face right away). One thing happened, however, in Baku: When we descended the steps from the monument for WW2 as well as the war in 1992 at dusk, we were approached by two men who claimed to be police and flashed some kind of ID in front of our faces. They claimed to have seen us kissing on top of the stairs, close to the memorial and a mosque which is also located up there, and said this was a serious impermissible act. My friend and I have never exchanged a kiss in the 12 years that we have known each other. They proceeded to threaten us with taking us to the \\"police station\\". We kept stating that we did not kiss and were willing to accompany them to the police station to make a statement. Eventually, they left us with a warning and vanished.<br />We are fairly certain that these gentlemen were interested in obtaining money from us in exchange for not taking us to the police station. We have experienced similar situation several times in formerly Soviet occupied countries and can only recommend showing the same readiness to be taking to \\"the authorities\\" to other travelers.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was glad the book was allowed to be released as I am a retired Army veteran and have many friends in special operations units. The hype about \\"Classified Information\\" being released is just that, Hype. Everything in the book is publicly accessible information.I wanted to hear a no spin version of the operation and the author delivered it in great fashion. No release of names, no release of secrets etc. The book is well written and interesting. I highly recommend it, especially for non military people so they may get a small look into the lives of those who put their lives on the line for us every day.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This was such a great read. Its been quite a while since I have been so entertained by the wit of the main character. I have literally laughed out load several times over the banter that comes out of Pias mouth. The secondary characters are just as captivating, and I look forward to reading about them as well. If you are not sure if you want to get this book, then I am here to say do it! It is a breath of fresh air from the norm. Enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The most exotic and erotic love story ever.  The characters come alive to each other and the reader.  I couldn't put it down.  In fact I reread the trilogy twice to review the nuances.  Dialogue and character development are the best.

Can't believe that Disney would pull out the most beautiful song of the film, which also guts the emotion right out of a key point in the story. A moron move on someone's part, and, thanks to the earlier reviewer of the original 2005 DVD release blowing the whistle on this, I'm sure it cost them thousands of sales, rightly so. Disney - please fix this and stop reconstructing your own classics!

B003R0MF1W|5.0|Stumbled across The Mentalist a few months ago and am addicted! Love the whole show! I agree with the other reviews- one of the best seasons. One of my favorite things about The Mentalist is the basic \\"cleanliness\\" of it, in comparison to quite a few other crime shows out currently. I don't handle the gore and dirty crime very well- which is what draws me to this show. I love this season of The Mentalist the best so far out of the three (as you can tell). I don't want to reveal too much, but there seem to be fewer episodes with Red John where I had to turn my head from the TV. You will want to start when you have a free weekend. So hard to turn it off! Can't wait for season 4 after this!

And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny! What we think we become.\\"<br />- Margaret Thatcher<br /><br />No worries with this one, Maggie.  This film was made without thought or character and is destined to become one of the lousiest biops in history.<br /><br />I was anticipating a powerful film about a powerful woman and ended up with looney Aunt Tilley over tea and toast.  The filmmakers took special delight in melting The Iron Lady into a pile of mush.  It's hard to come to any conclusion about Margaret the woman and politician when she's staring into space talking to a wall.  Politicians are often quite nutty, but did they have to turn this into another \\"A Beautiful Mind?\\"<br /><br />The IRA may have been blowing-up car parks and hotels, but the biggest bombs come out of Hollywood.<br /><br />I'd pass on this cracked teapot, luv.

B008LZHA3G|1.0|Bob Dylan can still write interesting, if somewhat indecipherable, lyrics.  However, he should have given up on singing before he recorded this album.  Ordinarily I listen to the Amazon previews before buying any music, but no preview was available for this album.  The best way I can describe his voice is that he sounds like a Tom Waits/Satchmo hybrid -- with a very bad cold. Please, don't waste your money on this one.
145162607X|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter is probably my favorite of the Cousin's War series to date. It is written from the perspective of Anne Neville and gives yet another interesting point of view from this volatile period of history. One of the things I enjoy so much about Philippa Gregory's novels is that she somehow manages to turn what could have been tedious political maneuvering into exciting intrigue that keeps me riveted from the first moment. I am not a historian so I have no idea how historically accurate this series is, but I can say that they certainly paint a vivid picture of what living in that time period might have been like. From the court customs, to the fashions, the scandals, the betrayals, and executions, each aspect was brought to life in such a way that I almost felt myself a part of the story.<br /><br />Each character was shown from Anne's point of view so was colored by her own biases and was a bit different from how these same characters were presented in the previous books. The story was focused so much on Anne, and to a lesser extent Isabelle, that many of the other characters, at times, felt a bit flat. Anne's relationship with her sister Isabelle was reminiscent of the rivalry between Mary and Anne Boleyn in Gregory's popular novel, The Other Boleyn Girl. While there was always that undercurrent of love, each sister didn't hesitate to betray the other in order to further their own cause or that of their husband. I didn't find either sister to be particularly likable, and sometimes thought that their personalities were a bit contradictory. For example, Anne seems to have grown from a bright, practical, inquisitive child into a fearful woman ruled by her superstitions and unwilling to even consider any point of view than that which painted her family in a positive light. I guess that the struggles she was faced with could account for such a drastic change in character but it was still a bit odd.<br /><br />One of the things about this series, including The Kingmaker's Daughter that I was not a fan of was the witchery and spells and magic that were included. However, after discussing this with a friend who is also reading the series, I can see how it may have been presented this way because of how the players so wholeheartedly believed that witchcraft was responsible for many things such as storms, sicknesses, and death. Curses were taken very seriously in 1400's England and so reading from Anne's perspective, I can see why an unexpected storm would be believed to have been whistled up by the witch who hated her. I guess this was a realistic danger in this time period, that any misfortune could be laid at the feet of someone believed to be a witch. This would have been a very effective way to discredit a powerful woman, as it seems to have done in the case of Elizabeth Woodville.<br /><br />While The Kingmaker's Daughter can be read on it's own as a stand-alone novel, I would definitely recommend reading the entire series in order simply because it is a beautifully written thrilling story. Despite the fact that I found many of the characters to be a bit flat, the fast paced plot was such that I found the book hard to put down. I know many people, after reading Philippa Gregory's historical fiction have been inspired to find out more about this violent era and these fascinating people. I would absolutely recommend this and any and every other book written by this author to any fans of this genre.ng The Kingmaker's Daughter that I was not a fan of was the witchery and spells and magic that were included. However, after discussing this with a friend who is also reading the series, I can see how it may have been presented this way because of how the players so wholeheartedly believed that witchcraft was responsible for many things such as storms, sicknesses, and death.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|I grabbed this book for my Kindle on a whim, not knowing what to expect. I'm not going to get into an extensive review, but I can honestly say Cloud Atlas is one of the most unique, intriguing books I've read in years. There are so many layers to explore, rendering it worthy of multiple reads. Each story contained has it's own charm, it's own message, yet the themes throughout build and play off one another. David Mitchell is incredible. Cloud Atlas is incredible. Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B008M34INW|4.0|One of the best movies Mel Gibson has been a part of over the past few years.  The Gringo is an action-packed, shootem-up, cussem-out movie with some unexpected, but great, twist and turns.  Mel is very believable as a down on his luck criminal who is trying to retrieve his stolen goods, ironically, he originally stole the object.  Make the time to watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B004W4N55C|1.0|stops working in ICS when you try to type in search bar.  Hasn't been updated to latest version in months.  Buy from play store if you want updated version that works in ICS.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Ihaven't wtched it yet.  I thought I ordered one copy of the Seinfeld series 1-6.  I have received multiple copies.  Also, I ordered the Blu ray version of Les Miserables,and I don't have Blu ray.  I would like to return all of there items.  Can you help?
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE pinterest! It's very addictive and you end up crazy hungry and wanting to cook everything and start new around the house projects, BUT it's still awesome! Get this app - you won't be sorry. =)
B00026ZG10|5.0|Came to me as the way it was described to me. You guys did a job keep it up and I'll purchase from you again.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|i liked the game when i first started playing - it is different<br />However it was not different enough for me to keep it on my phone...<br />sorry- i had to delete it to make room for other stuff
B005S9EJ14|2.0|I anticipated this movie very much.  With all the great actors, I couldn't wait to see it.  Turns out I was very disappointed.  I found this movie to be very dull and boring. I was hoping it would be funny, which is wasn't.  I am surprised so many people loved it and that it got such good reviews.
0756405890|5.0|There are plenty of opposing views but I've noticed the people who don't like this book or cant seem to read it have little patience or attention span and NO imagination. I like that it laid down the foundation for a whole CHRONICLE series. And the second book was even better. The characters have depth but there is room to grow on them and learn about them seeing as the story is currently from only one point of view. I like that its set up like an advanced game of chess and when reading between the lines and from a philosophical point of view by comparing it do modern today there are lots of similarities. The author has a good thing started and though he does have room to improve. Im looking forward to the whole series.
B000002NJS|5.0|Like her album 'Like a Prayer', 'Ray of Light' is a very deep and emotional album.<br /><br />'Drowned World/Substitute for Love' expresses ones feelings about their life in the past.<br /><br />'Swim' is about repenting of ones sins and accepting the Lord back into your life, with the ocean being the metaphor.<br /><br />The title track speaks of how life can be very chatoic and overwhelming, but you shouldn't let it get to you and stay strong.<br /><br />'Candy Perfume Girl' is about finding someone who is understanding and loves you in many ways.<br /><br />'Skin' is about finding a connection with the Lord and trying to find the meaning of it and other things you say or do.<br /><br />'Nothing Really Matters' is about when one's life is changed after someone enters their life.<br /><br />'Sky Fits Heaven' makes reference to the Bible and why no one shouldn't take anything we do for granted.<br /><br />'Shanti/Ashtangi' has a very Japenese influenece and speaks about defending ones Lord and savoir.<br /><br />'Frozen', the smash hit from the album, like 'Swim' is about the Lord, and asking him back into your life.<br /><br />'Power of Good-Bye, The' is about letting go of someone very dear to you, even if they don't want that.<br /><br />'To Have and Not to Hold' about wanting someone, but in the end not wanting them in your life afterwards.<br /><br />'Little Star' is about telling a new born about where they come from and why they are so important and means so much.<br /><br />'Mer Girl' is about running away and trying to find yourself and the Lord.<br /><br />All the songs on the album speak about Madonna's feeling after Lourdes birth, her views of life, and the Lord.<br /><br />Like 'Like a Prayer', this album is very auto-biographical and a masterpiece, which it is.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Another AMAZING works by Rush!! You could try to pick a bad song, but good luck with that. Again I say \\"RUSH RULES!\\" :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|have had no problems on my kindle fire with this app.  lots of fun awsome ideas for anything you can think of your interested in!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Loved this book! It was a fast page turner filled with suspense. Interesting characters and a surprise ending. I recommend this book to YA as well as adults. If fact I have chosen it for my sci-fi book club and can't wait for them to read it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|how can one NOT love this game...I remember losing BIG money for a kid back in my days playing this at carnivals...
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|This app is great for what it is.it is a free teaser to get you to buy the full version.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|After finishing about 38% of this compendium I became rather bored with it. There were many typos and the stories just began to seem redundant to me. No offense to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br />If you're a die hard Sherlock Holmes fan then you will probably enjoy it, but if you're not then you would be best served by purchasing just his best known works.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's so simple and so addictive! if you're lookingfor a little simple, stress-free game, this is great! my family and I can sit forever at these little games at the fair. good fun.
B000TDGGVU|3.0|I do have a better understanding on how we make a choice.<br />The difficulty to choose is ,ironically, due to array of choices.<br /><br />Worth to re-read again..<br /><br />Eric
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I watched this over a month ago, and my way of life has changed completely.  I cannot purchase commercially produced meat, eggs, or milk -- now I know the high cost of misery and suffering (both human and animal) involved in it's production. I lent this movie to my friends and family, and they were also sobered by it's message.  This is a life changing film that everyone who eats needs to see.  Americans have closed their eyes for far too long to what goes into the food they eat.<br /><br />Watch this film, wake up, and take responsibility for the part you play in this horrifying drama.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it would be alot better with world wide servers pl0x<br />other then that itz a awesome game the last two updates were good ones plz get fird from flint and steel with fire spread and also get armour
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|All you do is drop coins. Nothing extra. No fun stuff. Nothing even remotely entertaining about it. I thought there must be something to it with all the great reviews. Nope.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|While training is important, the information flow can be repeated.<br />Building the climax, in my opinion, could have taken on a better approach.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was very exciting and full of suspense. I would watch it over and over again. A true view of pure love for a sister and a blooming love still unknown.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved Wool and stayed up way too late nights finishing it. It inspired me to publish the first part of my own series Through the Veil: Hole in the Stone[[ASIN:B009DU8LZO Hole in the Stone (Through the Veil)]]I want to thank you for both an immensely enjoyable book and for planting the seed that I could follow suite.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the Oregon settler but it would be cooler if you could go in the building and that you lived in that town and you would have to get a job and a home and family! That would be the best game in the world to play!!! I would play it all the time!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addicting and keeps me busy for quite awhile! I highly recommend this game! :) Super Fun!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Aww man, this app is perfect! it has all the things I like: a simple notification icon, customizable widgets, and all kinds of information about the amount of time left. Definitely 5 stars.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It works well and I had no problems with. I like the fact you change the color of the Battery HD so it can look different for each person when you have multiple users for one tab.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I heard of this game from some friends of mine, and decided to try it. It's a great carnival game. I also love how it limits you to coins so you don't rush through the game. Definitely a must.
B00168OIOE|5.0|By far this is one of the most laughing scary movies from Pixar. Lots of imagination in every adventure. Price have gone up a little due to be out of print, (A practice by Disney's deceptive marketing strategies to keep their prices high). But good news to all fans: The movie will be re-released in 3D on theaters on December 2012, which means that soon it could be available on blu ray again for a more accessible price. Good Luck Fans!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. I am seriously addicted! no problems with the app on my kindle fire! I love that I can see my own boards and others' boards.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I have not quite finished reading this book yet, but I must say quite honestly that it is not a book that I am enjoying reading, I find it extremely weard and certainly not enjyable, I have almost finished it and will certainly finish it, but I won't be reading another one, but of course that is only my opinion.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting account of what the Navy Seals do. This is a group of brave souls who help to keep our country safe by putting themselves in harms way. The fear I felt for them during these encounters was very real.  I realize there has been some controversy over this book, however, I enjoyed learning about that very significant day in America's history.  Kudos to the Seals.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Great music from our sister across the pond. Hope she keeps up the good work and I am looking forward to her next album.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Excellent action/sci-fi film.  A whole new take on the art of war.  But if you don't watch it all, including all the credits at the end, you'll miss something.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great humanized look at those who completed one of the most important missions of our generation.  The politicized fuss about the book is unnecessary as no real \\"secrets\\" were revealed.  Anything mentioned in this book has been long available in the numerous other SEAL narratives out there or printed by the press themselves.  This is just a nice, one-SEAL's-experience account of a fraction of the sacrifices, training, and details that go into a mission of this magnitude and the everyday life of a SEAL.  Thank you, sir, for your service.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! It is addicting to scroll through and look at new craft ideas, home findings and yummy looking recipes!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a great read. A gripping story that I could barely put down. Best six bucks I ever spent. Hope there will be more in this series yet to come...
B008XG1X18|4.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! I can finally have all my wants, ideas, inspirations, etc. in one place rather than bookmarking on each device. My only problem is that it tends to freeze up and need to be forced closed on my Kindle Fire.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book is an interesting read providing some detals about a historiical event. The author, though, is obviously a much better soldier than writer, in my opinon.
B000N2HCM4|1.0|Note the absence of stars marked.  It takes a tremendous ego to decide to write an autobiography at age 30, particularly when your employer thinks you are writing something related to your position.  I read this in an effort to find more about the President and it is obvious to me why it didn't sell until he was campaigning in 2008.  I made myself read a chapter every evening in order to finish.  It is boring.  The author is clearly caught up with his own importance and spends an inordinate amount of time describing himself and things that did not in any way relate to the story.  Every move in Kenya is dragged on and on including his relieving himself and taking a shower.  He may be President and may be able to charm folks with his \\"folksy\\" speeches, but as a writer?  Not even!  The only thing I gleaned from the book is that he is anything other than the Obama he projects.  The important part is, he didn't even know his father!  A waste of good reading time that could have been spent on an author who isn't in love with themselves.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Denzel Washington deftly captures the incendiary spirit of the civil rights leader who made many white Americans appreciate the proposed non-violent philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King more than they otherwise might have.<br /> Under Spike Lee's direction, this 1992 biopic gives audiences a formidable visual of the autobiography of Malcolm X as it was told to Alex Haley (who passed away the year of this film's release) circa 1964.<br />The story begins with Malcolm's firey and slamming indictment of whites, and his narration of the troubling events of his early life, reflective of the impact of Jim Crow laws on him, his family, and nonwhites at large.<br /> His mother, Louise(Lonette McKee), a Grenadian, the product of a rape of her black mother by a white Englishman, is institutionalized after Malcolm's father, the Reverend Earl Little(Tommy Hollis)is murdered by white supremacists,  and young Malcolm and his siblings farmed out to various places under the supervision of a social worker named Miss Dunne(Karen Allen).<br />  After time at a school where he, as the only black child, is viewed as a mascot, and told he should only aspire to life as a manual laborer,Malcolm graduates to being a hard-core criminal on the streets of Boston, working as a pimp and hustler known as Dakota Red. His cohorts include a fellow hustler played by DelRoy Lindo, and Spike Lee himself appears as another cohort, Shorty. Kate Vernon plays Sophia, Malcolm's white, and married love interest.<br />  After an arrest and indictement for theft and burglary, the judge (William Kunstler) sentences Malcolm to nearly a decade in prison, where his inmate Baines, encourages him to read more,and while there is some dispute about his having done this in reality, introduces Malcom to the Islamic faith.<br /> Due to Baines'instruction of the history of the African people, Malcolm begins to challenge the prison Chaplain Gill's(Christopher Plummer) view of Jesus as a white man.<br /> After writing to the founder of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammed (the late Al Freeman, a civil rights worker in his own right), the still-incarcerated Malcolm  claims to have a vision of him. After his release, he goes to see him, and under his tuteledge, he becomes a member of the NOI, preaching, and reaching African Americans in the seedy  areas to which Jim Crow relegates them, or outside white churches where they stand outside and wait to be offered jobs as maids and butlers to whites, telling them that they can do and be better.<br />  In the meantime, he meets and marries a nursing student named Betty(Angela Bassett), and they raise two daughters.<br />  One dramatic confrontation  by  the NOI to see justice done on behalf of a wrongfully treated African American leaves quite an impression on an NYC police officer(Peter Boyle).<br /> A falling out with Elijah Muhammad occurs when Malcolm discovers that the man he had revered so blindly fathered children out of wedlock with more than one woman.<br /> CIA agents watch Malcolm closely due to his civil rights activism. A pilgrimage to Mecca where he encounters and worships Allah with followers of all races compels him to modify his views of whites. But the breach  with the NOI will eventually prove fatal.<br />  The blood of this martyr, however, will spawn greater things for future generations.Another civil rights activist, Ossie Davis reiterates the beautifully profound and touching eulogy he initially delivered for Malcolm X back in 1965 for this film.<br /> Steve White plays Brother Johnson, Ernest Lee Thomas is Malcom's good friend, Sidney, Jean Claude Lamarre is Benjamin 2X, Wendell Pierce plays Ben Thomas, Al Sharpton appears a s a street preacher, David Patrick Kelly plays Mr. Ostrowski, Michael Imperioli plays a reporter, Beatrice Wink plays an elderly lady who encourages Malcolm, and Mary Alice and Nelson Mandela remind the world of how Malcolm X's legacy continues to inspire.<br /> Two decades after this film's initial release, it is not hard to contemplate the idea of El Hajj Malik El-Shabazz smiling down upon the fruits of his struggles.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|...and just accept that The Killers change their sound drastically album to album.<br />Personally I love their old albums and although Battle Born is really, really different I like it a lot as well.<br />Brandon Flower's voice is majestic as ever and I dig the new instrumental sounds too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i love this app it is really useful. i would totally recomend this app. it shows you how much charge you have in different ways
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie kept my interest all throughout. I found myself getting attached to the main characters; and rooting them on, hoping they survive their ordeal.
0812550757|2.0|I loved Enders Game, and this book won just as many awards ... But, it just doesn't hold up.<br /><br />First, the idea of Ender, the most famous guy in the galaxy being able to hide his identity is ridiculous.  Don't they have images and voice recordings?<br /><br />Second, the whole guilt laden, crucify oneself aspect spoke to a serious neurosis, not something to be celebrated.  The friggin queen bugs were in his head!  And, they wanted Ender to plant their spawn out in space where it could be the root to the force that wipes out humanity.  He is carrying this hideous thing around with him and talking to it like Harvey the Rabbit.<br /><br />Sorry, I just could not make the leap.
0307155102|5.0|This was my children's favorite book when they were toddler/preschoolers.  I am now buying it for all my grandchildren.  Pages for everyone.  Trucks, farm, zoo, colors, seasons, babies all labeled individually with their name.  When they are at the stage where they are repeating the name for everything this is what they liked to look through.  Each child had their favorite page that we had to stop and study.
B0068AWO00|3.0|I found the movie to be slow and scenery got kinda repetitive( in the deserted development ) I liked the scene where Jerry asks Charlie for a couple of beers for him and a hot chick. Charlie kinda tests him in an interesting way.....Fright Night 1@2 the old version was fun to watch and scary ay the same time...the new version twasnt worth the 15 dollors I paid for it at Amazon, com
B0062NAVXA|4.0|Courageous is a powerful movie. It has action and plenty of tender moments. The acting at times is a little weak. Many of these folks are not professional actors. By the time you finish watching the movie, that aspect is easily overlooked by the powerful message. This movie urges everyone to take necessary action. There is a strong religious message, not encouraging religion, but rather encouraging fathers to take their role seriously in the family.<br /><br />As the writer of a book coming out in 2013 about the breakdown in the family unit, I've seen the studies that show the negative impact of divorce and high conflict family relationships. This movie puts emphasis on the role of the father in the family. Anyone man can be a dad, but it takes courage to be a good father. This movie is powerful enough to move men to be better fathers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent mental Nautilus! This game is worth the download and then some!!! Kind of easy though! Looking toward to a variation! THANKS!
B00846REIS|5.0|I am  wanting for the next book to come out. I was on edge throughout the whole book not wanting it to end.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This is a real fun game that every age will enjoy - from 5 to 80!  Kids will probably find it a bit challenging after a few screens though...  It forces one to analyze the situation BEFORE actually starting the game, to try to figure out the way to save the bugs from the spider(s).  I would recommend it for sure!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Wow! I couldn't stop watching this well-written, well cast, fabulously performed movie. From the opening moments until the credits rolled, it blew my eyes out. McAvoy is obviously the best known actor to Americans, but the entire cast was STUNNING. Even those with small parts were entirely believable and added their piece to making this one incredible mini series. There was only one tiny misstep and that is why did the police shoot to kill the hitman when they could have taken him down without that? Ah, I guess the answer is that you wouldn't have had such a great time unraveling \\"who dunnit!\\"
B006CED4W4|5.0|Kurt Sutter and company bring us another reason to love this show. If you haven't been hooked by the Sons yet, you need to get off your couch and walk into a Harley dealership and sit on a bike. Then once you have felt the power, watch the show again, and you will see the power of this amazing series. Thank you Kurt for bringing us yet again into a world unseen by most of the American public.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It was a really good movie. I would recommend it to others and I would watch it again. Rent it now!
B001E6GO6I|5.0|This is a beautiful set (13 volumes) of the complete works of William Shakespeare.  The books themselves are in pristine condition and are illustrated with steel engravings.  The text is very readable, although they look as though they have never been read.  Color is a deep burgundy or maroon.  They are contained in a matching box (9.5\\" wide, 5.5\\" high and 4.25\\" deep).  The box is in good shape, yet shows some signs of wear at the corners due to age.  The lid has become separated from the box, but it is a clean break and can be easily glued, taped, etc.  All in all this is a rare and beautiful collector's set.  I can't seem to find a publishing date, but I have owned them for 45 years and they were old and in the same condition they are now when I bought them in an antique book store.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|I have owned this movie for many years. If you are put off by the title or the cover of the movie please don't be. This movie is FUNNY not scary. Looks can be decieving in the case of this movie. I would reccomend it for a movie night at home.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN ANY OF MICHAEL CONNELLY BOOKS.  THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST ONES.  I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  LOVE HARRY BOSCH.
0199571120|5.0|This dictionary has so many extra features such as information about people and places. It has the integrity of the Oxford Dictionaries.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Very happy with this purchase! We did end up with the British version instead of American somehow. But that just makes it totes awesome-er!
B00846REIS|3.0|If you haven't read 50 Shades, this book is very good. However, if you have read 50 Shades, you will be groaning and rolling your eyes at the similarities and blatent copying.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I am enjoying this app but only at times when I find I have patience. This app force close A LOT. So until that issue gets fixed, my pinteresting will be limited.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|The movie is GREAT! I love the remake & couldn't wait to see the original. It's nothing like the remake - different plot & everything but i LOVE it!<br /><br />it arrived just as described and came super fast! would buy from seller again
B0011BBA2E|4.0|I love this series, no its not Star Trek or as good as a lot of other stuff out there, but a little gem of a find in itself.  With occasional nods to other sci-fi programs, it is a show that is fun and a great rainy day watch.
B0031RSBU0|5.0|Fantastic book, very intriguing detective work with a fantastic translation.  Can't stop reading his books!  Highly recommended for people who enjoy a great story without the mass production feel. Love the storyline with his family which is not mushy at all.  Totally enjoyable read for both men and women
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wonder what teens really feel about society that makes this book so popular. Televising teens killing each other for entertainment?  A society so bizarre that the powerful can do this? Twisted enough to think its “right“ and entertaining?
B0090P98Z4|5.0|good I like the game the only thing is that so far I. an only buy things with glue coins
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is great! I think it is much better than actually going to the website.  the only thing I don't like, is that sometimes it wont let me get onto it because it says,&quot;error in opening&quot;
B006LSZECO|4.0|Ms. Flynn showed us just how flawed the characters Nick and Amy were, and how they really deserved each other.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just as good as the first!  A fast read, slightly predictable, but you can't put it down! Onto the last for this happy reader.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A young Irish girl arrives on a VIrginia plantation after her parents die and the ship captain/plantation owner seems to look on her as his own.  She finds love in \\"the Kitchen House\\" and naively grows up unaware of color.  A woman of the early 19th Century with little power over her own choices, she survives, but not before she sees the ugliness of slavery, hate, and misogony.  It is a page turner or on a Kindle, a button pusher.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved these books.  These are things I should have tried earlier in my life.  My sex life was very bland, sorry to say!
B009329Y30|2.0|Cheesy, Hallmark Network movie...predictable throughout. Ok, if mindless entertainment is what you are seeking. Enough said, however, this review requires 20-words.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Its a great book and I liked it alot. I read the first part (Before chapter one) and then jumped to Day one? because mark Owen go through a lot of training which I dont really care about, because he's very carfull not to teach anyone anything from seal training. He does go into great detail to try and show you how they live and work. As an ex military I could really relate to this book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took almost 200 pages before the book really caught my attention and I was engrossed in it. Then it took a turn I didn't like and I hated the ending.  I have to finish a book once I start it, this one wound up being kind of painful.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|At first this game was pretty enjoyable. Then, I started having a lot of problems with freezing. Worse than that was that the puzzles started repeating before I was half way through the game.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|One of those movies that you know you will watch a second time so that you get all the extra layers in.  Acting so-so.  Great flick.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire and I love the the fact that it tells you exactly how much battery life you have available.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I love the large numbers,  I have used ot often great calculator.  I would. recommend this to anyone looking for this kind of app
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Gameplay is simple, there's only one control (touch the screen to go up), but the levels are different each time, and there are so many items to collect and missions to complete that it never gets old.
B008OOYALE|5.0|O.M.G YOU GOT TO HAVE THIS GAME! THE DRAGONS ARE SO CUTE YOU JUST WANT TO EAT THEM UP! ITS EASY TO PLAY AND VERY FUN TOO!
B000089RV6|5.0|Great sound,  especially if its cranked. Guitar oriented sound and that voice well, familiar screech! Lol Classic rock but at times I strangely thought of Ironman/Tony Stark.
B004S5C91Q|3.0|A friend read this on her Kindle and loved it so much she had to buy the hard copy for her bookshelf, so I was expecting big things. Yes this book was riveting. It had me guessing and theorising about how she came to be in the room but the ending left me a little disappointed. Perhaps there will be a sequel???
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! to me its smoother than on the desktop!! it is really a great app!!! I highly recommend!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Its very interesting to read about the day to day challenges our heros go through so that we can sleep safely in our beds at night here at home. The Navy Seals courage, dedication and sacrifice should be shouted from the moutain tops by the president instead<br /> of being bullied and sued for being  couragous enough to tell the truth
1594744769|5.0|Since I didnt read it...Ill only admit the shipping was quick & the reciever of book happily accepted book. Lets hope, I don't turn into one of those people who give out books as gifts all the time. Why doesnt anyone want a frisbee or a board game anymore? I'm dying for Connect Four, original version...just saying. Lol
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the two disc Dvd!! The graphics were great and so was the sound!! On the ultra violet copy, it cut. Out and became pixelated once or twice. That is really my only complaint..... I wish that if you bought the two disc dvd and bonus features that you could access those as well on your kindle, computer, etc...
B0090EHVMC|5.0|its definately worth seeing very funny and good for the family and the quality of the video on amazon instant video was very awesome.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have not had an problems,and it works so much better on my kindle then on my phone.  I use this app for looking up recipes that I have been when I need them quick.  So all in all works great.  I love it..
B000000OQF|3.0|For any fan of Gnr who wants to realize how old we all have become and truly,  how dated this cd sounds. There's songs, I havent heard in awhile and it was cool to hear em again.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't stop playing it! Its my new favorite game! Next to computer games this game is what I look forward to at night, is that a bad thing? Not in the least bit!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this website and it has tons of awesome idea's.  Sometimes this app will not open for me and I have to exit out and try again.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I love the feel and the clasp that really holds the kindle. It is hard to charge because of the proper way it is meant to be held inside. Besides that I'm cool.
B003HTPHSQ|1.0|Take musicians making great blues tunes, now add Cyndi Laupers voice on top of it. Clearly you see where it goes wrong? I wanted to love this cd but after playing it over & over...I like the music, but not with her on vocals.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It works great on my G2 and on my Kindle Fire. The smb networking is a bit hard to get going, but it works.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am completely in love with this book!! Although there are several similarities to Fifty Shades (which I have also read and love) this is a very different book. It serves up the same \\"adult\\" fun but with a whole lot less \\"tie me up\\" action. I have to say I love the main female character, Eva, much more because she is believable. She's a twenty-something that actually has some sexual experience (which I am pretty sure is the norm these days). It makes their physical encounters feel much less awkward and a whole lot more fun. We have a couple with some serious issues deeply rooted in their past experiences but are determined to overcome them in order to be together. Can't wait to see how this story evolves!!! Hurry up October so we can find out!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very good book. I was expecting something totally different, but I really like it. Very recommendable. It keep you hooked until you finish it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is really good if you need to have multiple alarms set for several different days because it shows which ones are active and when they're going to go off. What's really good for me and probably many others, there is an option to repeat an alarm. If you need to go to work or school in my case, just click on the weekdays. You no longer need to worry about turning on your alarm each night beforehand. I would suggest this to anyone because its really good for anyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome series!  Have read them all 2x. I couldn't put the books down.  I downloaded them onto my Droid X which worked out great.  the screen was just the right size and the books downloaded almost instantly from Amazon.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wonderful twists and turns and so beautifully written. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could start the next book. I am reading book 5 now and I will be very sad if there isn't a book 6 somewhere down the line.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love the game tons of fun reminds me of the game at kids castle and Chickie cheese. brings back really good memories.  def a five star from me.
0425152251|4.0|As expected a good book I needed for A levels.Not easy to buy locally.It helped my study&gave me better in sight.
034580404X|5.0|Could not put down those books and hated to see the end to the most wonderful love story I have ever read. Still keep thinking about Christan and Ana. Love it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|cute and fun for all ages. great for passing time or while watching a move that your not in to whither the spouse.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|This app deserves more 5 star reviews.  It offers a HUGE variety of jazz 'stations', and the audio quality is EXCELLENT.  If you like listening to jazz, any kind of jazz, you'll LOVE this app.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Very exciting! I find it very hard to put down, sometimes to the point that all my other work suffers... very well worth it though.<br />Mr. George R.R. Martin has done an excellent job so far and I can't wait to read book four!
0525953728|4.0|Four stars, not five.  I was spoiled by reading Marcius Luttrell's \\"Lone Survivor\\" first - which was much better written.  The first half of \\"No Easy Day\\" was a colorless recounting of training and previous missions. Ownen's story was told in a clinical \\"just the facts\\" way; as a reader, I wanted to know more of what he was thinking and feeling.<br /><br />The second half - the account of the Bin Laden mission was engaging and informative.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rarely find a book I don't want to put down. Catching Fire kept my fire for reading stoked. I recommend following up the Hunger Games with the second book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent read.  A page turner.  Hated the ending.<br />It was improbable and dissappointing from a relationship point of view as well as for a 2012<br />criminal forensic investigation.
B000001F29|5.0|I finally got around to picking this up after over 20 years of missing it.<br /><br />Hypnotic, mesmerizing, eclectic, emotive and most of all: fun.  I have extremely fond memories of hearing this excellent collaboration on my dad's amazing hi-fi system when I was still living at home.  I was blown away.  Can't believe it's taken me this long to get a copy.  My memory wasn't wrong, and though I don't have quite the high end equipment my dad did, it's still every bit as enjoyable now as it was then.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its kind of a stupid game but its addicting so there for it is amazing i would deffinately play more games like this
B004MC8CA2|5.0|several Bible versions and translations to choose from. easy to use. total and complete bibles with help available to interpret words and verses.
B005PR44XC|4.0|Michael Lewis's tour of GFC basket cases offers a vivid portrait of contrasting cultures and his way of linking these cultural traits with different countries' approach to the GFC and the debt boom that preceded it is highly suggestive and hugely amusing. However, I was left feeling that such arguments need a great deal more analysis than the anecdotal treatment they get in this book. It's a terrific conversation starter, but it could as easily start fights as national stereotypes get a good workout.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|got the book for kindle and could not put it away.  Very good book for adults  so good I got all 3 and loved them all  not for everyone but it was good for me
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I know that a lot of people who've heard about Fifty Shades heard that it was full of sex and pretty much porn for housewives..it's true for the most part, but it's not all about sex. I like the book because the author made Christian Grey deeper than some sex-crazed CEO, and Anastasia Steele more than some young naive college girl. They both had tons of obstacles to break through, and you'll be seeing that pretty much throughout the trilogy. But it's something you have to read for yourself.Yes there are parts of the book that make you think it's a little far fetched, but this book is based on fantasy - that's why we women love it so much! Long story short: there's more to the book than sex, it's definitely worth the purchase.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk delivers once again.  Excellent lyrics and melodies throughout the album.  The rare duets are stellar.<br /><br />I bought this and the Target Deluxe cd, if you haven't heard the bonus tracks GET ON IT.  Trust me.
B007TMON8M|3.0|I don't find this game To be all that exciting. I don't find this game to be all that exciting.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|The Raid is an elegantly orchestrated ballet of brutally chaotic action sequences. The goodguys are likeable, the badguys are dispicable
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|If you have ever liked a girl - only to end up in the friend zone - this is the movie for you.  The cliche of boy meets girl and they fall in love and live happily ever after is an almost unrealistic concept.  Movies project that fantasy and its rare to see the other side of the story.  What happens when the boy doesn't get the girl.  This movie showed it and therefor was a refreshing change.  I highly recommend this movie for almost anyone.  If you have had your heart broken then this will show your story; if you are curious as to why sweet guys turn into aholes - this will show you why.  Good movie and I plan on sharing it with my friends.<br />Sincerely,<br />The Nice Bitter Nerdy Guy
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie at least once. One of the greatest ever.  Swanson is mesmerizing. Had to watch it again.
B00005JMCN|4.0|**May contain spoilers**<br /><br />I'm a sucker for a movie about horses.  Doesn't matter if its a racehorse, plow-horse, whatever, I just like hearing their stories.  And lets face it, they're pretty to look at to.  And Seabiscuit, because it's true, is even better of a tale.<br /><br />After going to California with just a handful of change, Charles Howard makes it big due to his know-how with the automobile and their rising popularity.  He quickly becomes one of the richest men in the West but a tragic accident that kills his son leaves him lonely and divorced.  It's then that he meets Marcella and she reintroduces him to horses, making him want to have a racehorse of his own.  With the help of a drifter/quiet trainer named Smith they find Seabiscuit.  Seabiscuit has been trained to lose but there's some spirit left in him.  They just need to find a jockey that will fit his temperament.  So in comes Red Pollard, a kid abandoned during the depression who hasn't done well at the tracks but has just as much of a fiery temper as Seabiscuit does.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Tobey Maguire: Red Pollard<br />Jeff Bridges: Charles Howard<br />Chris Cooper:  Tom Smith<br />Elizabeth Banks: Marceela Howard<br />Gary Stevens: George Woolf<br />William H. Macy: \\"Tick Tock\\" McLaughlin<br /><br />The cast was pretty well done in this movie.  I think Maguire did a good job as Red.  He was certainly feisty enough although he did look a little too big to be a jockey, even considering Red was on the bigger side for jockeys.  By contrast, Gary Stevens was the perfect size and exactly as you would envision a jockey.  Jeff Bridges as Charles Howard was quite wonderful.  I just wanted to give him a big hug throughout most of the movie because he was such a nice decent guy, and a character you could really connect with.  And he knew how to work a crowd.  The only character I didn't really like was Elizabeth Banks as Marcela.  I just didn't think she seemed spirited enough, and actually she seemed somewhat superficial.<br /><br />I can't say that the movie followed the book or even the real history exactly right.  There were a few things changed to make it more Hollywood like and I missed some of the parts that were true.  Especially in regards to Red's history, there was a lot missing there, including the real reason he was blind in one eye.  But there was a lot that was accurate, and I'm glad they tried to keep it at least a little consistent.  I thought it had a good mix of racing and character development.  At least I didn't find myself growing bored at any one part.  It is exciting to watch the horses race.  Even if you know who's going to win it still gets your heart pumping.  And nothing in this movie was too objectionable, there was a little bit of fighting and drinking, but nothing overtly risque and I don't think there would be any problem with young children watching it.<br /><br />The music was mostly instrumental.  I honestly didn't really pay that much attention to it as it was just background noise.  It did seem consistent with the tiems though and there was some big band in there that I enjoyed.  And the cinemotography was great.  There were a lot of good shots and the picture was very clear, even while racing.  And I did like that they incorporated some old photographs into the mix and some black and white film on the modern shots.  It just made it seem that more authentic and even a little bit of a history lesson.<br /><br />A nice movie.  I'm still in the process of reading the book but I did enjoy it quite a bit and don't think watching the movie will spoil the book for me.  After all, it is history.<br /><br />Review by M.

B008XG1X18|5.0|really close to the actual computer site with the exception of not being able to follow the pinned easily if you like the pin. but ot is way better than any other app.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Imagine a history major who must gloat about every single fact, name, place or event she can recall about a particular period every single time you speak with her. Now imagine her spewing her endless knowledge at you while you're trying to read \\"Twilight\\". This book was kind of like that. With Deborah Harkness' constant barrage of historical name drops squeezed between a forseeable witch-meets-vampire romance, the brillance that could have been this six-hundred page book never came to shine.<br /><br />All that being said, I did wait in anticipation for the sequel, \\"A Shadow of Night\\", and purchased it promptly upon release so, obviously, the aformentioned wasn't enough to overshadow the attractiveness of the storyline for me. Kudos to Deborah Harkness for making me ponder over the period of an entire year to learn what's in store for Diana and Matthew the second time around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|at last, they made a kindle fire edition for minecraft. When I saw this, I immediately purchased it. I have seen and heard so many good things about the pocket addition, and it is now mine to play.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Writing is pathetic,really don't know how she is an author her writing style doesn't flow and had very limited words in most places and then random words as if looked up in a thesaurus to make it sound...throughout the book the expression \\"oh my!\\" Is way over used,and the story is completely unbelievable,very little talk about sex so I really don't understand the big commotion about the book,typical pathetic female fantasy about a millionaire who falls in love with the quiet shy girl,bored the absolute pants off me!!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Light entertainment; not literature; escapism. Well written, successful for what it was meant to be without being obscene, disgusting or pornographic. Understandable why it sells so well.
0297859390|4.0|I enjoyed the book and liked all the twists and turns it offered.  I like to try and figure out the plot and I have to say just when I thought I had it figured out the plot became more twisted and exciting. I wanted more for the ending but overall great book!!
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read, loved the characters, looking fwd to the next book!  I have read the 50 shades series and found them similar, although this was written a bit better!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I rarely read but my English teacher recommended this book to the class...in other words just an amazing read. highly recommended.
6305308659|5.0|This is an excellent movie. One item not noticed about this film is the pun with the word, \\"Colored.\\" This movie is as much about racism as it is played out with the black and white world and the \\"Colored,\\" world of African-Americans and other minorities who were not to participate in the ideal world of sub-urban middle America. The movie draws you along as it brings all people into the real world, the world of color, and where all are human beings with both gifts and faults.
B008B3EQPI|5.0|Voodoo Mon Amour is a fantastic opening song on this album. From there it's just a steady upward journey into awesomeness. I can't really just listen to one song on here, I have to listen to the whole thing. DSO did a great job on this fantastic album!
0446615625|5.0|I read the other 4 from this series, out of order, from the \\"library\\" at work, and came here to find this one, and am glad I did.<br />I really enjoyed this book, as well as the whole series.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|This book is a lot different to the previous books but it's a great read that you want to keep turning the pages.
B0068856TI|4.0|(This review is about the entire series) This show maintains a realistic view of what its like for my peers fighting oversees. This shows the strife between the men who have eyes on the ground and those that are higher in rank seeking only to please their superiors. The action is great, its realistic. I recommend this show to people who like an accurate action-drama.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Good to see my husband cry once in awhile...it's such a rare occurrence.  Thank you August Rush!  This is, indeed a classic!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I live in the same locale with SEALs and have some interactions with them and their families in the civilian world, so I'm sensitive to keeping their workings resaonably secret. But, I liked the firsthand descriptions of some of the SEAL life and the OBL mission and didn't sense it would endanger them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. perfect timing with it being fair season. really enjoy playing it. Wont regret down loading it. Got to go play now
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it! mindless fun! don't seem to ever get sick of it in spite of its simplicity. love this game!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Amust have when plugged in and is done charging it starts a alarm and tell how many hours you have left on your tablet a must have.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A couple of days ago I found a quote that said: \\"Someday you will get what you want. Or maybe not. Maybe you will get something so much better.\\" Well, I believe it's true and it is the perfect quote to describe this book. And you don't have to be a football or Eagles fan to understand the story because outside of the football games, Pat's journey with people like Tiffany, Cliff, Danny, Jake and many more is an enjoyable-sad-at-times-worth reading experience.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have had this app for about 2 days and everytime I click on it it works then exits out. Don't get this app!!!!!!!! not worth 7 dollars
160774273X|5.0|As another reviewer pointed out-- this is SO much more than a collection of steps and recipes. I've bought lots of bread cookbooks and have taken artisan bread making classes.  But at first read THIS is the book I know I'll return to repeatedly. I can't explain his organization --  but it's perfect no matter whether you read cover to cover or jump in and start baking, or whether you are experienced or have never baked before.<br /><br />Ken seems to understand that not everyone has a free 11-hour or more day to devote to bread making so suggests ways of starting bread at night then baking in early a.m. You learn the basics of how important time and temperature are and how to work with both. And each recipe includes full steps plus a helpful timeline: fermentation time, proofing time and a sample schedule. For example: do this at 9 a.m., do the next step at 5 p.m., shape loaves at 8 a.m. the next morning and bake at noon.<br /><br />And somehow, with Ken's clear explanations, and timely repetition throughout, even non-techy types like me can get a complete understanding of what's important to get the best-tasting bread, and how to actually put this into play.<br /><br />He seems always to be anticipating questions or situations the reader might run into, and provides answers or solutions. It's almost as if he's at your shoulder giving advice just when you need it -- like the best teacher you could have right next to you in your kitchen. Examples: throughout he stresses the importance of dough temperature and how to check it. But what if \\" the dough isn't at the target temperature?\\"  Or what if something comes up while your dough is rising and you need to leave, so won't be home to do the next step?  Or how about dough that never seems to rise? Ken has the answer and a great \\" don't panic, it happens to all bakers\\" spirit.<br /><br />And I haven't even mentioned what a good read it is. I can't recommend this book strongly enough!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!! It is very addicting. I recommend it for all. I just wish I didn't run out of coins so quick.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent account. I liked how the author included all aspects of effort going on to track Bin Laden down over the years that lead up to the raid - the anaalysts & intelligence personnel that made the SEALs mission possible.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There is nothing nice about any of the characters in this novel, but they were interesting enough to keep me reading. A fast-paced novel that will keep you guessing until the very end.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Everyone already knows that the Walking Dead series is excellent, with its edge-or-your seat action sequences and heart-rending emotional moments. But the zombie head display case takes DVD collecting to the next level. Every chance I get, I show off this amazing scuplture. Mind you, I also use it to scare the neighbor's kids.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD is a simple app that is a cool way to stay in top of your battery life great details... and it looks cool too...
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another good book from Lee Child. I look forward to the next one. Jack Reacher is truly a simple<br /> character.
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|Sacha Baron Cohen drops plenty of good gags in this movie, but the plot is very silly.  Reminds me a lot of \\"Zohan\\".
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This was a great story, but I would have changed one part of the ending. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who intends to read this, but it would have worked very well without the \\"natural disaster\\" part.
B001TKMAGW|4.0|Great Black Sabbath record.Recorded in just a weekend a 16 track recording this sets the tone for what is to come!! Rock that would change the course and minds of a lot of musicians seeing music in a whole new way! These guys are Kings of hard rock..nobody better. The extra disc is somewhat interesting and will get some air time agian unlike the other two bonus disc for the Deluxe Editions - Great packageing but no lyrics. Very cool though.  K
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Good movie; enjoyed it.  Chris Helmsworth wonderful as usual. Not something I'm going to watch over & over. Amazon instant Video was fantastic.
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun and addictive puzzle game. the best one i have found. the extra puzzle packs are a great plus!  i would recommend it.
B008MM9630|5.0|this is a great game. I just love this game I cant stop playing it at all. all my friends loves this game also
B001D2AYCI|2.0|This review is for the over-priced triple cd called DELUXE EDITION. First the dvd is not a video dvd..umm  pass!! Then on the bonus music disc we get nothing really interesting in these out takes..should have been left on the floor..you were right Tony almost not putting this out!  Not so great packaging No lyrics come on! priced 3x the warner bros. versions. I was really forced to buy this set because i have vol. 4 and all by Santuary - so the run of 8 albums match but have no idea if these re-masters are any better than Warner. Of course PARANOID is unforgetable and changed rock history- It is a five star classic don't get me wrong but please don't make me buy it 4 times!!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this app.  I stopped playing this game previously because the ads got in the way.  This app is perfect!
B003WJ6AD2|5.0|Great quality and a good deal to bring back childhood memories. This is a great fantasy film about the struggle to keep the balance between good and evil.
B008E374RC|4.0|This is fantastic! Every song is at least good.Adam Young brought a whole new level to this album;by including more of an alt.  sound with some songs, cool catchy lyrics :),and oh yeah a song w/Carly Rae Jepsen. The Midsummer Station is the perfect title for the eleven tracks!<br /><br />Track By Track:<br />\\"Dreams and Disasters\\" very good opening song;upbeat and catchy 7.5/10<br />\\"Shooting Star\\" This is the first song on \\"The Midsummer Station\\" I listened to and it's just a great song! 9/10<br />\\"Gold\\" This song is GOLD! 9.5/10<br />\\"Dementia\\" good overall song,very repetitive 7/10<br />\\"I'm Coming After You\\" WOW!! This is a fun song!Catchy classic Owl City here!....F-U-N! 10/10<br />\\"Speed of Love\\" Nice song,I like it. 9/10<br />\\"Good Time\\" The perfect summer song! Amazing song. 10/10<br />\\"Embers\\" Powerful Song. 10/10<br />\\"Silhouette\\" It's a good song but it is kinda depressing...sorry it is.:( 5/10<br />\\"Metropolis\\" This song makes me think of \\"Ocean Eyes\\" (the second full-length album by Owl City)catchy,a synthpop feel. A+!! 10/10<br />\\"Take It All Away\\" ah #11 is my favorite song on this album.This song is different than all the other tracks in a very good way! 10/10
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Start to finish one of the best albums I've heard in a long time! Highly recommend.  Can't wait to hear their others.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game. I like to play this game when I waiting at the port tot my container. or for the customers to load or unload the container
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it! very addicting game... cant wait for the coins to drop.....especially if you loved it at the carnivals! enjoy!!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|I thought Thor was another great addition to the slew of comic book movies now available.  I grew up reading my dad's comics from the 60's and 70's and I love these stories.  Perhaps it makes me rather biased and less aware of shortcomings in the films, but nevertheless, I love seeing these stories come to life.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more of them.
B005LAII80|4.0|When it comes to action movies, there seem to be two kinds: those that go into philosophical issues, and explore the deeper aspects of being human.  Other action films are content to simply blow stuff up without a second thought, and never going further then that.  It's the rare action film that manages to find a balance between the two, and \\"Dredd\\" manages to hit that sweet spot.<br /><br />Taking place in the late 21rst century, \\"Dredd\\" follows the exploits of Judge Dredd, who fights for law and order in a chaotic post-apocalyptic city where crime runs rampant.  While taking out a rookie cop on a routine patrol, Dredd finds himself trapped in a high-rise tower with a literal army of criminals eager to take him down.  Little do they know that they might just be the hunted, rather then the hunter.<br /><br />What's most surprising about \\"Dredd\\" is that it feels exactly like an 80's action flick, complete with a dystopian future, lots of gunfire, hard-boiled cops taking on psychopaths, and a story centered about drugs.  And that's what \\"Dredd\\" aspires to be: a really solid action film, and in that, it succeeds.  Its pace is steady, the story is good, the acting is good, the production values and the look of the film are high, and it mettles out enough action and justice to keep the audience satisfied, while even tossing in little moments of moral ambiguity in how law and justice can really even be applied to such a hellish world (how do you react when two kids come at you with guns?).<br /><br />What truly surprises me is that \\"Dredd\\" has no real weak spots.  It is, in all ways, a very solid 80's action movie that just happened to be made almost thirty years after that era.  Solid and with its own brand of charm that only comes in seeing criminal scumbags being blown away by equally tough cops, it's a genuine treat for action fans who don't mind a little bit of intellectual charm to go with all the gunshots.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|One of the reasons I've enjoyed Batman over the years is because, well, he's human.  This movie shows just how human Batman is because he's aged just like all of us will eventually, which means he's slowed down and he's not as strong, and he recognizes this; but he is still mentally sharp.  Batman's age is brought up more than once in the movie, but he has more than enough will and smarts to get the job done.  This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, Batman movie.

B009329ZF2|4.0|Even though I found out a couple of things \\"too fantastic\\" for the serious sci fi followers, in general this movie ended up entertaining me to the point I could not leave my chair once it started until the end. Plus is has the support of Liam  Neeson.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like the app. I thought it was a little confusing at first because I am used to using Pinterest on my PC but after I got the hang of it I like to use it all the time. I'm still new to pinterest so I'm not really sure if I actually like this social networking site/app or not though. Worth the download considering it is free.
0345803485|1.0|This has got to be the worst book I've ever attempted to read.  I don't like to write bad reviews, as a matter of fact, this is the first bad review I've written. I'm really not sure what all the hype is about, Christian Grey is a weird a-hole and it is all incredibly unbelievable. The whole contract, submission and punishment chapters turned my stomach. The only audience who found this book to be so great must never had dealt with narcissistic people.  Those of us who have been unfortunate enough to have been involved with such self centered people would have and most likely did find this book revolting. That's the best I can say about this book!!
B0091XRL86|1.0|had such high expectations and this was a complete bomb.  I was so disappointed in how bad this movie was.  huge wallace and gromit fan.  didn't even finish movie.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|The movie is supposedly based on the book of the same name.  Aside from sharing the same title, a few of the same characters and the setting in India, however, the two have little in common. In this case the movie is far superior to the book, which is muddled, disconnected and populated by a mélange of characters, most of whom, thankfully, never made it into the movie.<br /><br />Despite the best efforts of the screenplay writers to rescue a tedious and confused novel, it is the excellent cast of actors who make the movie worthwhile. I suppose the intention was to focus on the trials and tribulations of the elderly as they come to terms with the sordid reality of their past lives and the prospect of making the most of the little time they have left. Instead we seem to be faced with a bunch of whining, self-absorbed, petulant and obnoxious Brits who by the movie's conclusion are supposedly transformed into loving, caring individuals (for the most part) who teach the poor inadequate Indians how to sell things by telephone, how to run a hotel and how to stand up to domineering mothers so that love can conquer all. Clearly, despite all evidence to the contrary, the British still think they have so much to teach the world while they coincidentally continue to shoulder their long-standing, self-assigned White Man's Burden.<br /><br />Despite the cast of excellent, well-known British actors who stole the limelight in terms of credit, I enjoyed the performance of Dev Patel more than the others.<br /><br />Interesting also that in the novel it was the lecherous & creepy heterosexual Norman who died in a brothel, while in the movie Norman finds respectability and true love, but the one gay character is killed off.

B00009UW0N|4.0|\\"Halloween\\" (1978) was shot on an extremely low budget on an extremely tight schedule; forcing director John Carpenter to shoot with great tightness and economy. This is all to the film's advantage. By now, we are all familiar with the murderous maniac Michael Myers and the original \\"night he came home.\\" Familiarity and time, however, do not diminish the effectiveness of this little fright-fest. The plot, in brief: On Halloween night 1963, six year old Michael Myers murders his sister Judith. Fifteen years later, he escapes from the mental institution-- heading back to his fictional Illinois home-town. He is pursued by his psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Plensence), who knows how dangerous Michael is and that he will kill again. Michael stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (P.J. Soles).<br />  Carpenter sets up an atmosphere of tension early on. Michael stalks Laurie and friends in broad daylight. But Laurie is the only one who seems to be aware that something is seriously off-kilter. She senses Michael while she is at school. Later, she sees him for a fleeting second in her backyard-- and that one second is enough to leave her seriously, if privately, spooked. References are made to the \\"boogeyman\\" (Michael is not so much a human person as a symbol of pure, unstoppable evil-- that un-named, unknowable evil force that is lurking somewhere in the darkness to grab us). At school, we hear Laurie's teacher talking about fate and how everyone must face a day of reckoning. For Laurie, this Halloween will be a terrifying night of reckoning. \\"Halloween\\" is notable for its emphasis on suspense instead of graphic violence or gore. For a thriller about a murderous maniac that gradually builds up in intensity, the body count is surprisingly low.<br />  \\"Halloween\\" has  also  been criticized for originating the horror film convention that if you have sex or take drugs, you will die. That's a bit too simplistic. Annie and Lynda aren't killed simply because they are sexually active, and Laurie does not merely survive because she is a \\"repressed, virginal girl scout\\" of a babysitter. Annie and Lynda are  consumed with sex but, also, they are not very aware of their surroundings and what is going on around them. I doubt anyone cares when Annie is killed because she comes across as a snotty, spoiled brat. At least P.J. Soles is fun as Lynda, the happy go lucky girl who can't say one sentence without the word \\"totally\\" in it. Bob, Lynda's boyfriend, is such a cardboard, undefined \\"sex partner\\", it's impossible to care when he is stabbed to death and stuck on a wall. What really matters here is Laurie's intense \\"show-down and throw-down\\"  with Michael. Laurie survives not merely because she is the virginal girl, but because she is resourseful and proactive. Yes, she is ultimately \\"saved\\" by Dr. Loomis, who finally arrives after what is perhaps the most prolonged prowl around the block in movie history. But, hey, it's all in the service of great horror suspense. Laurie deserves to be celebrated as a great horror heroine. She saves the children she is babysitting and, in essence, she saves herself too; despite Loomis' last minute entrance with a gun.<br />  The Divimax 25th Anniversary DVD features excellent picture and sound; the feature-length documentary \\"Halloween: A Cut Above The Rest\\", and several more bonus features.a aren't killed simply because they are sexually active, and Laurie does not merely survive because she is a \\"repressed, virginal girl scout\\" of a babysitter.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first one was good, the second and third had more story line.  All three were excellent but the third was my favorite.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addicting that I forgot about words with friends. it delivers what it says and more I can spend tons of coins and actually win stuff (not actually) but I never had enough money in real life to play for a great payoff. really enjoy it and my kids can play too
B004KPX5GC|5.0|I bought this because of friends recommending it.  I was not disappointed, in fact, I watched it four times and found new things in it each time.  The story was terrific, the acting great, the color/film excellent.  Enjoyed the movie very much.

The reader is left with a sense of sorrow for a flawed genius.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An outstanding account and description from the operators viewpoint of the details of planning, training and execution of what it took to take out Osama. Credit should be given to these brave men that participated in the actual mission, and not the President approving the mission.
B002QXI2L8|3.0|The DVD Orhpheus und Eurydike is a recording of a dance opera created by the great german choreographer Pina Bausch. Since Orpheus and Euridice is my favorite greecian mythological story and Pina Bausch is a powerful soul and artist it is ofcourse soul fulfilling and beautiful, however it is only a recording of the actual theatre opera performance...yet one of the things...that you can watch over and over again...if \\"this\\" moves you...It has a beautiful DVD cover...booklet with photographs from the performance...with a beautiful quote from Pina Bausch... \\" I am more interested in what moves people rather than in movement.\\"<br /><br />Andrea
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I felt compelled to do a review on this movie due to the bad reviews. Give this movie a chance! It kept me interested from start to finish. It was very visually stimulating and Kristen Stewart's acting wasn't bad at all! The movie revolves around good vs. evil. Dark vs. light. There is also some well placed symbolism that you can notice if you're looking for it.  I absolutely LOVED it! Glad I watched this movie even though it didn't have the best reviews. Don't go off the bad reviews here people, you'll miss out if you go by others bitterness. They must be on the evil queen's side ;) lol It was a dark/beautiful story.

I haven't read anything this good since \\"Pride and prejudice\\" a long time ago. Thank you for writting it.<br /><br />After reading The Kite Runner I just got to buy this book. I was not dissapointed. The author hookes us with characters that are so very human, that one cannot avoid falling in love with them.<br />I also LOVE his messages about forgiveness in both books. Humanity needs more of that.
B0087DFIYA|3.0|In a way I liked this movie but I was disappointed that Mel Gibson  played in it I hope he gets his act back like it was.I have almost all of his movies.But this one was not like him.I would have liked the story if some no name played it but I still have it and will show it to who ever wants to watch it.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|As a real fan of Hitchens' thinking, I could not miss his last few pain-filled words, which are heart-rending.  The idiots he writes about, who found it God's revenge to have him die so young, unfortunately will not land in hell as they conceive of it (burning fires, etc., mainly because there is no such place), but they should feel guilty here on earth for even assuming their \\"friend in the sky\\" visited cancer on Hitchens merely to justify the existence of a prime mover.  Even in terrible pain Hitchens' few words as he approached his demise illustrate his intense intelligence and reasonableness.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|My biggest difficulty with this app was instructions for adding one of the few additional sound choices available without purchasing the entire package. It was confusing.
B008CLI3TE|1.0|There was WAY too much gratuitous nudity, sex, and even horrid incest; yuck.  Is it really not possible nowadays to tone that aspect down just a tad?  It really got tiresome and icky to the point that I had to stop watching the show after the first time.  I am not 'old fashioned' but COME ON..  over and over and over like that was the only aspect to the entire show..  was HBO really trying for an X rating?  :(

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I've read thousands of pages about Abraham Lincoln and about a thousand pages by Abraham Lincoln; this is the finest portrait of Lincoln I've had the pleasure to read.  The climate in which he came to the presidency and the his environment once he arrived in Washington are beautifully chronicaled in this volume.  Ms. Goodwin is never critical of Mr. Lincoln in this offering, in fact she is an uninhibited fan of his insight into human motivation and political machinery.  Still I find her portrayal of the infighting of the Whig, Republican, and Decmocratic parties in the crucible of the dissolution of our Union compelling.<br /><br />After this excellent book and spirited read, I find myself disillusioned in the face of the current unscrupulous crop of politicians.  Every elected official in Washington should be ashamed when they see the Lincoln Memorial.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I recieved my knife the other day and am very pleased. In my case, all the Youtube naysayers where overstating the gloom and doom.<br />The finish is even, the hardware was tight, the edge was hair shaving sharp, the sheath did not rub the sharpened edge when drawing, the retention was good but still easy to draw. Highly recommend for serious woods/camp tasks.

The content is great--Shakespeare, after all.<br /><br />Dropped the book, and the leather cover of the book ripped itself from the spine of the pages.<br /><br />Apparently, this book is put together rather cheaply.  It's nice, though, if you let it just sit around and don't read it.  But my guess is that this book would have torn up anyway after 50+ turns of opening it up.

B005LAIHPY|5.0|I saw Battleship in the theaters earlier this year. 6 times. I love this movie. It is my favorite film next only to the Avengers. I thought this was better than Men in Black III. Since many have already reviewed the plot, I am going to share some of my favorite moments and tidbits. Director Peter Berg is a Navy fan and it shows. Battleship has outstanding Transformer style special effects, lots of action, a great cast and support of the Navy, which includes many naval personnel, both active duty, retired WW II & Vietnam vets and wounded warriors. (You must see Army Col. Greg Gadson, a real wounded warrior who lost his legs in Iraq, personally take on an alien warrior-he is one tough soldier!)You don't see many of the latter in save the world films. Taylor Kitsch is wonderful as Alex Hopper, our slacker turned hero and I love Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood) as his responsible Navy Captain brother Stone. They have a nice vibe between them. Rihanna is absolutely bad ass as Navy gunner Raikes. She spent time with weapons training with a real gunner named Jacqueline and she modeled her performance partly on this tough young lady. You will see Jacqueline in the bonus specials. Brooklyn Decker is wonderful as Sam, Alex's girlfriend and physical therapist. The alien weapons are awesome (the first ship destroyers are designed to look like the pegs in the board game), both peg projectiles and the formidable shredders which eat metal and have a mind of their own. We humans are considered much of a threat until we directly provoke them. Time for the Navy to save the day! While we normally see aircraft carrier and fighters, it is great to see what a destroyer does and Director Berg does a great job of putting you in the action and making it easy to follow.<br /><br />Ignore the critics and the bad reviews. This is a great movie, with lots of action and humor. I have friends who didn't see it in theaters, rented it loved and now wished they had seen it during its initial run. Several of them bought it. One friend said it had more action than the Avengers. Sit back, relax and enjoy seeing the Navy save the world. This is a wonderful tribute to our veterans, active, wounded and retired.<br /><br />**************************************************************************************************************<br />THERE IS A BONUS SCENE AT THE END OF THE CREDITS SET IN SCOTLAND. Many people didn't know about it or missed it. The digital copy includes subtitles and languages and the bonus scene.<br />****************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Some favorite scenes:<br /><br />Alex getting tazed after damaging a convenience store to get Sam a chicken burrito. Great comic skills from Taylor.<br /><br />Alex meeting Captain Nigata (TADANOBU ASANO, a famed Japanese actor-Thor fans, you know him as one of the Asgardian Warriors 3) during the soccer match. Nigata kicks him in the face, causing Alex a concussion and the loss of the game. This sets up the dynamic relationship between the two.<br /><br />During the Rimpac exercises (the Naval games that include 13 nations participate in) some great moments:<br />Alex explaining the difference between a destroyer and a battleship (a destroyer is the Terminator, a battleship is a floating punching bag)<br /><br />The opening ceremony aboard the Might Mo, USS Missouri battleship (the cast and crew shot aboard the real Mighty Mo, including a rare opportunity to film the Mighty Mo out at sea (details in the great making of docs including a tour) with over 600 multinational sailors and WWII vets<br /><br />A great contrasting scene showing the difference in approaches Stone and Alex use while speaking to their crews. Stone as commander encourages his crew to be safe and learn cooperation from other nations and \\"Keep Charging.\\" Alex as tactical action officer informs his crew to crush the enemy and outperform every other ship duringthe exercises. Watch the faces of the crew during Alex's speech when he says \\"We are not here in this weapons room to learn.\\" Priceless looks from some of the real Navy sailors!<br /><br />When the Navy encounters the aliens and the action begins, note the care shown to include reactions from the sailors, they have some of the greatest reactions during the battles. \\"Who's running the ship? Hopper. Hopper is, we are all going to die?!\\" When a helmsman is steering the ship in a dangerous area, \\"Ordy, we are about to kiss these rocks, man! I can see fish man!\\"<br /><br />Alex in command of the John Paul Jones after the CO and XO are killed insisting on charging the overwhelming power of the aliens that costs Nigata his ship and the loss of the Sampson and brother Stone, being reminded by Petty Officer \\"Beast,\\" (a great John Tui) that there are sailors in the water who need to be rescued.<br /><br />Key section in which Alex and Nigata begin to work together (their dynamic, contrasting styles help drive the film) while plotting their next move. When Nigata explains his water displacement strategy \\"seeing them without seeing them\\" Alex steps back and offers Nigata his chair, showing how much he has learned. Raikes (Rhianna) and other crew members give him questioning looks and he says \\"My brother would have done the same.\\" One of my favorite scenes in the whole film. Watch the crew reactions as they first question and then rejoice in Nigata's clever usage of water displacement (like the battleship board game) to take out 2 alien ships.<br /><br />Destroyer John Paul Jones' destruction of the the third alien ship, which in turn sends out shredders to rip up the JPJ. Incredible special effects showing the shredders ripping the ship to pieces!<br /><br />A truly great scene where the survivors of the JPJ board the Might Mo. Beast says the ship is 70 years old with steam engines that he doesn't know how to run. There is a great view of the veteran sailors around the ship who come forward and step up once again when asked to fight. Great patriotic moment. I saw this on Memorial Day and the folks in the audience applauded. The Mighty Mo still packs a punch and it is worth it to see her take on the last alien ship and win. Another great section. Alex references the Art of War (a legendary Chinese guide to war strategy) several times during the film. Near the end he realizes the last confrontation reminds him of a section of Art of War. When the Mighty Mo defeats the alien ship, I love the exchange with Nigata.<br />Nigata, \\"I can't believe that worked!\\" Alex, \\"Art of War, after all these years it finally clicked! Fight the enemy where they aren't.\\" Nigata, \\"That's not what that means!\\" Alex, \\"Really?\\" Nigata, \\"Not even close!\\"<br /><br /> Buy the ticket and take the ride.

B0024SQW2Q|3.0|Underworld moves quickly at first, lags in the late middle, and has a predictable ending.  There are some excellent action and fight scenes.  I don't think the film is suitable for children under the age of fourteen because of violent images and sexual situations.  Because it is a fantasy period piece, the language is not vulgar - I don't think there is any swearing.<br /><br />In sum, a pretty enjoyable vampire - werewolf battle romp if you want to unplug and you enjoy that kind of movie.  I do.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the only problem I have with the game is when I unlocked the next puzzle I couldn't play it. I guess its coming in an update in the future.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I got this game for my grandson and started playing it so I could tell him about it.  I found that while I was having a lot of fun playing Jet pack Joyride, I was also exercising my brain by trying to avoid all the obstacles that came up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! My only issue with it is I have to forceclose it at least once a day. I thought it was just on my Kindle but I have it installed on my phone and it does there as well. Fix the issue of it closing all the time and that would solve my only problem.
B005OHSUQK|4.0|This time the show worked without any audio problems like the last one we watched. Hopefully that doesn't happen again.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|This is actually the first album I have purchased of In This Moment. I never really got into some of there older works, but this album definitely has made me give this band a second look! If you like hard rock, metal, and just plain awesome guitar rifts and drum beats this album is for you. It has a good mix of heavy hitting songs at the beginning and then tones it down a bit on the last half of the songs where lead singer Maria Brink shows off just how good her vocals really are. Would highly recommend to any metal head!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Where did this come from? I, like most fans, lost interest in the Pumpkins after 'Mellon Collie...' Yes I've heard everything they've done since then, but nothing moved me, and by the time 'Zeitgeist' came out I really thought maybe Billy should just throw in the towel. But a friend suggested I really needed to give 'Oceania' a listen, and I am so glad he did. This is an amazing return to form, totally unexpected and out of the blue. Billy definitely found his mojo again. This could be the follow-up to 'Mellon Collie..' it has all the elements that made early SP so good, great hard rock riffs, with tons of psychedelica and atmosphere, catchy songs, great playing. It's a fantastic record, and an incredibly pleasant surprise. If you are, like me, someone who wrote off Billy Corgan after 'Mellon Collie...' I can't recommend this highly enough, and I hope you share my joy that the Pumpkins have released another stellar album!!
B001N8V7KA|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this! The sound and picture quality is much greater than the one I saw on VHS when I was just a little boy. The one I saw on VHS was clouded with static and there were some things that I could not hear that should have been heard. This movie being put on DVD solves that problem. I definitely recommend this movie to all Clint Eastwood fans. It is an awesome movie.

B0058YPL66|2.0|After being put under a spell a group of fairytale characters are brought into our reality. All the famous story book characters are there in the small quiet town of story brook. The only one aware of who the identities of the towns folk is the one who cast the spell in the first place. The Evil Queen Sorceress who put them all under her spell for the sake of her own happiness. I'm not sure what that happiness is because she looks to live a lonely life still. Anyhow the show plays out with a ridiculous start. A bounty woman is confronted by a 10yo boy who turns out to be her abandoned child. The boy leads the woman back to his hometown of Story Brook. Now here is the part about the show that is why I give it 2/5. The kid is annoying and he's in every scene. The story can do without the long lost child plot if it was just a mystery to be unsolved. Instead of that you have a whiny tag along through every scene who only serves as \\"plot exposition\\". His role isn't really necessary and it seems awkward that he is even placed into the show. The show is already about a long lost child and now it becomes about a long lost child that has had a long lost child...not sure what the writers were thinking.<br /><br />Aside from annoying characters the other parts of the show are quite interesting. The \\"real world\\" the fairytale characters live in isn't so much the \\"real world\\" it's more of a \\"picture perfect sunshine and smiles\\" town that in itself is an unrealistic fantasy compared to the actual real world. That would be the second problem with the overall design of the show. The punishment of the curse is to bring the fairytale characters into the real word where they will live in the misery of reality but they all seem to be just living fine in a peaceful little town.<br /><br />The curse is more of an amnesia trick to make the characters forget who they are but, who they've become seems to be better people than they are in their story book world in some cases... so that is also another strange part to the story. To enjoy \\"Once Upon A Time\\" you really have to put your mind on cruise and just take the show for what it is. It's a light hearted series and should be treated like that. I enjoyed watching it but, somethings I felt could have made it much better like removing the kid for one and just letting Emma figure out what's going on through her own methods.<br /><br />Each episode is broken up into the actual fairy tale about a fantasy character and their present day life. You get to learn just enough about them but their stories are never really finished. So what you get are broken clips of a fairytale with no ending. The fairy tales in Once Upon A Time are loosely based around the real stories. They are actually written pretty well to tie the story together. I enjoyed Little Red Riding hood's story the most. I've so far watched 20 episodes of the series and still find a lot of the show to be overly cheesy. The mixture of good actors and bad actors trying to sell you the reality of a fantasy world come true doesn't help. Where some actors are very strong others are weak and don't exactly bring you into the story like they should. I mostly watch the show for Regina and to see what plot she can come up with. When you have a show full of mostly annoying characters you just find yourself rooting for the bad guys.so another strange part to the story.

0385344333|2.0|I think the reviews of this novel are accurate. It does get tedious at times, with so much time in the car. And the action is severely lacking until the end. Heck, we have a potential fight scene turn into a \\"That's what I thought\\" situation when the perpetrators simply walk away?<br /><br />And is it just me or has Reacher become more of a jerk and make the situation worse? Yes, he always comes through in the end, but this particular case could have been resolved quicker had he just told Sorenson what went down instead of pulling the \\"I'm the strong silent loner and I'm not telling you anything even though my info could have seriously helped law enforcement.\\" Yo Jack, do you have to go through all the drama when someone asks you a simple question? If I see one more law enforcement type, or even a local, ask a simple question like \\"So, how do you like the food here?\\" and Reacher respond \\"Why does that matter?\\" or something I'm throwing the book across the room. I'm using an extreme example, of course, but does he have to get an attitude with every question?<br /><br />And it's getting into comic book territory how only Reacher seems able to infiltrate the bad guys lair and take them all down Batman Rambo style. I'm waiting for him to escort the NAVY SEALS on a mission and the entire team stays outside while Reacher takes down all of Al-Qaeda, which happens a few days after Reacher fights the heavyweight division of MMA and whips them all in thirty seconds.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|First off, although this book has somehow been labeled YA, I would only recommend it for mature YA, 17+, for violence, language, and sexual situations.<br /><br />That being said, I love this book. I love the characters. Abby and Travis are great. Travis is the kind of guy you know you should not like, and yet you cannot help but fall for him. He is possessive, jealous, and impulsive with stalker tendencies, and yet he is so sweet and caring at the same time. In real life, Abby and any other girl should have been running away fast. Abby is strong willed and willing to stand up for herself and what she believes. The supporting characters, America, Shep, and Parker, are great as well. I love the dimension they bring to the story.<br /><br />I love the dynamics of the relationship between Abby and Travis. They really are a disaster, but that's what made them so interesting. The whole time you're reading you're thinking maybe they would just be better off if they left each other alone, and yet they cannot seem to stay away from each other. However, besides the romance between Abby and Travis, this book also gives you an interesting storyline. There is so much more to it than just the fighting and getting back together of those two. There are also many twists that keep you wondering until the end.<br /><br />The way the author wrote the book made the story flow so well. I liked that she did not give us stupid filler just to take up space, but rather only wrote what was necessary. Her writing was straightforward, and yet you do not feel like you're missing anything without the excessive descriptions. I really enjoy her writing style and hope we will get more of her writing in the future.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Twist on the time travel concept. Well written and enjoyable read. Could have been edited down a bit . Learned lot of the history of the time which I am embarrassed to say I am not as familiar with.  The audiobook version which I heard part of through my friend was also very well read with all the accents and gave life to the characters. Read it or listen to it!
B003G4W49C|3.0|I enjoyed the book and the storyline. However, some of it felt a bit drawn out. The ending was so swift. Literally a lifetime in one chapter and yet the beginning explained every feeling and motion. Overall, it is worth a read.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|The outrage about the pricing of this movie is that Marvel has deliberately left off the ultraviolet copy to force customers to purchase a $30 3D copy.

B00004TDTO|5.0|The used disc was in perfect shape and the movie was as awesomely scary as it was the first time I saw it! Go Team Jaws!
0385742886|4.0|I thought this was a really interesting and intriguing book.  I had already read the trilogy, and was excited to read the prequel.  I think the characters are all well developed, but don't expect to hear about Thomas or Theresa except for the very beginning and very end.  This is not so much a story about them, but a story about when the Flare initially started.  Maybe there will be a pre-prequil that actually reveals Thomas' and Theresa's relationship growing up together, and the particulars about their involvement in creating the Maze.  You will NOT find that info in this book.  I still recommend and again, really enjoyed reading it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I would give it one star except for the interesting fantasy characters; however, they didn't play any meaningful role...just eye candy.  When the movie came to it's climax, I couldn't watch anymore.  The movie was too long boring and the characters looked as if they felt out of place.  The two lead female roles were horrifically miscast.  I couldn't buy either one of them. Charlize Theron especially grated my spine with her feigned anger and evil infections. There was nothing sly or wily about her. The character was just too superficial.  She just couldn't pull it off. I also didn't like her face for the part.  She doesn't have an evil face at all.  I'd sure would like to have seen a beautiful, sexy and sleazy woman for that part.  She looks too much like a woman you would proudly take home to dear ol' mother.  As for Kristen Stewart, she could not muster up an emotional expression to save her soul.  She especially looked out of place on a horse.  She had no idea what sort of emotion to convey.  It was silly. The movie was a good try, but I could not get hooked at all.  I was more of a bystander in the same room as my TV.
B003O86FMW|2.0|This book was so much of a repeat of the last one.  I thought it was rather boring.  It didn't make me want to run home from work and read it.

B008220AVW|2.0|Believe it or not, I'm a Katy Perry fan, but not nearly enough to see this in theaters. This is pretty dull with a lot of home movie, some concert footage and behind the scenes. It documents her year long tour... but doesn't have full song performances. It shows the behind the scenes and even brief moments of her new ex husband. But sprinkled in there is the real biography of this documentary / film. It shows her growing up, where she came from, her budding music career, why she's so awesome and would make it big one day.<br /><br />Personally, this was a chore for 2 Katy Perry fans to get through. I think a concert DVD would have been better, but perhaps there are mega Katy fans that will think this is the best movie ever because it brings you into Katy Perry's life and how she's always been fun and weird from the start.<br /><br />It is more than a biography, but it is still a biography with concert footage and behind the scenes. If you like watching home movies about someone you idolize, this is for you. If not, skip it, because you'll be bored. I can think of something 1,000x more entertaining... listening to one of Katy's 2 CDs. They're amazingly better than this.

Normally I watch a movie in one sitting, but it took me two whole days to finish this one, because I kept having to take a break from it because it was so boring. Honestly, it was a torture to watch...

B008KNZ6X0|5.0|I know, I know. Thats a mighty bold statement but, if you have not seen this movie, you really dont know what you are talking about. There are scenes in this movie that you say to yourself, \\"There is NO WAY they could best that scene!\\" Then THEY DO! It is also fair to note that two stunt men almost died during the making of this movie. This movie is for fans of action flicks in their most true form. There is a script and a story but, once that goes sideways, the movie boils down to survival! There are no apologizes or time for second thoughts in the movie or movies like this. It is brutal, relentless and if you didnt get that from the commercials, you are going to be in for s shock if you thought anything else. I say BUY THIS MOVIE! Dont even rent it. Its THAT GOOD!

B0034G4P7G|1.0|The movie is a snooze fest and pretty much all the characters are unlikable and arrogant. The main character, Mark Zuckerberg shows little emotion or expression throughout the whole movie, just the same fast speech and condescending attitude. This movie is dull and has no deep plot besides him launching the website and getting rich. The end.

All these kids were leaving as they took the stage.  Couldn't believe it, but then the Blizcon thing was about video games, not The Foo.  Oh well, more for me.  Really enjoyed it.

I decided what the heck, might as well read them since I enjoy reading. Well started the first book and finished it same day so I decided instead of buying the written edition of the next one I just bought it on the Kindle. Well, let me tell you, this book was pretty darn good. I found it hard to put the book down because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. This was the best out of the three books in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good and quick read.

B005LAIHGI|2.0|In your home country, you are all-powerful, worshipped, albeit forcibly, and seen as God come to Earth. Then, you are abandoned in a country where you're despised by the public as a whole and must make a living. What do you do?<br /><br />  Admiral General Hafez Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) has been master of all he surveys in the North African Republic of Wadiya for decades. He's immature, anti-Semitic, has such poor judgment, and so little control over his libido that his bodyguards are all female and chosen primarily for their looks. In addition, he spends a fortune of his country's money for the pleasure of Megan Fox's company in the bedroom. Still, all is not perfect in the world of our conceited ruler. He must face the combined challenges of building his struggling nuclear program and keeping U.N. inspectors from discovering it. All while his right hand and uncle, Tamir (played by Ben Kingsley) grows frustrated with working for such a buffoon. Believing that he rightly belongs in the seat of power, Tamir (Kingsley) hires an American mercenary named Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) to kidnap Aladeen so that he can be replaced a look-alike they employ to foil assassination attempts. The look-alike, (also played by Cohen) is a simpleton and will be much easier to manipulate than the real Aladeen who managed to escape his captors, but not before they'd stripped him of his decorated military uniform and cut off his trademark beard. After meeting him outside the U.N., Zoey, an activist and operator of an alternative lifestyle food co-op (played by Anna Faris) offers Aladeen a job, believing he was a refugee from the oppressive regime rather than the covertly ousted oppressor himself.<br /><br />  Now, having not seen Borat or Bruno, perhaps I was unprepared for Cohen's brand of comedy. The director, Larry Charles, was also behind the camera for Cohen's previous efforts but I'm only familiar with his work as an alumnus of the Seinfeld writing staff and as the director of the Bill Maher documentary Religulous. I am a fan of both but comparing The Dictator to Seinfeld is like comparing apples to... well, Seinfeld. And the obvious references to eccentricities exhibited by Saddam Hussein  and former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi were funny, but the protagonist himself neither funny nor sympathetic. To me, he was rarely, if ever, interesting. Others might enjoy this film, I didn't.the director of the Bill Maher documentary Religulous.

B008KEQMDC|2.0|If you're about to take on the one task that you can never really be ready for, no matter what book you read, what do you do? You talk to people who've been there. Expert or not, they'll have advice you can actually relate to.<br /><br />  In the beginning of the film, we're introduced to a cast of characters too numerous to list. Among them, however, are Holly and Alex (played by Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro) who are beginning the arduous task of adopting a child from abroad after experiencing great difficulty conceiving. Also, we're shown the final episode of a Dancing with the Stars type of show and as one of the winning contestants, Jules (played by Cameron Diaz) becomes nauseous and throws up which, in this film anyway, can only mean one thing. Holly (Lopez) is concerned that, even with the wait they have ahead of them, Alex (Santoro) won't be ready for the challenges of parenting and isn't excited about the prospect. To help him, she sets him up with The Dudes Group, men with children and pregnant wives who tell the truth, offer advice, and commiserate. One of the founding principles of the group is that they do not tell wives or girlfriends what takes place during group meetings. Another, told to us by Gabe, a man who has children already is that they don't pass judgment. Even as one child, who's father is played by Chris Rock, welcomes Alex to the group by hitting him with a stick and seems to find an accident around every corner.<br /><br />  Now, even as someone who's never been expecting, the book of the same name was something I'd heard of before and as a result I would've known what this movie was about even without seeing the trailer. And, as was the case with He's Just Not That Into You, another movie based on an eponymous self-help book, there isn't much to see here. The characters themselves are exaggerated and the connections between them strain credibility and imagination. It isn't offensive, though I might feel differently if I had or was going to have children, but it isn't that entertaining either. There are some cheap laughs and shallow dramatic moments, but nothing that funny or insightful. If you are about to have children, skip the movie, read the book. And as someone who is beyond tired of hearing other people say \\"the book was much better than the movie\\" it pains me to say that.oing to have children, but it isn't that entertaining either.

I personally could have done without some of the language in some instances but with that aside, this is a very fascinating read with plot twists and changes that will keep you on edge to the very end.

But as others have said here, the more you listen to Tempest, the more hooked you may become. Subtleties of the music and the impressionistic-like lyrics start to settle in your brain as you listen. You carry them around. Such CDs for me are the best, the ones that take some time and effort.<br />Dylan in his last several works alludes often to earlier artists, particularly the old bluesmen, their styles and phrases. His creativity is not mere derivation, though. He makes the allusions work for him as tools to create his distinct and memorable own.<br />My favorites (as I write this) are \\"Duquesne Whistle,\\" \\"Soon After Midnight\\" and \\"Narrow Way,\\" the first three tracks. But the longer tracks that follow have begun to work for me too. Tempest is a little dark and severe through most, but with Dylanesque whimsy. It's not fluff. It's substantial. It's different, and well worth the effort - his and yours.
B000K2Q5X4|5.0|I've gone back and ordered these old Whitesnake Cds. Really cool with Bonus Tracks !! I gotta tell you if you like real Rock n' Roll. These Cds are Awesome !! David's vocals are superb. Also future Black Sabbath member Neil Murray on bass. And the late GREAT Jon Lord (Deep Purple) on keyboards and Ian Paice (Deep Purple) on drums. The guitar players are very solid as well. Until I got these older Whitesnake discs the oldest one I had was \\"Slide It In\\". I was not disappointed by these older discs. A real pleasure listening to some Real Rock N' Roll.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I was first hooked on this series after watching part of the HBO TV Series.<br />I was hesitant purchasing the eBook as it is sometimes difficult to translate motion picture to paper and vice versa.<br />However, George RR Martin's books simply jump from the paper. Well worth the read. 5 Stars hands down.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this show!  And the second series is even better than the first one!  I watch it over and over again and the quality is excellent.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Great brain exercise, and lots of fun. I don't even mind the kids wasting their time on it, because of the educational value.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was okay. The writing isn't the best, but the content was interesting. The second and third books were repetitious and boring. I kept expecting something, anything to happen. It never did. I would recommend the first book, but not the other two. They were highly disappointing.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Full of adventure and  you never know what may happen. Great for a movie day when it is raining all day and you can watch them back to back.<br />I look f orward to the new one in theaters.
B008IZ5LXA|5.0|Dexter is one of the best written, and portrayed, characters/program in history - Start at the beginning and see for yourself: [[ASIN:B000JO9Y6I Pilot]]... For six solid seasons, I have been impressed with how this program has managed to uphold the quality of script and performances - OUTSTANDING!  While it's sad that Dexter may only have until season 8 before bidding us adieu, I am grateful to have been along for the bloody ride into one of the most endearing psyches of all time!  Bravisimo!!!, to the writing team, Michael C Hall, and the entire cast & crew of Dexter... Can't wait for the next two seasons...
B008KL2ITW|3.0|Not quite what I expected but still a good read.  The reviews said it was along the same lines as 50 Shades but I didn't really see the comparison.  Still enjoyed it.
034580404X|5.0|Everywhere I turned I heard about 50 shades of grey. The book was on the news, radio, tv, internet everywhere I went it seemed someone was talking about it. What I heard was the book was bondage and sex.<br />I was not interested in reading this book. That just is not my type of book. I finally gave in and started reading but said I was only going to read the first book, 50 Shades of Grey. Well, I started reading and I could not stop! Yes the book has LOTS of sex and there is bondage but that is really not what the book is. The development of the characters and seeing how they grow and deal with issues, this is the real story.<br />Now I am one of those people that is always talking about it. I finished reading book three, 50 Shades Freed and I just wanted to start from the beginning and read it all again. I would and I do recommend for everyone to read these books!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing it every day.  Plays well and is easy to learn.  Great game.  Everyone should have fun with this one on Kindle Fire.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Better than the book. An interesting surprise. JL brings an edge that works. The fashion is strange in comparison to the 30\\"s vibe in 12. Will see how they manage to continue.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The issue I usually have with brain games is that they are stressful.  This game is challenging and requires the player to think several steps ahead, but utilizes serene music and graphics to counterbalance the exercise.  Use the titles of each puzzle for clues on how to solve it.
B006O2QNOU|3.0|These guys should be in jail. The actors humanize them. But they came close to destroying the system. And they are still playing the game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is uber fun! I love getting points and playing all the different games. some are easy and some are harder but i enjoy this app
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|Fresh and fun.  Plot is a little weak, But  the presentation is fabulous.  A nice feel good movie. The acting is wonderful.  Very nostalgic.
B00005CCK5|5.0|I am enjoying the Buffalo Springfield cd with the song Bluebird on it.<br />It has a very clear sound and I feel like I am right there with them in concert.
1451696191|2.0|Instead of list the same criticisms as others, which I agree with, I want to mention something else problematic, which I am seeing in a lot of reviews. I think people need to reconsider the idea that this is a modern Catcher in the Rye, despite the many comparisons between the works.  I am not saying this book does not live up to Salinger's masterpiece, which frankly I don't believe it does, but instead criticizing the comparison of the two books. Catcher in the Rye is considered a classic because anyone can read the book at any time and relate and understand the content. Classics are mainly defined by their endurance and universality, not by the time in which they are written but instead speak to a relevant theme that does not lose importance over periods of time (see: Shakespeare)<br /><br />The only similarities between these works are the narration by a teenage boy and the prevailing theme of mental illness. Likewise, all the references to the pop culture of the early '90s, whether or not they help or  detract from the book, also separates the two novels, as Catcher had almost no references to the youth culture of his time. Another issue for me is that this novel came out in 1999, and, while it has generated a lot of buzz over the past 13 years, we have yet to really find out if this is a book that can be considered a \\"classic.\\"<br /><br />Ironically, this idea is  carefully discussed in the most memorable conversation in Perks.  In the passage, the group is discussing the comparison of Kurt Cobain to John Lennon and Jim Morrison. They discuss how deeming Cobain a new version of any historical figure cheapens both parties. Kurt Cobain should be just as important and monumental as himself- it makes him less significant to cut and edit his image to fit within the constrictions of someone else.<br /><br />The same goes for this book- it should stand on its own and define itself without a comparison to a different work. The idea of it being a \\"modern Catcher in theRye\\" cheapens Catcher's legacy and diminishes Perks' relevance as well- A book is not regarded as better or more important when it is dubbed a modern re-telling of a classic.  The strongest works are in their own class and remain that way over long stretches of time.<br /><br />Of course, I don't believe its a strong enough book to remain a classic in future years. I view it as a very broad outlook on a very specific time. I only see it resonant now because a lot of us are familiar with the culture of that time firsthand or even secondhand. In fifty years, readers will not catch on to the 90s references of mix tapes and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Similarly, the ambitious mentioning of every \\"textbook\\" teenage issue from the last decade is a major weakness.  Most of them are casually mentioned and then dropped; for example, his sister's abortion takes up about a chapter and then never mentioned again.  An influential book generally deal with only one or two of the issues Chbosky includes over the span of the entire novel.  For example, some people have compared it with Go Ask Alice, but Go Ask Alice dealt with drug abuse and running away from home in depth over the course of the entire novel.  Sure, there are mentions of other things, like underage sex and teenage pregnancy, but they are not the themes.  The reason for this is that Go Ask Alice is actually a young woman's journal, and Chbosky's fictional characters deal with an unbelievable amount of drama for people their age.  I do not know anyone who experienced all of these issues, i.e., alienation, homosexuality, teenage pregnancy, bullying, suicide, molestation, drug use, teen sex, etc. all over the course of one year in high school.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This story takes you into the nightmarish psyche of a broken, maimed and half-crazed young woman who has lived through the horror of seeing and hearing her family being murdered, while she crouched under a bed,  at the age of 8. I found this to be a well-written story by an author who shows great insight and awareness into the weaknesses and strengths of the human spirit.<br /><br />(I purchased this book from Amazon.com/Kindle)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|nice slow paced game. like the different types of coins and the collection part of the game. wondering and waiting to see if other levels canny be unlocked. .
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is amazing, and its a great roadtrip time passer, but I agree it should be free if you have Pc version. the download should be free so you can log in as your account. then if you don't have one it should be available to buy a full account or just a pocket edition. other than that the game is amazing and any person who says its too expensive, ( and obviously hasn't played or own it)  ((which should be fixed by amazon since there false reviews))  is wrong. its worth 7 dollars or however many euros.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent insight for people who are curious about the life of our soldiers, risking their lives for our freedom.  Action with a touch of politics.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is good but after a while it gets old haven't played the puzzles but look good have fun.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game is called coin DOZER for a reason. I freaking fell asleep just watching this stupid game. No matter how many 5 star reviews people give it. This by far the worst app ever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game<br />awesome game<br />ssswwweeettttt I love this game because you need to earn the next levle it is very very very very very very very hhhhaaaarrrdddd
B0086700CM|1.0|it wont dowen lowed so I woledint no if its good or not so please fix all the problemes it creates
B0063IH60K|5.0|works fine for me. having to turn off the ads between each game is a bit of a pain, but i can live with it. i enjoy using this on my new kindle fire.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Okay. I loved this app honestly. I used it to download EVER bit of my music. Now it's not letting me download anything, as a MP3 or Video. It wont even let me view it online. So I say, update it to where it works, and ill change my rate.
B007SGM084|5.0|The details of this man's life before and after are well written.  They make you think and wonder but don't give it away too soon.  This kept me up hours of the night reading because I just couldn't find a stopping point.  Great plot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love all the games. I play them all the time.  my daughter loves them too.  very kid friendly and educational.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Nice app for the kids and myself as well. The touch controls to swap are a bit nonresponsive (on kindle fire) so I took off one star. Perhaps a stylus would work better. And even if the math is not hard, fitting the pieces together especially as it goes faster is quite a challenge !
B000002VMD|1.0|The wrong cd was inside of the the package.  Not worth the effort to return.  Very disappointing.  The cd in the package was unknown, with 6 songs on it that i have never heard before.
B00005JKNF|3.0|The acting is good, but overall a let down. To me it came accross as another \\"Clue\\" movie. The story line was eratic, and at times very predictable.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Confusing at first but great as a whole. the night circus is somewhat sad...a tryst of sorts. but i loved it.
0345525558|5.0|A beautiful but painful story presented in an unusual expression of the journey of this young woman's survival. Basically,the process of attaching to another in a relationship after years of rejection. The story goes back and forth from the causes to the present consequences of her history. I couldn't put the book down so it was a fast read but most likely I will reread it to enjoy the the writing and the language of flowers.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love my Kindle Fire and I love Pinterest, but they don't seem to love each other.  It crashes twice for every one time I get it to run successfully.  When it does run, the interface is nice and easy to use.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol Blu-Ray disk arrived quickly and was just what we were looking for. The quality is great!
B0091THDOM|5.0|What a great case and at a wonderful price. As I write, I'm gently stretching the leather of the case with all of my assorted cards and phone in place. I generally carry four credit card type cards and in addition to that I also have auto insurance cards and health cards and they are all beginning to fit perfectly into the card slot, with a little help. I'm stretching the leather. I've moistened a paper towel and with all the cards and phone in the case I wrapped the moist towel around it to let the leather soak up some of the moisture. The case is now slowly drying on the vent of my TV where a gentle warm breeze is beginning to dry it out. This is the second and last time that I'll need to do this because the case has already stretched and taken shape for all  that I need to carry with me. With all of my cards in place the phone slides out perfectly with the help of this wonderfully engineered pull system that was used in this iPhone 5 case. Bravo!
B008JH5FZ6|5.0|It looked like a good movie and it was. I was pleantly surprised and will watch it again with others. I streamed it on my computer for my own pleasure. I much rather watch by myself soI can hear all the dialoge. don't like to listen to others comment on everything while the show is on. But it is a show worth seeing. Some humor. Lots of action.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am a huge pintrest fanatic and was so excited to see an app for the kindle. So much easier to browse now. My only complaint is every once in awhile it freezes when opening and I have to force close. Only bug I have found!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest so I love to be able to have it as an app on my kindle!!! I only have one compliant and that is the it stalls every once and a while and force closes.<br /><br />but I love my pinterest app!
B009329ZF2|2.0|movie was ok.  would have rather rented from redbox.  glad I didn't go to theatre to see it.  would suggest people see it and make their own opinion
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is an addicting fun puzzle game and can sometimes be challenging.  I definitely recommend it.  A B C
B006GGR5QY|5.0|Melancholy, contemplative music.  Love this album and recommend it often to people over on Facebook.  Great mood setter for me when I write, also!  Don't hesitate if you like classical music.  Very reasonable price, too!
0525953728|4.0|Various reviews and people from Pentagon have stated that classified material was divulged in this book but like a knife edge and crossing your finger over it, do you get cut or not, even if the knife is shape?  The author touch only the surface of the matter but never gives details, this in itself was a very cleaver approach but people forget that Tom Clancy's first novel, \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" was questionable, even with its crapy ending. Clancy used Jane's Flight Ships as his source of reference in finding details about submarines, so you be the judge and not the DoD, this coming someone who has served for nearly 21 years with the Navy and yes, I did work with the Seals but never was one and has a TS clearance.  I still believe in the idea as \\"We, the People, for the  People\\" not the government dedicating our rights with regards to \\"Freedom of Speech and Press\\".  Read and enjoy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it find wonderful recipes and fun crafts to do with my children looking forward to finding fun Christmas ideas
B00902AKK4|5.0|fun game if you like games that challenge you.  I recommend this game for you people who want to spend much time on your device. so go on click the button and start playing. TTYL OUT!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I am so glad I went out on a limb and bought this album. I had never heard of this band before but amazon recommended it, it had good reviews, and I enjoyed the samples. Now I can't stop playing it over and over again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I must admit that this has taken my Pinterest love to an obsession.  I've had no issues with the app. I take it to the fabric store when working on projects.  My husband thinks I'm crazy until I show him how much money we save.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I like hack and slash games. I like hacking. I like slashing. I like games. I really really like it.
B0000V6SOG|5.0|My wife and I saw this movie only a few months ago, we really loved it and the music was just so well suited to it, we bought the CD and it is just as good as the movie.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love book 1 & 2<br />Historical novels are fascinating<br />I wish the author had given a date span thru the struggles of the knights<br />& the self sworn kings. The characters<br />are all likable. Can hardly put the book down
B003Y5USG4|4.0|but she was a little disappointed that it was not played full-screen that's why I gave it four stars.  We tried to change it, but couldn't figure out if there was a way, like on a regular DVD.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I had no idea who Bob Marley was other than the great reggae musician before I watched this. This completely opened my eyes to Marley in this very telling story. All the greats die young.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I am getting tired of all the technical terms and talk. I like to know some of it,but cut it back some please.
1596680296|3.0|Excellent step by step photos.  Tip boxes with information to enhance your sock, ie avoid leaving a hole when  picking up stitches, how to and many other helpful ways to make your  first socks, well made ones.<br />Gives recipes for 5 different gauges of sock yarn and 5 different basic sock instructions with that specific type of yarn.  Goes on To give instructions on how to make less basic socks. A terrific book to get you through the confusing bit of gussett decreasing and picking up stitches.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|I have been teaching my grandsons, 6 and 8, about the Trojan War and they are very familiar with the story and the players. After reviewing the movie, I decided, with my daughter's approval, that they were ready to see it. Its the first pg-13 movie they have seen so I had to distract them and fast-forward through the love scenes, which were mild and few anyway.<br />I also reminded them of the few differences between what we've learned from Homer and Virgil and how Hollywood chose to portray it.<br />I loved it and each of the boys have told me how much they loved it. They even asked if they could see it again the next time we visit. They live on the East Coast. I live on the West Coast.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use it constantly. Love the low light options so I can use it in church without being disruptive. I wish it was easier to make notes.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Forced myself to get to te final surprise ending. Mostly a page turner that droned on and on.  The end, finally.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes posting on pinterest from my kindle super convient and I'm able to keep all my pinterest organized and at my fingertips. It has frozen a couple of times but all have to do is exit the app and go back in. Nothing but a minor clich. Overall I love this app.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a Navy Veteran, I have great respect for the Navy Seals.  This was a great read.  Not too political, other than the obvious feelings of angst between the military and politicians in general.<br />I enjoyed the first hand account, and the inside view into the life of a Navy Seal.  The sacrifices that these men, and especially their families give for our freedom is not fully known.  I appreciate their service.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some of the games are a little hard, but its great when you're bored!  :) :) gcug cyfdh cyhff Gerhard fthdc hgdvjy d
B0091THRCU|5.0|At first I didn't understand this case.  It was too tight!  Though once I realized that the flap was a release mechanism (rather than a poor excuse for a money clip!), I was very happy with this case.  It adds very little to the overall girth of the iPhone 5 in your pocket and is very durable.  It is very much worth the price.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the app itself! there's so many creative ideas on here its truly got everything. but it tends to freeze up a lot and kicks me put regularly. other than that its great
B00181MHQU|5.0|One of the classics! I can watch it over and over. I always use an excerpt on this movie when I teach Romeo and Juliet.
B00006AW63|3.0|I have had this dvd for a while. I gave it as a gift and recently found out that it can not be viewed on any dvd player here in the United States. It is in UK format....there are no options to change this anywhere on the new blu ray dvd players we have or the old regular dvd players we have. Any suggestions?
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is one of the best free games Amazon has to offer! Create share and play! Resteraunt Story is fun for all of those who like all of the above!
B004BBDHEK|5.0|For sure this album represents a big step: new sounds, new producers, new arrangements and new musicians. And it, just like yanni's previous works, just fits! You can't go wrong with the majestic notes of Voyage nor can you resist the classical yanni's-esque Notes of Mist Of A Kiss. The entire album is truly a heartfelt work of art while still fitting tones of today's more contemporary melodies. And for sure tracks like I'm So are very unexpected for familiar yanni's listeners. He's managed to get it perfect, again and for sure we cannot wait for the orchestral renditions of the songs!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy listening as well as reading from this. It helped me during my Bible study group I searched for certain verses guickly and very smoothly. Now everyone in my group uses kindle fires. Even my children enjoy the readings from the Bible this is our biggest study guide.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I liked the first book better. This book was repetitive. You do learn a little background info on Cristian. Hopefully the 3rd is more exciting.
0470570954|4.0|This book is fantastic, beautifully written. I can't imagine how much time went into creating this monster of a book.<br /><br />But for anyone starting out as biochemist, this is total overkill. Although it's easy to read, it's a reference book simply because there is so much information and detail.<br />So for all but the very hardest working students, it can't be recommended.<br /><br />The price, especially the kindle price, is actually very good value for the quality you get.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Great quality. I have problems or complaints with this product. It's an awesome continuation of the story that I think everyone should watch at least once.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Very elegant and beautiful Bluetooth case. very comfortable and practical case.Very smooth and quick transaction. and very good price. really protect your device
B00571F26Y|4.0|[[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]<br />My spouse has an intolerance to gluten and is interested in any information about being gluten free. This book is very informative,<br />an interesting read and it is about time someone in the medical profession looked at this problem in a practical way. Yes you can happily live without Wheat.<br />Thank you William Davis MD.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Lots of questions and puzzling omitted situations are reserved for the last chapter. The story is interesting enough to continue to the third book.
B003UXRZ0M|4.0|This is an extremely funny episode. Seriously, the first time Cara had to speak like a princess, I thought I'd die. This character has had to make a few uncomfortable sacrifices throughout the series. This was by far the most interesting (and comical). It's not a matter of dressing up, or knowing people; it really isn't like other stories where impersonation was key to the plot. Great story! (And I loved the teasing Kaylan gave them at the end.)
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A lot of standard navy seal stuff, hard training, brotherhood, commitment, and patriotism. insight into the OSB  raid was interesting. Political undertones were revealing.  Overall a good read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I keep getting the message that the app is not responding and I have to force close. Today it took three forced closings before it would open. I have rebooted my Fire but still have same issues. Even with issues I still enjoy the app very much.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|DO NOT PRINT REVIEW.  I DO NOT WANT MY LAST NAME OR CITY INCLUDED.  y that, although changes in time periods throughout,  were easy to follow to the conclusion and truly surprise endings.  Very hard to put down.  Looking forward to more books authored by Ms. Morton.  I selected these books thru \\"amazon/kindle\\" which I find so easy to handle when reading and convenient to carry when traveling.  I did not want my last name or city included in review.
B000MGATTE|4.0|While this was not one of my favorite Stephen King novels I did find it to be a fun look inside an author's mind.  I think the fact that a novel is described as following a string and hoping it doesn't break before the end of the story a really interesting way to look at how an author shapes his craft.  I will keep on reading Mr. King's novels for as long as he continues to write them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|there is nothing on the actual site that you cant do easily on the app. now I can take my addiction everywhere with me on my kindle fire.
1401937268|5.0|In the past I have messed with traditional tarot decks but lost interest pretty quickly as I didn't get much out of the imagery on them. A friend of mine suggested I get this one. And wow!! When I got the deck I went through each card individually. As I looked at the beautiful artwork I tried to guess what each card meant without letting my eyes wander to the bottom of the card and then looked them up and I was right on most of them! I have used this deck every day since I got it. If I dont' have a specific question I just pull a card for the day and even have my husband doing it as well. It is amazing how accurate this deck is and the answers have calmed me down with things I was worried about before drawing the cards. The energy of this deck will really amaze you. I keep them on my coffee table and sometimes I'll just grab them and look at the artwork. I'm so glad I listened to my friend and got them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pintrest!  I was super excited to see the app for the Kindle Fire!  I'm on it daily. Its one of the best apps ever to find just about anything!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is very easy to use and is a perfect little calculator&hellip; I highly recommend it!! The buttons are big and it has an interesting memory that doesn't allow my entries to be lost &hellip; buy it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I remember Julian Fellowes from Monarch of the Glen where he played Kilwillie, neighbor of the MacDonald's. What a creative man to craft such a vivid story. Downton Abbey follows the lives of the Crawley family and their servants.  Last season shows us how WWI changed everyones life forever. The characters of Downton Abbey are loving, hard working, loathsome, funny and clueless.  I'm looking forward to season three with (hopefully) Mary and Matthew's wedding.  This series is filmed on location at Highclere Castle in England.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this!!!!!! I am always on it and I've learnt soooo much from it!!!!! Download it......you won't regret it:)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first, I was not sure that I would like this book, but I wanted to see what the hype was all about.  I definitely wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  When I first started reading it, it sounded strange like some science fiction thing.  The book quickly developed the scene and characters, so it made more sense.  Once, I started reading, I could not put it down.  Some descriptions were a little graphic, but overall I was not overly sensitive to the material.  I am speaking as someone who cannot read material about abused children.  I would definitely recommend it.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|The length of this book is justified.There is a lot in it. It was the first Steven King book I have bought in a while and I did so because the death of Kennedy has always intrigued me.I was 12 at the time. Everyone my age remembers where they were when Kennedy was shot. What really happened??? That question is not really answered or at least not in a satisfactory way but that is not Kings purpose. What if you could go back and change the past? What if you could go back with knowledge of which horse which team won? I rate the book highly as it delves into fairly complex human emotional issues and the core question of \\"what is the purpose of my being here?\\" King deals with these matters in an everyday folksy manner that is an easy read. He takes you to the time and emerges you in the mood of the time. I picked it up in Sydney airport as a filler for a couple of hours. It is a lot better than that. I finished it two weeks on and enjoyed it all the way. So its not a book you cant put down but one you want to pick up again and get back to. A well woven product.
B008LD4126|2.0|Being a dedicated Elbow fan I mulled over whether or not to buy this album having read the reviews and listened to snippets of a few songs.  My total admiration for all their earlier releases finally overcame any lingering doubts.  Oh dear !!  With one or two exceptions this collection of so called B-sides seldom reaches the heights of previous Elbow releases.  I must say despite the honest album description (a collection of B-sides) I can't help feeling disappointed with the band's decision to release this material. If you are new to Elbow and want to start with their latest release I would advise against starting here.  Better start with The Seldom Seen Kid which is probably their strongest and most commercially successful album to date.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|After a full hour of sitting through tiny snippets of scenes, \\"dollops\\" of information, and what can only be described as a Picasso-esque plot, I simply had to give up. Not all the lovely production values or great actors in the world could make me sit through another minute of this movie. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was happening, or where it was happening, or when it was happening, or why it was happening.<br /><br />This is why this movie stank: 1) You can't care about what happens to characters if you don't actually know what is happening to them, 2) You can't get involved in a story if you can't figure out what the story is.<br /><br />This is the second LeCarre novel Focus Features has wrecked. Someone needs to stop them. Discreetly.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Seven retired seniors discover an ad for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India on the Internet and all, for various personal reasons,decide to relocate to India.  To their disappointment, their prospective hotel is a far cry from the exotic paradise described in the literature.  A grand lot of professional Brit actors give outstanding performances in an exotic country full of life and color.  It is indeed a feel good movie with some life lessons thrown in here and there right up to the very end. The DVDs were packaged well and arrived two days after I placed my order.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars if it had been directed by someone other than the sleaze ball \\"Rupert Sanders\\".
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Usually, I don't enjoy seeing the movies as much as I do reading the books but The Hunger Games DVD was very good and I hope they produce the remaining movies sooner rather than later.  The acting by one and all is stellar and the action kept me interested all the way through even though I knew the outcome.  I would recommend this movie especially to those who read the books - I do not think you will be disappointed.  It was packaged well and arrived before the estimated delivery time.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|My first android game. Easy to play. I am never a gamer. I just to kill time. Much better than playing the stupid Angry Bird.
B007TR1R22|3.0|I bought this movie for my BFF (she loves Tom Hiddleston) and she loved it. I, on the other hand, thought it was so-so. It moved a little slow at times but the acting was good so it was bearable to watch. I would watch it again if the opportunity arose.
B0078XGJQQ|5.0|Rhonda Byrne has written several books I have read all of them, and they are all empowering books.In everyone's life there is a time for the need to be uplifted and this book does just that. It is positive from front to back. A very good book for teenagers to read.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my first time reading a book from John Green. I thought it was a well written awesome book for people young and old. Sad and inspiring, deep and reflective. This book gives all you all of the \\"feels\\". If you are considering purchasing this book don't hesitate, buy it now!
B0079J28NW|5.0|Great movie- awesome Blu-ray re-issue. Worth every penny. Completely satisfied with my purchase. Would highly recommend. Enjoy the ride to Pepperland!
0345803493|5.0|This was an amazing triology of books. It was an exiciting read and it was very hard to put the book down. It showed the innocence and vunerbility of ana. It made them discover a lot about themselves.  I purchased the books from amazon.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I seem to enjoy this version more than the original. It will stump you at times, but there is a hint system, and you could also search the web for help. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzles.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool 1 is a classic science fiction short story with a twist ending, and I was skeptical when the story continued after that.  Wool 2 is a little rocky as it makes the transition from short story to novel, but after that the series just keeps building momentum.  The best part is how all the oppressive rules like the Cleaning actually make sense once you know the whole story.  Everything fits together to make a self sustaining social system.  Like all the best distopias, it challenges to the reader with the idea that maybe all the terrible rules really do serve the greater good.

B007SGM084|4.0|I cannot seem to put these books down! Right from the start the energy between Mr. Gray and Miss Steele captures and holds my attention, keeping me turning page after page.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This author has created a very different type of romance story that is very believable.  I also appreciated that the book moves along at a comfortable pace without slowing down often so the reader gets bored.
B007TMON8M|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and frustration..I have had to think and rethink my projects to get them to work within the allowed budget. I was thrilled when they finally worked.
B00338QENI|4.0|Amazing insight into the lives of Henrietta and her family. Her story should be included in the teaching of HeLa cells!!
B002N2XI0W|5.0|God is running the Pat Peoples's movie in Pat's head. Matthew Quick composed the score for the movie. Fugues are for two voices with a theme of imitation and repetition. A fugue state is a psychological time out. Fugue within fugue within movie. Pat Peoples timed out and the people in his new place outside the bad place won't tell him where he is in the composition. Pat skipped a groove. Tiffany skipped a groove. Quick uses repetition ingeniously, like stuck vinyl. Repetition is imperative to survival. Pat runs. Tiffany runs. Separately together. They are cast out of the tribe by the workings of their brains. The past isn't a safe place, the future is out of control, and the present has so many dangers, it's intolerable. Except for the Philadelphia Eagles. And dance. Every character in Quick's debut novel is someone we know. The distant father, striving mother, congenial brother, narcissistic partner, best friend, confidante in adversity. We all are intimately familiar with the sporadically misfiring circuitry in our heads. Each plot element is orchestrated with consummate skill by a master artisan. The frying brain circuitry launched by Kenny G's screeching alto sax. Tiffany's recidivist effort to change the one scenario she can't possibly. The tailgate parking lot community, hours before game time, and the mortal combat for traditional space. Luck. No luck. Control. No control. Happy endings. Neural health institutes. Authentic jerseys and trash bags. Life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loved it its amazing and you must buy it it is the best it has so many fun fun fun games
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I think this game is fun and a bit addictive .. great time killer on a Sunday morning. I wouldn't pay for it..but for a free app u cant complain
0156030306|5.0|An absolute classic story. Very well written and Mr. Keyes character development of Charlie was absolutely amazing. Wonderful read and would definitely recommend buying this book. Oh and just an fyi, I bought it on Kindle, and found zero conversion editing errors.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie is a decent adaptation of the book. The characters were well cast and the actors did a great job bringing them to life. I can't wait to see Catching Fire!
1451627297|2.0|Never read a Stephen King novel, so this was a first. I decided to give this one a try because it had a pretty interesting concept and reading the reviews, you'd think this book could cure cancer. I think readers of the older generation or who enjoyed that time period may get a whole lot more from this book than I did. I'm only 24 and knew nothing about the JFK shooting conspiracy except that Oswald was the man who everyone thinks shot him. 800+ pages later, I feel like I just read about a man meandering around different cities trying to figure out how to stop Oswald, finds love, more stuff happens, and then the book ends. I don't know, I guess it just wasn't for me.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book of the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a good read, but more of the same in the first 2 books. I wouldn't go for a fourth!
B0063GORYU|5.0|SPIDER is a great game, and one you can leave and come back to.  I win enough times to keep me coming back for more.  Wonderful time killer when waiting for an appt!
1936608898|5.0|You don't have to be confused by conflicting reports about which foods are best for optimal health.  Instead follow the plan outlined in It All Starts With Food and find out for your self exactly which foods work best FOR YOU.  The authors will take you step by step and there is also a website for further support as you go through your personal experiment to create the diet that fits your body's needs.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a great read although I was a little disappointed<br />that I didn't learn any secrets. I recommend it.
0525423842|5.0|Great teen read. Brimming with intrigue and suspense. Can't go wrong with International bestseller, John Grisham. Would recommend to ages 13+ or pre-teens who are advanced readers.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is almost exactly what it should be, if it would just get it together. I am constantly having to force close the app on the initial start up and that's extremely annoying. There also is no button to reload more pins once you get to the end of a page, and that's a disappointment. Otherwise it's near perfect.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|twice I have taken a character. to level 65 only to have it be auto deleted.  what a bunch of bs.  I would not recommend this game.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|I returned the item as it was not the version of the item that I requested.<br />I received the All Zone UK version instead of the US Warner Brother Version.
B003405MF6|3.0|I cannot give this album less than 3 stars, just because it's Jeff Beck. It's certainly worth some listening appeal for that alone. That said, I found this disc somewhat of a letdown. I heard glowing reviews and effusive praise from several famous guitar players, so I figured I must just not be \\"hearing it\\" the right way. Well, sad to say, after a couple of years, it hasn't grown on me. I like Beck doing his version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow, but not this studio take. Nessun Dorma had the promise of something quite breathtaking, but Jeff just doesn't sound inspired on that one. The \\"rocking\\" songs don't rock hard enough (Hammerhead), and the covers don't bring anything new or interesting to the table. Live at Ronnie Scott's is a better overview of Jeff (and his usual stellar band), and You Had It Coming is a more interesting studio album with more inspired and unexpected playing by JB. Emotion and Commotion is quite vanilla, sadly.
B007MG360G|5.0|This game is sort of  a puzzle game. It's well worth buying. It gets a little addictive. Love this game!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is better than the weather channel app.  In addition to the information that it provides, the design and style of this app is cool.  I highly recommend this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am loving this series by Suzanne Collins. The twists and turns as the pages turn are awe inspiring and upbeat!!! I am looking forward to reading the final book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really liked this book. I had heard so many good things about it from so many people, so I decided to read it. I read it all in one sitting, and I am now reading it again because I read it too fast to appreciate it fully. Great book!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|my absolutely favorote game I actually bought it by accident and so then I had to play it since it coated $2 and it was so worth it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't believe I am reading the last book (book five) in GRRM's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. It's hard to fathom that I am almost done with this wonderful tale of kings, knights and all of GRRM's great characters. As you go through the series, you get to intimately know the characters and develop your own love/hate relationship with each one. GRRM does such a great job of character development that the story flows smoothly. If you love period dramas, this series will captivate you and keep you wanting more. Although the books are 800 to a 1000 pages in length, you really don't realize the magnitude of the work because of the great tale being told. I read the series on my Kindle and other than looking at the percentage read I was at the end of each book before I knew it. I highly recommend this series. I also watched the HBO adaptation of \\"The Game of Thrones\\" the first book in the series after I read the book. This series is a MUST read.
0316044695|5.0|This was a fantastic book. Great action read. Godbless all of our SEALs and all of our armed forces. Can't wait for the movie!!

B002ZG97LK|3.0|his second in the remake movie list comes up short only in the not enough dancing category. I would have had to give a 4 str rating, but more dance scenes kept it back, but is worth watching , just for he story line.Richie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This review is superflurous.  \\"Wool\\" (however you approach it...bit by bit or omnibus) is extraordinarily well written.  It verges on \\"literature\\" although very little literature delivers as much imagination and action in a small space as does \\"Wool\\".<br /><br />I pity the \\"hard science\\" people however who complain that the protagonist should have suffered from the bends or point out things like the absence of elevators in a 140 (underground) structure when clearly the technology was entirely capable of providing same.  Well, even my brain was a bit distracted by the dive sequence but on the absence of elevators, for instance, the story in fact makes it very clear why that was so.  The fact that no character discussed it but the author allowed the reason to become evident to the reader with a bit of thought is a strength, not a weakness: its all there, its just not spoon-fed.<br /><br />On the other hand, hard science aficionados should really, really appreciate the sympathetic and realistic portrayal of engineers.  I can't think of another work in this genre that is as gritty and realistic about what engineering reality is: the repair of the main generator shaft is a classic.<br /><br />So get the omnibus (the bit-by-bit approach will totally frustrate you) and enjoy a morally-driven story.  Warning: Libertarians among you will sneer at the sense of community, sacrifice-of-the-individual-for-the-group that is so evident but you will miss a wonderful story if you let that hang-up get in the way.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|its nice having a bigger screen but no push notification...<br />ill give 5 stars once that is up. other than that i have no complaints
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you like a book with lots of plot twists and turns plus a surprise ending-this is the book for you...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|While I agree that ordinarily the Seals should not reveal details about their missions, this is a story that every American who lived through 9/11 has a right to hear in order to help bring as-close-as-you-can-get-to closure to a horrible event that changed our world. This is an exciting story about incredible heroes and I could have kept reading this book forever. Unfortunately I finished it in less than 2 days as I couldn't put it down once I started. I'm so glad this book was written and, even though it's clear that some sensitive but non-essential details are left out, it tells the story so well that it makes you want to cheer while reading. We should all sleep better knowing that we have something of an idea what these guys go through to make the world a safer place.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game was one of the best games I have played.  Well worth the money and was really a lot of fun.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is super fun and highly addictive in a good way this could keep you occupied for hours!!:) must get app
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another Jack Reacher story that keeps the reader guessing and engrossed.<br />The recounting of the length of time and number of cars passing him by before being picked up gives the reader an insight to his mode of travelling across and around the US and is in keeping with the other novels.<br />The riddle about the two minute talk without using \\"a\\" is handy way to encourage others to read this book.<br />Another gripping tale of a modern knight errant, who does not always come up perfect.<br /><br />Please do not tell me it is true that they have picked Tom Cruise to portray him in the movies, it will turn non readers off and maybe the likes of me too! The role deserves a more rugged type!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Installed app with the proper printer from their list but it failed to even print a test page. No charge except my time
B003A060TW|2.0|My comments below are about the vinyl pressing itself and not the musical talent of Caribou.<br /><br />This album was obviously designed for the CD market. The liner notes are CD sized and the vinyl itself is a pretty weak pressing. The discs are thin and ended up slightly warped by the time I got them. Both discs in the set skip way more than any of my other records and there is an explained crackling noise in certain parts (no matter how many times I recalibrate my arm or clean the needle, the noises are still there) that aren't on the CD.<br /><br />The music itself is killer, which is why I'm disappointed.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|A pretty good puzzler where you push bubbles around in a 2D maze with hazards, warp spots and one way doors.  Some puzzle boards also allow you to wrap the board around (top to bottom, left to right).  Your goal is to achieve clear the board in the minimum number of moves.  Pleasing graphics, good gameplay and a good ramp up in puzzle difficulty makes this a keeper for me!
B006LSZECO|1.0|What can one say about a book that has a plot that makes no sense and has a million holes in it, characters that have bizarre motivations that render them unlike human beings, and an ending that is laughable and improbable?<br /><br />Oh, I know what one can say, \\"It's junk.\\"  Don't waste your time or money on this book.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I am going to say that I'm a sap.  I also did not read the book before seeing Beastly. If you take the movie for what it is, it's actually quite good.  I don't spend my time hung up on plausibility and what the book says. It's not high brow it's mindless entertainment.<br /><br />The actors were pretty good.  Alex Pettyfer has raw talent.  It would be interesting to see how his career will turn out as he matures. Story reminds me of Beauty and the Beast. They should have given more time for character development. For instance Lindy's father was barely seen.<br /><br />I do think the alternate ending was better than what they ultimately used but again, we're dealing with continuity issues with the second ending because the bad guy showed up from nowhere.  If they expanded the time for the movie maybe it would work.<br /><br />Anyway for the price of this movie, it's worth it.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Very good book, action scenes were very well written and fast paced.  Some of the storyline dragged a little, but when the action was there it kept you reading.
0061020680|5.0|Typical Pratchett genuis. It's not so much his stories--though, who could resist Death taking an apprentice--it's his mastery of the English language and his play with the genre. Every one of his books is pure candy, and Mort is definitely one of his best. It's typical Pratchett: a comedic story of ridiculous proportions with charming characters (like my favorite, Death), but that seems to run head long, incidentally, into a bit of truth. And many, many profound lines that should become idioms of the English language. Grade: A
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I enjoy reading Kathy Reichs novels. \\"Bones are Forever\\" was heavy going for me. I didn't enjoy it as much as others of her books.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|There is only one reason to watch this: the iconic Bruce Lee at his best in an English-language film.  His other previous films were released in Chinese but this was his introduction to the American film industry.  Here he takes on the evil and fallen Shaolin Temple trained student now a crime lord. The plot is decent but the action scenes with Bruce lee steal the movie.  Sadly, the quality of the film has not been improved much but watching Bruce lee dish out justice with his now-classic noises is pure action fun.  Side note: John Saxon fakes most of his moves and still looks like a novice American wanna-be.  Mr. Saxon does add some light humor with his role.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like this app you don't do very much but somehow it just keeps you entertained!! plz don't listen to anyone else cuz they don't know what they are talking about.

014050639X|5.0|My kids loved this when they were small, and I just recently rediscovered this for a whole new generation of little ones. I think it's the rhyming pattern that holds their attention so well -- introduces new vocab as well to the smallest of kids.  Lovely little read aloud book for babies and toddlers.

B008B0QH5S|4.0|Although there are lots of comparisons to Behaviour I don't quite see it because to me that album is an eternal masterpiece. Elysium, to me right now, is a collection of mostly great songs from PSB that shows their continuing development in style while keeping up the same amount of class and originality they've had since the start. I am very much enjoying all the tracks except one and I wouldn't say it's bad, just unusual for them. I do believe that in months and years to come the album will evidence more of a cohesive composition/production. In the meantime I am just enjoying the tracks here and on the b-sides.<br />Reviewers who proclaim their opinion as fact can be ignored.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As retired military I can say that at some times this story read like a post deployment report.  That is NOT a bad thing.  I started it, continued it, finished it and liked it in one afternoon.  Thanks for the inside story.

B007TXN4TK|5.0|I'll never be a piano virtuoso with or without this piano master app; but it certainly brings me a whole lot closer with it than without it.  It really is amazing what you can do when it just walks you right through the songs.  But be forwarned!  Not everyone in your family may appreciate your newfound talents and abilties as much as you yourself do!  Especially if left in the hands of 'younger' musicians!  However, I think it is just great!  Get it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Although I've given the original Angry Birds a positive review, I will have to state that it is a really shameless clone of Crush the Castle, and it's making so much money and merchandise for a mere downloadable title (Despite it being a clone) that I kinda feel like it's a crime against the free game (Which is making NO money) it mimics.<br /><br />What's great about Angry Birds Space is that the one gimmick in the game, in which gravity changes, revamps the whole game for me. Sure, the basic gameplay is still the same, but now there's more planning to go through, new ways to smash those pigs, and, of course, seeing the birds fly around in different atmospheres is pretty satisfying. Basically, it's different enough to call it a new game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so very handy to have. I wish the had a graphing app too but this one is still handy ;)
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is wonderful. it does everything I need, as if I were on a computer. I can pin anywhere I go.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game had a good story and was easy to play on the Fire.  It didn't feel too short like some of the PC games.  The ability to zoom in was a definate positive, it made objects close to the sides of the screen easier to select.  4 stars only because the don't have account continuity with the PC games.
0143121006|5.0|It is Peking January 1937. China is falling apart and the Japanese army is outside the city. The old Imperial masters are confined to a small patch of land - the Legation Quarter. The mutilated body of a young woman is discovered. It is Pamela Werner - the adopted daughter of an elderly and somewhat eccentric former diplomat. A joint investigation by the British and the local police eventually comes to a dead end. A truly awful war soon rolls over China, after the brutal Japanese occupation civil war sees the eventual triumph of Mao. Pamela's grave vanishes as does memory of the crime. The author happens upon her name and then comes across files in Kew. These set him on the trail of Pamela's killer 70 years later. While the book is very much about the solution to the mystery it is also reveals much about life in the last days of an Imperial city, especially its dark underbelly of misfits and wanderers, of drugs and prostitution.  He brings the period  and its people alive, especially Pamela's father. It says much about Empire and the imperial cast of mind. Only occasionally does the author lapse into detective fiction jargon. You are left with the puzzle as to why this one death so long ago should still matter. The reason is because ultimately, as the reader will discover, this very sad story is timeless and very well told.

B004EPZ08Y|3.0|Final Destination 1 was good. The concept that you can't cheat Death was done in a relatively new way. Final Destination 2 was also pretty good....It was a good sequel but a lot of the suspense that the first one had was gone because you pretty much were familiar enough with the concept to know that Death was coming fast and ugly for those that cheated It.<br /><br />Then comes like 2 or 3 more Final Destinations and it's more about the freaky death scenes than it is about story. (Okay, I guess it was always more about the freaky death scenes.) But while the past couple of Final Destinations had almost 0 suspense, there was something a bit more well done about Final Destination 5. You know the formula: Anyone that cheats Death in the initial scene of the movie is still doomed...it's just a matter of time before some kind of grotesque accident will befall the cheaters.<br /><br />Death and gore lovers will have a field day with Final Destination 5. There's all kinds of death and mutilation, and in some demented way it was all amazing to watch due to how real it looked due to the FX and CGI. The movie follows the predictable pattern of building up to the next gruesome death with some torturous B acting. It was easier to watch the deaths than the acting in between the deaths. And even though there's a bit of twist here and there towards the end of the movie, the Final Destination formula is worn out and old<br /><br />I'm glad that I waited to watch this on late night cable, but the downfall of not watching this On Demand or on DVD was that I couldn't fast forward to the \\"good parts.\\"<br /><br />If you don't need a fresh, new story behind your craving for blood, then you will enjoy Final Destination 5. A generous 3 stars.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good book, explaining the background of the operation without going into specifics that would provide terrorists with information.  I enjoyed reading the account and came away with a better understanding of the involved complexities.  The unstated but glaring fact was the disparity between this account and that provided by the POTUS.

B007XNAQ6A|5.0|I love this concert. My only complaint is that the DVD features Safe and the CD does not. Why? Other than that the sound is good and of course, its Duran Duran, so it is all good. It would be nice to have a complete live album. There is always something missing. I truly would like to have the complete audio recording from intro to encore. Definite purchase of any self-respecting Duran Duran fan.

B0036S4C6G|3.0|Perhaps I should begin by saying I am over 65.  I really did not enjoy the book.  It was disjointed.  Professional reviews referred to her style as \\"genre-bending\\".  I am learning this is not a style I enjoy.  Ms. Egan is a good writer.  The basic story held my attention, however, at intervals, it took time for me to place the characters in context.  The character<br />of Lou, in my view, was a degenerate pedophile.  The other characters were children of today's society.  Although I would talk about this book to fellow readers, I would not really recommend it.

B005LAIGN2|5.0|This movie is based on a factual history story in the war. My boyfriend wanted me to rent it. And I took a chance. I rented. I don't normaly like watching movies based on history or with alot of black acters in it. But I watched this movie all the way through with my boyfriend. And we both loved it. It is definatley different, intertaing, action packed, and just a great movie to watch. It gives you a different perspective on war. And it also shows you how different black people were in the past. And you see the world through there eyes in history at war. The Red Tails shows you how much the Tuskegee Airman did and how hard they fought for our country. I give this movie 5 stars! It's one of a kind. And well worth the money.
0439023521|5.0|Book #61 Read in 2012<br />The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />This book is the first in a series.  I gave up on it the first time I tried to read.  Friends loved it.  Students loved it.  I figured I would try it again--and this time I ended up loving it.<br /><br />Katniss lives in District 12, a relatively poor district, with her mother and younger sister.  When contestants are selected for this year's Hunger Games, a contest where children fight to the death, Prim, the younger sister, is selected to be in the Games.  Katniss refuses to allow this to happen and she volunteers to take her sister's place.  Also selected is Peeta, the son of the local baker.  The two form an alliance and Peeta seems to have romantic feelings towards Katniss.<br /><br />The Games themselves are brutal and horrible.  During the Games, the rules are changed so that two winners from the same district will be allowed.  This means that Katniss can band together with Peeta, who is gravely injured.  But will this rule change really give them a way to survive and win together?<br /><br />This book had a lot of action, great characters and a decent romance.  Katniss is a tough cookie.  Peeta is a hero whom readers will end up rooting for--to win the Games and get the girl.  I will continue on to book 2.<br /><br />[...]

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved the movie, but I don't think people under 50 would relate to it too well.  It's definitely a feel good movie for those of us approaching retirement age, or older, and those of us who have accommodated ourselves to divorce, death, and learning how to stay busy and happy as our lives change with age.  I can't imagine that 20 or 30 year old folks would enjoy the plot of this movie, but they might find pleasure in viewing India, which is on glorious display throughout the movie.  And, the theme of the movie has become my new mantra:  Everything will be all right in the end, and if it's not right now, it's not yet the end.  Smiles, sl
B0033807C2|5.0|'The Last Olympian', the fifth and the final book in Rick Riordan's immortal 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, ends with a severely huge bang!!<br /><br />Typhon has awakened, and while te Gods try to stop him from entering Manhattan, Kronos' army lays siege to New York. The Great Prophecy is finally getting fulfilled. And Percy has a few romantic challenges on board, too! While Percy makes himself invulnerable in the Styx, it still wont be enough. Can Percy follow the advice of Hestia, the Last Olympian and choose correctly? No spoilers for you.... go read for yourself...!!!!!<br /><br />In this adventure filled book, full of prohecies, mysteries, surprises, twists and turns this is a must read. The suspense just keeps you glued to the book, not wanting to keep it aside till you finish, and it's worth it!! Like, totally!!<br /><br />Rick Riordan puts up an awesome finale which is only fitting to one of the coolest series of all time. He has made the characters shape and mature with the progress of the books. He has improvised. He has perfectly conquered Greek Mythology, which has brought the edge to the series. Perfect!!!<br /><br />This series has pushed behind the likes of Artemis Fowl, and in the minds of most, is sure to give Harry Potter a run for his money. Go figure.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I think all the others have accurately praised this long lost gem which we finally have in our collection. Mind you, I have a pretty extensive collection of SMiLE related fragments, incomplete and complete tracks/songs obtained for the last twenty years or so, and as many loyal fans have done, have compiled my own version of what I imagined the final to be and then some.<br /><br />This collection is fantastic, albeit the 1st CD, which is seen as SMiLE the album, borrows a little too much from the recent Brian Wilson's SMiLE as template. In other words, the voice and piano version of \\"Surf's Up\\" from the Good Vibrations box set is for me the official version. Although orchestrated tracks were recorded for perhaps a band version, it was the other Beach Boys who assembled the song that appears on the album of same title, WITHOUT the help of Brian, and it shows. And, Carl's lovely voice just does not replace Brian's in terms of depth.<br /><br />For audiophiles, having the vinyls included I imagine to be a must. I of course did not need these, but all good. The box cover is art in its POP pure sense, a true collector's item, as are copies of the original illustrations within. WHAT ARE MISSING are the videos from SMiLE. I've seen fragments from the Fire track, as well as from Heroes and Villains, weird and wild, and boy would have I enjoyed any and all of these from those years included here instead of the vinyls.<br /><br />Finally, I may very well annoy someone by saying that the final CD wasn't necessary being that Good Vibrations was NOT part of SMiLE. Good Vibrations was a project of its own with its own separate story, begun with Asher lyrics but very much a Mike Love song, nothing like the playful project Van Dyke Parks penciled during the era of Dylan and Lennon. I would have preferred outtakes, demos, and rehearsals for what resulted as Smiley Smile.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is one very very happy camper. Amen.

B0099RFVXQ|3.0|After seeing this movie on the big screen and with all of the hype I must say I was very let down and hugely disappointed. It takes forever to get going and is just plain slow for to much of the movie. It's worth a rental for sure so you can judge for yourself but I just was expecting so much more bang or the buck.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|A great voice with a hard rock feel! If you like any hard hitting metal, this band is worth the try!
B005LAIGIM|4.0|I went in seriously worried that Eddie Murphy lost a few steps thanks to the disaster that is Tower Heist, but the reality is that Eddie Murphy is a more suitable and hilarious comedian when the attention is on him moreso than anyone else.  Or perhaps my hatred for Ben Stiller played a part in my dissatisfaction for that movie.<br /><br />What makes A Thousand Words so wonderful is the subtle approach to comedy.  It doesn't seem subtle at first and in fact, initially seems like another pitiful attempt at humor that misses the mark (just like Tower Heist unforgivably proves).  However as soon as Eddie visits the spiritual guru and especially when the mysterious tree of life forms in his back yard one evening, this is when the introduction to the storyline gets underway- that being, Eddie quickly finds out that he's not allowed to speak more than a thousand words or he will... I guess die.  I don't remember if that was ever stated outright or not.<br /><br />Another funny element (and this is surprising to me) is one of Eddie's workmates who's a dorky, talkative guy with a big mouth who happens to always find himself in hilarious situations with Eddie which especially become evident as soon as Eddie is forced to go through his 3-day period of using as little words as possible, so Eddie's facial expressions become a focal point.  More humor follows whenever Eddie communicates with his wife as they (or rather, she) discusses marriage and home problems.  Again, Eddie has to keep quiet!  The way he orders food at the uptown restaurant provides additional humor as the cashier guy has to figure out what Eddie's trying to order through hand movements and facial expressions, lol.<br /><br />With a really creative way of slowly building the humor through interesting storytelling, perhaps I shouldn't be so shocked that the ending -the part where Eddie visits his mom who happens to have memory loss problems and insists Eddie is actually her husband- is so effectively moving.  Iwas *almost* in tears in one particular spot.  I won't reveal what it is that makes it so moving, though.  Great writing there.  I also felt sadness whenever Eddie was forced to speak and leaves would fall off the tree in his back yard.  The writing makes it sad, not funny.<br /><br />Overall, Eddie rebounds after the pitiful Tower Heist with a really great movie.
0307592731|4.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The premise of the book is the hike, but underlying this concept is this woman's journey to self-enlightenment and overcoming her grief and loss. The book inspired me so much that I have now given a copy of the book to several of my friends. A great read if you are ready for the journey of your own insight and self-reflection. Ms. H-B.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This is not a real Jack Reacher novel.  The real Jack Reacher is not a boring, mean, bully.  Obviously Lee Child is done with this character and should just kill him off in his next book.  That would be preferable to making me read more of this tripe.

B003Y5H5F6|4.0|If anything still qualifies as a \\"monster movie\\" these days, it's probably the \\"Underworld\\" series. In that regard, the abysmally bad acting is quite forgivable, as the focus of these movies is on creating a mind blowing spectacle of monster mayhem, not on reenacting \\"Hamlet\\". This movie does not disappoint where its success will be measured- the CGI werewolves are more convincing than ever, and their battles are a treat to behold. I still feel that \\"Evolution\\" is the best entry in the series, but it's cool that the writers have found clever ways to keep the show rolling (and based on the cliffhanger ending, it's safe to assume there will be another one, if the bottom line remains agreeable). Fans of the series will most likely be pleased with \\"Awakening\\", but newcomers may be confused about what all the fuss is about.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|With all of the garbage that Amazon puts out for the Free App Of The Day, it's so tempting not to check, isn't it? There's the in-app purchases, the data-mining, the questionable content, and then those apps that were part of a kindergarten project that somehow made it to the app store.<br /><br />This app isn't ANYTHING like those. It's playable, fun, slightly addicting... ok, well, REALLY addicting, and it does exercise your brain. And it's great for all ages -- I enjoy the challenge as much as my 8-year-old son, and even my 6-year-old was curious about it.<br /><br />Whether you own the shopping cart a/k/a Kindle Fire HD or spent $10 less on a proper tablet that comes with a charger and without forced ads, what's best about this app is that it requires NO PERMISSIONS AT ALL. This app doesn't want to connect to the internet, doesn't care what your phone number is, doesn't want to annoy your facebook friends with updates of your latest addiction, doesn't want to take pictures, nor broadcast anything unsavory or sticky. It's just a game. And a good one at that.<br /><br />Enjoy it, folks. Had I purchased it and been offered it free the next day, I wouldn't have a single regret.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This [[ASIN:B000O8OTNC Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener]] is probably not the absolute best or most precision method to sharpen a high quality knife blade, but it is certainly among the handiest, especially when one has a specialized task to perform.<br /><br />Knife purists will tell you that you need an \\"oil stone\\" or a \\"water stone\\" to put the best edge on high-quality kitchen knives, and I can personally agree with my J.A. Henckels or Victorinox kitchen knives. For those I use a [[ASIN:B0000DD2C9 Woodstock SteeleX D1130 1000 Grit and 6000 Grit Japanese Waterstone]] that I luckily found brand new at a garage sale. But we're talking about speed and convenience here, and that's where the Smith's PP1 sharpener works well.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />* Very small footprint; easy to carry in a pocket, briefcase or camera bag<br />* Carbide blades and ceramic finishing stones are reversible and replaceable<br />* Tapered diamond rod; very convenient for sharpening serrated blade edges<br />* Package has easy to follow sharpening directions on the back<br />* Nicely constructed; ergonomic, lightweight and durable<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />- Preset sharpening angles on V-shaped sharpening slots may or may not be good for certain blades.<br /><br />Quick Note on Sharpening Angles:<br /><br />There are plenty of discussions on the `Net regarding which sharpening angle is best for a given knife.  Some say that you should choose an angle of 10° to 30° on each side. Shallower angles make a sharper edge that doesn't last as long, while steeper angles are more durable; I compromise between 17° and 22.5° with my better knives, but the choice is yours. Don't know what angle the Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Sharpener uses, as I haven't see it posted in their description. In any case, if you have an exceptionally good knife, check with the manufacturer's suggestions and specs.<br /><br />In Use:<br /><br />In my particular case, I needed to sharpen the serrated blade of my [[ASIN:B000VY4OJS Victorinox Swiss Army One Hand Trekker]], an excellent knife that I purchased here in 2008 and finally reviewed in early 2010. This particular knife made me put my other Swiss Army knives away as far as day-to-day functionality goes, yet the serrated blade was losing its effectiveness, probably from too much use over time. It was also gummed up a bit from cutting through packaging tape (and Amazon boxes, etc.) over time.<br /><br />First cleaned the serrated blade with WD-40, wiped it with a paper towel, then washed, rinsed and dried it. Following the directions on the package, I extended the tapered diamond rod and drew it through each serration, rotating it as the instructions noted. Within minutes the serrated blade was restored. Did the same with the serrated blade on my [[ASIN:B000EDPT9K Gerber Suspension Butterfly Opening Multi-Plier]], and the sharpness on that blade was easily refurbished as well.<br /><br />As noted earlier, it's always better to use a water stone on high-quality kitchen knives, but when you need speed and expedience, and the Smith's PP1 sharpener does its job. For a quick touch up with good cutlery, just remember to use the V-shaped slot with the ceramic finishing stones, and do it gently.<br /><br />I have also used the [[ASIN:B001CQTLJC Smith's Edgeware V-Slot 10-Second Knife and Scissors Sharpener]] for years as a household handy item for sharpening scissors. Have also used it reshaping a few worn out kitchen knives, and it did the job quite well.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />For quick and dirty sharpening, the [[ASIN:B000O8OTNC Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener]] does the job and does it well. For this user, it has worked very well, especially when sharpening a serrated blade by hand, and with that it's a 5-star product. For sharpening straight blades, you may wish learn to use a stone, but as admitted above, I do use this PP1 Pocket Pal when taking the time to use a wet stone is not convenient. If your need is for convenience and speed, then this one is highly recommended.<br /><br />9/22/2012nt. If your need is for convenience and speed, then this one is highly recommended.<br /><br />9/22/2012
1596680199|5.0|If you want to know how to make all kinds of polymer clay beads this i the one.  I would recommend it for an intermediate level  It does not go into great detail on how to smooth, slice, pierce or make skinner blends and these are must know skills. they do explain it but perhaps not using the details a beginner would need. That is not a mark against this book.  If they gave all those details they would have had to drop some of the techniques.  It has so many ideas it positively made my head spin. I could not decide which to do first.  Usually when I buy a book like this I dog ear the projects I want to try.  I found my self doing this to EVERY type in the book so I gave up.  Every bead pictured on the cover is outlined in the book with even more ideas and variations.<br /><br />Too bad they only had 5 stars.  Really deserves six.  Awesome investment

B0087HT36U|5.0|It does not let me move to the next level unless if I put a review. Well here is your ...
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is an adequate Jack Reacher tale.  True fans will probably hate it while mildly interested ones will chalk it up as another banal meal at the the Child dinner table.  The story revolves around a mysterious murder, terror plot and government cover-up, with the bad guys picking up a hitchhiking Reacher to provide cover to help them evade the manhunt.  Of course, Reacher gets directly involved and stays ahead of the government agents to save the day.<br /><br />The Good:  it's a Jack Reacher tale. Casual to rabid fans love this guy and, if you read the prior ones, it's more of the same loconic, non-nonsense, kick butt Reacher.<br /><br />The Bad:  meandering story line can put you to sleep -- the action takes place in a car for half the book and nothing new in the Reacher storyline is introduced.  He claims in the book he has to get to Virigina for something (meeting someone) but you never figure out why.  He just diverts his journey long enough to break up a global terror plot.<br /><br />The Ugly:  repetitive scenes.  I'm not sure how Child can make a casual walk up a driveway last for three pages or something.  Sheesh.  Everything just plods along.  Also, Reacher makes contact in the car with a fellow hostage who blinks some form of Morse code -- but the code is long sentences or phrases that just doens't seem plausible, particularly with two bad guys next to you. of course, they slept most of the time.<br /><br />Bottom line:  it's an okay read but Child has jumped the shark here. Time to finish Reacher off and go on a long sabbatical before Child loses every last fan possible.
B009AMAKJU|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5 out of 5<br /><br />'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is based on Writer/Director Steven Chbosky's 1999 novel of the same name. It actually would be better titled, 'The Perks of being a Victim'. Set in 1991 Pittsburgh, 'Perks' is the coming of age story of 16 year old high school freshman 'Charlie', played by 20 year old actor, Logan Lerman.<br /><br />Charlie the Wallflower is an introverted kid who feels ostracized on his first day of high school. It doesn't take long for Charlie to find a clique which he can fit into--a group of senior class 'Bohemian' types led by Patrick (Ezra Miller) and step-sister Sam (Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame).<br /><br />Patrick is gay, carrying on a clandestine affair with one of the stars of the high school football team. When the shop teacher calls Patrick \\"Patty\\" and he responds, \\"You can call me Patrick or nothing,\\" the teacher pours coals on the fire by insulting him further by calling him \\"nothing\\"(I had no idea that a school teacher would face no consequences for bullying a pupil in such a way--even in 1991!).<br /><br />After all the baddies (mainly high school jocks) begin calling Patrick \\"Nothing\\", most of the rest of the kids in the school follow suit. 'Wallflower' Charlie, who also feels ostracized, ends up sticking up for perennial victim Patrick. Completely out of character (and with improbable superhuman strength), Charlie ends up knocking out half of the high school football team after they set upon Patrick in the school cafeteria (okay maybe I'm exaggerating--it wasn't half the team but notice that the awkward editing prevents us from actually seeing exactly how Charlie thwarts the entire assault on Patrick).<br /><br />Chbosky's characters are no different than many other films that feature a coterie of quirky characters which Patrick refers to as the \\"Island of Toy Misfits\\". As is usual for these films involving a clique of quirky characters, they're pitted against an unsavory group of reactionaries (in this case, jocks, along with a bunch of young, belligerent allies). Of course you can count on the quirky kids to have some mild flaws, while the group that hates them, are all pretty unsavory and despicable.<br /><br />What sets Chbosky's quirky misfits apart from other recent quirky characters of this ilk, is that their machinations are firmly ensconced in the era of the early 90s. If there is any charm in this heavy-handed film, it's all in the allusions to the pre-internet era. Do you remember 'Mixtapes'? The kids mix their favorite songs on cassette tapes and pass them around to each other. The quirky kids also have a penchant for the avant-garde--participating in live presentations during weekly screenings of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.<br /><br />Perhaps the central failing of 'Perks' is Chbosky's paper thin plot. Most of the film focuses on Charlie's puerile infatuation with Sam and all of that silly puppy love he has no desire to suppress. Why should we really care for Charlie's obsession with Sam, especially when her character is so poorly developed? (just about the only thing we learn about her is that she was molested as a child and raped by boys who get her drunk (events confirming her status as perennial victim).<br /><br />There is also a comic sub-plot (few laughs!) involving Charlie's brief 'romance' with 'Mary Elizabeth', a Buddhist and vegan whose big mistake is to go out with a guy like Charlie, who is clearly obsessed with 'another woman' from the get go. Charlie's obsession is made clear during the 'truth or dare' scene where he kisses Sam on the lips in front of Mary Elizabeth (this elicited a gasp from the mostly teen-aged audience populating the theater I attended).<br /><br />Obviously Charlie's one-note infatuation and the 'us vs. them' theme was not enough to carry an entire movie, so Chbosky had to throw in some cheap melodrama to tidy things up. I'm referring of course to Charlie's mental problems, stemming from the traumatic death of his aunt when he was a child and the purported sexual abuse he endured at the hands of said aunt before her said demise. After this 'setback' (where he joins hands as a full-fledged victim with his fellow sufferer, Patrick), he can now work his way 'back' to sanity and eventually pretentiously declare along with his fellow quirky misfits (with a straight face), \\"we are infinite\\" (as he stares up at the sky through the roof of Patrick and Sam's pickup, hurtling through a tunnel).<br /><br />It's no accident that 'Perks' was produced by the very same people who gave us 'Juno', that revolting anti-abortion tearjerker. Nonetheless, 'Perks' is not a complete lost cause. Despite being acted by actors chronologically older than the high school students they portray, they uniformly do a pretty good job. Ezra Miller steals the show as the flamboyant Patrick and Paul Rudd is memorable as the sagacious and helpful English teacher.<br /><br />I guarantee that all those who loved 'Perks' also loved 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Both promote the unhealthy idea of a coterie of quirky misfits who are superior to a group of stick-figure reactionaries pitted against them. By promoting this illusory dichotomy, Mr. Chbosky has done a disservice to true Bohemians everywhere--certainly such true libertarians do not perceive themselves as victims and would not like other misguided souls such as Mr. Chbosky, to impugn them with such a label.lie's mental problems, stemming from the traumatic death of his aunt when he was a child and the purported sexual abuse he endured at the hands of said aunt before her said demise.

B0072NWJRK|5.0|No idea how anyone who has never lived in Beijing as an expatiate would view this story, but speaking from a 10+ year resident of the city, this is nothing short of required reading.<br /><br />The combination of the brisk pacing of the story, the vivid depiction of the mishmash of oddballs that made up the international community at the time, and the historical notes on one of Beijing's most tumultuous times makes for a compelling read that was genuinely hard to put down.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|its a pretty good game but I don't know why they would force a review from me its Mindanao dumb....
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very good romance/ drama story. It is exciting scarey at times and hard to loose interest.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good story and easy read. Seems to be written for high school age or younger, but holds your attention. I would recommend to my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game to pass the time when there is nothing on Tv or on a rain day or snowy day.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I bought this bag in May, 2011 and have been using it everyday since then to carry my Logitech mouse to work and back. The case is very well constructed and has held up excellently. The seams, the stitching and the drawstring are all in great shape after over 1.5 years of daily use. I came back to order another bag for my wife and was disappointed to see that Amazon no longer carries it. I hope that they change their minds and restock this great product.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its a great app. I love seeing pictures and getting new recipes and house design and organization ideas... but the app freezes a lot on the kindle fire.... u have to wait for it to open and sometimes you even have to close it and reopen it to get it to work. overall pretty good app... of u have patience.
B008J34466|5.0|What a great album.  I was looking forward to Pink's new album because so far, she's never disappointed me.  You never get the impression that she does anything for the money.  She doesn't pull her punches in case she might offend someone, and she never goes around apologizing for who she is.  To me, that is the mark of a great artist.<br /><br />I dare anyone else to write a ballad called Chaos & Piss.  I know I'm not that brave.  And Pink makes it sound heartfelt, in her gorgeous, smokey voice.<br /><br />In the vein of 'I'm Coming Up, so you'd better get this party started', Pink calls us all out with Here Comes the Weekend', and she partners with M&M, brilliant!  And how about when she sings siren, and then sings the sound of a siren?  So cool.<br /><br />Blow Me One Last Kiss is totally honest, 'You think I'm just as serious, I think you're full of shit, so blow me one last kiss'.<br /><br />Give Me A Reason has a beat, and vocal phrasing that will immediately lodge in your brain with no chance of getting it out for a least a week.<br /><br />The title song, The Truth About Love, perfectly sums up what it means to be in love, set to great beat, with some gnarly effects on Pink's rich vocals.<br /><br />Walk Of Shame is about going home in the morning the same clothes you started out in the night before.  It's about someone wrote a song about it. \\"Where'd I get the wristband, tell me there's not trampstamp'.  (A cautionary tale for young women everywhere and Pink has the guts to sing it)  haha.<br /><br />Love Pink, and she just gets better.  This is an album you have to listen to in your car at full volume.  Thank you for making my drive rock!

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Yes that's about it folks - boring, badly written and lacked any kind of an interesting story line!  Didn't attract me in any way shape or form and I really can't believe all the fuss and excitment about this book.  Aah sensationalism! that might be the word!  Written for those who have boring sex lives - maybe they will get some new toys and get some ideas of how to play with them and spice their bedroom scene up.  Fast forward Mills and Boon!
B0078JP5SS|5.0|This is a great show! It is so intriguing and full of drama. The quality of the video is also really, really good. It streamed very quickly and fluidly without any problems.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I won't buy the next 2 books. I was not impressed with the storyline. I mean, how many ways can you have sex and make a story out of it. I will continue to read my murder mysteries and leave the rest of the \\"50 Shades\\" to others.

B005CGI3ZG|5.0|This show was great and entertaining but of course it had ups and downs. Why is everyone complaining about the music? so what?. i personally think jann ardens \\"run like mad\\" was better than that stupid annoying song \\"i dont wanna wait\\" get over it and just enjoy the show!. :)
B001TXWJ4M|4.0|My son told me about the show but I had never seen it from the begining. I have watched both season one and two. I'll watch season three soon.  Great fun to catch up

B003IDMURM|5.0|A welcome difference to Grisham,s normal gripping books. A typical coffee table book with a dramatic turn at every page.I feel that I was a member of the county for a short time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep for years. Had several tests done including overnight stay in hospital sleep lab. Turns out I don't have apnea, I have delta wave intrusion disorder. Been taking zolpidem before bed but hardly ever works. Found Relax Melodies online and tried it. Then purchased Premium and my sleep has been much better. Hard thing is to get monaural beats - you must wear earphones or ear buds and I can't find any comfortable enough for sleeping. Anyway, keep up the good work.
B0063IH60K|3.0|i cant seem to do the custom background or card backs :( other than that its ur basic solitaire game
B003UBTX7C|5.0|The action in Hell's Corner was non-stop.  The characters were well developed.  It was so intricate and involving that I had a tough time putting the novel down.  The twists and unexpected turns also added to the enjoymen of the novel.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|This movie was great. I liked everything about it. Has some good humor, violence and dialogue. Highly recommended. The picture was not quite blu-ray, but excellent for streaming.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wonderful reading, never boring.  I highly recommend this book. The characters are great.  Hoping for another book to continue the story.
B008XG1X18|4.0|For the most part it is a good app.  I have it on my droid &amp; fire and it works the same on both.<br />My only issue is it sometimes doesn't want to load my boards, but will load the pins.
B008O6AK4S|1.0|Customer beware! This product will only play on certain Amazon Readers.<br />Why offer a product on the market which is incompatible with the majority of Readers?<br />Even on the Android version, the features are annoyingly very basic.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a good game.  The concept is fantastic.  Unfortunately, I discovered this at the same time as Where's My Water, which is superior mostly because of better graphics.  But this one remains a good game.
B00992CF6W|1.0|really fun game, needs updates to compare to the real minecraft though, buy it now if you cant wait, otherwise wait, nothing good in it yet, there IS Tnt, just nothing to light it with, also no ore implemented yet
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have really enjoyed this app. Lots of gift ideas for everyone and helpful hints. Great food ideas too. I highly recommend this great app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Innovative way to tell a story with a lot of twists and turns. I found it difficult to stop reading once I started.
0802473156|5.0|This book was delivered very quickly in great condition. I really enjoyed the book. It has given me a different perspective on how I give and receive love as well as how differently others give and receive love. Everyone's perception if how to truly love another is different.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|Was worth the 1.99 rental to watch during a cross-country plane ride.  Glad I didn't see it in the theaters.
B006ICOK00|1.0|I bought this unit hoping that it would be an improvement over the unreliable version 1, as the \\"improved\\" model has a view screen. This unit, however is just as unreliable as version 1, in that it also shuts off randomly making it useless if you wish to document something important. There are other irritating minuses as well (discussed in other reviews). Don't waste your money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful book.  Very fun. Fell in love with the characters, well not the \\"bad\\" ones! ;) Movie is also scheduled to come out and I can't wait.
B003CN4R74|5.0|i bought this cd today it rocks being a gutar player my self its the best album out of all three  its where they sould be and i love amy lees vocals and the heavy gutars keep it up
B0016GOM5Q|5.0|Wyatt Earp without the \\"pretty\\" twist of Kevin Costner. Val Kilmer in one of his best performances, EVER! Great cast. Great cinematography. Great movie.
B000V656X4|5.0|It's pretty nice to decide you want an album and you can have it in literally five minutes nowadays.  Anyways, you don't need to read an analysis of Asia's first album, there's plenty of would-be album critics here on Amazon who need to keep their day jobs.  If you weren't around back then listening to the radio though, I'll tell you that you might think Heat of the Moment was the one big song on this, but uh-uh  there was like three or four of them getting a lot of AOR airplay at that time and for good reason, since ELO, Genesis and Supertramp had become hit-makers (nothing wrong with that, who doesn't like money) and ELP was off making overblown albums like Works that no one could listen to all the way through.  Asia's first was a huge album at that time and is still a great listen.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Mike Matthews has written a very good book. On the positive side, he clears up a lot of misconceptions about bodybuilding and has a lot of practical advice that can save you lots of money, especially when it comes to supplements. Many people who give fitness advice are just out to sell supplements or workout equipment so at least Mike is giving objective advice.<br /><br />It could have been even better if he had cited studies to back up his claims, since some of what he says borders on medical advice. Also, there is a long chapter on definitions at the very beginning that should have been an appendix or glossary.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|This series can be compared favorably with Game of Thrones, the Sword of Truth, and the Wheel of Time series. It does not rely too heavily on magic and has a plot line that is interesting, yet not excessively complex (actually the previously mentioned series are more complex than would be ideal, from my viewpoint). This story drags a bit in places, but overall I found it highly entertaining and enjoyable. The characters are interesting and coherent, the settings are evocative, and the dialogue is natural. I always consider a series a success for me if I can't wait to read the next one.
0307742997|2.0|I wanted to read \\"The Snowman\\" a second time. First time in Norwegian, my mother tongue, next in English. Jo Nesbø - get yourself an other translator. This one does not match your native language - you're mutch better.<br />Nesbø writes elegantly simple in Norwegian, without becoming infantile. This translator oversimplifies the language, leving the impression of this being an author with a childish style, which Jo Nesbø is far from. The plot, however, comes across reasonably well.<br />I've read all Harry Hole books in Norwegian. When I need another Kindle version of a crime novel, I'll pick Lee Childs Jack Reacher.
B002XDISMO|4.0|This is one of the great classic Bogey flicks - you have to see it and ya gotta love it.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|After the first movie came out and I heard that there would be a sequel, I could not<br />wait!  Then i saw the movie and it was the best.  Watson is getting married and Holmes<br />believes that Moriarty is planning something big that will threaten the world.  This<br />is where we first finally get to see Professor James Moriarty in the flesh and he<br />makes more than a match for Holmes.  The ending is quite interesting as well!  Must<br />see!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is an absolute joy to play. A perfect balance of challenge and ease for casual gamers to just &quot;pick up and play&quot;. Who says there aren't any great games for Android?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|\\"No easy day\\" is a well-done account of upward mobility within the special forces' ranks as well as a first hand account of the death of Osama Bin laden.  Mark says he wrote it to straighten out the many stories that have surfaced of what went on, and he does it well.  Sometimes, I felt he jumped timelines a little too much but only because I got into the part of the story he was telling and I wasn't ready to switch.  I wish I could thank all of Seal Team Six personally for their service to our country, and I wish them all well.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Everything about this movie is inspired- the incredible music, incredible cinematography, the creepy tone in the second half of the movie.  One of the best parts is Kate Capshaw's blonde named Willie Scott, who is hilarious.  They would never make it that way today (and Spielberg has all but disowned the movie because of the violence).  But that is what makes it so interesting.<br /><br />Temple of Doom is arguably the best of all the Indiana Jones movies- a true adventure with heart, inspiration, and craftsmanship.  We may never see the likes of it again.
B009329ZF2|1.0|I'm a special effects fan.  Which can seriously corrupt my value as a reviewer.  For special effects I would grant this effort four stars.  Fortunately I'm able to overcome my infatuation with the technical aspects of film making.  Well, not entirely.  On the basis of story, acting and directing, this disaster deserves zero stars.  That's being generous.  Because of a few very good, imaginative computer-generated visuals, I'll give it one star.  Recommendation:  Rather than waste time watching the whole film, watch the trailer; it contains all the good bits.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it is an ok game and was fun at first but it is really kind of boring...at least the game has motives like finding all the puzzle pieces and getting more XP but really...not that great but not terrible...just amusing
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Touches of fantasy and whimsy, rooted in a basic, believeable tale about almost-ordinary people.  Promo of the film emphasizes romantic storyline.  Actual central themes involve mother-daughter relationship and single mother's life in male-dominated society, but nothing heavy-handed.  It's a near-perfect feel-good film.
0517548232|5.0|I bought this book from Mises itself, I wanted the hardcover and I try to buy all of my books on economics from them in support of their efforts. I think that gives away where my biases might lay, but that is fine with me.<br /><br />I've read \\"Human Action\\", Mises, and \\"Making Economic Sense\\", Rothbard, beforehand. So I knew what I was getting myself into. I was thorough pleased with how it read, the conclusions were just as clearly explained as the previous two authors I have read. This book is especially relevant still to this day, and it's inspiring to know that there are still copies being printed. I will be sharing and buying extra copies of this one to hand out.<br /><br />For all of those doubting this book, do not hesitate to buy it and read it. You will likely learn something that covers the $10 cost for the paperback edition. If you like it, give it to someone else and let them read it. This is information that will never expire, and it needs to be shared.<br /><br />\\"\\"Learn everything you can about a Free Society.

B006S009IY|2.0|Disappointing movie.  Depp's performance is wooden, Winslet reads her lines, Hoffman is simply putting in time.  There's a complete lack of wonder and fantasy in this presentation of a tale about the creation of Peter Pan, Captain Hook and the lost boys.  There should be magic.  Instead there's a businesslike treatment of how a playwright developes a stage play.  Boring.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE this game! It's so awesome! I am so obsessed with this game already! Today is my first time playing it!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Renee & Catherine were delightful, of course, but I was more surprised at the spectacular and unexpected performances by Richard Gere (comedy? dancing?) and Queen Latifa (wow!).  This was the breakout movie that rocketed Queen from being a reasonably popular singer to being an amazing star.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Have Had the watch about 45 days now and love it. Wear it every day and it looks good and gets comments from other people. The contrasting yellow hour marks and the white hands are easy to read. The watch is a bright black with chrome buttons. The rubber strap is large enough for wide wrists or small.<br />Yes the day of the week and the date are lightly illuminated, but easily read when you look at them in daylight or use the light button feature in the dark.<br />Got it for under $110.<br />Good buy, have had no problems and would buy it again.
B007SGM084|3.0|A lot of my friends were raving over these books so I gave them a try.  I read all 3 and enjoyed the stories. I liked them because the books tell the story of every woman's fantasy of falling in love with a hot sexy rich man.  The books aren't well written, the character depth is weak.  The story overall is unrealistic.  We're expected to believe that Christian Grey became a billionaire overnight and is only 27.  And that Ana's roommate Kate lets Ana live with her for little rent and that life is just that easy.  The plot is more dialog and sex and lacking detail and explanation.  We're told that Ana named her car \\"Wanda\\" but it never goes on to say why.  It hints that Ana has a sense of humor but doesn't elaborate.  It leaves you hanging on certain character details and doesn't explain much.  Christian is so busy sending emails to Ana that it begs one to wonder when he ever works.  All in all, a good story for the imagination but not for the intellectual reader who is looking for a literary masterpiece.  I would recommend them for a good raunchy romance novel but not for the writing.  Looking forward to seeing what the movie is like.

B004Q7CIFI|2.0|Stephan King had a great concept for the story with the idea of what if the assination of President Kennedy could have been stopped combined with the idea of time travel. The plot, characters, settings for both time periiods were engaging and kept me from putting it down.<br /><br />The issue for me was that excessive cussing and explicit sex. The story plot would have been able to carry itself without the cussing and edpliscit sex. It would have been enough for me to know that the cussing would have been used and the couple went to bed or a similar phrase.

0425263908|5.0|This book was recommended to me as a 50 shades-like book. It has some common themes, but no more so than any other hot romance novel. I really cared about the characters and wanted to get to know more about each one and she doesn't disappoint. Nor does she give it all away in the first book. It leaves you optimistic, but hanging on for more.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews that talk about how unrealistic this is and how we (as women) don't really want to be treated this way. To that I say \\"If you want realism, go read non-fiction!\\" I read to immerse myself in another world. I enjoy reading about relationships that are all or nothing, but I don't for one second believe the relationship between the main characters to be a healthy, mimic-worthy relationship. And I certainly don't thing anyone reading it will attempt to emulate the book in that way. There are other sections that we could all learn from, that's for sure, but it's a work of entertaining fiction and I enjoyed it for what it was. I can't wait for the next one!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I am very happy with this type of hidden objects game.its lots n lots of fun. I know u need to make money, but isn't $5.00 a little too much for the game.I think its more worth about $3.50.<br />u probably would get much more people to play it, if u cut the price and. then give at least 4 levels before u ask customers to upgrade. this way u have DEFINATELY,Hooked us.<br />Otherwise,  your game is most Excellent and Anyone can play meaning any Age.<br />U DEFINATELY. have me as a customer, we would like to c more on the lines of Haunted things.and oh yea, LESS Memory useage.lets face it, Downloading these type of games on a of, Doesn't leave much space for other type of games.I'm A Big Fan of H.O. keep up the great work guys.Thanks for letting us speak our mind.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|i recommend you try this game it is fun and challenging.  the only negative I would say is there are too many hints to help you through levels which you don't have to use but are tempting after failing a couple times
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I love the fighting in this movie and the story isn't too bad as well. Only this that was disappointing was that it was the english version and the voices didn't match up well. I prefer just to have only the subtitles on but I couldn't get that to work. Even with that I still enjoyed watching it!
B008XG1X18|1.0|I have this on my on kindle fire but it very rarely works. Everytime I try to use it it won't load the first time and it freezes up. If I try it a second or third time it will eventually work, but it's hardly worth the effort. It would be nice to see this fixed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addictive and super easy. be careful though about getting tempted by the pay feature. you could easily blow the budget buying coins.
B00846REIS|1.0|Returned it, had just finished the shades of grey series and people were recommending this.  Story was the same but the names and the characters were different.  And i could tell i wasn't going to like the new characters.  Shades of gray wasn't all about sex it was a good story.  After the 10th deja vu i decided to return it and find another good book to read with an original story.  Didn't need a repeat.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Hanna was great. I didn't even want to pause it to have a snack break. Really get all your snacks and bathroom breaks out of the way before you start watching this movie. I will watch it many more times. [[ASIN:B004Y8Y26C Hanna (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]
B0087HT36U|3.0|I don't understand any of the issues in other negative reviews. I will simply say that at first the game is a lot of fun, but if you get stuck you only get one free skip so you might end up never even completing the game. Fun as a free app but I agree, I would not pay unless there were more levels and ways to earn bombs rather than pay real money.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it's very easy to use. I like how quickly I can browse through my recipe boards to find a recipe online and then read it on my kindle. it's convenient.
B0053O89KG|4.0|While I enjoyed the season, I get some of the complaints.  However, Nathan Fillion is just so darn lovable, that he makes up for it for us.<br /><br />Favorite episode was the bombing episode.  Not due to being \\"timely\\", but because it wasn't your typical murder.  Love a different crime to be solved.<br /><br />Though, some of me is a bit scared by the idea of the cops being to track us as they want.<br /><br />I really miss the old Captain.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you like the original Angry Birds, you'll like this one.  I think it might be a little harder than the original (overall), so if you're really buying this for kids, it might not be a great buy.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Mr. Gaughran thank you for this ebook, you and other self-publishers are my inspiration.  This ebook is perfect for someone who needs that little push to do \\"something crazy\\" and self-publish.  Just reading about people who have done it before (and their reasons for doing so) makes me want to be like them too.  It's somehow comforting to know that these people have done it without much help from the outside, although the author recommends you to look for a superstar editor to fix your work.  Ultimately, people should self-publish because they love to write and share what they know.  Also, writing can actually be profitable especially for lesser-known or start-up writers.<br /><br />If you are looking for that kind of book to get you to write your first piece, then this is for you.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|TeamLava has the worst customer service. They continue to update the games so the items u need are completely impossible to get without spending real cash. When contacted they could careless. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
B000222GMQ|4.0|Contrary to what other reviews state the entire series of 26 episodes was English-dubbed, not just the episodes found on the Sony VHS videos. The English-dub series was indeed televised and could be seen in the 1980's exclusively on CBN (Christian Broadcast Network). After that run and the limited VHS release, Honey Honey then sadly dropped out sight -- doubtless, the show was seen by many kids who must still have fond memories of it but unfortunately memory may the only way to access it unless someone was clever enough to tape the broadcasts.<br /><br />I have all the Honey Honey factory VHS videos except for one, \\"Alpine Express\\". These tapes are nearly impossible to find and very likely not many were ever produced. In addition to the tapes I managed to obtain some ultra rare recordings off the religious TV station when it was aired years ago, not the complete series but I have enough to actually know what happened at the end.<br /><br />This show was really poorly dubbed but that's actually good as the whole thing is so wacky that the dopey English voice talent fits the crazy antics perfectly. The further the story progresses the kookier it gets...they even have poor Honey in the clutches of a King Kong gorilla atop a high bldg type thing before its over. Strange plot twists and surprise Honey-isnt-what-she-seems-and-neither-is-Phoenix ending to wrap up the whole story.<br /><br />Check this out, the Japanese have never even put these episodes on tape much less DVD. Besides the Japanese manga (comics) there is precious little Honey Honey merchandise.<br /><br />A lost classic. I would say get these videos but you probably cant.
B00846REIS|5.0|Read this after 50 shades of grey. The two are similar in ways. The female in this series is \\"experienced\\" so it adds a little twist. Can't wait for the next book to come out in October.
1557427283|5.0|If you do not own this book already and are a writer of any kind, it's time to purchase it.  The thing has helped me out of many a tight spot so far.
0525952926|2.0|I loved Fall of Giants. I've had Winter of the World on preorder for months, and I was so excited when it showed up in the mail. Now that I've dragged myself almost completely through it, I wonder why I bothered. While I cared about the characters in the first book, I can hardly figure out the folks who populate this novel. I learned a lot about WWI in Fall of Giants, but this book doesn't even touch on much that I already do know about WWII. I realize that it must be difficult to write a book of this size, and I would have waited longer for something as good as Fall of Giants. I think I'll just reread that one, and Pillars of the Earth, and World Without End, because I can hardly recognize this one as being by the same author.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the three books from the Hunger Games Trilogy. Even though they were written for a younger adience, they kept my interest and I looked forward to each new book. It's hard to imagine a future like the one portrayed in these books, but I suppose our life we are living now would have been difficult to imagine 100 years ago.<br />Worth the read!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This was the first app I installed on my phone. This is the only app type I know of that transforms the phone physically into another tool and a very useful one at that. Thank you!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very fast read, and quite interesting. Hopefully his remarks regarding the Seals are true and if so I really have a tremendous respect for them.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was a very enjoyable read it kept the imagination fine tuned : )<br />I recommend it to all avid readers who seek escape.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm enjoying this story.  Any story about people in a stasis-like situation, while things look like they are changing around them is great.  Easy to read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|No wonder this book has been on the best seller list for 122 days - even with all the madness of the Grey Trilogy it managed to hang in there.  I am only about a third way through but I do not want to put it down. So far not an exceptional story but so well written that I am enjoying more and more with each chapter.  I am sorry I did not skip the whole Grey thing and go right for this weeks ago!  Try it I think you will all like it!
B007F7QG0Y|1.0|I was in the process of listening to the audiobook. But I could not carry on past the 5th CD (There are 17 Cd's included). In this short time period, he has managed to insult gay people with pure venom. Referring to them as \\"poofters\\" and \\"f@ggots\\". One is example is the terrible way he described Little Richard. I find these words extremely offensive and degrading.<br /> I expected a higher level of maturity and spirituality from Mr. Richards. But the man seems to be extremely crass, insensitive and immature. I am very let down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It was the perfect Bible for on the go. it works great with my kindle fire. I use it everyday for my daily devotions. the lecrae overflow Devo was powerful and instructive.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was not very impressed with all the emails going back and forth.  They got rather boring after a while.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Good movie. The surround sound got a workout with this one.  If you like action movies the you will like this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its ok. I don't mind it. it will give me something to do at school while my teacher is goon on about whatever.
0740785508|4.0|heard lots of great things about James Gurney, and this book is definitely packed with helpful things.<br />I only gave 4 stars because the read is a bit dry...<br />I prefer loomis... but still good buy.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|It's been said before in a lot of one-star reviews but the characters did literally almost everything wrong from the moment the plane crashes. I'm no outdoor survivalist by any means but I think even my 80 year old aunt would have the sense not to leave the plane, a source of warmth, shelter, and not to mention a beacon to any rescuers.<br /><br />Imagine if you were on a cruise ship that had a power outage. Would you leap into the ocean and start swimming in shark infested water, hoping to find an island somewhere? That's sort of what these characters did.<br /><br />The reasons for leaving the crashed plane and heading out into a wide open area for a swath of trees off in the distance are even more dumbfounding. Liam Neeson's character keeps insisting \\"We've got to get food.\\" despite the fact, that, if they would just hunker down and not expel a lot of energy dashing across the tundra, starvation wouldn't even be a concern for another couple weeks.<br /><br />It was bad, really, really bad, and takes itself far too seriously. It's getting two stars instead of one just because I was still talking about how dumb it was even a week later, so at least it wasn't forgetably dumb, it was epically dumb.<br /><br />I know there are those who gave it 5 stars and raved about it. Hey, I'm glad you were able to take away something from it I wasn't.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down even though I am a slow reader. Great _novel I will recommend to everyone
B0087HT36U|5.0|see above for my review see above for my review ditto ditto ditto ditto dot dot dash dot dot dash!
B004U8VUUC|1.0|At least I didn't pay for the movie but I would like the two hours of my life back. It was slow and played like a lifetime movie. Kirsten Dunst's performance was good but I kept waiting for the movie to pick up and it never did. It should have just been on one of those hour long murder mystery news specials - they might have made the story more interesting.
0345803493|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST OF THREE IN MY OPINION. REVEALS A LOT SO DON'T GIVE IT AWAY! BUT BUY AND READ!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality of the video.  I do find it disappointing that I had to watch it on the computer instead of my television.  I also wanted to be able to copy the season on my own disc to take it with me where the internet isn't available.  Other than these objections, I am really pleased with this product.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was easy to read, it kept my attention, but it is not brain surgery.  A thriller, but not believable in many ways.  I felt like the main character (a writer) was just writing the story I was reading. Still entertaining enough.
0756405890|5.0|It's so rare to have someone be so good with all of these:<br />-Language<br />-Story<br />-Plot<br />-Character<br /><br />IF YOU CAN DO ONE OR TWO OF THOSE RIGHT THEN YOU CAN WRITE A GOOD BOOK.<br />AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO WELL AND WORK WITH THAT.
B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|HORRIBLY ACTED WRITTEN NO MAKING SENSE FILM, MAN IS A PERVERT WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH THIS GIRL BUT THE WOMAN TAKES A DAY TO GET DRESSED AND NEVER COMES DOWN TO HELP HER SCREAMS.
0525953728|1.0|I also watched the 60 minutes PR show and there are too many contradictions that makes this book to be a work of fiction.  First of all, when the two steath hopers arrived the light went out in the city.  In Pakistan, every hourse has back up generators so the \\"pitch Black\\" scenerio presented that led to killing of all males in the house is incorrect.  Secondly,the hopers were stealth but the two giant copters canot not be since they make so much noice.  Therefore, the Pakistani military has to know what was up and they were part of this all.  Thirdly, the events of 1st floor shoot out resulted in killing of one male but as son as they opened the door, these were a woman and a kid standing in front of SEALs, that looks so much like a fiction that anyone with a common sense will not believe a word of this.  I have over 70 fictional points but will not mention them here.
B0087HT36U|4.0|i had alot of fun with this game, not bad for free app of the day. more fun than angry birds in my honest opinion.
140120841X|5.0|A seminal and powerful manifesto delivered in rarest of forms, V for Vendetta is the sequential storytelling equivalent to French Filmaking giving reading audiences what they always wanted and what they deserve... a dose of candid realism and magical realism woven into a complex tapestry exploring such themes as politics, the human condition, domino effect, and synchronicity. This virtuous dystopian tale is filled with inner and outer metaphysical wisdom, stabbing at the heart and dark underbelly of our sheepish and malcontent lives. Read and re-read again and again and its philosophy will root itself organically into the fabric of your soul... if you're willing.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the most awssome game for free. it is so freakin addicting omg i was so mad we  i couldnt get it cuz it caused 99

0393343405|5.0|Greenblatt follows the life of a man name Poggio who unearths, recopies and promotes a Lucretius book On the Nature of Things which brings back a much more secular and materialistic world view which becomes the basis of the Renaissance and our modern western world. This is \\"the swerve\\" he writes about - the change from the religiosity of the Middle Ages to the new more Epicurean world view of the Renaissance.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not only is the app extremely functional and customizable but the UI is very attractive as well! I think this is a gold standard for apps.

0525952926|1.0|I was given my Kindle last Christmas as a gift and have enjoyed reading with it but am getting tired of the price gouging.  if this keeps up I will start buying the hard covers again at costco and sams.  I can get them cheaper then I can get the electronic books.  TAKE HEED AMAZON AND AUTHORS OF THE BOOKS i READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game. it is really fun.I saw this game it looked like fun so all of u people out there who r thinking about playing it u should.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There is a happy ending. That is one of the most important things to me. I hate if there is no happy ending and you are left feeling like something is missing. This book makes you sad, mad, happy and there is also a little bit of a triangle.<br /><br />I hate how forgiving the main character Abby is at certain points of the story. Abby balances Travis out but she is still running from her past and when her past comes knocking at her door, the relationship that they have established is threatened. It is sweet how she reacts with his family and the best friends are great characters.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot and highly recommend it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend suggested this app to me; a little time passer for waiting on line. It can consume long moments of time going from screen to screen figuring out how to 'connect the dots' with the most efficient use of space and the fewest moves. I find myself turning to the game when I have frustrating tasks to unravel at work. A few moments of Flow Free and the problems do seem to work themselves out!
B00122LXTM|5.0|Started out looking for one particular Doobie Bros. song and when I saw the listing for \\"The Very Best of...\\" and noticed what was included I jumped on the purchase.  Not only did I get the one song that I was after, I got a ton that I had forgotten about as well.  GREAT deal!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed this controversial book very much.  The author really tried to tell the story of the operation from the viewpoints of the men who this type of job for a living without bragging.
0061906220|5.0|This has to be one of the best children's books out lately.  Pete the Cat is so delightful in his adventures while wearing white shoes.  My two-year-old granddaughters think he is the funniest critter on earth as he stumbles through the different colors and soils his shoes.  They love the repetitive verses and hilarious expressions on his face, too.  I just think they can easily relate to him.  Great book and even I(the Grandmother) am excited about it.  Also, you can get on the internet and hear the book done in song.  The kids wiggle and jiggle all over the place during it because they think it is a riot!!!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|With permissions like this I'm surprised they don't ask for a first born child! Really, adults aren't the target for mined data... They need to know how to sell to kids' mushy impressionable minds. Middle finger to Namco Bandai. I'll remember this jerks.

B0083EW97W|2.0|Well, I must first of all say that I am not a Mayer fan. I bought this download for a friends birthday card...which by the way I haven't sent yet!<br />Anyway, I listen to allot of music, and I like alot of differnt kinds of music...but this cd was just boring.....I have other Mayer music, and honestly...older is better as far as I can see for John Mayer...it lost something somewhere ...can't  say that I liked it much at all...not that the playing or singing wasn't good, it just didn't have any 'life' to it...felt like he recorded the whole CD while he was laying down...Just MHO folks...that's all!<br />Guess I'd best sent that CD on to the friend I bought it for, she's probably waiting for it, and most likely will love it!

B004SBQGHS|5.0|I play this game almost every day; its so much fun!  Some levels are pretty easy but some take some critical thinking.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The series is extremely powerful, very well-written, and thoroughly enjoyable despite being equally depressing.  It paints a bleak picture of humanity and shows a future that's based on both our present and our past.  It sends a strong anti-war message but also shows the problems with doing nothing when a terrible government has total control of a country.  Overall, it's a fantastic series that could easily be included in an English Literature class in high school or college yet is fully accessible to the average reader.  Absolutely worth reading!

1878424319|1.0|I bought this because it was described as \\"Just like new\\" or something to that effect. A lot closer to \\"Rode hard and put away wet\\". The book was replete with yellow highlighting and extensive underlining of what someone thought were key passages. I prefer to find out myself. Physical condition was also not \\"Just like new\\". I have highlighted and underlined this vendor as being \\"Just like a fraud\\".

B00413QB5A|2.0|This book , although entertaining , is not characteristic of some of Folletts' later works . It sort of plods along to the finish line.
B000H5TVJY|3.0|The sardonic handling of wall street mentality is a little entertaining. The dialogue from Bale such as his rants about 80's pop artists, was fun. But overall the movie really fails to have a plot outside of \\"guy kills people in twisted and colorful ways.\\" I don't know, is that all it takes to get 5 stars from so many? Perhaps this is a commentary on the audience. If you see it and aren't repulsed by the violence towards women, you may continue to watch and be entertained and then be confused by it's ending. Thank you director, for toning down the violence of the book, still though, this really just emphasizes the lack of plot. 3of5 because it did have a few laughs.

B000AQJPQE|1.0|Pros:<br />- fairly easy to put together<br />- cool and realistic colors on planets<br /><br />Cons:<br />- sun does not light up well enough to illuminate planets which means at night, when the mobile is on, you cannot see the planets!!<br />- loud annoying grinding sound as planets rotate<br />- it turns off after just 10 minutes (which is sort of a blessing considering the irritating motor you hear when mobile is on)<br /><br />Wish list:<br />- sun was a bit brighter (for the size of the sun, it illuminates about the same as a tiny nightlight)<br />- planets were illuminated so you could see them in the dark, especially since the colors are so cool<br />- system lasted at least 20 minutes before turning off<br />- unit was quieter when on<br />- planets hung down in various lengths<br />- larger planets (good luck watching the smallest planets rotate in the dark! You'll find yourself focusing on Saturn!)
B00785P2QC|3.0|virtual city is a fun game.  I do however find it bothering that this is part of the quests.  how cheesey can you get?  I don't want to bombard facebook friends with these spam messages either its rude and pointless.  word of mouth directly from User to their friends is much better pr stance.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|If you are familiar with some of Burton and Depp's previous movies together, you may find this film to be closely allied with their film \\"Sleepy Hollow\\".  While \\"Dark Shadows\\" has some underlying humor not present in \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", it does have that same gothic-macabre feel.  If you are looking for the eerie charm of \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Dark Shadows\\" is much more intense.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the first book in Fifty Shades trilogy, but Fifty Shades Darker develops so much more of their relationship both physically and emotionally. New characters enter the story adding both mystery and suspense.  I finished this book in two days!  I could not put it down!
B004XN3FHA|1.0|Love the brightness, loved showing it off to my co-workers on midnights, in the field.  HOWEVER, I didn't like that it would not turn on when I needed it.  That was really embarassing.  Law enforcement should not buy this.  When you get out of the car, and you're looking for that man with a gun, in the dark, you need a flashlight that will turn on instantly.  This isn't that flashlight.<br /><br />It's a good, bright flashlight for when the power goes out, or you need to find the circuitbreaker, or any other time when you can wait a few seconds for your flashlight to turn on.  It's WAY too expensive for that purpose.<br /><br />To repeat: if you might ever encounter a situation where the failure of your flashlight might endanger your life, please don't buy this flashlight.  Believe me, it will scare the hell out of you, and then you will realize I was right, and you'll want to kick yourself.  That is, if you didn't get killed when this happened.  Don't let this fatal flaw become an actual fatal flaw.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An excellent account of how an elite Navy Seal team carries out its mission. The introductory chapters tell us how a team member gets to be good enough to be chosen to go on a historic mission and the later chapters dispel the myths, fog and misinformation of this incredible operation. The author is impatient with the way Washington works but the fact that we have an combat outfit like Seal Team Six lets Washington and our Commander-in-Chief pursue options that minimize civilian deaths while meeting mission objectives, a clear win in the propaganda wars.<br /><br />By the terms of his service agreement, he should have had the script vetted before its publication but I believe it is a better and more clear story for his choice to go ahead without doing so. I give the author credit for telling the story; he may have sacrificed his career and all profits from the book to do it. The elite team code is: don't tell or brag. They just get the job done.<br /><br />Well and simply told, I couldn't put it down.
B004QO9WVO|2.0|The reader did not do very good. He was not very expressive,very monotone.His diction was subpar.I am refering to the auto version of this book From Edwards Publishing House.The book its self is a masterpiece of course.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read on non fiction about military operations. I strongly recommend it. The text is clear, logical and entertaining. Nice job!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Each book was better that the last!! I will be reading this series over and over for years to come!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Definite read, very interesting and informative.  Nothing is disclosed that would be an issue.....Obama, the government and politicians should have no say over what our special forces are engaged in and doing, overseas, anywhere, any & all special ops..War is war..  Our military and specially trained men and women deserve much better  than what they receive. The very stupid rules that have become warnings to the enemy need to be removed from the rulebooks.  Lawyers need to think about justice for all, not just their guilty clients.<br /> I am proud to be an American and think less information on National security and things involving police activity against the enemy and criminals should be kept out of the media.<br />It is very commendable for money from this book to be donated to families of the Special Forces, and the list of organizations that we can donate directly to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read/have read tons of books that are part of a series, and I couldn't believe this book was better than the first!
0807014273|5.0|This is the exoperience of a great man and Psychologist Vicktor Frankl and how he developed his theory of Existential Psychology.  He spent 3 years in various concentration camps in Poland and developed a way to live each day and survive. He also delves into the psychology of his fellow prisoners and the camp guards and camp structure.  This is his and unltimately our search for meaning.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was looking forward to reading this as soon as I heard about it.  It was everything I expected. I read it in three evenings and couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  It clarifies a lot of unanswered questions.  Good job!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is outstanding!  It gives you a front line perspective of what it is like for these men who put their lives on the line every day to protect and defend the American way of life!  I am honored to be able to read it and grateful that Mark Owen chose to give an account of his experiences, setting the record straight in light of the lies the Obama Administration had told about it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|my son as well as I really enjoy playing this game.  its a nice upgrade from when I played a version of this game when I was his age.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Chances are you already know what Caligula is about and that the movie took sex combined with violence and integrated it into the film in a new way previous to 1979.  If you are not familiar with these things, then you should review some of the other reviews before making a purchasing decision.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell acted in the film, but did not perform nearly as well as he did in Clockwork Orange or Evilenko, (two much better films to buy if you are a Malcolm McDowell fan like me), although I am sure he had fun.  However, Teresa Ann Savoy does great job acting in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I like the film and will watch it again.  The part that is annoying is that on the DVD back cover it states, \\"this landmark production is now presented in a beautiful new high-definition transfer from recently uncovered negative elements\\".  This is a huge marketing stretch, the DVD transfer is dark and grainy, and so keep in mind you have been warned if this is a concern of yours.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Charlize Theron is a great actress and plays this role wonderfully. The huntsman and dwarfs really brought the characters to life and the effects were great.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|This is the best album of the year.Jack White rocks with the best of them ( 16 Candles and Freedom at 21).. Then he switches tempos and does song like Love Interruption and Blunderbuss.He is one fo the best song writers currently.This album proves it !!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|My daughter recommended it. (I am 77 yrs of age.) In fact I started reading her copy of Hunger Games on her new I-Pad and had to buy a Kindle so that I could carry on. I am inclined to steer clear of new authors so could not get over the fact that I couldn't put it down and had to get the next two immediately. I don't think I have ever read the three books of a trilogy one after the other.<br />A new exciting author. Must find out what else she has written.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I read the reviews before I bought this book, and I almost passed right over it.  However, having loved all Sophie Kinsella books read previously, I went on gut feelings and purchased this book.  I'm so glad I did.  It was truly delightful.  It is typical Kinsella wit and humor.  I just loved it, and found the whole ghost idea very creative and refreshing.  If you are looking for something light, fun and quick to read, this is the book for you.  Just a feel good, happy read.
B00756GKBA|5.0|She did it again (with a collection of songs that not only remains current, but that also continues to give her credibility as the world's most successful Dance artist.)<br /><br />\\"Girl Gone Wild\\" and \\"Give Me Your Lovin'\\" have everything it takes to propel her into \\"hit\\" territory, while there are other gems abound here to introduce her to whole new audiences!<br /><br />I won't waste time here reviewing the album, as that has already been done countless times.  I'll only say that I find it impressive that at 54 years old, she's still very boldly stepping out with freshness, diligence and showing no signs whatsoever of slowing down.<br /><br />This is an album tailor-made for a night on the dancefloor and despite it's lack of selling power, the Golden Globe win for \\"Masterpiece\\" trumps all of that with yet another feather in her thirty-year reign as Queen of Pop and further cements exactly how and why she holds her position as a gigantic cultural icon.  She is Pop Music majesty and all the others continue to fall by the wayside in comparison stylistically and musically.  Simply, they cannot compete.<br /><br />No artist in history can ever hold it down like Madonna can.  She's in \\"a league of her own\\" with an endless list of #1 Dance singles.  \\"MDNA\\" is a complete \\"masterpiece.\\"  Elton only WISHES HE could ascend to the heights Madonna has and clearly, she's outgrossed his ass 100x over.  Soon enough, the world will be asking \\"Lady Who?\\" and \\"Rihanna WHO?\\"  Drive and hard work pay off.  It's not Rocket Science.  Madonna Louise Ciccone Ritchie is STILL a legend and deservedly so!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|this is honestly the worst book i have ever read in my entire life. i will never read a book by suzanne collins again
B008220CHO|4.0|I didn't go into this one with high hopes. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very good horror film and had me squirming and jumping out of my seat a few times. Excellent cast and well directed. Yes it treads familiar territory but it does so with such passion and puts a new spin on the genre you cannot but admire the it. I loved it!
B0018W2L38|5.0|I have always enjoyed listening to Russian versions of western opera. This filled the want. Atlantov,no stranger to the west did a nice job with the title role. Vishnevskaya,nothing needs to be said about her singing. Wish we could have seen more of her during the cold war. Have recomended this to several friends.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This was a great story and I enjoyed reading it. The story starts out a little slow, but once the pace picked up, it was very hard to put the book down.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|When version 4 comes to the Amazon Appstore DO NOT UPDATE the app.  Version 4 is just plain horrible, virtually unusable if used offline, no full screen, low light doesn't work anymore, the search was changed, and not for the better.  If you're lucky (or unlucky) enough to manage to create an account, sign-in, and get the new incredibly slow-loading app to start up, look forward to force closing issues and very poor response.  If you've got version 3, hang on to it, apparently it's going to be the last good version of this app.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love the game. I'm not too crazy about the ads but at least they are only popping up after the deal for me.
B007V508CC|5.0|I read some not so positive reviews about this CD before I purchased, but I'm SOOOOO glad I didn't let those reviews stop me from making my own determination.  Sometimes music isn't always about what you're used to, or what accolades the past music has received, but THIS is what music is all about, IMO.  I've listened to this to and from work, at work (when no one is around - wink, wink), and it's filling up my house right now.  There's nothing boring about this CD.  Every song has it's own beat, it's message, while it may not be deep and life changing for some, I find that I'm moving to every song.  I catch myself grooving in my car on my way to work, and if I were to get stopped - it would definitely be for \\"distracted driving\\" (LOL)  I sure wouldn't complain if I were standing 'in the middle of Hollywood Blvd' while Adam 'wipes my eyes.'  I bought this CD for one song, initially - \\"One More Night\\" but that has quickly changed.  If you can't relate to \\"Sad\\" at one point in your life than you're either arrogant or you're too young to understand.  My new favorite!  Did I mention I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CD?  Give it a try and just let it play!
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Micheal Connelly's ability to string together a tale continues to be masterful. As usual the plot develops easily setting out the landscape and defining the actors. and then it starts rolling taking turns on two wheels while the LAPD Bureaucracy greases the wheels with epoxy and the FBI plays catch-up to Harry Bosch's unwavering mental march to the truth despite the pushes and pulls on the ride. I had to suspend belief through a few technical details, but that isn't difficult if you want to follow the tale, and in the end they played no part in the solution to the mystery, so it can be claimed as artistic license. The mystery was a page turner.
1451648537|4.0|This guy really did define the era we live in; I remember the beginning in the early 1980's. Isaacson does a goo job of putting Job's life and details in focus. And it's not all real appetizing. Steve Jobs was aggressively greedy and lustful. Good read. Might have offered a bit more historical context.
B008SAXHG8|4.0|Billy Talent knows how to make music, but with the release of Billy Talent III, it seemed the band was losing it's edge. Billy Talent has made a comeback with a punchy and super enjoyable fourth studio album named Dead Silence. The band combines pop-punk with rock in a beautiful way, and in this album we get a taste of everything. The first few songs are heavy and well crafted with well mixed instruments and as always great vocals. As the album progresses, we get some slower songs and even a couple filler songs. I do wish Billy Talent put a bit more effort and energy into making the overall album punch you in the face, but the half of the album that stands out makes this album worth listening to. My favorite tracks are: Viking Death March, Surprise Surprise, Runnin' Across The Tracks, Love Was Still Around, Crooked Minds, Man Alive and Cure for the Enemy. If you are a Billy Talent fan, or a punk rock fan in general, I recommend this album.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I fell in love with Celtic Woman the first time I heard them. Their voices, individually and corporately, are so pure and clear they really don't need musical accompaniment (but that is first rate too).  This album showcases all the lovely ladies and leaves one wanting to hear more.  Although I loved all the songs, my favorites were \\"Orinoco Flow\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\"  I highly recommend this album!
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Awakens the Spirit........ energizing, up beat, makes you want to be happy....<br />one of his best. if you need to pull out of a slump...this is the way to do it...so many different kinds of blended instruments...

B008220DGE|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's movies tend to be sprawling, inconclusive, and difficult to summarize. In that, they are more like the books of novelists such as David Foster Wallace then like any movies currently being made (at least in America). \\"The Master\\" isn't the most elusive of Anderson's movies--for me, that will always be \\"Magnolia\\"--but it will separate the Anderson lovers from the Anderson haters, with a large subgroup of viewers scratching their heads, unsure what they think of the movie but also unable to get it out of their minds.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" begins with the story of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a shell-shocked sailor whose World War II service leaves him a feckless, sex-obsessed drunk. After various misadventures, he ends up by accident in the circle of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a charismatic, self-proclaimed genius who loves Freddie's ability to create potent potables from whatever chemicals he has at hand. The rest of the story concerns Freddie's induction into Dodd's cult and the strange, love-hate relationship that develops between the two men.<br /><br />To say anything more about the plot after Freddie and Dodd's meeting would be giving away too much. It isn't just that the events are difficult to summarize; it's also that it would spoil the sheer, unadulterated shock Anderson wants the audience to feel. (Hint: you'll never regard the old folk song, \\"I'll Go No More A-Roving,\\" the same way again.) You may or may not like what Anderson presents, but you will not be bored. At the very least, Phoenix and Hoffman alone will keep you fascinated. If there's such a thing as bravura acting, it's what Phoenix and Hoffman do here. One brief scene, with Phoenix and Hoffman side-by-side in adjacent jail cells, alone is enough to establish both actors' claims for this year's Best Actor Oscar. (How will the Academy ever choose between them? After all, there have only been two ties in the Academy's history.)<br /><br />The closest I can come to describing the theme of \\"The Master\\" is that it concerns two recognizable American types: one who seeks to bind others to him, and another who cannot be bound. It turns out to be a bigger theme than one movie can contain, but Anderson makes an honorable effort, and to my mind a thrilling one. You be the judge. But at least you won't be sorry you saw Phoenix and Hoffman in these roles.come to describing the theme of \\"The Master\\" is that it concerns two recognizable American types: one who seeks to bind others to him, and another who cannot be bound.

B005LAII80|5.0|Absolutely amazing, well done. Great script, great acting, excellent action scenes. Dredd truly sets the new standard in the action genre. I came out of this movie absolutely stunned. It was flawless. I will preorder as soon as this item becomes available. It's a day one purchase for me. It was that good. Well done.
B00005ASOC|5.0|The other reviewer have pretty much said it all....so I do not have much actual content to add. But just want to add to my list of rare gems, those funny odd offbeat films, many without much sex or violence but still work just fine...hey! It's a concept?<br />I guess I can make a list of favorites like I did over on IMDB including say. VITUS.. NOW  there is a cool different film..from Hungry I think....any way most ofmthemfilms on mynSPECIAL RARE LIST...are pretty non-mainstream, often true stories...so this one Finding Forester just seems so well done thatmitmshould be/could be true.  Next go grab another gem....RADIO.  OK that is it for now. FF i bought...I own around 14 movies...this is one known to share. Enjoy.

B00000ERD2|5.0|This is the band that did it for me.  Emerson's arrangement of Moussorsky's Picture's is what got me hooked on classical music, even made me study the piano.  Yet even after all these years, this album is still the holy grail for me.  Things have changed for me from hissy, popping vinyl to hi bit/sampling DVDAudio but the star is still the band.  What a fabulous mix.  In 7.2 (OK 7.4 if you wanna get picky) this thing shines.  Bass lines articulate and clear.  Voices where they should be, center channel and a really spacious utilization of surround channels.  Listening with thousands of clean watts of power, multiple subs and state of the art speakers this new mix does not dissapoint.  Sorry I can't say the same for the the Tarkus DVDAudio remix.  Doesn't even sound like the same sound engineer.  Now let's do Trilogy!  Buy this, you'll like it I promise.  :)
B008C40218|4.0|Joey Burns and John Covertino founded Calexico in Tucson in 1996, and they continue to explore territory on the border between Southwestern rock and Mexican music. Longtime fans will be very satisfied by this new release, their seventh, and it should attract even more followers with its seamless blend of atmospheric guitars and vocals with lush horns and violins. Recorded in New Orleans, it bears none of the sounds of that city, but it does capture some of its mournful pathos.<br /><br />\\"Algiers\\" opens with two sweeping anthems, \\"Epic\\" and \\"Splitter,\\" followed by the songs \\"Sinner in the Sea\\" and \\"Para,\\" both of which have a feeling of low-key, minor-key menace that builds to a shattering climax. A Latin rock instrumental entitled \\"Algiers\\" precedes a powerful song of lost love, \\"Maybe on Monday,\\" and two others with a south-of-the-border style (think acoustic guitar and mariachi trumpets), \\"Puerto\\" and \\"No Te Vayas,\\" the latter sung in Spanish. The album closes with two intimate, heartfelt songs. The first, \\"Hush,\\" is much simpler than second, \\"The Vanishing Mind,\\" which features a layered sound with acoustic piano and strings.<br /><br />Not all of the tracks on this CD are quite as effective as the ones I've mentioned. The confessional \\"Fortune Teller\\" is a lovely composition that brings to mind Paul Simon, and while that's very good company to be in, I feel the song lacks distinctiveness. \\"Better and Better\\" is just too fragile and pathetic for me. Overall, however, the album is a beautiful, brooding work that perfectly matches my mood on those cloudy days when I want to wallow in my blues.<br /><br />A two-CD import edition is also available. It contains \\"Spiritoso,\\" a second 12-track disc with an excellent live concert performance that includes several of the songs on \\"Algiers\\":<br /><br />1. Frontera / Trigger (5:25)<br />2. Epic (4:24)<br />3. The News About William (3:44)<br />4. Black Heart (4:54)<br />5. Minas De Cobre (3:02)<br />6. Inspiracion (3:29)<br />7. Two Silver Trees (4:39)<br />8. Para (4:39)<br />9. Quattro (5:02)<br />10. Crystal Frontier (7:43)<br />11. The Vanishing Mind (4:13)<br />12. Fortune Teller (4:19)r />7. Two Silver Trees (4:39)<br />8. Para (4:39)<br />9. Quattro (5:02)<br />10.

B007Y2W44W|5.0|As I have said before, I appreciate the production of Nile albums continually getting better. In the past they always were really muddy sounding. Even though they still have some improvements to make production wise, this is on par with the sound production of the previous 3 albums. In addition, they have liner notes and GREAT artwork with this release too. This is my favorite artwork of any of their releases thus far. The packaging of Nile albums, and the artwork adds to the shear awesome experience of listening to this great band.<br /><br />Death metal like this can be an acquired taste for people, including those who already listen to metal. I enjoy all types of metal, but after listening to some of everything that there is to offer over the years, the technical ability and unique sound of Nile never fails to amaze me. They are better live than they are on record, because actually seeing them destroying their instruments on stage is something out of this world. They have some of the most impressive gear and electronics I have ever seen. They are comfortable at what they do and it shows!!<br /><br />Stand out tracks to me are track 2,3, 6, and 10. I like the Nile songs that mix some of the catchy grooves and choruses in with trashing and insane riffing. There really isn't much else to say about Nile in general that hasn't already been said. The track by track analysis others have wrote are accurate. If you are new to death metal, or want to listen to the best in the genre, Nile is one of the best. Sit back with some headphones on and turn it up really really really loud.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This has an interesting twist to the \\"End of the World\\" scenario novels.  A bit confusing in the beginning, however, the writer brings it all together in the end. I really felt for the main character as he endured every possible hardship and near death experience you can imagine and came out ok (hope I didn't give anything away).  At first, I was confused about the creatures, but thought the explanation very believeable.  Overall, a very good book.
B007SGM084|2.0|okay at first- kinda like a book you have to stick with because you're sure the story will begin to have structure, and momentum and purpose. It never began. Weak character development, weak and slow story evolution, and so much sex that it became monotonous. I bought the trilogy on my Kindle to save money, but ended up loosing money because I deleted it after about 16 chapters of nothing. Don't waste your time.

B005X5MXM0|4.0|Good show to have for fans of Ian and Mick but both guys rocked harder with Mott and David rather than together.  Good show overall but not as energetic rock as one might expect from these two together.  Good example is Cleveland Rocks.  Ian played it in Chicago last October more enthusiastically (at age 72) than with Mick and band here.  Even the Drew Carey show version was more enthusiastic than here, but, just my opinion since I was there in Chicago.  Having a member of the Mekons singing backup didn't hurt?<br /><br />I wonder if Mick, Ian and David Bowie ever shared the stage together?  Something tells me THAT would rock.<br /><br />This DVD in NTSC format (shows \\"Region 0\\" on the cover thumbnail on Amazon but not the actual DVD cover) is only in Stereo but sounds OK enough to be passable.  Video quality is about as could be<br />expected from the period of 1980 but grainy.  The lighting on the musicians is not up to par but the camera angles are proficiently done without annoying aggressive changes in angles and zooms.<br /><br />Overall a good thing to have of fans of this type of music.  Ian plays pretty much guitar with another guy on keyboards.  Ian also plays a cool \\"double-rail\\" guitar at times.<br /><br />Kinda funny how great it is that the TV show captured a great segment of cultural history that can be treasured over the ages.  Glad some of the tapes survived.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Absolutely one of the most amazing novels written in my life time.... Look out Thomas Pynchon.....  The story, (story's) themes all intertwining, and the glorious use of language.  The first chapter is rough, and thank you Kindle for the built in dictionary... I got hooked and couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to see what they do with this as a movie either.  Enjoy this one.  No.  Savor it.  Tell your friends to read this.  Truly exceptional...
B000J10ERO|4.0|the only problem with this movie (and it's a doozey) is that the females leads are woefully miscast:  kate bosworth is just NOT convincing as lois lane (and there is ZERO chemistry between her and THE MAN) and parker posey is. . . well, parker posey; she always plays herself and this is NOT the roll for that.  eva marie saint is phenomenal in a cameo as martha kent (lots of chemistry between her and THE MAN).<br /><br />brandon routh IS superman:  he has the beauty, the bod, the just-aloof-enough-not-to-be-too-mortal personality; he is such a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />this is a beautiful flick; give it a look-see.

However, I am reminded of what I've always told my students: \\"do not assume anything. You know what it makes out of you and me?\\"  I only read it, because I paid for it.  I wish I had not. It was not worth a dime.  It was no better than a \\"trashy\\" dime novel!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The third book was a huge disappointment. Felt as tho I was reading the same boring dialogue and I finally became so annoyed I deleted the remaining unread third from my Kindle.

B00571F26Y|4.0|I like to see facts in a book that is on such an important subject as your own health. By the end of this book you are left in no doubt about the evils of wheat.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I've read literally every book Mr. King has authored or co-authored. I willing admit I liked everyone of them - some better than others of course. But since I apparently missed the new constitutional admendment that declares anyone who disagrees with an African-American president's political agenda is automatically a rascist, I've decided to discontinue my patronage of Mr. King's literary career. Just can't stand stereotyping of any group of people.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game to pass the time when I am bored. I use it more than any other.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Enjoyed the second book as much as the first book in this series. I particularly enjoy the unpredictability of the story. No character is safe. The author isn't writing a \\"feel good book\\", and it makes the story much better as you never know what is going to happen.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this on my android phone and kindle fire. Never have any issues. I'm on this app all the time just love it.
B00005R23S|5.0|Still waiting for 1080p but I guess it may never come. Too bad because that would be the icing on the cake
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This movie is so amazing, I don't think I have enough words to describe how awesome this movie was.<br /><br />This should be (or is it?) a classic movie everyone should see. The narrator is unhappy with his life, and meets Tyler Durdan, and it changes his life forever. Now I won't give too much information, because the first rule of Fight Club, is to not talk about Fight Club.<br /><br />But if you want a movie about a man who is struggling with his life, finds something that makes him happy and a friend, but everything just completely goes wrong in a psychological thriller, this is for you.<br /><br />I was not expecting the ending. This movie also makes you think about the world around you. People do want things they don't need.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|pretty awesome for a free app and an excellent time waster. the best part is not having to use real quarters!
0735327793|5.0|This is the first Mudpuppy puzzle I've purchased.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality / durability of the puzzle and the box.  The pieces are a nice size for small hands, about 3'x3' (measuring as if the piece were a full square).  They are made of cardboard, but it is thick and stiff, it does not bend easily like some other cheaper puzzles we own.  The puzzle has been worked many times over the last few months by my toddler and so far shows no signs of wear and tear.  It has a nice shiny / slick surface which I imagine can be cleaned up fairly easily if needed.  This was not purchased through Amazon (because I found it slightly cheaper elsewhere), but this is where I come for product reviews so I thought it would be helpful to include this for others.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is really good. my favorite part was when they finally got to see each other for the first time.
B004UID2LC|1.0|KINDLE FIRE<br /><br />What the heck? It just, doesn't work. At all. Like, what? Do not purchase, why would you purchase something that just, doesn't work? At all.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it .it is just like the old arcade game you used to play at restrautes. you should so get it I mean its free right
B00992CF6W|5.0|OMFG I love this game it worked great on my kindle and I already (after 2 days have all the gold and diamond weapons. :D I'm so happy!  ( emperors new groove quote)  ;)
B007TMON8M|4.0|A fun and challenging game.  Can't wait for them to come out with some new problems! Played on an Acer Tab with no problems.
B006OB3K56|5.0|Shame is a film about a sex addict living in New York City. This is bold filmmaking and Michael Fassbender gives an absolutely visceral performance as a sex addict that is powerless over his addiction. Steve McQueen directs brilliantly showing the strained relationship between Brandon and his sister and how she prevents him from carrying out his carefully planned lifestyle. The real person to watch is Fassbender. He gives a raw and completely immersive performance. A must-see for serious film lovers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have a kindle too but for some odd reason it won't download no matter what! please help me with this problem.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|So like many others have said before, I really love this game but there are still things that need to be worked out. I have an evo 4G lte with sprint and it does lose coins, gadgets that I have purchased and even given me negative coin amounts. Once these are fixed and my gadgets restored will gladly give 5 stars
B004UID2LC|3.0|its fine most of the time but i cant download any vidz even if i have nothing elss  downloaded at all
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Was not easy to use .  just want to be able to type in a word and find it. Need better directions.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I first played this game on my uncles phone and it was so fun I bought it its only 99 cents that's good for such an awesome game. you should get this game it is awesome and fun for all ages.
B008W14ZD2|5.0|just a great great CD.  trust me buy the whole album.  every song is awesome.  Love listening to it.  Owl City definitely has a winner here.
B005HSL626|4.0|fingering fun! if you like fruit smoothies you gotta like fruit ninja. oh and i actually ment smoothies as in food
B005AFB69E|5.0|Ladyhawke is one of our all-time favorite movies!  To be able to watch it in bluray was better than ever!  I was a little concerned about ordering it from overseas but the delivery was punctual and the quality of the dvd was awesome.  Thanks Amazon!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really fun for a 15/20 minute time killer a day.  never a need to buy coins unless you just wanna A in my book
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Great to watch years later.  Kevin Klein is a great actor,  It's a shame about River Phoenix.  He played a great roll.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Creative, thought provoking and entertaining on multiple levels. I was particularly impressed with Mitchell's use of changes in language through time.
B005LAII80|5.0|When I left the theater after seeing Dredd, I had to pinch myself. It is the first action movie I have seen since perhaps Terminator 2 in which I was fully engrossed and thoroughly entertained throughout. I initially had my doubts about Karl Urban as Judge Dredd, but his performance is stellar, perhaps phenomenal. Urban's delivery of Dredd's famous signature one-liner was goosebump-inducing in so much as it captured everything that is Judge Dredd with ne'er a hint of effort. I never felt like I was watching Karl Urban as Judge Dredd; I was simply watching Judge Dredd himself. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headly also offer up flawless performances as the rookie Psy-Judge Anderson and criminal queen-pin Ma-ma, respectively. I applaud Alex Garland's decision to leave Dredd's helmet on for the duration of the film, paying homage to the comics and lending an air to the character that would vanish were the helmet to come off. Though, this movie goes beyond merely fulfilling every Judge Dredd fan's dreams. It is, even to the uninitiated, a thoroughly enjoyable action movie bereft of the undesirable corniness and bad acting which so often plagues the genre. Dredd is truly an instant cult classic.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am fairly new to Lee Child's character Jack Reacher and by no means have I read all his books; but without doubt, this book is a good read. What I noticed most was that in this presentation of Reacher, he doesn't get it done all alone. I enjoyed the book and the only criticism I would have is that it only took me two days to read it. At that rate, I'll go broke.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Hahaha You're little bit late :P It have been released in Sweden already (2012-09-05). I thought Ameirca was the first one with release dates, especially with their own movies :S But not this time. I wonder why?<br /><br />Anyway. This movie was awesome :D All the heros you wanna see is in there!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game package provides lots of variety.  They open about twelve of the games at first and you earn coins to access more.  I love the cookie game.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I used to be mainly a classic rock guy until a friends daughter shared a link with me on You Tube. It was on a cover PTX did on \\"Somebody that I used to know\\" by Gotye, which led me to watching all of the Sing Off episodes. Now I am hooked and NOBODY can do what these guys do. To say they are great is an understatement. I just can't believe there are no instruments! Acapella at it's finest. Now I love pop music and PTX has even got me up to date with a lot of songs that I had never even heard before. OK, I admit it, I had never even heard of Gotye before PTX! When I hear the original songs all I can think is \\"Wow PTX is much better than the originals!\\". Love these guys - you will too! Ps. I am not related to Avi Kaplan. Sometimes when I post something I get so many friends request or mail because they think I am related. Avi is awesome for sure, but not a family member.  ;-)
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|You rock Lee Child!!!<br />Gripping from start to finish<br />Your laconic style shone through, and I had a right chuckle on occasions too.<br />No falling in love this time?<br />My mind wandered to the horrible thought of Tom Crusie playing Jack....hideous thought!<br />Await next novel with baited breathe
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I had pretty low expectations for a two dollar hidden-object game. But this game was truely incredible! The gameplay mechanics were great. The plot was exciting and dramatic. The atmosphere was creepy and eerie... They couldn't have done a better job! I can't wait for the sequel to come out!
B009157BWU|5.0|This movie was just inspirational.  The scenery was gorgeous, even though during the after movie credits we could see they \\"blended\\" scenery from other rainforest type countries also.  The story was touching and perfect for the entire family.  Sadness and happiness and beautiful scenery and a little chimp you are actually touched by.
B000VZUT64|4.0|Was surfing around & ran into this old album. Not sure the  year it came out, but originally bought it in vinyl, then cassette. I frecently found it digitallys remastered on Amazon. I remember it was around when the 1st wife was around. That was a long time ago..<br /><br />Anyway, good old tunes. Brings back alot of good memmories........
B00932A6G4|1.0|To rate this movie, I would have to say PEEEE UUUUUU.  It was awful.  Starship Troopers was a fun cheesy  movie and we assumed that this would be similar.  First it was ANIME, and we should have read the description better.  That would have been okay, but this was really awful.  Even though we paid for it, we didn't watch it all, that is how bad it was.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I remember going to the fair and playing this game for hours. Its just like the real thing. Love this game.
B008ZTVQLA|4.0|This time Ian goes back to his Rant band years and puts together a nice follow up to Rant!  This is a great record with memories of Mott The Hoople all over it.  Horn arrangements, etc. bring us back to the Ian we once knew.  Great record Ian.  Let's not forget he is 73 years old.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I have always enjoyed Christophers essays and books.<br />Even while he was dying he managed to have lucid and interesting thoughts.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very handy app. I like to know the status of battery and this gives me a graphic picture. highly recommend it
1401216676|5.0|What I mean by concentrated is that it seems like Alan Moore has so meticulously created each panel to only advance the story or further immerse you into the book; there's never a dull/unnecessary panel. Moore switches back and forth between telling the story of Joker's present crime to what created the Joker in the beginning, Moore is one of the few that can pull of telling two stories at once and tying them together so nicely. The only downfall to this amazing comic is that it's a quick read; however, if youre anything like me youll be reading this one multiple times.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased this book solely out of curiosity...so many of my friends have read this & it's all I read about on fb....BUT as I started reading, I couldn't help feeling like I was reading an excerpt from a teenage girls diary. The writing is embarrassingly poor, often I felt like a thesaurus was used to throw 'big' words in to 'smarten' the lines up. The sex scenes (to be honest, is the only reason why this book has sold) are definitely fantasyland...I don't know any woman who has had an orgasm, let alone 2-3, the first time she loses her virginity.  Toward the end, I admit, I wanted to know more about the love story & I'm ashamed to say, I bought the second book too. This book is nothing more than a daytime soap show with s&m
B003XYERRM|5.0|Fantastic! I read all of Penman's books out of order, so this was the last in the glorious line of historical novels for me. She is such an amazing writer and I feel as though I know these characters who were flat characterizations or names on a page before.<br /><br />I can see why she felt compelled to write about Richard. Much maligned by Shakespeare, he is known to most as the embodiment of pure evil. After reading this I can feel his tragic pain. So much like people of today wrongfully accused of a crime of which they are innocent, the mere accusation of such a heinous act is enough to bring censure and condemnation. I am glad to be corrected in my opinion of him.<br /><br />Excellent novel and very well researched. A must-read!
0385344333|1.0|I have read and re-read Jack Reacher books until they were worn out. This will not be one of them. The story was so slow I thought the dang car they were riding in was going in reverse. Boring Boring Boring. When the acion finally did happen it was even worse. Just a totally unbelievable story.<br /><br />As other commenters have said it doesnt even seem like the book was written by Lee Child. If he did write it, he certainly didnt pay much attention to doing it. Mr Child stated the upcoming movie was not for his book fans, well it seems his books are not for his book fans either. Get the Hollywood stars out of your eyes Mr Child and see what you are doing to your legacy. We dont care about the movie, the short unintersting stories or what Reacher's Rules are. We care about Jack Reacher: all 6'5\\", 250lbs, heavily muscled, blue eyed, light haired, street smart, dinner plate handed, action packed Jack Reacher. (and yes that is all a dig for Tom Cruise playing Reacher, makes me want to puke it does)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoy reading about the Special Forces, although not every book about the Special Forces is an enjoyable read.  No Easy Day is a vivid account of what it was like to work on the mission that killed OBL, and it crackles with wit even as Mark Owen takes us along on this dangerous--and incredibly important--operation.<br /><br />Owen successfully hides his own identity and the identities of those he worked with in the teams, but he also allows us to glimpse the world of the DEVGRU SEALs.  We don't really know what they looked like or where they were from, but we get to know Charlie and the rest of the guys nonetheless, and it gives this book a flavor that many of the other \\"anonymous\\" Special Forces book sometimes lack.  Mark Owen doesn't merely rehash his BUDs training or give us an account of the OBL mission that we've read a thousand times in a thousand different places.  Rather, he provides us with an opportunity to hear the sounds and smell the smells and feel the feeling of riding in an out-of-control helicopter.  He takes us into the compound and up the stairs, and he lets us run along with them as they invade OBL's bedroom.  And he gives us the chance to celebrate with Jen and Ali and the rest of the gang when the mission is all over.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that it was too short.  But then again, anything longer would have probably required too many details, and too many details would have probably compromised too many identities.  Either way, this book is a keeper, and I'm impressed since I didn't expect it to be so riveting.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|A classic Stephen King novel shown with a great deal of style and substance.  Tim Robbins along with Hank William Seniors great musical style.  He soars when Hank is played!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|I have not read the book that inspired the movie. Even still the movie was extremely good! You do cry in this movie! I cannot express how good of a movie it it...It's definitely inspired me to read the book =D
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is the best game on earth it is so creative and is cool. coin sizer rocks busts saying
B008IEFJAQ|5.0|Some artists have a good run, maybe have one album with good songs, and are never heard from again. Not the case with Maroon 5. Each album has a unique sound, fresh and new. My whole family loves this group. Even my kids know all the words...the youngest is six. His favorite song is \\"Moves like Jagger\\".
B000W93CHC|4.0|I liked so much but the firs book was better, if you like medieval times you are going to enjoy it.
B007NG93CK|4.0|As in many long running series, the novelty wears off and it becomes extremely difficult to develop new plots and characters. Therefore, I agree with the nay sayers on this one to some extent. It is more of the same. Ryan is there with his moody presence. An old flame introduced to generate a bit of tension. The case is a series of infanticides and the search for the mother. The action takes place in the North of Canada mainly, a place I know nothing about and therefore interesting. I enjoyed this book- it pretty much delivers as expected. I buy thrillers from series I enjoy as it is good to revisit old friends. Sometimes though- such visits are spoilt by ever more ridiculous plots abd characters that are stuck in a repeat sequence. For example Kellerman and Cornwell. Cornwell's later books were so bad I now will avoid her work completely. This has not happened here. It was a good read, an interesting without being too far fetched plot and a good background. Why not 5? There is no development of characters, Tempe and Ryan seemed like strangers and her ex was  prat. Other characters are mentioned in the sense of an update but with no real onvolvement. The plot got a bit messy in that there were some side bars which we are not lead through. I was ok with that mostly unlike other reviewers as Tempe is a pathologist not a cop so her being involved in interviewing perps is a bit of a stretch. I just felt that the two boys left her out of it a bit. Overall, if you want something to while away a few hours that is not too demanding but is interesting and in a familiar format then go for it.
0525953728|5.0|Very good book, normally a book takes me forever to read but this one keeps you wanting more. I would like to see more books like this in the future. Bravo!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|this app is lots of fun.kind of amazing! the genie is right on! very cool app. fun for all ages. 4 stars!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good destresser, I do think the coins are a little stingy. Maybe you could double the earned coins. The game does pass the time
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great perspective from inside Seal Team  6. Shows how much these guys sacrifice for the rest of us. More  factual and much less  political than the you think after the noise before the book release.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book kept me wanting to read more and when I had to put it down I was still thinking about what will happen next!  I feel that I have an even more appreciation for time and those I love around me! I am so glad I read this book! The author was very detailed and made it easy for me to visualize the story as if I were there! Loved it!!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie was not as good as the best animated \\"kids\\" films, but still very entertaining. It was just a little too long maybe?
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well. I enjoy the maps and videos, as well as the hourly forecasts. I just wish it showed the daily highs and lows on the main page. Access to historical weather data would be cool, too. But overall, this has lots of weather info and works fine on my Kindle Fire, even if it refuses to rotate and forces the user to keep the power button on the bottom where it's easy to bump.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book demonstrates the ups and downs w/ relationships and describes how being in love is not a easy road to take. There are some issues w/ the main guy being a bit too controling, sometimes borderline obsessive with his love Abby. I thought this book was an easy read, it flowed nicely and I can not wait to read Travis's version in \\"Walking Disaster\\".
B0088WFZQG|2.0|Moving story.  Great concept using actual nave seals. Utter failure in execution.  The acting was horrendous.  In hindsight use the real guys for the documentaries, lead the acting to the trained professionals.
B00932A2MC|4.0|At first I thought this was going to be a typical war movie.  It was a war movie, against the aliens & using old technology to win.  The 'younger' generation may not understand the intracacies.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is wonderful.  We love our pets and wonder what they are thinking - now we know!!  I definitely recommend this book.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Season 2 is every bit as good as season one and maybe better.Some new characters show up and some old ones turn walker and as usual there's always lots of drama.I can't wait for season 3.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is terrific. Joss Whedon did a great job of showing all the superheros and giving each one a decent amount of screen time. The final battle scene really shows what a great director he is when he does a slow and continuous 360 (not a spinning in one place Michael Bay-esque 360 shot)  showcasing each and every hero in his own fight. My only complaint is that the Black Widow should have had a Russian accent.
0307460444|5.0|Love this book!  Our favorite is the strawberry cupcakes.  I buy lots of cookbooks, and this one is worth every penny!
B008XG1X18|5.0|does freeze a time or two .... but I love me some Pinterest .... I almost like it better on my fire then on my laptop.... fun times
B007FG9LIE|4.0|First time reading this author and it definitely will not be the last!  It kept my interest.  I would recommend it if you like surprise answers to your guesses!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I never thought I would like this game but once I started playing it I couldn't put it down. it is so much fun
0061780308|1.0|I wish I was able to listen to the story.  The CD came with a blemish.  Couldn't get past the first 5 words.  Thought it was a new CD.  Why did it have a blemish?
B005K17RU0|4.0|I find the content of AccuWeather for Android to be specific to the area where I live and easy to read and understand.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|The Season one Suits was all and more than expected. I can watch it over and over again and never get tire of it.
B001R6AW18|5.0|The original King Kong is a black and white classic with all the horror, melodrama, pathos and (subtle) sexuality of an epic drama. Masterful animation at a time when the techniques used were simple, artful and honest. Includes slices of New York life, tramp steamers in the South Pacific and the entertainment world of depression America while making reference to Darwin, Freud, Margaret Meade and Kraft-Ebbing. Produced in the era when all these themes were as novel and exciting as the newly-built skyscrapers of New York. The naivete of the movie is more than made up for by the enthusiasm that went along with the novelty of these elements at that time.
B00275EHJG|5.0|We just ordered Toy Story 3 on DVD, and as promised, was in great condition! Cover was intact with no worn edges, DVD had no scratches on it. The extras are a little minimal, but the behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie was interesting, especially for art and graphic design lovers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book, easy read. katniss reels you right in<br /><br />d i would definitely recommend this book to any who is looking for adventure
0345803485|4.0|I haven't read a book since I had to for  school. I read the first book in a week and the second in a weekend. I loved.the second book. The third, to me, wasn't as great. It could've ended.for me two chapters before it actually did. But I absolutely loved the books.<br />I heard they were making this into a movie. I also hard they were thinking of Kristen Stewart for Ana. Please don't do that. She is a horrible actress.
0307592731|1.0|This book deserves less than one star. Written by a woman so self-indulgent, whiny, promiscuous, lacking a moral compass of any kind, impulsive, reckless, overly dramatic, and ill adjusted that you will be sick to your stomach. She lives in la-la land and blames anyone but herself for living based off her emotions.<br />This book is a \\"memoir\\" on events that happened in 1995, never once quoting her over-sized and heavy journal she took with her. The details she gives are simply unbelievable.<br />Her mom dies and she plunges herself in her own little grief world and makes that her excuse to commit depraved things:<br />Lets her beloved horse starve and go uncared for and instead of humanely putting it down by a veterinarian, has a botched execution graphically portraying this horse's misery. She trys to paint this picture that she's showing sympathy for the horse by having it killed by people it knows....what she did was criminal.<br />Destroys her marriage by sleeping around with other men claiming she is \\"still in love with her husband.\\"<br />Delves in hardcore drugs (heroine).<br />She aborts her bastard child she has with a heroine addict and is unremorseful.<br />She eats her mom's ashes because \\"she wasn't ready to part with her.\\"<br /><br />On a whim, without any real preparation, decides she's going to hike the PCT. Ooh, she sees a bear and a few rattlesnakes. And because she didn't take her husband's advice and try out her boots before leaving, loses 6 toenails. The prologue that hooks you is she loses a boot off a cliff. When you come to that part in the book, it isn't dramatic at all, you learn she has other boots waiting for her at the next stop.<br /><br />There's no relating to this author, she cannot take her head out of her ass for ten seconds and she's 26 at the time. Grown woman blaming her marriage's destruction on being too young and naive. Nope, she just gave in, shut down and became even more self absorbed. Her mother and her husband catered tothis indulgence, one out of wanting to keep her around and the other out of naivety. He should have sent her to hell, IMHO. Not getting a tattoo celebrating their divorce.<br /><br />This book is a complete waste of time, I was hoping for a Pacific Crest Trail story, what I got was a stupid girl with stupid thoughts pity partying the entire time, she didn't even hike the whole thing! She hitchhiked more often than not.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|not well written but was informative on the actual preparations for the raid, the actual insertion and post extraction actions.<br /><br />I believe that anyone who has read about the Navy Seals (and the other US military spec-op units) realizes, by now, that these individuals are exceptional warriors and that our country is well-served by them. Too much was written about his pre-Seal life and the Seal training.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I just read all three Flynn novels over the past few weeks in order.  I enjoyed them all, especially Gone Girl.  The ending by some may be disappointing, but I feel it blended perfectly with the book.  Whenever I read a novel, I imagine how it would/could be done as a movie.  Her first two novels; a piece of cake.  I do not see how Gone Girl could ever be done as a movie without destroying it. Ms. Flynn, I hope you have not sold away all creative control, and please keep them coming! They get better and better!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is addicting and fun. highly reccomend to anyone. great free game. plays for a long time. good for all ages
B0046H95RM|5.0|Ten people mostly unknown to each other are invited to a barren island cut of from the mainland by heavy seas. There is a modern house for accommodation but at the end of the story there are ten people dead, murdered. But who is the killer. So well written that I doubt that anyone could pick the person. There 3 clues. A real page turner as they say.  Can you pick the murderer?
B008EEB4TA|5.0|So this is one of those times when I wish I could grant four and a half stars. On the one hand, there's just no way that this sophomore album is as good as the first. On the other hand, \\"The Family Jewels\\" towers majestically above every other pop album of 2010 as far as I'm concerned, so docking \\"Electra Heart\\" a full star on that basis alone really wouldn't be fair.<br /><br />In the end, I had to go with the five stars, because even a Marina who's toned down the quirkiness in pursuit of mass dance-pop appeal makes me extremely happy. Fellow Diamonds will argue that she's being *ironic*, and while I might respond pedantically that she's also trying to have her cake and eat it too on that front: the fact remains that cake is good, and if any pop singer can get away with not having to choose one or the other, that pop singer might just have to be Marina Diamandis.<br /><br />Potential buyers should note that there are a few different physical and digital releases of \\"Electra Heart.\\" For the most part, you'll be good to go with the U.S. standard edition, which removes one track (\\"Living Dead\\") from the U.K. standard edition but adds three others: \\"Radioactive\\" (a promo single which I find extremely disposable, but YMMV), \\"How to Be a Heartbreaker\\" (a much stronger single which wasn't ready in time for the U.K. editions), and \\"Sex Yeah\\" (the best of three B-sides from the U.K. deluxe edition, with its feminist musings and a playful pinch of Marina's trademark self-deprecation: \\"Question what the TV tells you / Question what a pop star sells you / Question Mom and question Dad / Question good and question bad\\"). If you like what you hear, though, I recommend tracking down \\"Living Dead\\" on one of those Other Music Services, along with \\"Lonely Hearts Club\\" and \\"Buy the Stars\\" from the U.K. deluxe edition, because they're all solid songs.<br /><br />I decided to name this review after a song that Peter Gabriel wrote a while back, because Marina has joined Gabriel himself in a fairly small circle of artists whose head (and heart) sounds enough like mine for the effect to be joyous bordering on a little bit creepy. She's smart, she's funny, she writes lethal hooks...game, set, match.in a fairly small circle of artists whose head (and heart) sounds enough like mine for the effect to be joyous bordering on a little bit creepy.

1401223176|5.0|From the criticism that I've heard about Jeph Loeb I was afraid that his writing would be cheap and cheesy, but it's actually very complex, thrilling, and challenging to understand sometimes (not in a bad way, but the way you might feel when you read a chapter book). I've only seen one other comic book writer who writes with much complexity: Brian Michael Bendis (ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN). His work on BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN was so thrilling that I decided to buy BATMAN: HUSH, which also sounded like a really good story to me. Even though it wasn't as widely praised as THE LONG HALLOWEEN, the clerk at my comic book store highly recommended it. I was right to buy this because it was an incredibly sensational story arc that had many memorable moments, and ultimate artwork!!!<br /><br />Many scenes in the book were extremely powerful and drove deep into the heart and soul of Batman:<br /><br />1: Batman forms a romance with Catwoman because they have a lot in common as vigilantes and it helps Batman feel less lonely. The price of being a crime fighter is having no one to love or care for him as he shields himself from the rest of the world to carry out his mission to destroy crime in Gotham City.<br />2: Batman nearly breaks his one rule as he tries to kill the Joker! The Joker has been responsible for many tragedies in the dark knight's life (shooting Barbra Gordon in the spine, paralyzing her, the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin, and murdering Sara Essen in the No Man's Land crisis) and has now killed another person close to Batman, bringing the dark knight closer to crossing the line between being a vigilante and a criminal!<br />3: We discover that Batman had a long lost childhood friend, Dr. Thomas Elliot, who know reenters Bruce Wayne's life, and gives us memories of Bruce's childhood before the night his parents were murdered.<br />4: A person, who was long thought to be dead, remerges into the life of the Dark Knight.<br />5: Batman's final encounter with the mysterious adversary Hush, a man whose face is wrapped in bandages, and has orchestrated a master plan involving a countless number of Batman's rogues. His sole purpose: TO KILL THE DARK KNIGHT!!!<br /><br />The artwork by Jim Lee is the best I have seen in any comic book! The characters are defined very well to their personalities, and look extremely realistic! Batman is extremely muscular and heroic, Killer Croc is more reptilian than human, Joker has the appearance a homicidal maniac, both Catwoman and Poison Ivy are sexy and seductive, Oracle looks very intelligent, and Ra's Al Gul truly looks like an immortal. The realistic, gritty, and astonishing artwork presented in this book has transformed me into a fanatic of Jim Lee's art, and I'm know on the hunt for more of his works! I used to think that David Finch's artwork was the greatest, but Jim Lee's might have surpassed David Finch completely!<br /><br />At first the mystery and the plot may seem hard to follow or understand, but that's one of the strengths of Loeb's writing. Jeph Loeb writes creates complicated plots that are hard to understand at first, but they are easier to grasp once you look back at the story a couple of times. Reading Jeph Loeb's works can sometimes almost feel like reading literary novel, since it's that complicated. The main villain Hush has become one of my personal favorites in Batman's rouges gallery, and while he lacks an ulterior motive for his vendetta in this book, it's later expanded on in Paul Dini's HEART OF HUSH storyline. So while Hush lacked a plausible motive in his first story, I felt that every other component of the character Loeb established made him astonishing! BATMAN: HUSH is not the kind of story that you can read in one sitting, but it is an extremely powerful Batman tale that gives us new insight on the dark knight's life. Jeph, along with Frank Miller is one of the few writers to truly dive deep into the psyche of the dark knight!<br /><br />&#34;The aim ofart is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.&#34;<br />-Aristotlenward significance.&#34; -Aristotle

B007ELN8Y8|4.0|After all the hype, the Academy Awards & trailers, I found this movie fascinating.  There were so many times in the \\"Artist\\" when one openly laughed, but others that required some small amount of thought.  It was genius to see all the things we have seen in other silent movies done so cute, funny & thought provoking.  The use of body language is lost because of \\"multi-plex\\" theaters.  Many of today's actors haven't a clue as to how to use facial expression, and hand and body movement as a way to communicate effectively.  The \\"Artist\\" is a movie we can all learn from.  As we work & interact with others we don't use our hands, posture or facial expressions to empathize what we want to do and say more clearly.  If you haven't viewed this movie, you should.  Great price, all the sizzle promised is delivered and more.  A movie such as the \\"Artist\\" should be in the mix of romance, thrillers, & comedies made available each year.  I'd watch this again, just to see \\"Gee, how did they do that?\\"  At work, if you get in a battle with your boss, try some of these clever, but almost lost techniques to see the effect.

B008VVT51U|5.0|The \\"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" BEMH, is a film for all generations.  Please set aside any & all prejudices.  I did not rent this movie for myself.  My wife is a Judi Dench fan, as well as many of the dramas/comedies one watches on PBS.  I decided to watch a few moments of this 2 hour movie & found - a bit of me, and a bit of friends, family, co-workers and life.  Face it, you have to retire.  Will your retirement income leave you broke, or living a life-style of pinching pennies.  Each actor was super.  I'm good at predicting movies, but I was surprised & pleased.  I will purchase this for my personal collection, as well as buy the book the movie is based upon. I found myself writing bits of the \\"nuggets\\" of wisdom this movie shares.  BEMH allows you to lose yourself in the movie, but it also awakens feelings we will all eventually face.  If you are married, have a GF/BF, partner or lover, you need to share this experience.  Again, set all prejudices aside.  Have no expectations.  Don't try to anticipate anything.  In our current dismal economy & world that feels like it is sinking, BEMH shows you that life doesn't have to be a futuristic, dismal drama.  People, can come together in unlikely places & life becomes more than 9-5, a gold watch, and sitting around waiting for life to happen.  This is A TRUE 5 STAR film.
B00004XQ8E|5.0|This heartfelt, magesterial work Das Lied von der erde as sung by Kathleen Ferrier is heartbreaking in the poignant understanding Ferrier has of Mahlers intentions to convey the many emotions, particularly of anguish and resolution and acceptance of the human condition.

0439023521|5.0|I began this book reluctantly at first; although I had heard some great praise for the Hunger Games.  Are the critics right?<br /><br />The Hunger GamesSynopsis:<br /><br />Katniss has lived all of her life in District 12 and every year they attend the Reaping where a male and female tribute is chosen.  She has grown up with her friend Gale hunting and providing for their families.  This year's reaping is special because Katniss's sister Prim is attending for the first time.  Both girls go to the reaping but when Prim's name is drawn what will Katniss do?  The Hunger Games are a fight to the death.  There are always two tributes from each district, and who will the other be?<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I am really glad I read this book and the critics were right on!  I thought the story was great!  I felt it was well written.  The protagonist is not superficial and shallow like many in young adult books.  The character of Katniss is realistic and knows the hardships in her world.  The conflict between Katniss and Peeta really helped push the story.  Suzanne Collins leaves you wanting more!<br /><br />I spent most of yesterday finishing this book.  I don't usually spend most of the day reading unless it is a Readathon.  What makes a great book for you?  For me it is a well told story, great characters, and great action.  I am ready for Catching Fire! Are you?<br /><br />Please let Suzanne know your thoughts on her books on  her website.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes, there are ads, but what do you expect on a free app?  You can use your back button to get away from an ad.  I love the multiplayer aspect to this game. You get to play great players all over the world.  The game is very fast paced, and addictive.  Get ready to kill a lot of time when you download it.
B00112GVFO|2.0|Myth Busters could do at least an entire episode on this movie.  In fact, they have busted many of the things shown in this movie.  None of the stunt scenes make any sense at all. Let me pick three examples, but there are dozens.<br /><br />Vehicles have bullet holes in them but when the heroes are riding in them and bullets hit, they spark but don't leave holes.<br /><br />A fiberglass boat repels bullets on some parts but not on on other parts, it even repels bullets from a Jeep mounted 50 cal.<br /><br />They \\"pull a Panama\\" and the boat blows up, which it would not have blown up especially that fast, and it blows up one of the bad guy's boats.  The other bad guy boat is clearly visible and untouched but they swim to shore with no pursuit.  They also look like they are standing on something in the water and they are all together even though one of them bailed out about 200 yards before the others.<br /><br />But that's the problem, I could fill five pages with the goofs or careless science.  I can do this with almost any Hollywood movie, but this one is completely over the top.<br /><br />I could ignore this but the plot was stupid and not interesting.  So it's just a series of impossible stunts.

B0016OLC5Q|4.0|On the surface, it's a little like Grizzly man, unprepared person goes into the wild and perishes.  But it's a great coming of age film and more importantly how Chris finds out who he is based on his interactions with others.  And he finds that many people are not like his parents and also that he needs other people.  He started out trying to get away from people and ends up finding the good in people.  Which is just great but sadly he wasn't a Boy Scout or something when he was younger or he could have returned and enjoyed his new insight.

B008P9M614|1.0|I know Fox isn't known for their amazing box sets, but this is disgraceful. House was one of the most popular television shows on air, and their effort to do it justice is to literally box all of the season sets together in the laziest, half-assed way? Its an insult to the show and to the fans who were looking forward to a big box set release with more features; something more then a new box and an episode booklet. I really hope this is not the only attempt at a box set release. Its too basic, stripped down and rushed to be its only attempt.

You'll get the insight of Katniss in the first-person and all the thoughts that she is thinking about! She is quite a complex person but I grew to love her. Can someone find me a girlfriend like this gal!?<br /><br />Don't forget to read the other books of the series also!:) The last one may be violent and perhaps frustrating to read but when you look over the whole series, you'll see so much similarity to today's world events! And perhaps these books will inspire you to make a difference in your own small way. You never know the impact it may have!
B008AWBQGW|5.0|ok, here is the deal..I don't write reviews unless it is necessary...this is one of those times.  The album is fabulous.  I did not think they could top \\"God n Guns\\", and I am not saying this does, but it comes dam* close..There are only few classic rock bands that have the talent and ability to put out QUALITY new material, and even though we all know this is nothing close to the original lineup, somehow these guys continue to put out INCEDIBLE new material.  Here is a little breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Homegrown\\" - As* kicking in your face southern rocker that should be played on every real R&R station in the country.<br />\\"Ready to Fly\\" - reminds me of \\"gifted hands\\" from God n Guns (which is a good thing)...Unbelievable vocals, piano, etc.<br />\\"Honey Hole\\" - nice little melodic start that turns into a gem of a tune.<br />\\"One day at a time\\"  - should be played everywhere period.<br /><br />Other solid tunes are \\"Good Teacher\\", \\"Life's Twisted\\", and the title track.<br /><br />Buy the album, you will be happy you did.

But I really got a feeling of fulfillment by reading to the end. It really is valuable to be able to look over the whole series and see what transpired and to see what it means to you! It did lead me to check out some books about the names of the characters and the places in the series. Suzanne Collins is very creative and has a great heart for history and I think did a neat job of incorporating her Catholic faith and her love for Greek mythology very subtlety. (even though it is staring you right in the face!) I loved the movie and the series!

It sure presented the problems our operational forces have in dealing with the<br />chain of command. No different from what I experienced in Viet Nam.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Season 3 was yet another great season for \\"The Good Wife.\\" It was a transition season for the main character. The writing is solid, the cast is solid, and the series is only going to get better in season 4.<br /><br />Now if CBS would only wake up and get behind this show again. Putting this show in Sunday night was a huge mistake. Having the show delayed every weekend during the NFL season  has hurt the shows ratings. PUT IT BACK ON TUESDAY NIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS!
B0046A9MRW|5.0|This is probably the best I've read by A.C. and I think the reason is that the story is told in the first person by what I guess is an unreliable narrator. The Doctor's voice and his sister's character are brilliant,shades of Arsenic and Old Lace.<br /><br />Poirot plays a secondary role but this doesn't detract from the story.<br /><br />I guessed at the ending about 3/4 through as the red herrings weren't really serious but was still intrigued to see the final denouement.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|just a few words, as I agree to the hundreds of similar reviews. Poorly written book, you would think this is written by a teenager. The characters are not well thought through: Ana is only 21 but soo  very mature in handling a seriously disturbed man, she is a virgin but then again so \\"adaptable\\" to her unconventional boyfriend. On the other hand, Christian Grey is only 27 but a business tycoon, great piano player, looking great and so knowledgeable etc etc... I could go on and on. Somehow this book got famous, just by describing some kinky s*x and through word of mouth everybody believes it must be good enough to be read. t would be just a story invented by teenage girls day dreaming...  if you are interested in reading some kinky books this is one you can find easily.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is one of the most disturbing books I have read in a long time. Told from the perspective of Jacob Barber's father, a successful attorney, it shifts back and forth in time between an inquest in which Andy, the father, is being questioned and the book's main narrative. The writing is good and, though it did seem a bit over-wrought in places, I never lost interest.<br /><br />When a fourteen year old boy is found knifed to death in a nearby park suspicion falls on Andy Barber's 14 year old son, Jacob, a classmate of the dead boy. The narrative is mostly about the trial and the revelations that begin to unfold about the problems within this family and the secrets Andy has kept all his life about his family history, including his father who is serving a life-sentence for murder.<br /><br />Slowly we begin to realize this family has a LOT of secrets. Jacob was bullied in school by the dead boy. Jacob has some very disturbing behaviors of his own. Laurie, Jacob's mother, is shocked when she finds out about her husband's secrets and is unable to reconcile these revelations and their implications for her own son. When a psychiatrist adds some frightening (and I thought specious) opinions about Jacob's behavior, Andy overlooks them but Laurie becomes obsessed with them.<br /><br />This is an extremely complex story and the ending is quite disturbing. I'm not really sure how I felt about it. I admired Andy's ability to trust in his son and I found Laurie's inability to do that quite upsetting. This is not a book one soon forgets -- and that makes it a better than average read.

B006BOT28U|5.0|Goldratt write in a thoroughly well-planned and concise style that is highly readable, yet the major characters do have dimensions that add to the plot and the learning he wishes to deliver.<br /><br />I work as a teacher in a public school and know very little about business management. Yet as the story developed I could draw many direct connections between the story and working with students parents, and faculty. The theory of constraints, the underlying theme of the books, has many levels of use: personal, social and professional.<br /><br />The book is brief. The thinking it inspires can last and last, and that is my favorite kind of book.
B00932AA5G|5.0|You quickly forget the subtitles. Excellent European ( they do stuff so much better than us) movie with good acting, characters and plot development that keeps you guessing The main character is an unlikely hero that you initially don't like much but becomes someone you root for when he is put under pressure and is out of his element. He is a smart guy caught in the wrong place and u cannot imagine he will make it through.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Before purchasing, I read the reviews and thought to pass, but, kept seeing the trailer and thought to view for myself.  So glad I did..  I don't know if ALL of Kirsten Stewarts detractors decided to write a review, but, I can't see how they could be soo down on the film.  Granted, her performance wasn't nearly as good as The Evil Queen, but it wasn't so bad to keep me from watching again.  It isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but defn isn't the worst (the Immortals would be).<br /><br />I liked the story, it was kinda dark. but, i loved how much time the film devoted to the queen, IMO she made the movie, talk about a bad mamagama... It is a little long and some of the Snow Whites scenes didn't make sense (like what was up with that moose and some of the forest shots) and it didn't stay true to original story (at least what I remember of the original story line) but, it didn't completely botch it either.....<br /><br />I would defn recommend viewing however, it isn't for the kids.... A little too much fighting and it may seem a little creepy with the black magic and the queen showing just how evil she is...

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Absolutely great thriller/mystery/scifi/whatever hybrid that will keep you reading from page one to the end, and wanting more.  I admit, I picked this up because I was a huge Twin Peaks fan back in the day, and it was on sale, so I had low expectations, but this book shattered them and vaulted its way to near the top of my favorite mystery novels.  I love mystery and scifi, but if you are turned off by either of those genres, then you may not like this book, because it has plenty of both.  In truth, the novel is in no way anything similar to Twin Peaks (which the author admits), other than it involves a federal agent in a small mysterious town somewhere in the pacific northwest.  The first half of the book seems like it might be heading in a Twin Peaks direction, but then the second half plows right through that into a very strange scifi plot, that is very similar to many of the Phillip K. Dick novels (Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said came to mind).  Bottom line, if you like thriller/mystery novels AND/OR you like scifi novels, then chances are you will find something in this novel you like.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great love story, yes love story. Of course there are extremely details, but it was not what I expected. It's not all anal, this and that. It's two people who are madly, deeply in love. A love everyone deserves. Great series! Would recommend to most adults.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I was excited  to find this app, but rather disappointed  that I can only repin - there is no ability to pin new items. Nonetheless,  a fun waste  of time as always.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game is challenging and is fun for hours!!!!<br />Challenges you to use your brain and look for alternate options for a solution. Thecreview is just as challenging to submit.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|First of all, this book is briliant.  I grew to admire and respect and be engaged by Hitchens through the too few chapters of this book.  How to convey the depth and wisdom and breathtaking candor of Hitchens' account of his ebbing life: \\"living dyingly\\", it makes me cry to think he is not in this world to write for us any more.
B004UID2LC|2.0|its an awesome app.. but lately i cnt download any songs anymore.. all it says is searching and thats it... somebody pls fix this!! :((
B004BDOJJU|4.0|this is one of Neil Gaiman's lighter works - there's a boy in love, and a beautiful fallen star, and some inventive bad guys.  It's a lovely read - draws you in and keeps you interested.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this app ever.I hope you like this app because I loved it is fun.Love This App............................................hope you do to.I did I rate this app 5 stars.
1416550550|4.0|This was a great story, well written.  The story covered 100 years in time, weaving together the stories of 3 women:  Eliza, Nell and Cassandra.  I liked the way the characters were developed, and the various twists which revealed the story of each character without a strictly chronological storytelling.<br /><br />Sometimes in this type of story (rotating between the three women and time periods), the reader can get confused; I thought the author did a good job of making it complicated enough to command the reader's attention, but clear enough to avoid real confusion.<br /><br />I thought the three main characters were fairly well developed, as were some of the secondary characters.  I was left at the end kind of wondering what the deal was with Uncle Linus; when the early part of the book referred to the terrible things done at Cliff Cottage, I found myself on the edge of my chair waiting for the terrible revelations.  While the story was quite dramatic, the \\"terrible things\\" seemed predictable given the character's various decisions along the way.  I guess I felt the foreshadowing here could have been a little more understated.<br /><br />I also found a couple of plot twists towards the end to be a little harder to believe....But Ms. Morton had me for most of the book.  Unlikely turns of events, but not quite unbelievable--marks of a good plot!<br /><br />I thought the end went on a little too long.  I was listening to the unabridged recording--kept thinking it was over, but it went on a bit longer.  I appreciated her desire to tie up the loose ends; when an author does not, I find that frustrating--but when they do, sometimes a little too neat.<br /><br />All in all, it was a very good book.  Well written, and suspenseful and interesting enough that I didn't want to put it down.  I'd give it 4.5 * if I could.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app.It is really great.No problems at all.It is changeling.See if you can complete all of it not to hard not to easy.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I would not even give them one star (the site made me give them something though it does not deserve the one star).  The game only lasted for a couple of times.  Now it opens then goes to an advertisement page I cannot get rid of.  Very frustrating as I never get to play the game any more.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is full of fast-paced fun. I like all the little extras you can buy. I also like the achievements. It's an addictive game.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|John Carter was a blast from beginning to end.  It may have tanked at the box office and may have gotten panned by the critics, but neither of those things should dissuade you from giving John Carter a chance.  This movie has heart, action, fun and a well crafted story line.  The acting is top notch and the special effects are brilliant.  I liked John Carter a lot and I think you will to.
B008Y6WPXC|5.0|gotta love it.  if you are over 55 years old and sane, have some fun and watch this movie.  if not, it might add to your journey in life as a mass murderer.  seriously, this is what gets these kids going.  and nobody can stop it.  if it's not guns, they'll (the killer kids) use bombs, or anything else they can get their hands on.  nobody under 55 should see this.  if you are, (over 55 and male) watch it and just go for a ride of mucho machissimo violencia and nonstop killing of bad guys on a level that i was not familiar with till seeing this.  but then, i don't get out much.  i don't think as many women as men will enjoy this.  like a mucho macho ride into the fantasy dreamland of being the 'the toughest, baddest, meanest, but down deep, goodhearted guy in the world'!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This Movie was fun from beginning to end.  The action was intense and fun, the story was well written and clever and exciting to watch.  Joss Whedon nailed writing the hulk and Mark Ruffalo brought him to life with great enthusiasm and skill.  This movie is one you can watch over and over again without it ever getting old.  Watching The Avengers is an Epic Good Time.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Received this DVD within the time period during which I was informed it would arrive. The movie followed the book fairly closely although obviously it omitted some details from the book. I have read all three books in this series and look forward to the coming of the movies based at the two remaining books of the series:Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its easy to play and creative. a nice. way to pass some time . I love this app. and the fact that its free is even better :)
1401232590|5.0|This is one of the best batman magazines I have ever read.  Very intense and suspensful all the way through.  great story and plenty of twists

B001HM1PFO|5.0|Jist love this DVD.  I have seen it so many times in movie houses in Pa.  I'm so glad to have a copy of my own.
B007PVHANM|3.0|As a huge fan of reggae music and Bob Marley i was really looking forward to this movie. I have to be honest i was a lil disappointed. I gave it 3 stars, but its a weak 3 stars<br /><br />1.Failing to deal with Marley's other children is now a problem when documenting bob's life. it would have been great to hear from julian,kymani, robbie etc.<br /><br />2.Way too much time on cindy breakspeare and bob. We have heard this story in every documentary made.<br /><br />3. the subtitles were too small (ok i am being picky)<br /><br />this is a good movie. marley/reggae fans need to get it. but this is not a definitive movie<br />1Love
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is awesome.  I played all the levels more than once it never got old. I LOVE THIS GAME!!
B0090P98Z4|1.0|i try to upgrade my weapon at 70% success rate and fail 5 times in a row!!!! really glu?  this game is fixed so that u end up buying gold coins don't do it ppl don't let these developers rip u off its suppose to be Free!!!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Christopher Hitchens writes of his last days with his usual no-nonsense, get to the heart of things. No one wrote like Hitch with his combination of extreme erudition and ability to make you think, no matter the subject. Always challenging the reader, never talking down- he expects you to keep up with him. Not always easy.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I thought this was a lot of fun and it provided me with hours of enjoyment. I hope they continue to develop it
B0050KEVO6|5.0|educationally fulfilling. you should get it. I have it on every device I have and then some. it blew my mind for example, (spoiler alert!)  if you add a green mushroom to a Mario it makes another Mario. very entertaining and addicting.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It's okay. But I wish there were more free puzzles. I get so frustrated with apps that require you to continually spend money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is tons of fun and has lots of different levels for a variety of players and challenges. Really makes you think!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I agree with others this game lags and Also the pop up scores which I don't really need to see prevent me from seeing available moves which frustrates me. I thought this was to relax.  Alawar please fix this and make your ad screen go quicker we know who you are.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I am in LOVE with this app! This game is like no other one because you actually get to move around! Glu, you have never disappointed me! Thanks!
1933633867|4.0|This book is really a mixture of:<br /><br />- 1/3 valuable, fascinating, groundbreaking research into the origins of money and credit<br />- 1/3 tangential stories that, while interesting, seem to have nothing to do with anything<br />- 1/3 the author's completely unsupported political opinions<br /><br />All of this is mixed together throughout the chapters. The book is worth buying simply because of the first 1/3 -- that's what it's getting well-deserved acclaim for. The relationships between taxes, markets, credit and war is absolutely eye-opening, as well as the notion that credit came *before* money.<br /><br />The second 1/3 is simply entertaining. I'm going to assume it's basically a bunch of historical knowledge Graeber has accumulated throughout his career, and wants to write down here since he doesn't know what else to do with it. The worst that can be said is that it gives a rambling character to the book, but hey, it's interesting to know that Cortés played a game with Moctezuma to pass the time, and was a notorius cheater, or that if a team in an Aztec ball game managed to send the ball through a tiny hoop (incredible difficult), the spectators would lose their cloaks. None of this has even the slightest thing to do with any arguments Graeber is making, but whatever.<br /><br />But the last 1/3 of the content really detracts from the first third. Throughout, there are blithe assertions like:<br /><br />  \\"We could no more have a universal world market than we could have a system in which everyone who wasn't a capitalist was somehow able to become a respectable, regularly paid wage laborer with access do adequate dental care. A world like that has never existed and never could exist. What's more, the moment that even the prospect that this might happen begins to materialize, the whole system starts to come apart.\\" (p355)<br /><br />Frankly, this is just bizarre. I mean, a conclusion like this could be the thesis for an entire book -- which would be needed to marshall convincing evidence, because this is a shockingly audacious and controversial claim to make. But Graeber just *says* things like this, without any evidence whatsoever, and moves on as if no further explanation is needed. Particularly the last chapter of the book seems to be a kind of stream-of-consciousness of the author's political opinions about economics and recent history, without seeming to demonstrate any actual understanding of how economics actually works.<br /><br />In summary: the book is worth reading for the anthropological research into money/credit. But anytime you see Graeber asserting anything philosophical or on economics, just skip over it. The book would have been far stronger if he wasn't constantly mixing in his private political opinions at every opportunity -- it just gets really tiring after a while.
B004W1GD4A|4.0|This is a great series, although very short indeed! However there are at least 7 episodes, i believe, slated for 2012! If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, you will hopefully find this entertaining. Downton is unmatched, but this fills a loss when Downton is on hiatus! The casting is quite stellar, especially Eileen Atkins and Anne Reid, two of my favorites. The series harbors on the political aspects of England in the 1930's, a few bits on the fascist movement, however there was enough drama that did NOT include politics to make it worth while. It's a young husband and wife starting their life anew and adapting to society around them. The house is absolutely beautiful too! I thought the casting was great and there was no one character that you \\"love to hate\\", which i thought was kind of nice for a change. Although flawed both great and small, everyone had some sort of redeeming quality! I'm looking forward to the 2012 season!
B0035G0U2O|3.0|this was one of those movies that I thought about watching on many occasions, just never got around to it. I finally watched it and found that it was really good. No, the science was not 100%, and a lot of the scenarios the characters found them selves in were not realistic. However, I was not looking for real. I was looking to see some adventure and danger, I found it. There were some great laughs and me and my family were even routing for certain things to happen. If you are looking for a fun, end of the world type movie, I think that \\"2012\\" is a great choice.
B000003CMD|5.0|Had the album.  this is about the 2nd cd.  someone made off with the last one.  Classic Allman bros.  Just had to have another copy.  Great songs, all of them.
B00846REIS|4.0|I'm not sure why this book isn't getting as much talk as 50 shades. This book is just as good with more of a story line. Good read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am completely addicted to this app! can not wait to try some of the things i have found so far.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great read, reads like one of the Bourne Identity books, can't wait for the movie to be made. If anything it was a typical spy novel with a mission impossible theme.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|In this novel, Mitch Albom combines a multi-generational yet cohesive story about what \\"time\\" is really all about. He is diligent in his application of the concept of \\"time\\" as it is held by each of us and how it effects our relationship with the others in our lives. It is a masterfully written novel that I would recommend reading by any age group as it is so inspirational and provocative to our own thinking of time and the role that it plays in our individual lives. SMS
B008IYOEZM|1.0|Where did our favorite show go?  It's gone....we stopped watching Season 6 after just 3 episodes, hoping beyond hope that it would improve.<br />Sorry to say, we're no longer fans.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Whenever a book is made into a movie, there's always a little concern that the result won't live up to all your hopes, especially when you love the book. I was initially concerned by the casting -- I just didn't understand the choices: everyone from District 12 looked a little too...healthy. Dirty, but healthy. (Please note that I'm NOT saying actors should crash diet to look like they're starving, it's just that I especially pictured them a little more wiry and roughened in physique.) I didn't see Jennifer Lawrence as our Katniss at all.<br /><br />I blocked all these preconceptions and looked at the movie on its own, and it IS a good movie -- I enjoyed it! The acting is great and all the major plot points are there. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta turned out an especially good performance. The movie has a more artistic edge than the book and draws you in quickly. While part of me is still looking for the movie I pictured, I can look at it and appreciate it for its own good qualities.
B00933ZG9A|5.0|Great cast, superb acting by all (who knew Claire Danes could pull-off bipolar?!) and a great storyline.  The kind of story that makes you want to watch episode-after-episode...each better than the last.  Well done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent plot and dialogue both internally & externally by the main characters. Wasn't just about sex. Really made you think.
B006H5120E|5.0|I saw Titanic in 3D when it was re-released in 2012 and then picked up the 3D blu ray.  I can honestly say this film looks better on your home tv then it did in the theater.  The image quality and 3D are top notch.  This is a disc to show your friends.  I wish there were more bonus features and perhaps some added scenes, but the movie looks so good on blu ray, it's hard to complain.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|for the last update I had to reinstall and I'm still trying to finish old levels! Not doing the update!
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I was disappointed in this cd. Only 2 descent songs, the rest seemed like they were very dated and maybe just added on in order to have enough music to make a cd. If I had it to do over I would only have purchased the hit song \\"somebody that I used to know\\" on Itunes and called it a day.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so much fun. It brings back memories from going to carnivals. I can't seem to put the game down. I just wish I wouldn't lose so many coins off the sides.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This movie really bombed a the theaters and really broken down by the critics but to me this movie was really good.  The story, special effects, the sound and the acting was all very good.  I really enjoyed this movie also because it has enough action to keep my attention.  If a movie is boring to me I will not pay attention to it.  This blu-ray has very good picture and sound I give this movie a B+
B0086700CM|5.0|Very nice game, lots of detail.<br />keeps you engaged , exciting.<br /><br />would like to see more levels please , a little more difficult
B007XF0X16|3.0|This movie has awsome special effects, good picture quality, crisp sound, and it is better than Clash of the Titans, but like Clash of the Titans the storyline could have been alot stronger.  To me this movie gets a passing grade is do to the special effects, which are really cool.  I wish that they went deeper into the actual story and plot.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves their special effects.  I give it a solid C.
B004P1JEXE|2.0|Compared to the first and second book in this series (A  Song of Ice and Fire) \\"A feast of Crows\\" (which is book 4) is boring.  It seemed to bog down in stratergy and personalities. I would not have kept reading but I really want to know what happens in the end.  I get confused with all the house alliances and the names of the knights and families.  Hoping that end of the series makes the read worthwhile.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|This movie is the icing on the cake for the American Pie movies.  If you have seen the rest of the movies this is a definite movie you will need to get to add to the collection.  It is very funny and raunchy from the begining until the end.  The picture quality is really good and the sound is really clear.  And lets say the stiffmeister gets his ultimate revenge on his nemesis.  I give this movie an A and highly recommend it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a neat game and gives you a feeling of accomplishment, as you do win enough times not to get frustrated, but at the same time, you do have to use your brain and logic!
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|I heard that this movie was good and I think Jonah Hill is funny so I ordered it, and I was not let down.  This movie is really good and funny and I laughed alot during the movie.  I did not think someone could make a cop movie to be funny and I feel that the movie is original because of it.  Cop movies get old after a while because it is the same thing one movie after another.  Now don't get me wrong, there are plenty of gun fighting in it but the comedy is more entertaining to me.  The quality of the movie is good, sound and video. A definite A.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|rips u off jus like a real carnival game..lol.  its a fun game ive always loved and its sweet that's it free too. only thing that sucks is you lose coins kinds fast and have to wait 30 sec for a free coin. so unless your really lucky at this plan to set it down n walk away for a while to wait for few coins
B008XG1X18|5.0|I actually enjoy using the app on my Kindle even more than the regular website on my laptop. It runs smoothly, allowing you to pin to the board you want. Going onto the website from the browser on the Kindle doesn't allow you to scroll through your boards when pinning and it's much harder to select things correctly. This app seems to fix  all of yjose compatibility bugs.  :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed this \\"book\\" so much and we use it almost every day!  We have started a Bible study in our home and this is ALWAYS on the center of the table!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I was very pleased with this album.  I loved every song. There is such variety in the different songs and I love it. I look forward to hearing other music from them in the future.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest + Kindle Fire = addiction. I can instantly 'Like' a pin with a quick tap on the screen, and can repin as easily to my specific boards. Because of this app/site, I've seen the most beautiful landscapes from around the world that I'll never see in my lifetime. Today I'm going to try a new dessert found on another person's board. I need to limit myself on this because accessing Pinterest on my Kindle while relaxing in bed each night has pushed my log off time to way after midnight.
B004IF8TLU|4.0|I watched this moving growing up and always enjoyed it. It is defiantly dated being from the late 80's but it is still a very enjoyable movie. The basic storyline is a girl (17 years old) gets called to baby-sit and has a friend who decided to runaway from home and now needs to be rescued. So she packs up the kids she is babysitting and off to the city they go. On the way they get a flat tire and it just goes on from there, from being in a car that is stolen, having to sing the blues as they run from the bad guys and so on until they have to race back home before the parents get there. Some of the content would not be suitable for young children (under 11 years old).
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of my all time favorite books the only bad thing about thus book is that it ends and there's not another one
B002NLU0AY|5.0|I guess I need to start by saying thank you to \\"Supernatural\\" for allowing the seasons to be published in Amazon...so Thank you again. I would offer to you my oppinion but rather I will be a little more optimistic about our status as a human race at the threshold of growth and the unknown and like all unknowns we will demonize it untill its blue in the face and call it good...ahahha nice job...keep the faith...I hope you all understand the value and power of \\"Faith\\"...:)
B007HGPBRC|4.0|I thought I was too old to cry.... but Christopher Hitchens' last book, 'MORTALITY'  had just that effect on me. I read Mortality in one day... I couldn't put it down. Christopher was an author who when he wrote, made it seem like he was talking directly to me, the reader. I'll always keep his last work on my tablet and at least one other mobile device.... Reading it is inspirational. Christopher was a light in the darkness...
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love season 5 of Dexter, as well as all the other seasons of Dexter.  Can't wait for the next one on Amazon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it<br />I play this at the fair all the time<br />it gives you free coins all the time!<br />one of my favorite apps
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am an avid reader of romance novels.  Book 1 was a challenging read, primarily because the world of BDSM has never appealed to me.  Initially, Christian's playroom and playroom behavior had a negative impact on my reading enjoyment.  However as the trilogy unfolds and the characters evolve, I accepted the rational provided on why Christian was enticed into the BDSM lifestyle and his aversion to closeness.  It was refreshing to see the affect that Anastasia's innocence had in modifying Christian's perception of life.  Overall, the trilogy is simplistic but entertaining and romantic.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|a typical reacher story. with lee child you always know what you are going to get. reacher does again what he does best and child always delivers a storyline to keep you thinking. couldn't put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book met all my expectations for this series. I would recommend this to everyone. The Hunger Games Trilogy was excellent .
