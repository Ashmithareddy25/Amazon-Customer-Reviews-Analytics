B007HACDLK|5.0|If you like the other books in the series, you will love this one.  It has the twists and turns that are expected of any Flynn book. My only problem with his books is that when I start reading, I can't stop and I end up finishing it in two or three days, then I have to wait a year for another.<br />Vince Flynn is by far my favorite author.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Initial trailers misled the public into thinking this would be Liam Neeson reenacting Taken with Wolves replacing the Albanians.  It's set up as if he gets put in a wolf-punching contest, and spends the next hour and a half making pelts with nothing more than his bare hands and a gravely voice.  Unfortunately for many (pleasant surprise for me), The Grey is a much more complex movie than initially believed.  The film is less about survival, and more about the psychological struggle man must ponder when confronted with inevitable death.<br /><br />What isn't really changed, however, is how awesome Neeson is.  He's every bit as tough as in Taken, but maybe a bit more morose.  Definitely more philosophical.  He proves once more that he is indeed a headliner capable of dominating the screen.  A few others round out the cast well as \\"Men, unfit for mankind;\\" although, it definitely doesn't fit the normal character for Dermot Mulroney.<br /><br />As for the plot holes, bizarre decisions made by plane crash survivors, and all the other nitpicking of this film, it's called suspension of disbelief.  Many movies require both an open mouth and an open mind, both for input, neither for output.  Sure, the remaining seven men could have stayed with the plane wreckage for a better chance at rescue, but they've likely seen the results of Alive, and those Uruguayan dudes didn't have to deal with a seemingly endless barrage of brilliant wolves with a taste for the other white meat.<br /><br />Ultimately, The Grey boils down to mortality.  How the environment, the animals, the general requirements for survival all plot against men at the end of their lives.  Wolves do not reflect; the wind does not cease; the cold does no change temperature.  None of that exists - it's just man's introspection and awareness of no control.  How we react in moments like this allow us to reach that primitive state of survival, and the lengths to which we will go in order to persevere.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I LOVE ALL VINCE'S BOOKS, I HAD READ ALL OF THEM AND THEY ALL GOOD.  I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN ONCE I STARTED READING, BUT THIS ONE IS A BREATH TAKING.  AMAZING.<br /><br />THANKS, VINCE AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.  I'M READY FOR THE NEXT ONE

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This was  my first Stephen King book.  I read it based on the mostly positive reviews.  I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Born in 1950, I loved the snippets of life; many I remember, many I do not, but I believe it to be a pretty good representation of life then.  The premis was interesting, and I often wondered as Jake traveled through the south, what I would do as a stranger in that strange land.  I loved the ending, but won't give it away.  My only wish was that Sadie didn't smoke so much!  I guess a minor point.  As long as it is i read it in record time, one night it kept me up until 4:00A.M.  Regarding the Kennedy Assassination, after all that is a main plot of the book, Ilearned a lot about the politics of Texas at the time and the Cuba connection with Lee Oswald.  I think that Mr. King's assessment is probably right, but no one will ever know for sure. I would highly recommend this book

1419705849|5.0|I am so grateful to have a format of reading that my son enjoys.  He reads the books in this series quickly and really looks forward to the next book.  I even use the book as an incentive to read other books.  I say - OK, read three chapters of the other book and then you can read the Wimpy Kid book.  It actually works!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Excellent, excellent DVD. I watched this movie in the theatres with my dad and i loved it so much that I had to purchase the DVD.<br />It's very inspirational...and a real tear-jerker!<br />It's the kind of movie that will really challenge all the men out there to step up to the plate and make a more conscious effort to be more present and involved in their child or children's lives.<br />I'd highly recommend anyone to watch this film, you won't be disappointed

B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I think that this movie is drastically underrated! The visuals alone are just so incredible. An instant favorite for me. This film is just so beautifully put together and great for ALL ages.
B0030A0ZD4|2.0|I was extremely disapointed, the video appears to be a copy (one to many times) from a standard definition video, however the sound portion was fine. I own a VHS copy and was attempting to upgrade, but this isn't the DVD.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I have yet to get a Blu-Ray player, but I like getting Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs to feel more up-to-date. Obviously, The Avengers is an amazing film, and this combo pack is sold at a very affordable price. Thanks Amazon!
B000024JCA|4.0|This live album, recording during a UK tour in June 1973, is a very good album that highlights the original line up of this excellent, yet often overlooked, band. For anyone unfamilar with Wishbone Ash this album would be a really good introduction to the band, since it contains material from all of the first four Wishbone Ash studio albums, released between 1970 and 1973.<br /><br />The King Will Come, Warrior, Blowin' Free and Throw Down The Sword are from the Argus album; Ballad of the Beacon and Rock n' Roll Widow are from Wishbone Four (my favorite Wishbone Ash studio album, by the way); The Pilgrim and Jailbait are from the Pilgimage album; Lady Whisky and Phoenix are from the band's first album, simply titled Wishbone Ash.<br /><br />Wishbone Ash was a great guitar band and a very good live act. This album showcases the band's guitar work in a live performance during the best days (IMHO) of their career.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a really good live album that will appeal to anyone who is familiar with Wishbone Ash as well being a really good introduction to this band for anyone not familiar with them. Well worth your attention.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Definitely one of my favorites! Sadly, this film is drastically underrated. The animation alone is just incredible, along with an adventurous storyline and unique, likable characters. Also, I personally love the fact that the main character is voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt & some songs in the film are performed by Johnny Rzenik (lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls, my favorite band). If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend that you give it a chance.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|In comparison, if you like the Angry Bird series, this is MANY times better! Seems to use the same physics engine as Angry Bird except you build a vehicle or propel the piggy to the finish line. Requires some form of brain power, instead of mindlessly flinging birds, to move wheeled vehicles, winged aircraft (of your own design) in conjunction with balloons, rockets or soda bottles to propel you.<br />Instead of getting 3 Stars in Angry birds you have 3 objectives? to complete for level. For example, 1) just getting pig to the finish, 2) Get pig to finish before a certain amount of time, 3) Pick up a starred box along the way to the finish.<br />Other examples, not crashing, getting a King pig AND regular pig to finish, getting an egg and pig to finish.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Prince of Denmark (Africa) has his kingdom stolen from him when his uncle murders the king. Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Only Disney could make light of a story about a lion cub being framed for murder, then going into self imposed exile. The lion cub makes friends, grows up, then returns to reclaim his rightful place and to redeem himself.<br /><br />In typical Disney fashion, they antagonist meets is demise in the most brutal way possible, and all ends well.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I actually got this as an unabridged audiobook many years ago (for cheap or free, I think), and \\"read\\" it while commuting to and from my Master's program.  I loved it then, and raved about it to my family, and tried to get them to read it, unsuccessfully.  Now, someone made a movie, and everyone wants to read it, lol.  I actually bought the Kindle book so I could read it aloud to my 7 year-old (home schooled child) and edit any parts I thought needed it. Really, I only ended up editing a little bit of the gruesomeness from the hyena eating the zebra, but there was a lot of vocabulary to be learned!  And we drew pictures of the raft, and talked about solar stills.  We also had a lot of discussions about the zoological information, and the Alpha/Omega relationships described.<br /><br />I am not going to give a synopsis, since that has been done.  I will just make a few comments to those who are thinking of reading this to a child, or allowing a child to read it.  It is quite gruesome.  Animals are eaten in grotesque and gory detail, and die slowly.  There is quite a bit of suffering and danger.  And the end (SPOILER) includes grotesque murder and human depravity, including a little cannibalism.  In the end, you discover that the entire 98 chapter story has an alternate reality, which seems more likely, though certainly sadder and more horrific.  Interestingly, my 7 year-old spoke in the end of the second story as the \\"fake\\" story, and assumed that the tiger story was the true one.  I didn't suggest to him otherwise.  (END SPOILER)<br /><br />The story is interesting in the zoological information related, from which my son learned a lot, and we really enjoyed talking about all kinds of things in terms of Alpha Tiger versus Omega and Super Alpha.  I loved Pi's take on religion, and I think that may have been my husband's favorite part, since he has recently started to explore different religions.  The story is definitely spiritual, and Pi's suffering is quite staggering, and his perseverance is quite uplifting.  I did not feel that the story was slow, mostly because I was reading it to a 7 year-old who was fascinated by the details given about different animals and cultural idiosyncrasies of India and the 1970s.<br /><br />My husband loved the story, too, which he recently read mostly on the Kindle, and then we listened to the end on my iPod during a long car trip.  He loved it as much as I did.  I am going to take my 7 year-old to see the movie today.  I hope justice is done to the story and Pi's suffering.  I will be interested to see how they deal with the ending.<br /><br />All in all, this book is well worth the price, and is a terrific read for anyone who likes fantastical stories.  It is a bit of a coming-of-age story, with a lot of suffering involved, and no other characters to speak of.  It would be highly inappropriate for children under about 7-8 or for immature children 7-9, or possibly some girls, not to be sexist, but boys tend to like and be OK with gruesome earlier than girls.  I would not have read this to my son last year.  He's a pretty mature 7, and likes gore and suspense a lot.  We read The Hobbit, the How to Train Your Dragon series, and Peter Pan recently, all great successes.  He loved this book and is very excited to see the movie.  I hope that helps anyone who has questions about the appropriateness of the book for children.g, and his perseverance is quite uplifting.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was conflicted about Mr Owen writing  the book.  Because the first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about fight club. I'm very glad I did read it. It was an honest account of what happened. NO political agendas . I would much rather see Mr Owen and the members of seal team 6 get the money than to have their work used for political gain by people who should know better.
B002BWP49C|5.0|When I first saw this movie last year, I'd say that it was the best one, but after seeing Part II, I would say this movie is a close second! This movie is packed with romance and is very interesting!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show!  I hated to miss even 1 episode so I bought that episode here.  I'm thrilled I can do that.
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved this movie! Jennifer Lawrence is awesome in this movie! She is strong, powerful, and the pure quintessential Katniss Everdeen!
B005LAII80|5.0|I didn't see one trailer for this movie in the theater.  I didn't see one commercial on tv either.  This movie was not advertised at all.  The only reason I gave this movie a chance, was because of yahoo user reviews.  I cannot wait to own this on blu ray.  Plenty of other more detailed reviews here, but know this...I loved the Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers.  This movie did not have the budget those movies did, not even close.  The story is not as epic as those movies either.  But I had more fun watching this movie, than any other movie in 2012.  My girlfriend even liked it better than any blockbuster this year too.  It is fast paced.  The soundtrack (and I rarely even notice the soundtrack of a movie these days) fits this movie and the pace of it perfectly.  For an action film, the acting is above what you would expect.  I am not a movie critic so I am going to stop here.  I just felt compelled to write SOMETHING here because I saw, loved, and will be owning this bluray when it comes out because of word of mouth.  I'm throwing a Dredd party the day I get this in the mail.  If you like action films and missed this in the theater, do yourself a favor and give it a chance.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is the one movie that made me burst into random tears! My sister and I watched this movie years ago. We lost it when she forgot him, yet again! I recommend this movie to everyone! I'm not even the romantic movie type, but this movie holds my heart!

B005LAII8A|5.0|Straight up great movie, great actors, intriguing story line and never boring.<br />Totally original in the sense that I did not know where this movie was going but once it found it's mark I flat out loved it.<br />Time travel alway brings up the possibility or impossibility of paradox realities, an issue that the movie tried to address as best they could and were rather successful at it.<br />Thing is knowing it's about tima travel (call me nuts but I don't think it's possible) you already are more than willing to suspend current beliefs and let yourself get swallowed by this movie.<br />Terminator would never have been as good if the time travel aspect was not well handled or remotely believable and so ditto for Looper.<br />But fortunately for us they did a more than decent job of it.<br />Cool things happen in this movie that has not been tried to death already and for that I would wholeheartedly recommend to buy this however I know a few people who didn't like it, so maybe rent it first and buy the it next day.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|This is Gary Moore playing Jimi Hendrix his way.  He is not as delicate and textural as Jimi.  He is not as psychedelic as Jimi.  On the other hand, his is a first rate shredder and a powerful player.  This is not a bad or a good imitation - it is a completely new way of listening to the Hendrix canon.  Certainly not better, just different.  There are moments when I wish he would swing more and rock less, but Gary cranked it to \\"11\\" and was playing hot that night.  When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail!  I doubt it would  have been released without his untimely passing, but I am glad it was.  It may actually appeal to newer guitar enthusiasts who are a little confused by the Hendrix legacy in the age of power players like Vai, Morse, etc.  FTR - I am a huge Gary Moore fan, but if this was the first thing I had heard of him, this would not have convinced me that he was as special as his more nuanced blues playing indicates, or his homage to Peter Green, Blues for Greeny, where he really does inhabit the spirit of the man.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I would recommend this book to women mostly, but the man who enjoys intelligent humor, with a little menstrual humor on the side, will enjoy this book.  I expected just a stand-up comedy show from page to page, but was pleasantly surprised to find some insight into human and female psychology.  I know I am not the only one who can relate to Tina Fey, especially her eyebrows, which grow from ear to ear, &#34;and if you stand too close, they might grow onto your face as well!&#34;<br /><br />Hilarious!

0062183591|5.0|I read this book as a student in the Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics program at Carlow University [...]. I was excited to read this book as soon as I saw it on the course listings and it did not disappoint.<br />For many, non-fiction is difficult to read and can be extremely tedious, but Ariely's is not. He introduces complex ideas and information in entertaining ways by using jokes, anecdotes and modern language. It's just like Zumba! You don't realize you're getting in shape because you're having fun dancing, but with this book, you don't realize you're learning because you're having so much fun reading. He uses relevant ideas and studies topics that any reader can relate to, even those not seeking a degree or studying the social sciences.<br /><br />This book gave me better insight into human behavior as well as new signals to look for when performing investigations. I now understand the importance of the scientific method in research, law and daily life more so than I previously did. I realize that without the scientific method the information we cannot rely on information given to us. The main concept that really grabbed me was how every single thing, even down to silly questions like \\"how much do people really exaggerate during games of golf, and why?\\" can be developed and understood by experimentation and the scientific method. This was a profound realization and has changed the way I look at even the simplest of tasks. This is going to be vastly important in my future career in fraud investigation because it provides insight into human behavior and highlights potential red flags to look for in different situations.<br /><br />One of the only weaknesses of Ariely's book (besides it ending all too soon!) was the lack of different experimental methods being used. Ariely's methods are effective in explaining the theories he is studying in a topical manner but for a more scholarly approach different experiments and more thorough explanations would be helpful.  Variations in his experiments could also provide more perspective to the topics at hand. He does provide enough information so that the reader may understand the experiments and their outcome, but for an expanded understanding of behavioral theories, his explanations of his experiments and theories may not be deep enough.<br /><br />Despite the weaknesses of the book, the informative and playful nature of Ariely's writing keeps the reader engaged and interested throughout the entirety of his research. If all non-fiction books were like this one, I think the sciences in general would generate a lot more interested students.
1451638450|2.0|Lois Bujold's Vor series are usually filled with quick-witted characters with surprising depth. Unfortunately, choosing a humdrum main character makes for a humdrum book. Ivan, the main character of Vorpatril's Alliance has always been the dullest character in the other novels, playing the straight man to the smart and savvy Miles, Elena, Aral, Illyan, Cordelia - pretty much everyone. It's no surprise, then, that this book is filled with comments such as \\"Huh?\\" and \\"What?\\".<br /><br />Ivan and Tej, both beautiful people that have always been surrounded by others smarter than themselves, end up at the center of a Jacksonian mess. Sadly, it doesn't make them seem any smarter or more interesting. At least Ivan understands that he isn't smart, and he seems to be fairly good, if unimaginative, at what he does in the military. Tej, the other main character, describes sex as the only thing she was better at than her siblings. In fact, we get a long list of things she is not good at, and isn't interested in. And that list just keeps getting longer as Ivan and Tej stumble around blindly through the entire plot, constantly having other characters sigh and shake their heads when the two fail to make painfully obvious connections.<br /><br />One of the things that I have always loved about Lois Bujold books is the characters' sense of introspection, how they strive to be better, to have others see them as being good or worthy. This is the first book of hers I have seen characters strive for mediocrity and achieve it with stunning success. There is really no sense of emotional connection between the characters or from the reader to the characters. This book feels like something she whipped up quickly to keep her audience quiet while she figures out how she wants to deal with the emotional storm she created at the end of Cryoburn. I recommend only getting it if you are desperately missing a taste of the Vor series, but don't expect her usual high-level characters.

B0064MGU98|4.0|I have heard over the years this was a good show but I just never thought I would really like it.  Another lawyer show is what I thought.  One day while looking through what T.V. shows looked good, I saw The Good Wife and thought what the heck, I will watch one episode.  I have been instantly hooked ever since.<br /><br />The acting is so great.  Each character seems to be so well thought out.  Josh Charles is probably my favorite on the show.  He plays Will Gardner.  I cannot figure out if he is a good guy or what, but I am hoping for good guy.  Every actor plays their character so very well.  The writing is great with serious issues and humor mixed in the right places.<br /><br />I look forward to the rest of season 1 and moving onto season 2.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|yeah baby, Rod's still as sexy as ever, classy Christmas tunes, even my husband will listen to this one, amazing

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a book that I could not put down.  Once you got a handle on all the names of the characters, you wanted to find out who they were and what would happened to them.  A MUST READ!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is great, action adventure, and a MC-12 appearance... If you're a fan of this series or you've never read this type before I think you'd like it..
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am in the middle of the book and have been fascinated by the twists and turns of this book.  Since I am only half way through, I am looking forward to more surprises before the book ends.  Great read!
B00846TRHY|3.0|My wife and I were intrigued by the title and description of Machine Gun Preacher and decided to rent it one afternoon while the kids were in school.  We don't care for profanity in movies and this had a lot of it.  That (for us) is hard to get past.  The profanity is pervasive and very intense in many scenes.  If such things don't bother you, you may enjoy this film more than we did. It really helps to open your eyes to things going on in the world that we would all rather forget.  It is worth seeing for that alone. It is not a feel good movie about a biker gangster coming to Jesus and then changing the world.  It's a lot more complicated and leaves you unsure in the end what good is being done and for what reasons...just like real life.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|No way to review the movie but as far as streaming from prime I could never get my computer to connect so no clue about the movie.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I basically watched this because I think Ezra Miller(Kevin) is so gorgeous.  I look forward to seeing him in a lot of movies as an adult.  I see the next Tom Cruise.<br />Anyway, the movie was pretty good.  My only gripe is that the editor should have made the story a bit more linear and easier to follow. I have ADD and I cannot just watch a movie by itself. Clipping back and forth to pre Kevin, early Kevin , post divorce and post tragedy is kinda hard to follow. Was the divorce the final straw?<br />Otherwise, it was gut wrenching to watch a pure sociopath from birth. That poor mother.  The fact that his father does not experience his wrath until the end is even more sinister.  I did enjoy it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought the story mixed the historical with the 'improbable' and fantastical pretty well.<br /><br />Lots of action obviously but there was enough of the psychological thriller there too to keep it interesting.<br />The acting was good from the cast and the special effects weren't over played for the genre.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!!! I play the non timed version &amp; first night I played on my tablet until almost 4am<br />13 &amp; 11 yo granddaughters turned me on to it, who compete with eachother at  the higher levels. Great game!!
1451695195|5.0|I have read a few books about near-death experience but this author's version about what he experienced and sensed is the most beautifully written piece I have ever come across. My mother had just passed away a few months prior, I felt so hopeful and joyful after reading this book. I felt only happiness for my mother and I no longer fear death. The story was wonderful and surprising all the way to the last chapter.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very cute and a lot of fun. play it everyday with my 4 year old and 2 year old.  minimum problems.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|My wife, kids, and I, love this movie. We have watched a dozen times and it continually gets better each time. My favorite part is the \\"Snake King\\" part...hilarious!! Great movie with an even better message.
B0057B6DSU|1.0|I thought it would be an original all spanish dubbed. It is just the same American Pianist, but supposedly the mexican edition (not dubbed, just subbed). It would have been cheaper and probably better to buy The Pianist.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game continues to hold my attention months after download.  I'll find myself playing for long periods of time. love it.
B0002VJIGY|5.0|Since I am a French person who lives in the USA, I consider myself lucky whenever I come across a French movie in the original version.  I intentionally bought this original French version of les Misérables without English subtitles. The mini-series totally meets my expectations: I love Victor Hugo drama, Depardieu's rendition of Jean Valjean, as well as the whole cast and the photography. Being able to enjoy a French production without any subtitles on the screen is also a plus for me.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone fluent in French, or with enough knowledge of the language and the story, to be able to enjoy it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Truly well written, great concept and ideas, consistent quality.  My &#34;test&#34; for a good book is whether I MAKE time to read it.  I stayed up late and blew off chores for this!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Fun to play.  Some levels much more difficult than others.  Just a good way to relax and have some fun.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Pretty good app, however, there are a few things to approve on. Picture loading should have edit option of rotating the pic. You should be able to discribe each pic as you can from Facebook on PC. Would like to be able to edit comments posted like Facebook on PC.
B000FC0O7M|5.0|Being a bit of a NASA-junkie, I really enjoyed getting this historical perspective from a long respected launch director (Gene Kranz).

B001FB55H6|4.0|I dont know what the hell is wrong with people. Watchmen is one of the best movie adaptions from a comic ever made! I only sliced off one star because they go on way to long about the death of the Comedian, but then after that the movie takes off. I think all comic movies should be R rated. That is the only way to portray the graphic grittiness of the comic. F*** trying to make it sensible for kids! Zack Snyder I salute you!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game! Very challenging and makes you work your mind! Keeps your attention working against the clock! Plenty of levels to make it interesting!
B004Y8075M|4.0|So you want to live in a perfect world without poverty, crime, disagreement and worry?  What does it take to create such a utopia?  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a chilling example of how one such world is structured.  Such a perfect society may not be what it is thought out to be.  Freedom, individualism, and emotions are sacrificed in order to create this utopian world.<br /><br />Lowry leads her readers on a journey through the highly structured life of twelve-year-old Jonas.  Given a special role in his community, Jonas slowly begins to learn how his world differs from what it used to be.  He sees events and experiences feelings he has never encountered before.  Jonas is left wondering if the freedom to experience these emotions, good or bad, is really worth it.  Is freedom to experience pain, love, happiness and sorrow better than structure in a sterile environment?<br /><br />I highly recommend The Giver as it will influence the reader to ponder the structure of society as well as the freedoms our society allows.  This book may be considered a book for younger readers, but it would greatly benefit any adult reader as well.  Lowry creates a piece of literature that evokes thoughts and emotions comparable to Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  The Giver is a book that should not be overlooked.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I could not put it down.I was so curious to find out what was going to happen so i kept reading. E.L James is a wonderful writer.  The story flowed very naturally and kept you guessing.I would highly recommend all three books. I am looking for more.

B000002MTU|4.0|The whole who has the right to be called a bluesman is tiring.  This CD is spectacular and Clapton's music is genuine and sincere so yeh he is a bluesman regardless of where he came from.  The blues has evolved and we have to embrace that.  Gary Clark Jr, Tedeschi Trucks, etc are taking it in a new direction.<br /><br />I love this record.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I don't get the reviews. We rented this movie with 10 people who watched it including a 9,14, and 16 year old boys, a middle aged mom and dad, a 60 year old aunt and the grandparents let's just say 80's.  Everyone loved the whole movie. The idea was just so mind boggling and thought provoking.  We still talk about this movie and it's been months since we saw it. At least 3 of us watched it with other people who all loved it too. Granted there were some slow scenes but we used them to discuss the movie and they were never that slow. Believe me any movie that can keep my 9 year old entertained is a great movie, he falls asleep in James Bond movies!!!<br /><br />Watch it, discuss it. Anyone who loves a good sci-fi and thought provoking movie will LOVE this!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love this second season it's so awesome!!!<br />I definatly will be getting the third season so excited!!!!<br />I recommend to everyone who loves zombies

1423140591|5.0|The Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan, captures your attention with the first sentence, \\"The snake haired ladies were starting to annoy Percy.\\" The book goes on to tell you that the sixteen year old demigod, Percy Jackson, has lost his memory and must recover it by questing to Alaska, \\"the land beyond the gods.\\" On his way he makes many friends including a girl who has been dead for seventy years, a Chinese-Canadian baby-man, and a harpie that has memorized more texts than are available in the library of congress.<br /> In this irreverent book filled with sarcastic humor, the gods of Rome still exist... in modern day California. This may change though if Percy and his friends can't prevent Gaea (the evil earth mother) from waking and changing the earth as we know it.<br /> This book will wrap you up in fantasy and intrigue. Riordan's genius will hold you until the book has ended. Highly recommended.

It has many features like highlighting, bookmarks, and starts on the page you left it on.  FREE and worth a lot!
1934356476|3.0|This review is specifically for the Kindle version of the book.  I'm be willing to be that the printed edition doesn't have the same errors.  There are two show stopper problems.  The first is that the code is horribly formatted.  It does span lines properly and has \n's in the middle of keywords.  The second problem is that words in non-bold italics simply don't exist in the book.  It's been stripped of them entirely.  So you end up with sentences like \\"This is called a .\\"  As you can imagine, this isn't super helpful.<br /><br />The content is, as most other reviewers have said, good.
B004JY0KP8|5.0|I liked it as soon as I opened the box, I really liked the smell of the leather strap. The Watch looks better than its photographs, it fits well.<br />I find it slightly light weight but thats not a deal breaker.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page and never let go!  The author made this book so much fun to read because it was unpredictable and you could only guess at how it would end.  What an adventure.  Well worth the time spent reading.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Excellent movie! Warm, funny at times, Sad and also Loving.  One all the girls must see.  Even a loving man will like it, I did!

1469984202|4.0|Wool was an enjoyable read that keeps moving from beginning to end. Hugh Howey does a great job of establishing an interesting vision of the future while also taking care to develop the characters that live there. This book wraps up nicely on its own, but I'm looking forward to moving on to Part 6 to read more about this world and the people in it.<br /><br />The first two sections are pretty much short stories that stand on their own. The rest of the book is more of a traditional novel, but it still integrates closely with the first two stories. I don't want to say too much about the story for fear of giving away some of the twists, but I have trouble imagining anyone who likes science fiction who wouldn't enjoy reading this book.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is one secondary character who makes what I think is THE critical decision in the book, but I wanted to know more about him to understand why he did what he did. A minor hiccup in a solid and enjoyable novel.

B000U0O9FM|3.0|This is one of those rare instances where I actually think the movie is better. This book seems more like a rough draft of a screenplay than a novel in itself.<br /><br />Again - it's still a worthwhile read, especially for the fans of the movie.

B000E8QVWY|4.0|I was impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own singing, and did it well, in this story of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  What I liked best about the film was the family drama - Cash working out his past relationships with his brother and father, and the support June and her parents gave him in recovering from drug addiction.  My favorite scene was when the elder Carters, both carrying shotguns, chased away the drug dealer.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is a fine renditions of Jane Austen's novel.  I'm not quite sure why a story of 19th century England, in which the heroine defies the expectation that an unmarried woman's sole occupation is to secure a well-heeled mate, is so appealing these days; but I was so satisfied with this film that I was disappointed when it ended.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote is about Truman Capote's writing of his nonfiction masterpiece, In Cold Blood. In my mind, it ranks right up there with the book. Director Bennett Miller, screenwriter Dan Futterman, and actor Philip Seymour Hoffman,  with support from all the other actors and crew, bring such a nuanced experience of the story of this writer and his subjects (mainly two murderers) that I could identify in some way with every character.

The actions of the so-called \\"terrorists\\" make sense, given their situation, and turn out to be the most effective strategies.  The movie is somewhat like a documentary, but follows several personal storylines to deepen the emotional tone.  The film highlights the ambiguity and complexity of the oil story, and though no easy solution is evident, I feel somehow more hopeful by seeing more clearly  what the reality is.  By the way, this is good film making.

B004QYTRRS|2.0|I adore Johnny Depp and like Angelina Jolie very much. But this movie is beyond bad. Johnny looks like he just came out of a stint in re-hab. It's beyond comprehension how he could look so BAD. There is absolutely no chemistry between he and Jolie and what very little dialog there is, is stilted, boring and banal. I laughed at the \\"boat chase\\" because the music lent an air of adventure and urgency but the boats appeared to be chugging along at 10 mph. Absolutely nothing interesting, exciting or romantic about this movie. Skip it and go watch a pot boil. It will be a better use of your time.

B00902MCVY|5.0|Album of the year? Definitely. Album of the decade? Could be. Without becoming tangled in comparisons and superlatives, I'll put it like this: 'Time I' is epic in vision, theme and musical execution. Not chained by the restraints of stereotypical metal, Jari Mäenpää and his Wintersun compadres explore musical styles from Chinese traditional (using instruments such as the sublime-sounding erhu) to precision-picked extreme metal with blast-beat drumming and choral backing vocals à la Nightwish. Indeed, 'Time I' has an epic soundtrack-like quality to it that is often reminiscent of Nightwish at their best. As has been pointed out by many others, the wait for this album was inordinately long. Every time I listened to Wintersun's flawless debut album, I wondered when - and sometimes if - they would get around to releasing a follow up. Jari is a perfectionist with every detail of the music he creates. That, combined with financial issues, delayed the album. The resulting masterpiece is well worth the wait.<br /><br />Intro 'When Time Fades Away' is oriental, epic and majestic. It would fit just as well onto the soundtrack of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or 'Hero' as it does onto this album. Subtle strings and heart-wrenching erhu melodies hook the listener with their poignance, setting the scene for track two.<br /><br />Clocking in at 13:31, 'Sons of Winter and Stars' is the longest track on the album. Its four sections, (I) Rain of Stars, (II) Surrounded by Darkness, (III) Journey Inside a Dream, and (IV) Sons of Winter and Stars feature Wintersun's trademark sweep picking, executed with astonishing precision. Kai Hahto's drumming is notable, as are the Scandinavian influences that permeate the lyrics and music after the album's decidedly eastern intro.<br /><br />'Land of Snow and Sorrow' features, in addition to one of the greatest titles ever, one of the greatest riffs ever. Starting out slow and down-tuned for maximum heaviness, it segues into a clean-tonedrefrain then pummels the listener with a monumental riff. Throughout the 8:21 of the track, it alternates between delicate melodies and epic heaviness. This is something Wintersun do extremely well. Like their compatriots Insomnium and Amorphis, they understand that the key to making a sonic impact isn't relentless bluster: it's exhibiting light and shade, darkness and light.<br /><br />'Darkness and Frost' is another instrumental piece that could easily be from a film soundtrack, although this time it's not oriental: here we find ourselves very much rooted in the band's Scandinavian homeland. Subtle wintry keyboards and note-picked guitar melodies provide the tune, with occasional bass-drum booms creating a sense of majesty.<br /><br />'Time' is the second-longest track on the album. The biggest difference between this track and the Wintersun debut is Jaari's vocals. Gone are the growled words discernible only with a lyric sheet, in their place clean vocals that soar above twin guitars and a thunderous rhythm section. The song twists and turns until 6:15, when a staggering guitar solo precedes another beautifully sung chorus. The song outros with piano melodies, delicate keyboards, wind chimes and an erhu bringing us back to the oriental theme of the intro.<br /><br />There isn't a weak moment on 'Time I'. Every detail of the album - song titles, lyrics, melodies, musical execution, vocal delivery, production, artwork and packaging - is breathtaking. This is the standard by which other metal will be measured. Jari and co. have set the bar so high that most bands won't be able to see it never mind reach it. Monumental.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|A must have to any Christmas movie list, If you want to laugh and have a good Christmas experience watch this with your family its hilarious. The Video and sound on the Blue-Ray is Pristine.
0385535147|3.0|Its a quick read. It kept my interest. For about half the book it seemed like a good story. Therefore the three stars. The second half of the book becomes a disjointed,unbelievably far fetched silly narrative. Certainly don't waste your money and unless you are a serious Grisham devotee(in which case you've probably already read the book)who has a need to read everything he publishes-Don't bothet!
B003VS0CYC|5.0|I love these movies from the 80's and 90's they really concentrated on the acting and feeling of each scene so much better most of the movies that come out now are sloppy because all they care about is CG and explosions. Blue-Ray transfer is great loved it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I heard a lot of hype about this concert, but I still hesitated to get Celebration Day initially.  I wanted to wait to see if the hype panned out.  As review after glowing review began to pour in, I got excited.  Could it really be that good?  I know these guys are legends, but how many legends can you think of performing today who honestly need to hang it up?  I can think of quite a few right off the top of my head.  Could the reviews be right, and not just the typical hyperbole of overenthusiastic fans?<br /><br />From what I can see and hear, the reviews couldn't be more accurate.  The biggest question mark, Robert Plant, sounds wonderful.  No, not amazing or unbelievable, but good...better than good, really.  He has a cool, smooth, controlled delivery, and although he's mostly in a lower register than in Zeppelin's heyday, he still summons that piercing wail at key moments.  I was surprised by the power in his voice several times, not to mention some energetic moments just rocking out onstage as he gets caught up in the vibe.<br /><br />And how could he not be galvanized by the downright muscular performances of Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones?  If Plant doesn't quite reach the level of amazing, Page and Jones do and then some.  Page's tone is perfect, sounding raw, raunchy, and as virile as the youngest, cockiest guitar phenom on the scene.  Jones's bass thumps with authority, and his keyboard work is entrancing.  He's especially incredible on one of my all-time favorite songs, \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" which I LOVE on this.  I'd call it a highlight, but there wouldn't be much point, since every song stands out.  But it's REALLY good.<br /><br />That leaves Jason Bonham, who fulfills his dream of sitting behind the kit in place of his dad.  He's a driving force behind this show, delivering with a bombastic punch that would surely make his dad proud.  It's exhilirating to see the band's camaraderie with him throughout the show, but especially at the end when they all three watch him finish \\"Rock and Roll\\" with a truly appreciative, admiring look that's pure family.  It's a bit of a spine-tingling moment.<br /><br />No doubt about it...the legends delivered.  Sad as it may be that this concert might conclude the career of one of the most important groups of musicians to ever play, it's not a bad thing to see them go out with a show that has already attained a mystique in the five years since it was performed.  If you've been hesitating to go for Celebration Day like I did, take note that those glowing reviews continue to pour in from longtime fans and casual listeners alike.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|I bought 3 of the Sapphire Series the other day, 'Gladiator' and 'Saving Private Ryan' which were both excellent editions, and I bought this with them, and I just watched it today, and this one is right on par with the other two in terms of the video transfer, the audio, the extras, and of course the film itself, and this film looked great on the special edition 2 disc DVD, but this just takes it to another level in all aspects.<br /><br />Starting with the video transfer, this film looks absolutely fantastic, and considering it's almost 20 years old, it's quite amazing, the colors are vibrant, the image is sharp and very detailed, especially the shots of Scotland and the mountains, looks beautiful, and the battle scenes just look outstanding, those charging horses just come off the screen it's so bright and vivid, and when William Wallace (Mel Gibson) puts his war paint on, man oh man, it looks even better on blu ray, and the long hair of the scottich blowing in the wind, I swear you can see every strand, no kidding! and the costumes really stand out, especially the armor, all the metal shines, but you can see the wear and tear on it, which is of course what Mel Gibson intended, and now thanks to blu ray, it really shows.<br /><br />Now this is a 2 disc set, the first disc is the movie and a nice little interactive feature which features nice little historical facts about the real battles, not videos, but reading, but still, I like it, the 2nd disc features some really nice recent documentaries, such as Braveheart: A Look Back, which is about an hour and a half with cast and crew talking about the creation of the film 14 years later, because this set came out in 2009, Smithfield: Mideval Killing Fields, which is a bunch of documentaries on how the Scottish and English fought their battles back in those times, Tales of William Wallace which is a nice little half hour documentary about the man himself, William Wallace, and A Writer's Journey, which I think the last 2were on the special edition DVD, but the first 2 are new, and they are excellent additions, and I think it has a couple of trailers.<br /><br />So is this edition worth the double dip for those who have the 2 disc special edition DVD? absolutely yes!, the video and audio transfers are excellent as I said, and the extras just sweeten the pot, this is a film that really shines on blu ray, similar to 'Gladiator' which is another Sapphire Series worth getting if you don't have it.<br /><br />So Paramount delivers again with the Sapphire Series, they seem to only put their best movies on these sets, so I'm sure there will be more of these in the future, I still want the Forrest Gump one, and the first 2 Godfathers, then my collection will be complete, until they release more.

B003YZGWHS|1.0|CHILDREN OF THE CORN was my very first horror movie and R-rated movie back in 1988. I watched it with my father against my mother's wishes, so it reminds me of him. When I saw this for cheap I thought, \\"Why not?\\" Here's why not:<br /><br />  This isn't the Stephen King classic. This is a Made for SyFy piece of crap on a crap cracker with a tall glass of diarrhea soda. I mean, the corn \\"field\\" is like a 2-plant thick garb of plants with 3 or 4 crosses in the middle. Not to mention in this go 'round the \\"corn\\" proper is not what's possessed, actually nothing is, just the kids are very backward and creepy.<br /><br />  You don't want to see this. You know how you think that you're a wee bit interested at this point? No. You're not.

B00007LTIL|5.0|I used to think that \\"Workingman's Dead\\" with songs like \\"Uncle John's Band,\\" \\"Dire Wolf\\" and \\"Casey Jones\\" must be the strongest Grateful Dead album. After listening carefully to \\"American Beauty\\" there is no doubt that I have to reconsider my opinion. Where the \\"Uncle John's Band\\" has a few less interesting numbers, \\"American Beauty\\" comes out as a full set album. Stylistically the two albums, of course, are very close to each other, with the emphasis that is placed in magnificent vocal harmonies, with considerable inspiration from Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.<br /><br />Grateful Dead's songwriting is troughout the album marked by both inspiration and creativity and many of the group's most beloved songs can be found here. First and foremost, the bluesy \\"Truckin '\\" is highlighted because it was a great concert favorite, the closest the group came to a single hit, and of course because it's nice song.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is the country / folk-inspired songs that dominate with \\"Box of Rain\\", \\"Sugar Magnolia,\\" \\"Ripple\\" and \\"Till the Morning Comes\\" as my personal favorites.<br /><br />The magnificent vocals are particularly expressed in the hymn-like \\"Attics of My Life\\", which also help make this album an unforgettable milestone.<br /><br />More upbeat is \\"Friend of the Devil\\" and \\"Operator\\", the latter written and sung by Ron McKernan. Otherwise, it is as usually Jerry Garcia who is the most prolific songwriter, with Phil Lesh and Bob Weir contributing with the classics \\"Box of Rain\\" and \\"Sugar Magnolia\\".<br /><br />In addition to the single versions of \\"Truckin '\\" and \\"Ripple\\" the bonus tracks consist of fine live recordings from various concerts played in 1970. Fine sound and great performances.
B00338QENI|5.0|What a super book.  Read for the book club.  A very different book that offers a lot of information.  I have a friend who said this was the best book she had ever read.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I felt from the beginning that there was something exciting and very contemporary in sound of Lana Del Rey's album. With elements from both Dido and Kate Bush, I think that producer Emile Haynie has created a sound that is very contemporary which incorporates the feelings of disillusionment which characterizes our times.<br /><br />There are several really good songs which lyrically corresponds well to the music. The title track is perhaps the number most people will know from the radio, but for me \\"Blue Jeans\\" is the absolute highligt, both melodic and catchy - magnificent!<br /><br />\\"Dark Paradise\\" has not been released as a single, even though the song to my ears was a more obvious choice than a couple of the other five singles that have been pulled from the album.<br /><br />It can be stated that more songs remind pretty much on each other, but still each very good.<br /><br />One song which really stands out from the rest is \\"Million Dollar Man\\", which has a more jazzy sound. There are also some James Bond-ish in both melody and production. I would not be surprised if Del Rey is offered the title song for one the next Agent 007 movies.

B007VTVGFQ|5.0|I was a huge fan of Extraordinary Machine. When the Pawn grew on me, and I only like a few songs on Tidal. If you are only a fan of some of Fiona's later work, you will love this. If you are only a fan of \\"Criminal\\" then you may not, but that's your own fault.<br /><br />I love that this record is crisp and clean sounding (though still complex and beautiful). Every song isn't cluttered with electric guitar and synths. It's fiona and some (sometimes very interesting) percussion and piano. And in typical Fiona fashion, her songs hit close to home.<br /><br />Mildly unrelated- but she is brilliant on tour. She really feels the songs as she performs them. She's not putting on a show; instead she's letting you witness her turmoil.
1451695195|2.0|Because there are so many reviews of this book already, I'll make my primary focus one thing:  whatever else this book might be, it isn't \\"proof\\" of anything.<br /><br />I'm happy for Eben Alexander that he's joined the many people who have had a near-death experience (NDE) that changed their lives for the better.  But Alexander is insistent that his wasn't just your average NDE experience.  His was special, and can't be explained as a matter of neurochemical processes, because his NDE occurred not only while he was in a coma, but when his cerebral cortex was completely \\"shut down.\\" He says this was demonstrated by enhanced CT scans and other neurological exams.  However, neuroscientists like Dr. Martin Samuels, chair of the neurology department at Brigham and Women's Hospital (affiliated with Harvard and one of Eben Alexander's former employers), respond that there is no way to test whether there was, in fact, such a shutdown.  CT scans do not measure brain activity and we do not yet have the scientific expertise to measure all brain activity.<br /><br />In any case, how does Alexander know when his NDE occurred?  Well, he doesn't.  He never tells us how he knows that his NDE didn't occur when he was going into a coma or coming out of it.<br /><br />Early in the book, Alexander describes a time when he was doing a group skydive and someone made the mistake of opening his parachute when he was below Alexander.  Alexander relates that in a matter of microseconds, he reacted with a maneuver that avoided catastrophe.  He says that his brain had become, for a moment, super-powered, and that this experience shows that the brain is more extraordinary than we can imagine.  Alexander never makes the connection between this experience and his NDE; in other words, it doesn't seem to occur to him that his NDE might have occurred in microseconds in a brain in crisis, or that his brain created the NDE in a way he doesn't imagine.  If it did occur to him, he simply rejects that logical possibility.<br /><br />Alexander makes a big deal of the fact that he's a neurosurgeon to support his claim that his NDE is inexplicable by anything other than an actual experience of the divine.  But again, he is undone by something else he says at the beginning of the book.  He acknowledges that \\"surgically repairing the brain, while an extraordinarily complex undertaking, is actually no different than fixing any other, highly delicate, electrically charged machine.\\"  In other words, Alexander is like a mechanic of the brain.  He doesn't have any special knowledge of neuroscience.  Dr. Samuels of Brigham and Women's Hospital puts it more bluntly; saying that the fact that Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon is no more relevant than if he were a plumber.<br /><br />So we're left with the story of a guy with no particular expertise in neuroscience who had a subjective experience and decides that it is, somehow, an objective proof that heaven exists and not something that happened in his brain.  Well, I have a problem with that.<br /><br />My problem is NOT that Alexander had a spiritually transformative experience and that he is now a man of solid faith.  I have absolutely no quarrel with faith; I have it myself.  But don't confuse faith with fact; it's as simple as that.<br /><br />Aside from my problem with the logical underpinnings of the book, my only other particular observation is that I got the feeling that Eben Alexander has a strong psychological need to feel special.  He writes extensively about spending years emotionally and spiritually adrift for reasons relating to the fact that he is an adoptee.  This seems to have instilled in him a drive to show that he is exceptional and, thus, worthy.<br /><br />He's at pains to tell the reader that he's a skydiver, a top neurosurgeon, has a perfect wife and sons, and even was the most beautiful baby in the hospital when he was born.  Everything that happens to him seems to be against lightning-strike odds.  He claims his medical crisis was \\"unprecedented,\\" as were the fact, speed and thoroughness of his recovery from a seven-day coma.  As he tells it, even the weather during his week-long coma was extraordinary.  So it was no surprise to read that, according to him, his NDE was exceptional.  He describes its features as having been different from all other NDEs he's read about.  For example, unlike pretty much everybody else, he didn't recognize himself in his NDE and he didn't meet anybody he knew.  Of course, the capper in this string of long-odds experiences is that he claims that his experience is one that cannot be explained by biochemistry and will become the basis for breakthrough research in the nature of consciousness.  Not surprisingly, he now has a website (which promises a store is coming!) and a foundation (which welcomes people to become members at any one of several pricey levels).  His book ended up being more interesting to me as a psychological study than anything else.<br /><br />Those who are interested in reading books about NDEs may find this a worthwhile read, but--with apologies to Dr. Alexander's psyche--there's nothing exceptional here.e claims his medical crisis was \\"unprecedented,\\" as were the fact, speed and thoroughness of his recovery from a seven-day coma.

1451627297|3.0|This book started VERY strong. The story was intriguing, the characters were interesting, the time travel was fun, and of course, King had some nice and disturbing bits. I did not want to but this book down, and then... I did.<br /><br />I think this book could have used some editing. I don't want to give away anything (because I hate that!), but it sort of veers off the suspense course and dips into a Nicholas Sparks novel for about 400 pages. I've always been avid about reading EVERY page, but with this book I was skimming pages and even skipping chapters to get to the real meat of the story. You'd probably be fine skimming too.<br /><br />Not sure if I'd recommend this or not. When I started reading it, I told everyone about it, but my enthusiasm faded. I would give this 3.5 stars if I could.<br /><br />EDIT: After perusing some other books and seeing their ratings, I lowered my rating to 3 star. My personal rating scale tends to be skewed higher than other Amazon reviewers, and so I wanted to correct this.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I've loved the first two books of the series, can't wait for the next one in May.  Sure Eva is high maintenance, the duo have their issues but it's so well written, has just enough twists to keep you interested, I find myself not reading as quickly as I could just to make the book last longer.  Never mind that it's giving me hot flashes just reading it.

0545425115|5.0|I couldn't imagine liking a novel where children are in some crazy game where they must kill each other until the last one is standing- why were my friends and others raving about a book with such a gruesome theme? But with so many people talking about The Hunger Games, I just had to experience it myself or be left out. The first thing I noticed was the clean writing style of Suzanne Collins that allowed the story to present itself clearly to the reader. The story moved along at a breathtaking clip- a true page turner, impossible to set aside. It's a very visual novel that immediately immerses you in another time and place of great imagination. It must have been very challenging for the author to have pulled this off, and I greatly admire her for it.<br /><br />I loved the characters, and I liked hearing the story from Katniss' perspective. The Hunger Games is a wild ride that delivers many important messages. It's left unfinished, and with that, I'm moving on without delay to the next one in the trilogy.

0920668372|1.0|This book creeps me out so much.  It creeps my 9-year-old son out as well.  In fact, it's become a running joke between us that as soon as he turns 40, I'm going to go get a ladder, and he's going to get a restraining order.  But maybe that's just us.  There is something intensely disturbing to me about the image of an elderly mother sneaking through her grown son's second-story bedroom window to drag him, sleeping, out of bed and rock him in her lap.  I don't find it funny or charming, just creepy.  And please don't tell me I don't \\"get it\\".  I understand what the author was going for here; I just think he missed the mark, and my son thinks so, too.
0316212377|4.0|Banks' \\"Space Opera\\" fluff is just an enticing come-on in the Culture novels, a way to get the reader to think about and absorb  Banks' ideas on everything from how to structure a just society to the crucial nature of experience in tempering and even reversing impractical ivory tower theories.  Having achieved enormous success with these books, as the reviewers note, in the Hydrogen Sonata Banks barely even tries with the plot; the \\"opera\\" is now stretched so thin that it is almost invisible.  Why?  Because Banks has bigger fish to fry.  Here he takes on the knotty problem that, with all our thousands of years of blather about God, we are only now beginning to grapple with -- how do we create meaning in an arbitrary universe that seems devoid of it?  The \\"M\\" theory of eleven dimensions arising out of string theory is reified here as an \\"elevenstring,\\" a formerly  uninvented instrument for which a long-ago composer wrote a piece impossible to play, essentially as a joke, much the same way that the universe itself is unplayable and unmasterable.  The connection between the two is made even more obvious since the first two notes of the piece are meant to reflect the first element in the universe, hydrogen.  Similarly, an ancient civilization that has decided to abandon the \\"real\\" four-dimension observable universe and move into other unknowable dimensions based purely on faith turns out to have been founded on a similar joke played on it by a long-vanished civilization, which provided it with its holy scripture on \\"plates\\" left for a charismatic con man to find and interpret (shades of anti-Mormonism here).  What Banks wants to know is, how do we deal with new knowledge that our entire culture is based on a lie?  One way of dealing with it, Banks is saying, is to continue to rely on faith, and to disappear essentially on vague promises of transcendence into those alternative dimensions.  But the two main protagonists, a musician and a 10,000 year old man, make clear that this is not Banks' preferred option.  The player wanting to play the elevenstring, faced with its arbitrarily created challenges, masters the instrument, going so far as to obtain a second pair of arms to allow her to play the piece.  Once she perfects the piece she abandons the instrument, refuses to disappear into the ether, and moves on to new challenges in the real world.  The 10,000 year old man realizes that the most important thing is living fully with all senses and continually moves on to new experiences.  Taking on new challenges and living through our senses, Banks is saying, and not blind faith, are what make us fully human and able to live meaningful lives even in a cold, cold universe.

B0031Y4A8U|5.0|First of all, this LP was originally released with different tracklistings in the UK and in the USA.  The first track on side B on the British LP was \\"Evil woman\\", while in North America it was \\"Wicked World\\". This version includes BOTH.<br />The cover is an exact replica of the original British LP, so \\"Wicked world\\" is not indicated there, nor on the record's label. But there is an extra track at the end of side A and I can recognize it's \\"Wicked world\\". \\"Evil woman\\" is the first track on side B, as indicated in the label and cover.<br /><br />The sound quality is the highest I've ever heard. Much better than the original old LP and certainly better than the CD versions I know.<br /><br />Some of these old Black Sabbath records were re-issued in the 1980s with new inserts with lyrics and pictures.  This 180gram series all comes with no inserts, but the old records from the 1970s didn't have them either.<br /><br />If you have a good turntable, you'll probably ignore the CD version at home and play this instead.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|The introductory games are kind of silly but the games get better as you move along.  By even the 3rd screen, all of the games are worth playing
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate when ever this season ends. very good show and amazon allows you to watch it at a great price for people that dont have cable.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book changed my perspective on life and helped me to understand myself a lot better. It was great to get the validation that I'm not alone in the world and my feelings and reactions are natural. Susan Cain's clearly defining for the first time what introversion means and doesn't mean (and shedding a lot of preconceptions along the way) and explaining how it manifests in a variety of ways. That really helped me reconcile the parts of me that I found confusing or contradictory (\\"How can I love meeting new people at a party one night and then can't drag myself out to socialize the next night?\\"). It's such a great message that introversion is something to embrace, not just suppress or get around. There are all these positive qualities that come along with being introverted (like ability to focus and listen and be creative). You can achieve all that you want and still be who you are at the same time.<br /><br />The book strikes a good mix and tone for the layman -- full of anecdotes and personal stories, real psychological theory, studies, and statistics, and also practical advice. It's well structured through the chapters as she explores different aspects, theories, or themes. The chapter on what to do for introverted children might be especially useful for parents. I felt myself having so many Eureka! moments that -- even though I'm the worst note taker ever -- I started using the notes/highlighting functionality in my Kindle to save particularly insightful parts down.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this series was the best of what I have read this year.  However,  I was coerced into reading it by my dark sci fi loving sister.  While this is a richly imagined world with fully flesh ed out characters  who are driven by a rapidly moving plot,  I could have lived the rest of my life without some of the violent images which will now be forever implanted in my brain.  Can't wait for the movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Can run in the background, so you don't have to worry about having to open it before going to bed.<br />You can schedule as many alarms as you want at any time during the week.<br />I love being able to wake up to my own music.<br />The math problems is a clever option to add; myself being in Calculus II, I still have some difficulty with the &#34;Very Hard&#34; level problems haha.<br />Highly recommended
0525478817|5.0|This book was so amazing. I just have no words to describe how phenomenal it was. READ IT NOW.  You wont be sorry.. if you are then you're stupid.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a feel-good story about good versus evil; with good triumphing.  Great story; outstanding characters.  Vince Flynn never fails to satisfy.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Poor Temperance - she's looking a little peaked these last few outings.  I guess her stint in Hawaii didn't do much by way of recharging her once gracious presence.  Reichs takes a big risk in the precipitating case requiring Brennan's expertise in the latest offering, but it's strictly by the numbers from then on.  Brennan needs to evolve and mature to maintain her once singular presence in crime fiction, but it doesn't look like Reichs is up to the task.  Pity.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I have never, ever, read anything this brilliant.  Really incredible, can't gush enough about this masterpiece.  I was especially impressed by the language that changes drastically between the different sections of the book.
0547884591|5.0|I have been a fan of Tim Ferris for a few years now and I think his approach to learning, life and everything he does is extremely interesting and innovative. I would say that not all parts of the book are applicable for everyone but I don't think that is the point. Certain parts will be more helpful and interesting to each person who reads it. Maybe not everyone wants to become a cook but that isn't all the book is about. The way Tim approached cooking can be applied to almost anything you wish to learn. I really enjoyed most of the book but found the approaches to language learning extremely interesting. Tim Ferris has a lot of critics but his writing has inspired me and changed my life. I hope to see more books from Tim in the future.
B0015AARJI|3.0|The controller's that reached me had defects on the rod. The skin is off so the inside plastic goes bare. It does not harm game experience too much but I would still like a newer one.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but found that Mitch is becoming just too casual in killing. In addition, the thought that everyone in the world, including the President, is afraid of him is just carrying things a little too far.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I rarely play tablet games, but this one I have downloaded to my Kindle Fire HD and it has been addicting.
0547884591|5.0|Randy Pausch began \\"The Last Lecture\\" telling his audience there would be two headfakes. At the end of his lecture, Randy let the audience in on the two secrets: 1) the lecture wasn't about making dreams come true as much as it was a depiction of how to life one's life, and 2) the lecturer wasn't for the viewers, it was for his kids.<br /><br />Years back, Tim Ferriss quoted Randy on his blog, writing, \\"We don't beat the Reaper by living longer. We beat the Reaper by living well.\\" The 4-Hour Chef upholds Randy's creed to live well. Instead of praising The 4-Hour Chef for its a) beautiful presentation, b) superbly simple and delicious recipes, and c) actionable approach to learning, this review will speak to the meta-intentions of this book.<br /><br />The recent presidential election focused predominantly on the economy/job creation and healthcare. Behind each of these political issues are real people, voting everyday with their work, purchases, and food choices. Like Randy, Tim has presented his readers with two headfakes. The first headfake: the book isn't about cooking well, it is about eating well. By enabling readers to eat healthy AND tasty food, Ferriss provides a platform to begin health reform at the individual level. Furthermore, on its opening pages, the 4HC presents a goal of changing America's food landscape from one of manufactured, corporatized food production to sustainable agriculture practices. The second headfake: the book isn't about learning anything, it is about learning something. Ferriss systematically deconstructs the learning process and provides readers the tools to efficiently acquire the tools the desire. Ferriss, an open supporter of a Liberal Arts education, understands that when a concrete understanding of skill acquisition meets individual passions, individuals will combine their talents with their interests to gain, create, and improve their employment situation.<br /><br />While Ferriss jokes that he has entered the Fourteenth Minute of his Fifteen Minutes of Fame (FMOF), the 4HC showcases why Ferriss will be relevant for years to come. Quite simply, the 4HC is the definitive (and incredibly enjoyable!) manifesto on how to enjoy individual success while enacting change on the world whole.<br /><br />P.S. - I live two blocks from Central Kitchen in SF, and there is no doubt Ferriss knows food!!! Thank you Tim
B006OOHYIC|5.0|One of the best app to play when you have spare  time.  Wish it was longer;hoping another will follow.  I like this one even more than the first.
B00503BN1M|1.0|I hated everything about this movie and I am amazed Natalie Portman is in this type of movie.  Raunchy, immature, idiotic humor, I had to stop it when she decided to have sex with Ashton after he woke up from a night of blackout drinking.  Who the heck would do that, I have no idea.  Frat party scenes, talk of oral sex, the humor couldn't get any lower. Do not waste an moment on this movie, no wonder it is free to rent on amazon.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I purchased this game for my toddler's tablet for Christmas and ended up playing it myself.  It is a fun game to play to kill time. My daughter loves bubbles so I'm sure she will enjoy it too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|AS usual Vince Flynn has exceeded expectations with this new novel. It held my interest as I rushed to the end of the book. Now I'll have to wait a year the next book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|absolutely great books!  i rushed through all 3 of them bc they were so hard to put down!  great story
B004W2UBYW|3.0|As someone who knew very little about the individual, I thought this might be an opportunity to learn more. What I am discovering was a deeply disturbing look at someone who had very little in the way of true empathy for his fellow man. Someone who was a great showman and carny but who profited from the hard work and ingenuity of others.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Of course we'd seen it on PBS but it was so good! Not only outstanding actors perfectly cast and a beautiful production (location, costumes, everything was perfection) but the writing was excellent too. Enjoyed watching it again. Saw things we hadn't seen before. We'll undoubtedly watch it again and order the next season when it becomes available.
B003MU9D0S|5.0|Garth Nix's \\"Sabriel\\" introduces us to an intriguing and highly original world. The characters are full and the plot diverting. I tend to be a little cautious about reading books that I can tell will need some world building but the exposition felt seamless and in no way detracted from the pacing of the novel.<br /><br />In my opinion Sabriel is a perfectly suitable book to be read by young adults but it is equally engaging for older audiences.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|This movie is sad, sweet and heartwarming. It's so awesome to see Zach G. in a role that isn't straight up comedy. He does a great job. Everyone in this family loves this movie!
0345803493|1.0|read the first one which I thought was very poorly written - the author has certainly received her money in a didfferent way have not read any since that one as I did not enjoy it and have more to doith my time and reading than to read any of her books thanks waste of money
B0096DZKZC|4.0|I have had no problems with the purchase and quality, so it's all good. I would recommend it to anyone i know.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What can I say they always come out with something of great interests and I love this and all in one complete collection. The woman in my life will love this! So will you! Thanks!
B00005R24K|5.0|i saw the army of darkness many years ago and had heard of the eveil dead from several sources. as a bruce campbell fan i had to have it for my library.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a wonderful family movie!  My 4 year old did get a little frightened with the thought of his mommy turning into a bear but overall we loved the movie!
B0024FADDI|5.0|i saw the movie many years ago and could not pass up the chance to add it to my library.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|SIddhartha is a good, quick read for those who like the bildungsroman (coming of age/growth story) genre. It follows the life of Siddhartha as he grows and reaches spiritual enlightenment. The story reflects many of the ideas of Buddhism and its founder Siddhartha Gautama. It follows his journeys throughout life and outlines the spiritual struggles he went through on his way to enlightenment. Overall a fun, quick, and enlightening read.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I have to admit I almost gave up on this book when I first started to read it. I felt like quite a bit of background information was given unnecessarily. But, once you get into the second part of the book things pick up. It was still a slow read, but it was very fascinating.
B000VZKMSO|5.0|Kanye has produced another great album. It has a good mix of both mature and fun songs from one of the greatest rappers of our time. While not quite as good as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Graduation is still an excellent album with a number of hits.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Really keeps the reader involved. You will not put it down till you have finished the read. I own them all - this one is right at the top of the action.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child and now I am passing it on to my niece for Christmas.... It was actually on her list!
141659521X|5.0|for some reason, this was my favorite Rapp novels, maybe of all novels.  complex, interesting plot.  affs some depth to kennedy and Rapp.  all in all, really excellent read
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|just like title said it does exactly that and it creates adds witch are stupid DONT GET IT i will say it again DONT GET I T!!!!!:/
B0034G4P8A|5.0|For me it is a good movie, but also for me all the Marvel's films are. I had to have this one for my collection and it was at a vwery good price. Here in Chile, the Blu-ray is still expensive.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing this game as a child and loved it then so when I saw it avaiable again this time for kindle I knew I had to have it. Though it has been updated to the technology avaiable in the 21 century I feel it still holds much of its origional charm. I find my sefl not wanting to put it down and a bit dissapointed that you can run out of energy.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!  Easy play, good graphics, challenging puzzles.<br />Worth it at twice the price!<br />Can't wait for more levels. Maybe a level editor?<br />Thanks!
0810989956|5.0|This is a fun book for my daughter.  She gets to actually fill it out for herself.  It helps because it has questions for her to answer.  It is not just a blank book.  It will be interesting for her to go back in a few years and read what she has written now.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This author has a flair for tying together today's politics, heroism and evil in a story that is intriguing and yet can be interpreted as coming from a conglomeration of many actual events that can occur in &#34;actions&#34; like Afghanistan, etc. The plot can be imagined as a real event but one that somehow also seems surreal. Sometimes this type of story makes you really wonder whether &#34;truth can be stranger than fiction&#34;. The novel is a good read and kept my interest throughout. The finish is fast and closes out quickly without a long drawn out ending.
1933308087|5.0|I am Rob's wife and wanted to write this review. This book is marvelous eye candy to look through and so much indispensable information.  What a wonderful resource for piecers!  Lots of history, drafting instruction and beautiful examples of all the blocks in full color.  Cleverly divided into subsections with helpful, quick to find groups.  Jinny Beyer is a treasure and she really knocked it out of the park with this book!
B005OJTVMK|3.0|It's okay.  Does the job and looks exactly like its picture.  Just not very exciting. Easily fits on kindle white
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|incredible, just incredible. The lyrics from Victoria flow like a musical instrument  This CD has become one of my favorites. I couldn't count the number of times I've played it.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is a timeless classic. Most definitely the best Christmas story of all time. The miracle of Christ's work on the dreadful Scrooge. Everyone should read this at least once.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie was very emotional, funny and sad. Actors did a good job on playing their parts in a way to keep you interested.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is a great story. I am a huge fan of Stephen King novels and if you enjoy horror stories with a twist of culture, this is perfect.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Have always been a fan of Grisham and wasn't disappointed in his latest novel. It kept you guessing right up until the end and you weren't sure where your sympathy should lie with each character introduced.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After seeing the movie I HAD to read the books. I enjoyed the first book the most. The other two were still good though. The ending  was not how I imagined it would be.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I love this timer and use it daily for yoga and meditation.  It is terrific.  I particularly like the fact that within a timed session (say 60 minutes), you can have interval bells set with a different chime or different number of bells, perfect for timed poses, or if you want an idea of how long you have been holding headstand: i.e., I have a 5 minute timer with one minute interval bells so I know how long I have held the position while still in the pose).  My main functionality improvement suggestion would be to offer a optional count up feature after the the timer has stopped (useful if you are inspired to sit longer in meditation or hold a pose longer, etc., but want to know how much additional time you were in position).  That said, it does what it promises to do and is v functional.  Highly recommend.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I LOVED this book. I have yet to read a book of Sophie Kinsella's that I didn't like. This book made me laugh and cry
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag free with my purchase of a Nikon D7000, but $30 this bag still worth buying.  Seems to be well made and doesn't weigh much.  It will be great to use for anyone that likes to carry multiple lens.
B0086700CM|5.0|The game is really addicting since you keep playjng to get a high score. I know you love the feeling of beating those demonized monkeys and getting different characters cauee I do.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing! Love every minute of these books! Still wish she and Gale were together though. Hope there's another sometime soon!
B008CIUS72|1.0|I've been trying to get something on my Android tablet that will let me watch Amazon Instant Video, but it says my tablet doesn't support flash and this is supposed to be the same thing.  It won't load onto my tablet either. If anyone knows what I have to do to watch videos on my tablet, I would appreciate a word.
1401235417|5.0|i like the new 52, i cant wait for next volume of comics and the art was pretty good too
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I love the premise and the writiing make it believable.  The characters are well developed throughout the stories.  Samantha Carter is my favorite character.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This 3 disc set is amazing. It really is a great movie and the Blu ray is just great. I have seen this several times and am always amazed by the quality and movie.
B000C13Y2S|3.0|Well when it arrived it was a little smaller than I had imagined. I guess for its size the light ourput is ok. Its more of a novelty than a serious mini flashlight. My wife thought it was a cute little thing so now its on her keychain.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Great story.........,, it can be alittleboring at times but it makes a great point in which what our society could become one day. And it is starting now
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The lorax is a great movie I thank Danny Devito did a fine job as the lorax. I would recommend the movie to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|omg the game the game is do awesome like forreal. I luv it so much.I think everyone should play angry birds.
B007HACDLK|4.0|as usual, a fast paced read. Thoroughly entertaining. If only Mitch Rapp really existed..(or maybe he does!). looking forward to the next book from Vince Flynn.
1451627289|4.0|History is a great subject for \\"what if?\\" discussions, and I'm sure there have been plenty around the subject of President Kennedy's assassination.  While it's impossible to know exactly how things would turn out if Kennedy wasn't killed, Stephen King takes a stab at it.<br /><br />While this is a bit different than many of King's other works in that it's not a horror story, his powers of description (especially when it comes to the workings of the human body) are still in top form.  Jake Epping is given the opportunity to travel back in time and stop the Kennedy assassination, but the time travel takes him to 1958.  So he has five years in a very different America to get ready for one point in time...and to hope he doesn't screw things up.  Five years is a long time to plan something, and life is what happens while you're busy making plans.  I'm not going to spill the beans here, but complications in various forms arise because the past doesn't want to be changed.<br /><br />The book is a good read, and a bit of a history lesson in some parts.  When I was finished, the question which came to mind wasn't whether or not I would change the past if given the chance, but whether or not I should.  Read this book and you'll probably feel the same way.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|Let me preface by saying I'm a life-long Asia fan and pretty much pick up anything I can get my hands on and see them anytime they come through town.  I've loved all of their studio recordings (including the Payne years), however, their live recordings have really been hit and miss for me.  Though the performances have typically been top notch,some of their live releases haven't been that good.<br /><br />Resonance is outstanding.  In my opinion, it is the best live recording Asia have ever released.  It is crystal clear and the individual members shine during the performance.  The instrumental balance is good and the engery is great.  Wetton sounds fantastic (which has not always been the case for him on live recordings).  The arrangements are pretty true to the originals, so the ear finds some comfort in familiarity and yet there is enough nuance to hold attention.<br /><br />I believe that someone took his time and really cleaned this one up for release because it really is that much better than some of the earlier live recordings.  Keep in mind that Asia has pumped in certain sounds, sequencing and background vocal textures into their live performances to flesh out the sound a bit.  Downes has always been good at this kind of thing.  It matters little in concert because what you see happening instrumentally is very good anyway.  I bring this up simply as a note because on this recording such textures and background vocals are so much clearer than they have been in the concert venue.  It's not a bad thing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|A great, refreshing series for zombie fans. All good from the walking dead, I strongly recommend the series, not for the little ones though
B00881VLCE|5.0|love it! this is such a relaxing game! also a lot of the puzzles are free. I hate the minimum number of letters for a review.
0061537969|5.0|I can't really describe what reading this book did to me.  The feeling was visceral and deep inside my body.  I am a dog lover and I have had dogs as part of my life for many years, and it never ceases to amaze me what joy they bring to a family!  As I read this book about Enzo, I thought of every dog I've ever had, and put each of them in Enzo's place as I read.  I know that each of them had thoughts, dreams and emotions just as Enzo did.  The book though is more than just a celebration of dogs.  It's about life, tragedy, hope, love and death.  And Denny, Enzo's master is a wonderful fictional creation.  He is three-dimensional, and even more so because we see him through the eyes of a wonderful dog who loves him unconditionally.  It's been a long while since a book has brought tears to my eyes, but this book did-many times.  I know that I will carry Enzo and Denny around with me for a long time.  The book has enriched my life, and I think that everyone who loves dogs should read it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|great movie and could not find it in stores so it was much easier to order it on line fast and easy
B001EBWING|5.0|I wasn't  sure what to expect with the quality on digital format. Pleasantly surprised. Also i recommend amazons instant video to any college student taking a film class. They always have the movies I need and i didn't have ti leave my desk to get them.
1615470158|5.0|Woohoo!<br /><br />Just received mine today, great first impression overall.<br />The big fonts are welcomed as they relax my excel-strained eyes.<br /><br />I am about to dive in... Will comment on content later on.<br />Thanks Rob for the time and efforts you put into it.<br />Bye
B004LQJPEG|4.0|As a procrastinator I tend to forget the movies I needed to watch for my film class. Amazon came through ans was able to deliver a good quality movie and a great story. I was unaware how good the chase scene is until I was sucked in to the plot. Great motifs throughout the movie and the finale was really unexpected. If you love older movies and have missed this one pick it for a rental.
B009DLYSTG|2.0|These aren't the greatest rockers they've ever written, but they're also not bad at all for a bunch of elderly gentlemen.  It's also great to hear Steven Tyler sing in a lower register again instead of just shrieking.  The first two or three songs are in fact downright fantastic.  But good god do the ballads stink.  And they comprise a full third of the CD!  It's possible to write a great ballad -- \\"Dream On\\" was basically a ballad, remember.  \\"Seasons of Wither\\" and \\"You See Me Crying\\" were terrific songs too.  But this is just generic \\"Crazy\\"/\\"Amazing\\"/\\"Crying\\"-alike garbage, as if Stephen truly came to believe that the garbage music he heard on American Idol had true artistic value.  It's a real shame.  They really stink up an otherwise not-bad-at-all rock and roll record.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Watched it 5 times so decided just to buy the movie.  Great movie to watch with the kids &#34;modern musical.&#34;  Very clever plot using songs adults remember from the past.  Highly recommend and I'm extremely picky about movies!
B0091LS07E|3.0|And I'm super glad I didn't run out and buy it like I could have. Instead I listened on Spotify for free (it'll put a little change in her pocket for listening to her album anyway so I guess I did my part). Alicia's best CD is 2007's \\"As I Am\\" although the 3 CDs (including her live CD) before it were good too. 2009's \\"The Element Of Freedom\\" was OK but this CD is a mess. She tried to experiment too much and most of it didn't pay off. The songs come off as mostly average or boring. I can't say that she is one that I can trust for quality music from now on like in the past. Where are the songs like \\"Empire State Of Mind (Pt. II) Broken Down\\" that had quality, heart and spark? Where is the piano that was bountiful in her first 3 outings?? It's mostly absent here in a lot of these songs. She just changed things too much and I don't think it works for our dear Alicia. At least \\"The Element Of Freedom\\" had \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\", \\"Empire State Of Mind (Broken Down)\\", \\"Distance And Time\\" and \\"How It Feels To Fly\\". Even \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" was more Alicia than most of these songs present on \\"Girl On Fire\\". Her worst work to date easily.<br /><br />3 stars.
B00377V6J2|5.0|This was the very first time that  I have heard this and I felt like I've missed a piece of history. I am simply amazed of the magic that each artist brought to this. It is a MUST for all SRV and AK following. Thank you for this piece of musical history.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|I've pushed this CPU through a lot in the past year. Hundreds of hours worth of rendering high-def video and live compression. It is possible to OC this to an extent but if you are a real speed demon, spring for the [[ASIN:B004EBUXHQ Intel Core i5-2500K Quad-Core Processor 3.3 GHz 6 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80623I52500K]], which is about the same price. Not like you will need to OC it - you'll likely be bottle-necked by another comportment in your PC. I love this CPU and I highly recommend it.
B004624N6K|4.0|I love all her albums... this one is not the best but I like it though. The price was unbeatable.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|Though I'm sure everyone has heard this story, it is a great reminder of what Christmas should be. Even better this time.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Excellent!  I wish every family in the world would watch this movie - and mimick it.  And young boys should be made to watch it and chose to follow it for their own passage to manhood.  SO many good lessons in here, as well as just a really excellent movie.  If every family had this kind of dedication to each other....
B00A77II0U|5.0|best game I have played on my fire! great graphics and no glitches gameplay. good length an interesting stroyline. great deal!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was not sure I could read a book about war. Mr Kyle was able to give just enough detail for me to in vision the horrors of war but not the gruesome realities we all know are there, then saying something that would make me laugh out loud.  Pure Texan.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought one of these for myself a year ago and it still looks great.  I use my kindle a lot and turn back the cover while reading and the binding still looks good.  I bought this one for my son.  I wish it had a place to hold the stylus but thats' minor
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Bottom line if you like gladiator,Troy,and 300 you will enjoy this movie as well. Kinda has a clash of the titans feel.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The blu-ray was perfect all the songs were great but i wouldve liked to see a bit longer Whole Lotta Love with improv lyrics thrown in like the older versions other than that i was very impressed. Some didnt like the camera work i didnt understand the need to turn the picture grainy for effect every so often but it was well worth the amazon purchase.
B004SBQALA|5.0|If you like xmen type movies and alien movies you will like this one it has a great story keeps you into it till the action comes in.
0307730697|5.0|This is an inspiring story, this book is a must read! Adam Brown and the men and women in uniform are true American Heroes! I could not put the book down once I started reading and was amazed at the drive and honor these men of the Navy SEAL Teams share. Thank you for everything you have sacrificed and done for US!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|After watching this i had to buy the sound track. it was great tom Cruis is a very good rock star.
B000W967KQ|5.0|What Donald Trump says is true! Animals kill for food, people kill for sport! Realize that people will try to take advantage of you! This book was very helpful in Donald Trump is a good closer. In life don't look for trouble but when trouble looks for you sometimes you have to protect your assets! Anyway this is a very good read! I recommend it! Good job! Well done Mr. Trump!
B009VB97EY|3.0|if your watching it for the eye candy its there, but you saw most of it in the previews. if your wanting a good story it follows the out line of every rom com you have ever watched. its good if your not expecting it to be the life altering movie, i wouldn't buy it but def worth the rental
B009329Y30|5.0|I gave The Lucky One five stars because it is truly enjoyable.  Movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels are hit and miss in my experience, but The Lucky One is definitely a hit!  The casting is strong and smart (from Blythe Danner to Zac Efron to young Riley Thomas Stewart.)  The story is well-crafted, setting is absolutely breathtaking and the acting is wonderful.  I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you have ever been familiar with someone who has served in the military.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|i was amazingly surprised by this tv show, so much so that ive bought season one 4 times for other ppl as gifts. an amazing story line rivaling 24
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great album. As an avid ELO and Jeff Lynne fan, I thought this album was awesome. Not sure why Jeff needed to return to this hits and re-polish them. But as usual he did a great job
B009NQKPUW|5.0|it was a very well made movie. kind of a prequel but a good stand alone. was a must have for my collection
B0083GOPSG|1.0|My friend and I made my wife and his wife watches movie. We told him that it would be good, and it looked really interesting in the previews. I think that we were a little wrong, and I feel bad for making our wives watch this movie. It was definitely not worth the money. The camera shots were horrible, and the plot just was not there. They could've made this movie so much better, but it is a major flop. Do not watch this it's not worth your time.
B004X75RK4|4.0|its a rom com, of which im addicted to. cute funny movie no real surprises, but that's not why your wanting to watch it is it ?
B008JAG9BW|4.0|We watch this movie a few weeks ago, and my wife and I found it fairly funny. There were parts that really weren't that great, but there were parts where we were really laughing. It's been a while since I saw the other movies, so it's hard to compare them. However, I think that this movie was actually fairly decent.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|Game is worth $10 but not $15.  Fun to play.  Hours of fun.  Still have a lot more to play on it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I looked through various versions of Jane Eyer and they seemed either superficial or commercial. This version is a JOY! Beautifully done, with amazing acting and takes the time to give justice to the amazing book.
B00A5052YE|5.0|2nd best album ever or first it's debatable ! I love alicia keys and this is classic r&b / soul! I can't stop listening to it and it's been 2 days of straight of repeating the album. the songs don't get old or repetitive !
B005FPT51K|5.0|I like think it is good and I like to watch from anywhere and it has good quality I would by it a gen.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I understand its not ad free but it puts the same dumb train advertisement I said no and it still came up if I say no I mean no not ask me again other than that its very fun
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very much like the fame I played in the casino on the ship. I enjoy it on my kindle just as much. It'salkt less expensive too!-
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King takes the reader back to the 50's and 60's as a character wrestles with the prospect of re-writing history.  King, again delivers likable characters and an epic task.
B0053TWW1I|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.....thanks for shipping it to me at such a fast pace. I do plan on ordering more movies from you soon! this movie was in such a great condition! Thanks Again!!!!! :)
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game as much as, if not more than, the original black and white. I love the challenge and the feeling of having created something. I can spend hours on the puzzles and I don't even feel like I wasted time. The only drawback for me is that I need a stylus to get the correct square filled on some of the larger puzzles. I love that I can \\"zoom \\" them in, but then I can't see the whole puzzle at once. Very minor inconvenience in an overall great game.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This game is fun but it always stops on me. i mean bakery story is funner and you can make way more stuff for shorter time. i talked my sister and cousin into getting it and they said they would rather play bakery story. it's fun but not my fav. and WHY DOES IT NEED TO HAVE INTERNET??!??
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun!! Best of all it is free! I love it. It is very addicting though.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I can watch it again and again.  Titanic still holds fascination with people today, movie brings the whole thing to life, with a nice story too.
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is a book for anyone who is interested in self improvement of almost any kind. I am a university student and I have used many of the skill deconstruction methods to learn my course material, ace my midterms (and hopefully exams) and come home to cook a delicious dinner, much to my roommates surprise. I definitely recommend giving it a read!
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Aerosmith are done. But to be fair they have been done for along time. This album is a joke. The music on this album isn't  even a shadow of the music they once created.<br /><br />To advertise this as a return to their 70s roots is an insult to all Aerosmith fans. Douglas didn't even produce the whole thing. 6 songs are ballads!!! and they are not even good ballads. Everyone of them is trying to be another version of \\"I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\\".<br /><br />They just do not seem to sound like a band anymore. I can tell Steven had the final word on this album and the rest of the band were along for the ride. Carrie Underwood says it all. The fact that she is a guest on this album makes me crazy! I knew the writing was on the wall when Steven decided to judge Idol.<br /><br />If you are big fan of late 80s or 90s Aerosmith. This album still doesn't please. It's just a train wreak. There is nothing more I can say
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|The CD is very nice! He always bring it home with his sexy self! Keep doing what you do in having all the ladies wanting your body!
1574214276|5.0|An excellent book for the tangler who wants to have easy instructions in drawing the many different Zentangles.<br />Highly recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very suspenseful.....keeps your guessing throughout the entire book as you can't perdict what is going to happen next.  I am more than half way through and have loved it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This well written book was an interesting read and will be the most unbiased account of what really happened on that glorious night.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I love this series, yes, Downton Abbey is great too, but Upstairs Downstairs deals with different times and I think the series complement each other. Amazing acting, just loved everything about it!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|PTX is doing things that I have never heard before. I enjoyed their music on the Sing Off and I'm loving it now! I hope they continue to make more music and put out more albums. This is my favorite Christmas CD.
B004LFO0FG|5.0|I love Britney Spears!!!!! But this is a great album I was so glad she got better! And made this Great album!!!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Came in perfect condition. I love this movie more than anything. If you don't have it get this right now.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It was easy to download and my 5 year old grandson loved the games. He had never played this game before but it was easy for him to figure it out.
B009Y6OIWC|5.0|I tried out the beta/free version of this calendar on my Samsung Galaxy SIII phone. This app gave me what I wanted, an easy to use calendar with a few extra bells and whistles and no learning curve.  I have now installed the paid version on my Kindle Fire HD 7\\" and it is running fine.  The two sync via my Google calendar.  I'd like to have more colors to assign to tasks and events and it looks like that is in the R&D stage and may follow soon.  My favorite feature is the Birthdays list.  By entering their birth year I can see how old my family and friends are each birthday or if it's my Mom and Dad's 59th Wedding Anniversary or 60th.  Ya got to keep track of these important milestones!  Over all, I'm very happy with this calendar app.  Thank you!
B004SDEP38|1.0|i is  not a good app. documents to to go is stupid i hate it. dont get it its not ok. i love lots of things but this no way.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I love the idea of a world that wastes away because the people are too interested in an online virtual reality game and this book really brought that idea to life.
B001NLL93W|4.0|[[ASIN:1416972250 City of Glass (Mortal Instruments)]] This book will grab you from the beginning and take you all the way to the end.  Excellent writing gives fantastic characters that leaving you wanting more.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's hard to get an 8 year old to pay attention to much, but this kept my 3rd grader engaged for a long train trip. Keeping her away from watching TV has been a challenge so this was a welcome change.
B005LAII12|1.0|This would have to be the worst movie I have ever seen.  Not funny in the slightest.  I turned it off at Flash Gordon.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|My best friend's mom lent me a copy of Sabriel when I was in the 8th grade. This was the first (and only book so far) that I read all the way through, closed the book, then immediately opened it again and started it over. Fun fact: I have read this book close to 15 times.<br /><br />This is one book I won't spoil in the review...<br /><br />The world building and the mythology used/created is just fascinating. Without getting too spoiler-y (shush, I'm pretending it's a real word) the basic story is Sabriel's father goes missing and she has to use the lessons he has taught her to search for him. The problem is, she is a necromancer and to find him she may have to go into Death.<br /><br />It is a phenomenal read and a great Fantasy novel topic that hasn't been used a million times.<br /><br />Now, I have to go read it again.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss has packed so much info in to this book it is incredible. However, I think the title is somewhat misleading. This isn't really a cookbook and there's limited info about being a chef. Instead, this book is the third installment of what I would call a \\"braindump of interesting things that Tim Ferriss has been working on or thinking about...\\"<br /><br />It jumps from kitchen gear to outdoor survival tips to language learning techniques. Super random but also super cool.
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille is my favorite fiction author.  I always look forward to his latest novel.  His topics are timely and his research is exhaustive.  His character, John Corey, is the funniest assassin I've ever met.  His &#34;aside&#34; comments are hilarious.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great app! It has a lot of cool effects and the editing tools are wonderful. It's a lot of fun to play around with as well as doing some serious editing. They also have a \\"meme\\" maker which is totally awesome. I think it was definitely worth the money. This is an excellent photo editing app! I'm definitely going to be recommending it to everyone.
B0073O8BOS|4.0|Don't expect much else from gritty rock riffs and the lyrical hooks. You should have fun if you like rock and roll. I'm pleased with it.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love most of Sophie Kinsella's books and I was worried this one would disappoint me but it did not. Poppy starts out as a starry-eyed girl who is ignoring various situations in her life. After various eye-opening experiences and entertaining adventures she begins to confront the reality of her life, her fiance, etc. She becomes more and more &#34;real&#34; shall we say and in the end has some difficult decisions to make! But she comes out on top with a happy ending.....worth reading!
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|I bought this album solely for Nights in White Satin. Love the entire thing. Planning to buy it on vinyl soon.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I rank this 4th in my list of Vince Flynns  books.  Number 1 was American Assisan, secont was kill shout and third is his Consent to Kill. However, with all his Mitch Rapp books it is only  a small degree that separates the best of the best.
B0087ZG7HK|3.0|The DVD was great, but there are no extras at all on this disc, which was kind of a let-down, considering.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This is my all time favorite program. I have watched every program and look forward to viewing season 8. The character personality dynamics are intriguing and fun.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|Being a British product, It's difficult for me to determine whether it's the writing or directing thats the problem. The actors seem to be doing their best and for the most part are good in their roles. But their's just something either in the directing or writing that prevents this program from being as good as it could be. Sorry Torchwood, I wont be buying a second season.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great time wasting game.  Easy to play and understand.  Still working on unlocking the rest of the content but all in all a fun game.  The puzzle pieces take forever to drop.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle and Becket play off each other well.The story line remains interesting. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic fit their roles perfectly. The writers are giving Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas more chances to show what they got. The boys deliver. They are good and getting better. Alexis is always a delight, and is mom the diva/actress. Between them they  always keep Castle on his toes. All in all this program is well worth watching. Nathan needs to exercise a little more, he's getting a bit chubby. Probably the hazard of being the star of a hit program. No time to exercise. Looking forward to season five.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|The Lorax has quickly become one of our family favorites. Great story and music. Love the colorful imagery in Thneedville!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|chbosky is a genius. couldn't put it down. disturbing yet passionately eloquent. the movie is almost just as good! a true must read.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran makes the reader think hard about a lot of things that have taken place and continue to take place in today's world without hitting us over the head with them.  I laughed out loud many, many times which felt really good.  I also said out loud words like &#34;SO TRUE!&#34; and &#34;WOW.&#34;  I think this book would be especially funny if you have a British background as I do, however, her message which is basically that anyone who IS a woman, GAVE BIRTH to a woman, is MARRIED to or in a RELATIONSHIP with a women, WORKS with women, or SHARES A PLANET with women should consider him or herself a feminist.  IT'S A GOOOOOOD THING.  I wish Caitlin Moran lived next door to me...
0385344333|3.0|I'm a major Reacher Creature. Check the name and the photo. I'm not kidding. I've been to meet him at book signings and have read all of his books. I was one of the sad souls who discovered him right after The Killing Floor and have had to wait a year for each new book to come out. That said, A Wanted Man is clearly in the bottom 1/3 of Child's canon. The rote Reacher mental observances and permutations just seem tired and strained here. We spend way too much time in cars driving around doing nothing and way to much time in hotel rooms doing nothing and way too much time sitting, standing, musing over nothing. The heart of the story is one of the weaker plot lines Child has built as well. The old-war bunker with what may or may not be terrible biological weaponry tied to a local murder. Sounds okay. Didn't work out that way. The normal wink, wink of law keepers looking the other way also stretched my patience in this volume. There is an utterly preposterous exchange in a night time car ride that I won't spoil, but it involves a lot of blinking and mental leaps that professors at MIT with computer processors couldn't reach. It's not all bad. It's still Reacher, and Child has a way of making this guy interesting no matter the circumstances. There are still some brief forays into bums getting jacked up by Jack, but they're scarce and, in their brevity and infrequency, are unfulfilling. This is one of, if not my very, least favorite of Child's books. Here's rooting for next year.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Fantastic!! Can't wait for next year.<br />Felt so bad for Joan this season, wonder what is in store for Peggy in season six.
0399157565|2.0|I finally gave up on reading page after page of people being nasty to Kay...the characters have turned into clichés and have gotten downright boring...never liked \\"Lucy\\" anyway, since I can't get any sympathy going to a character so narcissistic and unempathetic. (hmmm is that a word???)<br />I really feel the Cornwell books have been going down the drain for a while.  The last two have been a hard read and I started reading her with such delight!
0307960471|5.0|The 9th Harry Hole, but is it the last? How can it be with loose ends hanging, i.e., Oleg and Mikael still running around? Great book, as were all the others that I read, which does not include the first two not yet translated, The Bat and The Cockroaches. (Had to buy the Queen's English version of The Redeemer.) Some have said that the plot is too hard to follow. I say that maybe these books are for those who have a little more intelligence than normal.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I wasn't sure I would enjoy this game, I'm a big Angry Birds fan. But, this won me over. It's different and I have found it's my go to game now.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|I cant say that this CD is bad in anyway its an alright CD but I was just expecting a better CD. It seems every few CDS the Killers like to change there style. There is only one or two songs on this CD that sound like they come from them, the other ones are very slow and pretty mellow which is alright except i was expecting a blow your mind CD and it just didnt happen with this one for me.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Didn't take long to read. Enjoyed the story. Kept my attention and would recomend it to others who like a quick read that is satisfying.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I had high expectations for their new album and when i got it i was not disappointed at all. Its got the perfect mix of nice upbeat songs as well as some slower more mellow songs. Cant find a song on the CD that i dont like/dont want to hear over and over again!
1451696191|5.0|The book was in pristine condition and shipped somewhat fast. Of course the story is beautiful and one you can read over and over. This is one of my favorite books and have no regrets with this purchase
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great price for the whole first season of the Walking Dead! Perfect gift for the zombie lover in the family.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|And I agree with all the reviews.  It's a so-so movie.  Not terrible but I would not recommend it unless you're really curious about it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy to use. Must have app for any kindle fire user! I have tried other calculator apps and none compare.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I enjoyed the different sort of Snow White character as well as the Huntsman.  Not a super movie, but it was enjoyable!
B0088P2A7A|3.0|Frankly, I end up using the web browser more often than I use Wikipedia app. It's just easier to click on the link in google than to go open another app. Still, it's free and doesn't take up much space.
1439152802|4.0|Kate Morton's latest novel \\"The Secret Keeper\\" opens in 1961, where 16 year old Laurel witnesses her mother, Dorothy, commit a horrible crime that her family then decides to sweep under the carpet.  50 years later, Dorothy is dying and Laurel decides she wants to understand her mother's motives all those years ago.  As she pulls at the yarn of her mother's story, she will learn more than expected about the past.<br /><br />This was another good read from Kate Morton.  Like her earlier works, the Secret Keeper tells a complex family history, with lots of rich characters with interwoven lives.  I like how the characters form the central core of the story, and that their lives still go on the extraordinary time that was the Blitz in London.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed this novel, I do think that it was a bit weaker than some of Morton's earlier work.  The characters set in the modern day felt flat and almost unnecessary at times.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love this app but ... its the free version and I would love to see the paid version! It has never asked me to get the paid version but it might have to some people. I really like this calculator. Great fot math homework!!
B0020PJJHS|5.0|It's true that Sean Connery is my one and only Bond, but this film is a great Bond romp, and hugely enjoyable by moms and their sons.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Does this The Dark Knight Trilogy come with UV Digital Copy? I just know the other version comes it, can someone answer this question for me please?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is always good, if you like legal thrillers.  I would recommend this.  Maybe not his best, but still worth the money.
0425263908|5.0|I read both of the books released so far in the series in two days. The love story is so enthralling it was nearly impossible to put the books down. I can not wait for the next book to come out May 2013.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a wonderful adaptation from the book. Like all books made into movies, it missed a few key moments from the book but what they did work with was great. I loved this movie and can't wait to see the rest of the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read both of the books released so far in the series in two days. The love story is so enthralling it was nearly impossible to put the books down. I can not wait for the next book to come out May 2013.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Who knew the classics could be so entertaining! I enjoyed the warring families, showing not all the old times as wonderful.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|It was very easy to download and watch. I love the show and this was definitely a great season to watch.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|There was so much hype about this movie before it came out that my expectations were very high.  While this was a very good movie, I wouldn't spend the pre-order monies again.  I love horses so almost anything with them is interesting.
B00826B65M|1.0|Unable to download this purchase from my McBook to my iPhone!!!  And unable to find any way to get help!!!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This should be a try before buy app.  After downloading and installing it, it instantly brought my HTC Thunderbolt (a 4G LTE phone) to a stuttering slow-down, and I never even made contact with my LAN.  I can only imagine what it would do after I made a connection.  I gave it a try though.  But it kept restarting my Thunderbolt and I was never able to make contact with my computer through my LAN (protected by a Netgear router).  As soon as I uninstalled it all was well again.  If this app was supposed to retain phone speeds without encryption, a dangerous prospect, I'd hate to see what encrypted apps do.  Save your money.<br /><br />URGENT UPDATE!  I add this update minutes after my original review.  After uninstalling the app from my cell phone, and not being able to get a refund, I decided to give the app a chance on my Kindle Fire since the companion Splashtop streamer was still installed on my computer.  As usual, the download process from Amazon to my Kindle was easy and the app then found my computer automatically and right away.  But then I entered the code to connect and things happened fast.  I use three monitors and within seconds, MY THIRD MONITOR PICTURE WAS CORRUPTED, AND ALL MY MAIN SCREEN GADGETS AND PROGRAM SHORTCUTS WERE RE-ARRANGED (and I have over 30).  A RESTART CORRECTED THE THIRD MONITOR PICTURE, BUT THE GADGETS AND ICONS WERE STILL ALL SCREWED UP.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!<br /><br />FYI Update:  Just ran a registry cleaner after deleting Splashtop from my computer and the Splashtop Streamer leaves about six registry entries behind after the uninstall process.  If you're going to use or try it anyway - best of luck.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Read the entire book in 2 days.  I love how honest she was about everything.  It is hard for someone to imagine this actually happening.
B00846REIS|4.0|Almost a line for line of Fifty Shades, but a good read all around.  I'm into it enough to read the next book and learn more about the characters past. Hopefully it strays away from the fifty shades story
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read these books because all my friends loved them.  They are so/so at best.  Not really much else to say.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|this was a waste of time and effort. I think she's more interested in being a model than a country singer. she needs to go back to the drawing board.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an amazing show.  I loved Season 2 but thought it was a little slower, but Season 3 is packed with intense moments.  There is a good reason why this is one of the top rated cable TV shows!<br /><br />See for yourself:  [...]
B003O86FMW|5.0|Complex, engaging, emotional, while still keeping your mind transfixed on the subtle horror and social disparities in this seemingly transverse world. Katniss is an amazingly well developed character, one who inspires and challenges something to dark to comprehend.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Always loved Alicia Keys.  Thought after a 2 year break, raising her child, her new CD would be good.  It's not good, it's AMAZING.  You can feel her love for her music and lyrics will never die.  Have also watched previews on You Tube, this is not someone just putting out a new CD.  Thank you Alicia for your amazing voice, music and most importantly - lyrics I can identify with.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan has outdone himself again great as always. I can wait for the next one I hope its as good as this.
B001HN6922|5.0|My toddler son loves loves loves the Cars movies. His imagination runs with characters all day long. For some reason, he identifies better with the cars in this movie than he does with the cars in the original, especially FInn McMissile. He asks to watch this movie over and over again. It is a well-written story and I don't mind seeing it over and over again with him.
0547884591|5.0|As ever, Ferriss is on form with his energetic style and hectic pace, tangential anecdotes and \\"come on, I dare you\\" attitude.<br />Using the metaphor of cookery, the 4-Hour chef does for learning and 'mind use' what the 4-Hour Body does for personal training and all things physical.<br />Obviously I'm a fan of his work, and I've always enjoyed cooking, so my perspective is perhaps skewed to some degree - but for any neophytes out there seeking a glimpse into the mind and musings of a modern trailblazer, paradigm-shifter and human-experience-explorer, do yourself a favour and read this book.<br />In between all of the other cool stuff, you might even learn how to cook...
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Bring on the minions! I can't wait for the second movie to come out as well. Gru is truly despicable until he is forever changed by adopting the three little girls he only wanted to use to get back at his nemesis. And then there's the line &#34;It's so fluffy!&#34;
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Good family movie about the importance of nature in our environment.  Dr. Seuss always does such a fabulous job with his stories.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My, boyfriend and my kids and I loved the movie, can't wait to finally read the books. I bought the books first but I haven't not had any free time to read them, hopefully soon though.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|It is amazing to read about sound obversations that were overwhelmed by religions for so many years, and how we are finally coming out of the dark ages.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I really love this soundtrack for the movie.  I loveeeee part 2, played with my emotions, but I loved it anyway.  I felt the soundtrack really captured the essence of the movie, the feeling of losing your family and loved ones and the theme of &#34;forever.&#34;  I wish the breaking dawn soundtracks had Muse, but they were both well composed.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|I was looking for a book with sound logic combined with just enough science to keep me interested.  This is it.  I am really glad that I read this book.  It enforces my beliefs and give me good ways to discuss them with friends.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Of Monsters and Men is a great band with their  folk and alternative undertones.  Of course &#34;Little Talks&#34; was a hit, but I really love Mountain Sound and Slow and Steady.  A must buy.  You'll find yourself humming the songs.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This was in great condition upon arrival. No scratches what-so-ever to be found. The quality of the box it came in was amazing, and the movie itself was immaculate.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not a slow period in the book, ever.  Its a diary setup between both husband and wife, flip flopping back and forth.  I didnt think I would like that at first, proved me wrong.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|My son said the book was better but we still enjoyed the movie.  The quality of the streaming was great also.
0937381888|4.0|It does give a great how to idea of what it takes to brew your own beer.  Honestly, find a good local home brew place and ask them.  If they want your busines they will answer all your questions.  If a local isnt to be found, search online.  A lot of places sell kits, everything you need both hardware and brew ingrediants, to help make it foolproof.  One BIG hint that makes this book obsolete:  Cleanliness and Sanitary is key. (with guidance from a brew shop)  I suggest [...].  No I dont work for them, and I dont buy everything from them, but their knowledge has been tenfold what this book gave... and free to boot.    That said, they do have some good recipies in the back.  But this is info that you can usually get online these days.  Most breweries will even tell you the type of malt they use, type of hops used, and the IBU rating of the beer (lack of a better term, bitterness).  You wont get it spot on, but its really close usually.

B009FXIICK|4.0|It's one of the older match 3 type games around, but still just as solid.  Cute graphics, but soundtrack could be improved.

072325804X|5.0|As a fan of all of the Beatrix Potter stories as a child, I naturally wanted my little niece to have the same experience of reading them as she grew up and so I went on a hunt to find them one by one.  Well, I came across this collection all in one book and to be honest I was a bit skeptical.  I was worried that maybe some of the illustrations might not be there or that the quality of the book itself would not live up the the price, but I really did not need to worry.  I am so pleased with this book.  It not only includes all the stories and all the illustrations, but also explanations and origins of the stories.  The book is also well made and sturdy.  I look forward to giving this book to my niece for Christmas.  I now have an excuse to re-read all these stories again as i will have to read them to her. I am super pleased!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let's be honest; for a long time after the show was canceled \\"Firefly\\" fans could be some of the most obnoxious and pushy fans out there. Constantly flooding every discussion site with \\"Firefly\\" based arguments and discussions regardless of how out of place they were. This was the main reason that some (like me) avoided the show for a VERY long time.<br /><br />I wasn't a Joss Whedon fan until earlier this year. I hated \\"Buffy\\" and all the spin-offs and so didn't care about him as a director and creator. Then I saw \\"The Avengers\\" and received a great intro to what he could do with the right material. Some friends begged me to Watch \\"Firefly\\" that weekend and I relented and watched the pilot...then I went out the next day and bought the whole series and the movie \\"Serenity\\"!<br /><br />Oh my goodness! The acting! The attention to detail! The writing! I genuinely cared what was going to happen next! I hadn't felt that excited about a show in a long time. The actors are all wonderful in their roles and sometimes you forget that they are acting. They just seem so right. The show took clichés of right and wrong and \\"heroes\\" and turned them on their heads. The stories were both compelling on their own and yet fit into a longer story arc. Whatever was going through the heads of the executives that doomed this show, I will never know. I know that Whedon's constant fear of being canceled led him to focus on making every episode as concise and appealing as possible while being true to his original vision and that very well may have led to better episodes than we would have gotten otherwise, but there is not one bad or out of place episode in the series.<br /><br />If you like good sci-fi with quality everything, this is the show for you.

B009369Z8A|5.0|The Bondurant brothers do what they do best: make damn fine moonshine.  They practically own Franklin County, the residents of whom respect--and fear--Forrest Bondurant, the brothers' ringleader.  But a new lawman, Special Deputy Charlie Rakes, is determined to take his piece of the pie.  But, as Forrest succinctly puts it, the Bondurants \\"don't lay down for nobody.\\"<br /><br />The film hinges around youngest brother Jack, played here with surprisingly poise by Shia Lebeouf.  It's basically his story, though, as with Matt Bondurant's source novel THE WETTEST COUNTY IN THE WORLD, the most intriguing character is Forrest.  As portrayed by Tom Hardy, Forrest is a hulking beast of few words, a man tied by honor and loyalty, caught up in his own legend, mostly because it largely happens to be true.  Hardy brings much of the same physicality to Forrest as he did to Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, creating yet another memorable performance in a career full of them.  As the third brother, Howard, Jason Clarke doesn't have much to do, but does it extremely well; one wishes his role were larger.  As the villain Rakes (a composite of characters from the novel), Guy Pearce is electric; he walks and talks like a big city dandy, but he strikes with the suddenness and venom of a cobra.  Mia Wasikowski doesn't have much to do in her role of a preacher's daughter; as in the novel, her burgeoning relationship with Jack takes a backseat to everything else.  More interesting is the relationship between Forrest and Maggie, portrayed with an air of regality and seduction by Jessica Chastain.  Perhaps most enjoyable of all, if only for its brevity, is Gary Oldman's performance as a gangster whom Jack admires: in his two scenes, Oldman reminds us why he's one of the great villain actors of his generation (in fact, he does this with a single wink).<br /><br />The script comes from frequent John Hillicoat collaborator Nick Cave, who again (along with Warren Ellis) provides an exquisitely haunting score.  The trio of Hillicoat, Cave, and Ellis gave us the superb THE PROPOSITION (Pearce's contributions cannot be ignored, either); if LAWLESS doesn't quite equal THE PROPOSITION's level of violence, it's not for lack of trying.  This is a violent film.  The violence isn't constant, but it's realistic and powerful, as it should be in this sort of film.  The story is, of course, somewhat true; if Bondurant's book is a fictionalization of his family's history, then Hillicoat's film is a fictionalization of the book.  Cave's script, Hillicoat's direction, and the actors' performances hold fast to this element of truth: this film, at its core, isn't about moonshine, but humanity.  And sometimes, humanity can be an ugly, violent thing.ting score.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Best movie I have seen in years. I read the book years ago (Team of Rivals) and loved that. This production selects excellent parts of the book and develops them in a riveting drama - even though we all know the end - the tension developed in the movie keeps everyone attentive. It is also timely since the suggestion is that we need to get back to pragmatic politics in order to accomplish things. Take a look at Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of Thadeus Stevens and imagine some of our current politicians behaving the same way to great effect. Congress should watch this movie together in a joint session.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This movie is sure to become a cult classic. Quirky and very original characters and story. Kind of movie that grows on you.
B005C5A6C0|1.0|If you are planning on buying this album. Don't. Don't do it. I have been a machine head fan for bout 6 years and have loved their past albums. Burn my eyes, more things change, and burning red. I must say that the last machine head album The Blackening disappointed me there was only bout 2 songs I liked so I thought maybe this one would be better but I was wrong. Machine Head have gone to shit. Sorry but its true. They are trying to much to sound like Metallica with songs that are 7 to 9 minutes long is just annoying. Really? A great song doesn't have to be that friggin long. Slipknot Wait And Bleed lasted 2:00 and something and it was epic and great. There is 1 yes I said 1 good song on here and its called Darkness Within. Other than that, the other songs are just terrible! If the next Machine Head album is as worse as this pile of garbage, then breakup and call it quits. So save your time and your money and get another rock album.

1451695187|2.0|When I first heard about this book I was excited about the testimony of someone who could refute the old story about how after death experiences were chemical or whatever the experts gave as it's cause. This man says he went to Heaven, but he says there is no Hell and a loving God would not make a Hell for his children. Of course he doesn't make Hell for His children but, for those who choose to follow the Devil. Unfortunately this is not true and gives people the idea they can live like they want and there will be no repercussions. I will not recommend this because I feel like it is not the whole truth..........

B007NZQU72|5.0|I was recommended this book by my therapist, who is also an HSP. I am halfway through the book (downloaded on Kindle) and am thoroughly enjoying knowing why I have felt &#34;different&#34; all my life. The author explains what an HSP is, the research she has done (she is also an HSP and got her graduate degree later in life), as well as other psychologists, and then gives ways to live with being highly sensitive in an unsensitive world. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who believes they are highly altered by their environment, and also for those who live with someone who is sensitive. The most valued information to take away is that many HSP's don't understand why they have a harder time, but that we have many traits that non-HSP's do not, such as more sensitivity to those around us, more creativity, and are generally highly intelligent and self-reflective.
0316069434|4.0|First, I am a big Connelly fan, having read all of his books (in order of publication). Thus, my huge disappointment last year with \\"The Drop\\", which was the textbook definition of \\"contractual obligation\\".  Anyone reading that one should be excused in thinking Connelly had lost his touch, as it was a meandering set of two equally boring plotlines slapped together with no regard for the past novels that made Harry great.  Well, Bosch is definitely back with \\"The Black Box\\", which hearkens back to classic cases of old.  It reads so much different (better) than the previous book, you have to wonder why Connelly even bothered putting out something like \\"The Drop\\" if this was the follow up...I'd rather just wait two years for a GOOD Harry novel!<br /><br />The plotline is one that Connelly (and Harry) excels with, a past murder that is labeled \\"unsolvable\\".  A foreign journalist on vacation is found murdered during the 1992 LA riots, and little investigation is done at the time.  Harry eventually draws the case as part of his Cold Case squad, and immediately follows the thinnest of clues to find a few leads as to where the murder weapon is and why the girl was killed. He soon finds the woman was not just on vacation, she might have been investigating a crime, and perhaps was silenced for her efforts and her death made to look like another murder caused by the riots. As usual in these things, there is a lot more than meets the eye, connecting to Desert Storm, National Guard members on leave, and a conspiracy that has lasted decades.  Added to this, Harry has to face an inquiry as to possible illegal actions he might have taken (boy, have we heard that one before, there is even a joke made that Harry once had the number to his legal rep memorized).  Added to this Harry's growing relationship with his daughter and his partner Chu, and you have a great return to the kind of novel that made Connelly's novels \\"must reads\\".  Also, there is actually quite a bit of action in this one, including an exciting shootout at the end (how long has it been since we have had this kind of action in a Bosch book?).<br /><br />If I had any problems, they are few.  IMO the case moves much too fast (this is explained away as Harry pushing the case so it doesn't lose momentum), one main character has no explanation why they are in a certain place just at a certain time to help Harry, and the \\"IA is looking for you\\" plotline has been overused WAAAAAY too much in the Bosch novels....in his world everyone over the grade of Detective is a selfish, narcissistic, bean counting idiot, while all the detectives are unselfish saints.  Look, all Harry does is clear cases, I can tell you there is no way he'd be getting all the friction he does from higher ups if he existed in real life. But heck it does make for good tension and helps hurry the story along, as Harry works best when everyone is working against him.<br /><br />Hopefully Connelly has a few more Harry novels of this quality left.  With his daughter Maddie wanting to join the force, perhaps Harry can pass the torch when he retires. The Black Box marks 20 years of Harry Bosch, I don't know if we can hope for another 20 years, I'd be happy with another 3-4 books this good.s one, including an exciting shootout at the end (how long has it been since we have had this kind of action in a Bosch book?).<br /><br />If I had any problems, they are few.

1419705849|5.0|My son was so excited when the UPS driver delivered this book he could hardly contain himself. I was happy because he was excited for a a new book and not a new toy. As for the actual book it's definitely for younger readers 2nd-5th grade. I'v read some with him and it is full of kid humor. I would buy this book or any of the others from this series as a gift for his friends.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I have read many different books about Mr. Holmes and I always enjoy each one.  Since I read for the pure enjoyment of it, I try not to be too critical.  It has to be a real yawner for me to speak badly of it.

B009SQRL4U|4.0|It's a cartoon that both kids and parents will enjoy. Some inside humor for the grownups and just fun with an important message for the kids. It's a movie I would certainly watch again, plus recommend.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You was an absolutely awesome book.  If you thought Fifty Shades of Grey was a book you could not put down once you started reading it, then you need to read this.  Excellent - definitely would rate it an A+.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Has some interesting twists not seen in many hidden object games.  Looking forward to unlocking. more content.<br /><br />Great graphics and cute characters.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Thought this was a beautifully written book that kept me flipping the pages. Each story was uniquely different in its content and writing style adding a freshness throughout the book. The connections between the stories were subtle creating mystery and a desire to solve the puzzle. I thought the buildup was stronger than the conclusion but overall was a enjoyable read.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|i suspected some of the plot lines but in the end it was too unb3elievable<br />this story was not too my taste
B0098VXCR0|5.0|this movie was very entertaining, this movie was action pack, the witch plot was great. The background scene were great.

B007JMW46U|5.0|Great free read. Nice mysteries. Go ahead and download it, its free, so what have you got to loose? You might just like this classic literature!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Imaginative story combining different genres.  It was a bit predictable at times, but overall it was engaging and full of action.  If you're looking for a dramatic story that changes your life, this isn't it.  If your looking for crazy action, wild and imaginative fight sequences and constant butt kicking; then this is for you.

I am so ticked off at myself. I was doing so well. So here is my review for this game i understand you have to pay to play, but not really if you dont use any of your dimonds and keep searching rooms you'll be fine. with every level you beat you get five more dimonds. CAUTION: This is an extremely addictive game. I cant get enough of it. Every time you play you find new things. You also get to complete challenges.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews...<br /><br />I am a big super hero movie buff and going on a limb, I'll say this was quite probably the best super hero movie I have ever seen! I saw it in the movie and was hoping to catch it playing on Prime. I really wasn't expecting too much, but low and behold was I seriously impressed, in every aspect of the making of this film.<br /><br />Looks like I am buying this here little gem to watch about 25 times in the next 3 years, most likely. Yes, it is that awesome, IMHO...
B00846REIS|4.0|Man talk about frustrating, I dont think ive ever wanted to smack an inanimate object as much as I want to smack these characters. There up and down, hot cold, happy mad. Can you say bi-freakin-polar. I know, I know they went through a lot and its understandable but damn. Eva bares the most horrific experience to Gideon and he cant tell her whats up with him, if I were her i wouldnt wake him up from his dreams Id listen to him for a while, she would find out more that way. Gideon is hot, tall, dark, handsome, broading, rich and sought after but I really wanted to punch him in the nut sack. That boy needs to look up double standard in the dictionary. At first it was like oh hes so indifferent and hot and straight forward then he was winny and all please dont leave me, come on grow a pair. I want my man to a least make me put up a fight. Can these two make it with all the crap between them I hope so.  Do they honestly think sex is going to make everything better cause their in for a rude awakening and all they do is talk in circles never really discussing or solving anything. eva lets things  go way to fast.  damn this book is giving me a headache but a good one cause I love drama in my books. Definately a good read. now on to the next one....

Every chance I had I would be reading it. Took me about two to three days to read, because I was so glued to it. I honestly got teary eyed at some parts and other parts had me saying out loud \\"oh my gosh\\". I won't ruin the story, just buy the book.

B009B0L324|3.0|One comparison between this CD (promoted as &quot;Their First Live Album In 20 Years&quot;) and 1991's &quot;AC/DC Live&quot; tells you the main problem with this band...they absolutely refuse to shake up their setlist in any significant way.<br /><br />Of the 19 songs here, 12 appear on &quot;AC/DC Live&quot;. Another one, &quot;Hell Ain't No Bad Place To Be&quot; (which seems to come back tour after tour for no particular reason, certainly not because it's one of their well-known radio hits) is available on 1978's &quot;If You Want Blood You've Got It&quot; (featuring orignial vocalist Bon Scott). Two more, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (also featuring Scott) and &quot;Shot Down In Flames&quot;, are on the live disc from the &quot;Backtracks&quot; set released a couple years ago.<br /><br />This leaves four songs appearing on a live album for the first time, all from the &quot;Black Ice&quot; CD, which this tour was supporting.<br /><br />I saw AC/DC live twice, once in 1985 and again in 2000. In that time, their setlist changed by maybe 6 songs, and 3 of those were the token new songs from the album they were touring behind.<br /><br />&quot;The Jack&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;...does anyone outside of the AC/DC faithful even know these songs?  Don't they get tired of playing them night after night?  Shake it up already, guys...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very entertaining and additive - Its great!  I find myself constantly burning out my Kindle battery and I've only downloaded the game a few days ago.
B00275EGWY|5.0|So uniforms may not be correct, or flag patches wrong, no cluttered windscreens! Not important to non- military viewers! &#34;Soldiers cowboy &#34; quite often, disobeying orders or taking matters in their own hands. Even George Custer went AWOL to travel a few hundred miles to see his wife Libby and got court-martialled!<br />Some 'veterans' have complained about no NVGs, but the crater fire was so bright that they would have been a bit over-powering. Using flashlights on weapons, no NVGs, flashlights then, Squad members using sniper rifles and spotting scopes got complaints, but given that three of the British(?) Mercs were killed by snipers and their remaining members flipping out, it makes sense for Sands and James to take over. We're they &#34;good&#34;? Accurate? NO. Lots of misses, jitters. Very real to me and others watching. The opening lines &#34;War is a drug&#34; certainly comes 360 degrees as the movie ends. Men return to wars now and always. Sebastian Junger's book &#34;War&#34; has an excellent chapter on why. Just watch and enjoy the movie without small nitpicking and you'll see an excellent film!

B003BW0CB6|4.0|Michael Connelly involves two of my favorite characters Michael Haller and his half brother Harry Bosch. He uses a first person narrative when the focus is on the which character. Sometimes it takes a second or two to realize which one is talkng.<br /><br />It is hard to put down the book as he keeps the suspense going. If you enjoy these characters you will love the book. I've learned it is best to read Connelly's books in chronological otherwise you find a character that was killed off in a previous novel.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album is pure perfection. The music is fantastic, the lyrics, awesome and the band super tight. I haven't heard an album that I love this much in a very long time. These guys have an amazing career ahead of them.

1469984202|5.0|I browse e-books constantly. I get so tired of amazing reviews that make you wonder, how did this book get published??? This is not one of those. I love Hugh's writing style, character development, & storyline. These days original stories in science fiction seem to be so fantastical they are hard to actually comprehend. This story is easy to follow, you don't have to imagine your some made up life form living in the vacuum of space. This book is just a very good story about one possible future, that's what makes it refreshing. Buy it :o)
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I bought this game hoping for the best yet I've found myself disappointed. The game's social element is bugged, and while it is being fixed it's still bad for such a highly anticipated game. There are quests you will find yourself stuck on without any relief in sight due to it being hinged on social elements. Also, their buyable currency, Crystals, are used abominably. I understand having some ponies requiring crystals, but the Mane 6? Rarity - the third pony you must work for - costs 90 alone, which isn't expensive but what about those that cannot or will not buy the currency? The game becomes all but unwinnable without being able to play daily for months on end every day. (yes, you build up free crystals that slowly) I've given the game 3 stars because at least it's playable and the connection issue is being fixed. If only all of the Mane 6 were buyable with the main currency, this review would be much higher.
B00354YA2M|4.0|I gave this book a big rating for a number of reasons, firstly as an American Bill writes with a turn of phrase more like an English writer which I really enjoyed, then as an Australian who has visited most of the places he wrote about I found it a very humorous read, his description of all the dangerous creatures that could do you harm had me laughing out loud, of course they exist but no-one ever allows them to limit their enjoyment of the outdoor activities. I found the interesting facts about the multitude and diversity of ancient fossils that abound in the remote areas of this amazing country. Finally, I would like to thank Bill for hours of enjoyment having read most of his very entertaining books.

0757302661|3.0|I purchased this book while pregnant with my second child.  With my first child I labored at home and barely made it to the hospital in time (she &#34;popped&#34; out 12 minutes after we pulled up to the ER door), so I didn't have to worry about deciding if I wanted pain medication or not.  For my second, I was determined not to have any painkillers (primarily on the principle that I'd done the first without any, so I should be able to have the second without any as well).  My second labor was going to be much different, since I knew that I would be going to the hospital at the first sign of labor, rather than laboring at home, in order to ensure that I was safely in the hospital when it was time for the baby to arrive.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to deal with the pain (yes, it is pain, but we'll get to that in a bit), and would succumb to the &#34;evil&#34; nurses pushing pain medications.  I read about the Hypnobirthing method on several pregnancy forums and thought it was worth a shot.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />I love the positive message that this book has: Childbirth is natural, our bodies are made for this, and we can do it!<br /><br />The breathing exercises are a good way of centering and do help to promote relaxation<br /><br />It encourages partner participation - though I thought much of the recommended participation was a bit cheesy (example - have your partner record him/herself reading the meditation, then use that meditation recording to relax ... sorry, but that wouldn't relax me!)<br /><br />The message of the book is about empowerment<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The book prepares you for a fight (with nurses, doctors, etc) that you may not actually have to deal with (many hospitals now ask for birth plans and respect a woman's wishes on how she wants to labor, the tides are changing!)<br /><br />The book states that &#34;childbirth shouldn't be painful&#34;, and paints pictures of women birthing calmly against trees.  It sets the expectation that if you follow the HypnoBirthing method correctly, you won't feel pain, but &#34;pressure&#34;.  Unless you're Buddah, childbirth hurts.  Period.  These methods help to center you and help you deal with the pain - but nothing (except an epidural) is going to make it 'not hurt'.<br /><br />Ms. Mongan does the reading on her meditation CD, and, while she has a nice voice, she also has an incredibly distracting 'thing' her mouth does when she speaks.  I can't describe it, but it completely threw me off using her CD.  Instead I downloaded the Rainbow Relaxation meditation.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I found much of this book useful - it certainly helped me feel empowered prior to my delivery, and served as a good basis for the  method I employed during my delivery.  Did it make childbirth painless?  No, of course not.  I had an 8 pound, 20 inch human pushing its way out of my body - nothing short of heavy drugs is going to make that painless.  I'm glad I read it, and will recommend it to friends as a basis for their birth plan.e expectation that if you follow the HypnoBirthing method correctly, you won't feel pain, but &#34;pressure&#34;.

B008XZKSKG|5.0|Back in the late 2000's, Genesis began re-releasing their entire back catalog in remastered & remixed CD / DVD sets. There were three sets which were released to reflect three distinct periods of the Genesis timeline: 1970-1975 (The Peter Gabriel years), 1976-1982 (the early Phil Collins years), and 1983-1998 (later Phil Collins years / Ray Wilson era). The sets were greeted with mixed reviews from the fans. Some panned them as being harshly remixed with compressed sound and an increased loudness factor, while others praised the new mixes which weren't as muddy as the previous ones and revealed new details within the music. Nonetheless, of the box sets that were re-released, only one of them had a vinyl release to coincide with the box, and it was the 1970-1975 Peter Gabriel years set. I previously reviewed the vinyl release of that set here on Amazon and still listen to it frequently. I, like many fans, was hoping maybe the other box sets would get the vinyl treatment as well. Years passed and nothing came about....until now.... :-)....and I am personally thrilled because this was my favorite of the sets when the CD / DVD re-release came out. And to have it now on vinyl is very exciting!!<br /><br />As the description states, this \\"new\\" 1975-1982 LP box set contains five classic albums on thick 180 gram vinyl:<br /><br />1-Trick of the Tail<br />2-Wind and Wuthering<br />3-And Then There Were Three<br />4-Duke<br />5-Abacab<br /><br />Now let me back up for a second. When these five albums were re-released on the CD / DVD box set, I personally loved the new version of \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" as it sounded like a fresh new album thanks to the remastering. I felt the same way about \\"Trick\\" as well. However, \\"Duke\\" sounded like a harsh mess, with very chaotic sound. \\"Abacab\\" and \\"Three\\" were marginal. I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this new vinyl set, but I'm glad I did, because each of these LPs sound fresh and vibrant, with very little (if any) compression in the mixes. A definite improvement over the harsher sound of the CDs.<br /><br />\\"Wind and Wuthering\\" is amazing! As great as it sounded on CD, it practically soars to new heights on vinyl. The \\"choral\\" parts of \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" and crystal clear, adding yet another added piece of depth to an already classic song. \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" sounds like it was recorded this year. The end of \\"Afterglow\\" sounds more beautiful than ever. Phil's drums sound great throughout this entire album, and many lost sounds of cymbals and crashes are now more pronounced. Very good bass as well. I will be playing this one non-stop!<br /><br />\\"Trick\\" is fantastic as well. \\"Mad Man Moon\\" and \\"Entangled\\", two gorgeous songs, shine even greater on this set. The quiet parts are enhanced, in that they sound very clear, nothing muddy in the mix, while aggressive tunes like \\"Squonk\\" and \\"Los Endos\\" will give your subwoofer a good workout! Good clear bass without overkilling it.<br /><br />Without a doubt, though, the best improved of the bunch is the aforementioned \\"Duke\\". It sounded muddy on the original vinyl, thick on the '94 CD remasters, and a big loud mess on the CD / DVD re-release last decade. This version on vinyl is the one I will now return to again and again. I longed to hear a good, clean, clear sounding \\"Duchess\\" and that's exactly what is here. Two underrated gorgeous tracks, \\"Heathaze\\" and \\"Please Don't Ask\\", are VERY clean and the mud has been kicked off them, so to speak. \\"Duke's Travels / Duke's End\\" also shine. I can hear previously buried sounds now, with Tony's keyboards leading the way with a more definitive bass groove. This album really rocks, and now the thick sound has been lifted and it sounds the way I always wanted it to !!<br /><br />\\"Three\\" and \\"Abacab\\" sound pretty much as they did on CD, which is good. I concentrated mostly on \\"Wind\\", \\"Trick\\" and \\"Duke\\" as these were the strongest of the albums. I'll add the other two in time.<br /><br />So far,I have encountered zero surface noise or drop-outs, which some fans said were present on the 1970-1975 vinyl set. The packaging is the same as that set, which has a big box that the LPs slide into from the side. All five albums have protective sleeves covering the inner LP and all have faithful renditions of the original covers / gatefolds. \\"Wind\\" even has a textured cover. The covers are all heavyweight cardboard and look quite handsome.<br /><br />I was told that only 1000 of these were made (although I'm still looking for confirmation and none of them are numbered), so we'll see what comes of that. Anyway, I don't think you'll be disappointed in this set. Great quality music, great quality packaging, and a boxful of memories for vinyl junkies like myself. Perhaps Genesis will finish things off by properly re-releasing the 1983-1998 box set on vinyl too (I'd love to hear \\"Calling All Stations\\" remastered for vinyl!!).<br /><br />Prog on, my friends.I have encountered zero surface noise or drop-outs, which some fans said were present on the 1970-1975 vinyl set.

B005LAIH4A|1.0|The obvious Greenazi agenda in this movie is revolting.  The story is absurd, and really, there is nothing to say nice about it.  I have thrown this in the garbage.  Do not allow this movie to steal your precious time, do not watch it.  You will be sorry if you do, I am.
B004GEB9UQ|4.0|Dr. Cordain has obviously done his homework, as this book reads well scientifically and socially. I've been trying to stick to the diet for only a week, and have lost a little weight (water, I think); the notion that our genes have not kept up with industrial and imported foods, additives, fats. sugars, etc. is accurate from my perspective and eating habits.  However, this book preaches at the reader and repeats the same notions so often that it really becomes repetitious  I had to look for new kernels of wisdom and insight into healthy foods/the Paleo diet--still perhaps others need that repetition more than I.  This book is easy reading and a must &#34;take a look&#34; for all living in industrial societies, especially those with allergies, medical problems, and who eat a lot of fast food.
0385535147|2.0|Every couple years I try another Grisham novel, since reading my first \\"The Firm\\",(which I loved) and have consistently been disappointed. The early reviews on this new novel were so positive, I gave it a chance. This book was so boring I cannot believe it is getting the reviews its getting! It goes on and on and on! Very difficult to follow, despite the wasted narritive. This is the first time I have placed a review, but I am so dismayed with the positive feedback, I just had to comment.
0307588343|4.0|1.  I've read the various \\"negative\\" reviews on this book and I have no doubt that those folks are correct in many of their views.  However, from the average american reading this book, no can do no wrong in getting this book.  It's very well written (which is very important in that many books dealing with finance can get overly too technical in their pursuit of being \\"correct\\" and in the end being a good substitute for a sleeping pill) and enlightening to those of us who are novices in the world of serious finance.<br />2.  My one constructive criticism of the book is that the author never answered (to my satisfaction) how in the world, why in the world did the financial institutions lend money to people with very bad credit.  He may have tried to deal with this issue, but probably done so in a technical manner.  Furthermore, I'm assuming (know?) that there was the underlying political climate for which the financial institutions were \\"encouraged\\" to do this?  At the end of the day, the whole thing still doesn't make any sense.  I mean, most (all) people reading this book knows that in \\"real life\\", you just can't walk into a car dealership and purchase a car without having to fill out a ton of paperwork, supplying various financial statements etc... And thus, how in the world or again the more interesting question is why in the world did all these financial institutions give loans to people with high credit risk.

I decided to give their album a go and am very pleased with the result. I hope they will do their best to be themselves and continue to produce easy listening. A video DVD might be a good next step. I would live to hear them perform with Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra playing behind them.

B005URRCUY|5.0|I am just now getting into this \\"band\\". (Two amazingly talented musicians.) This is their newest album and after hearing this I quickly went back and bought \\"Brothers\\" and \\"Attack and Release\\" - equally awesome albums.<br /><br />This is classic intelligent rock. Stellar playing, great vintage sounding instruments and gear, and a terrific delivery with unique voicing. The lyrics just drop me sometimes. These guys are doing all of this using anywhere from 2-5 chords done so perfectly I wish it had been my writing. They make gut wrenching rock using standard rock progressions and then do it in a dorian, minor, or myxolydian mode that just grabs me. When I listen to this stuff I want to quit my day job and make music like this. Essential music for anyone who says they are into \\"rock\\" or \\"alternative\\" music.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|I understand why this series have a cult following. The book is very well written and I kept going because I really wanted to know what happened to Harriet and what is the deal with Lisbeth. However, all the themes in the book are not for sensitive readers with vivid imaginations.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The ability to watch this movie at home, rather than a theatre with lots of kids, people texting and sticky floors was a much better experience than it was when I went to the movie theatre.
B008Y6MKSW|5.0|This is a terrific movie for all ages beyond about 10. Hard to believe there is anyone out there who hasn't at least heard of it. The idea of trapping Bill Murray in a sort of time warp in a small Penn hamlet until he essentially discovers how to be a good person and how to love someone other than himself was brilliant. And, because of the star and the script, the journey is frequently hysterical and always entertaining.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|For me, this book was everything I love in a story. I love the back and forth through history.  I love the multiple story lines. I love the family mystery. I read this book first then backtracked to the others and now will read Morton's newest--but I'm saving it for a trip. I can see why people who like simpler stories, might not find this as compelling, but for people who enjoy an interwoven compelling look at character and a plot that pulls you through--this one is great. Loved it!
B009OYTIXS|5.0|What happens to a millionaire playboy stranded on a remote island for five years?  Ben Gunn from Treasure Island was completely mad in a little over two, Chuck Noland in Cast Away developed a profound relationship with a volleyball in three and Gilligan did almost everything imaginable in less than four.  But five years of playing survivor, throw in some dangerous adversaries and even torture and you just might get a superhero.<br /><br />During his time on the island Oliver Queen had only one article from his past life: a ledger of his father's pointing to a family legacy built on corruption and exploitation which provides the driving force for survival as he feels an obligation to rectify the wrongs he believes his family has perpetrated on the citizens of Starling City.  Oliver has also learned to hold on to the memories dearest to him in order to survive but after rescue from the living nightmare in episode one, he returns to find that the family he idealized has moved on; his mother has remarried and the attitude that his baby sister now possesses could probably be best described as ambivalence.  His mother unknowingly hires a bodyguard for her less than helpless son that ends up quitting when he discovers the secret identity of his charge.  But the ethical nature of this character provides a counter to Oliver's single-minded pursuit of justice as he later convinces him to assist in the logistics of his mission although I believe he needs him more as a conscience and a compass to what should be done as opposed to what the Green Arrow is capable of.<br /><br />At times this series may digress a bit towards inter-personal drama but it's buoyed by action and to be completely honest that's what keeps me coming back to this show.  Anyone can do well-choreographed fight scenes but in this case it's all about filming in such a way as to maintain a certain level of believability as well as making the viewer actually \\"feel\\" the action.  Additionally, the violence is subtle and tastefully done; how many shows can say that? At the writing of this review I'm still not very impressed with any of the female characters but it's still early and there's lots of potential and I'm sure they will continue to introduce new heroes and villains.  Speaking of which, the addition of the character that will eventually become the Huntress provides a sort of polemic to the heroic vigilantism of the Green Arrow as he demonstrates respect for the inherent value of human life while the latter is motivated by end justifying the means.<br /><br />I just wish the critics would stop comparing this excellent television series with prolly one of the most exceptional super-hero film series currently around (i.e. Batman).  As another member of the DC superhero universe, of course there's gonna be similarities in some of their characters... get over it.  I suppose if you can't then just keep watching those films over and over again but for all of us lovers of creative/fantasy/super-hero, television-entertainment.... there's Arrow.  :o)tle and tastefully done; how many shows can say that?

The author could have made this one boring, poorly written book instead of three. She needs to invest in a Thesaurus and look up other words for &#34;murmur&#34;. I think that word was used around 1000 times. Ana also constantly refers to her 'Inner Goddess&#34; and says that Christian 'cupped her sex'. Who says that?? Ana also calls Christian Mr. Grey throughout the third book. Very redundant. These books seem to be thrown together with very little thought. I started reading them because of all the hype. I barley made it through the third book. I skipped over every other page of the same exact description of them having sex. I'm not opposed to two consenting adults having this kind of relationship but Ana and Christian seemed way too boring to live that lifestyle. Don't waste your time or money on these books.  I usually don't write book reviews but I want to spare others the agony of reading these stupid books!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great value , I love this movie and jumped at the chance to buy it on blu ray.  if your a terminator fan this is a must buy
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Had Angry Birds not been free I never would have discovered the absolute fun of this game.  I've ordered every other angry bird game out there!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Somehow the book was better. It seemed to be missing some of the elements that make the book so interesting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like calculators that are large and easy to use.  Great free app! If you have trouble with small print and need an easy to read and easy to use calculator then this is the app for. you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Although this was not my favorite Grisham, The Racketeer was a fun read that has you rooting for the narrator.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|If you have good headphones, like Audiotechnica ATH M50s or something comparable, this is a worthwhile purchase, especially if you have high impedance headphones. The basic EQ settings are welcome, and for my tastes, the blue setting noticably improves sound quality. This is durable and light, and the battery lasts a very long time; somewhere around 6-8 hours. It comes with all the cables you need. Recommend buying the Fiio L9 LOD as well. These two products go well together.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|It was a different reading experience. It was well written though the end was a bit predictable. Still an enjoyable read.
0525953728|3.0|I wasn't really interested in is navy seal training.  I finally skipped to the part where the actual capture took place. I am in the middle of that now.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|Add this to the triollegy, very funny and intertaining movie. Had to watch it twice to catch some of the stuff i missed from first viewing.
B007BZM30M|4.0|Just a fun song to drive or clean to. Extreamly easy lyrics but that just adds to the fun of the song.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|When I recieved the package, I immedaitely checked the disc for wear and tear, and there was not a single scratch on it. Very happy with this purchase.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I have been searching for headsets for a while and I decided to take the plunge with the limited edition Tango. All of the extra features compared to some of the earlier models are worth the extra dollars. The dual band works great, have had no interference at all and the memory foam on the ears make it really comfortable to wear.<br /><br />You have not experienced anything until you have played a game through high quality headsets like the limited edition Turtle Beach Tango headset.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Totally disjointed and the colloquialisms are sometimes unintelligible.  I kept waiting for something to tie it all together and develop a plot, but it just didn't happen for me..
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a lovely read. Quite fantantastical but with valid humorous political remarks throughout a tale of impossible adventure. Too much fun to put down.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I love this little thing, It has brought my headphones up to the level it needed to be.<br /><br />Even though it only runs at 150mw it is more than enough power to bring your headphones up a few notches. I used these with Sony XB-40's rated at 1500mw and it brings them to life! If your looking for an inexpensive way to gain proper performance that your headphones claimed then this will do the job.<br /><br />The build quality is more then exceptable. It features an aluminum body with a spring loaded clip at a little bit larger size then the iPod shuffle. The plastic components are good quality and work properly.<br /><br />It features a boost circuit, It sounds a little off though and I prefer using software EQ for boosting. The battery lasts a few days on a charge and recharges fairly quickly through the USB port, unless your without access to power for long periods of time then this battery will be just fine. Uses a standard Micro USB port to charge so if you have alot of computer stuff you should have plenty of chords laying around.<br /><br />For 20$ you can't go wrong!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I must say I loved this movie. I loved everything about it. But at the same time I am a nerd in this kind of way so maybe it played into my weakness.<br /><br />Before you watch this it would be helpful to have seen (from most to least): Thor, Captain America, Iron man, and a Hulk. This will give back story and make things make more sense. Either way good flick very enjoyable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A great 3D movie for a 3D enthusiast and a must own no matter what the format.  If you buy this movie, buy the Four-Disc set.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved,the intensity in the books every moment was suspense would love to reread them again not the kinda book I normally,read but so so glade I read these!!!
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I thought I would give it a try for free, but it needs some work.<br />The sounds are nice, but the loops are too short and it skips slightly when it starts a loop over. Also, Some sounds were too soft even when I turned up the volume.<br />I will try it again when it's updated but deleting it for now.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|evernote is easy to use and a great price. i have another similar app but its not user friendly. this one is. my only complaints are the spell check could be better, and i wish it had an appt book. the spell check is small to make the app small im sure and there are plenty of other appointment books available. so overall i have no complaints.
1442346949|3.0|I thought I bought the unabridged version; it was not. Still enjoyed the read. Would have preferred the book containing the original content; not condensed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really need to know the percentage of charge for the battery life of my kindle fire hd...and this app provides more info than just how much charge is left. It tells the health of your battery, how much time you have for internet browsing, listening to music, face to face chating, video playing, etc. with whatever the exsisting charge is in the battery. Gives options  to set notifications when the battery has reached a certain low and when fully charged. Went without the app for a little while and felt like I was blind to the precise charge and time for tasks with how much battery charge I had. I HIGHLY recommend this app for both tablets and phones.
B005K17RU0|3.0|looks okay but only potrait mode, no way to customize bottom menu so you can find pollen or outdoor quality, etc.  pretty basic
B007PFD90G|5.0|I have struggled for years to get through a Rushdie novel and so when I saw him on The Daily Show talking about his memoir I decided to give it a try.  It's an excellently written book--especially for those of us who hate non-fiction.  I was in my early adolescence when the Fatwa was implemented and remember only vaguely the press around the whole thing.  I believe he treated both his readers and the people in his life with respect and honestly.  Yes, there are moments of bitterness expressed, but a person would be hard pressed to not to experience if going through something like this.  Highly recommend!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband. The first time we watched it was from Redbox and he liked it so I bought it for him! good action movie!
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I have seen the other Step Up movies and wasnt sure what i would think about this one, but I loved it so much it might be my favorite one! The dance and emotion in this is inspiring, it makes me want to Step Up!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Great movie! well to me anyway! some people might not like it but I thought it was a good movie! kind of dark and funny at times! love the music on this movie too!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|To all those thinking your getting a more pure remaster of the ORIGINAL MASTERS as the CD cover states. Your wrong. This is simply a slightly remastered version of Dave Mustaine's 2004 Remixed and Remastered collection which not only remasters the recording but also changes things in it as well. So this is NOT the original. Why Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab called this an original is beyond me and why they needed to remaster a remaster from 2004 is is futher beyond me and why they are charging 26 dollars it when its not at all a collector's piece, I can't comprehend. Personally I like the original 1992 version of this cd which is musically a 5 star album. The new Dave Mustaine Remix and Remaster changes too many elements. Altered solos, Drum Machines replace the live Drums, Some Re-Recorded Vocals, He removed some samples and added some samples. Too many changes. I like a classic to be kept a classic. So this remaster of a remaster is not worth your money and it's false advertisin
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I think this movie is my husbands favorite movie. He watched it 5 times in a week. I even liked it and Im more into scary movies. This is a great action movie!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I installed this on a recommendation from my girlfriend. I installed it hit play signed into the face book thing and every time it got halfway through loading it would close tried multiple tomes but still no success please fix this!!!!!
B0053KWDES|5.0|I upgraded from the [[ASIN:B005JT8OT6 FiiO E6 Headphone Amplifier]] to the FiiO E11, due to the great reviews and the E6 did not have enough power to really drive my [[ASIN:B001UE6I0G Sennheiser HD 380 PRO]].<br /><br />I bought this with the [[ASIN:B004QVNNI0 FiiO L9 Line Out Dock Cable ]] to use with my iPhone 4. They say you are never to use two amplifiers as the quality varies, you want the straight sound out prior to it hitting your amplifier. All iPhones, laptops, desktops, iPod's, and mp3 players have an amplifier built in so you need a line out dock to get the best quality sound.<br /><br />With the line out dock, and the FiiO E11's the Sennheisers really came to life. I could finally hear the bass, and the mids and highs were much clearer and accentuated.<br /><br />I love the features where it has a High/Low gain switch (based on the type of headphones you have) which helps when I take this travelling to use with my [[ASIN:B004PO10E2 Shure SE215's]].<br /><br />The EQ settings (0,1,2) is also nice for adding that little extra bass boost needed for some songs.<br /><br />Also, under the battery (removable by the way), is a switch for voltage. You can keep it high (for better sound quality) or low (for longer battery life). The low does kill the sound quality a bit but it's up to the user preference and your ears and how long you'll be going without charging the unit.<br /><br />All in all, I give this 5 stars. Another great product from FiiO. If you're considering the E6, don't buy it. Buy the E11, and you'll be much happier.
B008M721MS|4.0|This device and app is new to me and I can't wait to get used to using them both as soon as possible.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this and it was worse the movie to get this movie. I highly recommend this movie.
0312641893|2.0|Amazon has declared that this is one of their best teen novels of 2012. On that basis I bought it. Well, I wonder how Amazon is judging what best is - sales?<br />This is most definitely a teen novel and I can predict that it won't be remembered in 20 years - this is not literature. Teen love it is. Romeo and Juliet it isn't. The characters are teens, there isn't much intro-spection, they are rather wooden.<br />I am not going to read the others in the trilogy - I can spot a happy ending in the first 50 pages
1423101472|5.0|enjoyed getting this gift from me.  He said he wants me to buy him  more of thee series when I could.
B000M343BM|5.0|My girlfriend says I quote this movie too frequently. I probably could watch the movie on mute and just dictate the lines of the movie nearly verbatim. It truly is a baseball classic.
B00005V9IK|5.0|Aliens!<br /><br />America!<br /><br />America kicking alien a$$!<br /><br />Will Smith!<br /><br />What more could you want?<br /><br />Just buy it already.<br /><br />You know you want it.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|This movie did the tv series no justice at all. I never watched the tv show, but I heard it was pretty good--this was terrible.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This movie is based on the book by Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />While I love the book, I will have to say that this is the first time I have ever loved a movie rendition more.<br /><br />Action, magic, mystery, romance, and pirates all rolled into one story.<br /><br />I say get it, watch it and be amazed.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I'm sure there's a bit of poetic license with this story, but it was such a good reminder of having heard and seen these news stories at night years ago.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is very good because are different levels where need think about is not more of game is think and play is good
B000002MTU|5.0|audiophiles say his music from this genre got better after he produced this cd. While he toured it was noticable. Clapton is one of the true masters of the guitar and his voice lends itself well to this bluesy-rock genre of music.
B00008EY7H|5.0|This is a particularly good one. Two reasons to buy: most of us live nowhere near anywhere the Cirque is liable to perform, and you can buy five of these for the price of a single ticket to a live performance and entertain dozens of people. Merci M. Laliberte', merci Cirque!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Probably the best show on tv right now. Definitely the best comedy. The humor is novel and the characters are great together.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|It is a great book for little girls fun fun fun to read<br />  Boy will love the picture and light
B004XN3FHA|5.0|The Fenix TK41 is unbelievable.  It's like holding a giant professional floodlight in your hand, in a relatively small flashlight.  This thing produces a whopping 860 lumens... and delivers that level of blindingly bright light for an impressive 2 hours and 20 minutes on one set of 8 standard \\"AA\\" batteries. You really need to experience \\"860 lumens\\" to understand how absurdly bright that is.  It's \\"crazy bright\\".  If you toggle it down to 365 lumens (which is still truly extremely bright - far more light than you would likely need), it will run for almost 8 hours on that same set of batteries!  Toggle it down further to 120 lumens (which is still a bit brighter than your average hand-held flashlight) and you will get 27 hours of run-time.  Finally, in 15-lumen \\"map-reading mode\\", it will run for an amazing 240 hours (10 days, 24-hours-a-day) on that one set of batteries!  It is very versatile, with this wide range of light intensity modes.<br />One thing that makes this flashlight unusual, is it's ability to produce this level of performance using standard household \\"AA\\" series alkaline batteries.  Typically, in order to get into the realm of flashlights that produce over 500 lumens (like this 860 lumen beast), you need to either use rechargeable battery packs, or you need to use specialty high-discharge batteries like the CR-123 or similar speciality batteries, which are generally not available at your local store, but must be ordered online.  This flashlight uses those \\"AA\\" batteries that everyone is familiar with, and that are available almost anywhere.  Due to the fact that standard household \\"AA\\" series batteries are inherently not as powerful as specialty CR-123 -type batteries... you must use a large quantity of \\"AA\\" batteries (in this case 8 of them) in order to gain the power required to deliver such a spectacularly bright light as \\"860 lumens\\".  But that's just the unavoidable limitations of physics.<br />If you are willing to buy specialty batteries, you have many high-intensity flashlights  from which to chose.  If you are more comfortable using standard \\"AA\\" alkaline batteries, you will not likely find a better size-to-light-intesity ratio than the one offered by this flashlight.have many high-intensity flashlights  from which to chose.  If you are more comfortable using standard \\"AA\\" alkaline batteries, you will not likely find a better size-to-light-intesity ratio than the one offered by this flashlight.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I don't normally like these movies, but got this one for my husband. This turned out to be a great movie!
B008J34466|5.0|As usual this CD has contoversial lyrics which will delight the younger fans. On another level Pink has drawn on her own likfe experiences to deliver an extrodainary compilation of songs with fantastic lyrics and music. Well worth buying. I haven't changed this CD in my car since I got it and find myself singing out loud and slapping the steering wheel getting alot if strange looks. Who cares I love it and have ordered more of her music. My 11 yr old daughter intoduced her to me I am 45, so her music appeals to all ages, Highly recommend.
B0033TI4BW|5.0|This book is really eye opening and filled with research and insights. Might help you personally, your team, your company and your kids lead a better and happier life.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|Disney does it again with another movie that will be passed down generation to generation. Family friendly and overall a great movie.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|it's a very cute game app.  It has different games and it keeps my 2 years old son busy whenever he plays with it.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I realize this is the free version, but the Hobbit ad crashes the game every time...what is up with that?  Some of the other ads are inappropriate, so beware.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|First off - Great Actors!  All three big actors had great roles. I would recommend this one if you want something fun and intense.  The ending will throw you off. :)
0756686970|5.0|great for collecting or just letting you kid look and shop through the pages. it is Star Wars and Legos all in one .... can't miss
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Now I can watch it anytime I want. Nice to be able to pause and rewind since I don't have a vcr anymore.

0307730697|5.0|If you are looking for a story about Faith, a wonderful love story, a different way of looking at your own life, and a new found respect for the men and women of our Country, this is it.  Adam Brown was a man every single person should strive to be like.  I walked away from this book feeling like a part of the Brown family, and wanting to thank each and every one of them for standing by Adam to help him become the wonderful man he rose to be.  My parents attend Church with Kelley and I would love to personally thank her for being an inspiration to me in my own relationship and the desire to never give up on the ones you love.  An exceptional, exceptional story of an even more exceptional man.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Coming from Reality, while not as good as Cold Fact, I like it a lot. I have ordered the movie, Searching for Sugarman&#34;, so I can loan it to friends....and, of course, watch it again myself. It was fantastic! gnn
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Its not bad, cool premise. If Hollywood would stop putting Kristen Stewart in movies, we would all be better off, her facial expressions tell me she is constantly battling constipation and we dont need to watch that for 2 hours.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing the movie, Searching for Sugarman, I couldn't wait to get this CD. It's probably my third CD purchase in 2-3 years. I have also ordered the movie. I'm anxious to watch it again and to loan it to friends. What a talent! gnn
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I didnt buy this or play it, so I cant say much about it, but apparently my opinion is so well loved that I was asked to give it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun for a free app. &lt;3 these little pones. lots of characters for bronies. colorful and bright graphics. everything is just like the show. fans of the show will like it.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|If you grew up on watching these guys movies, you will love it, if not you will be watching a 2 hour action movie.
B00006FDCD|2.0|I was in the Halloween spirit and read the book \\"It\\" and definitely wanted to see it come to life in the movie. The book was great. I watched the movie and it doesn't compare to the book. I thought it would be a full length movie but I later found out that it was a made for TV series. The movie wasn't scary at all. I wasn't looking for another Saw movie but I was looking forward to some terrifying action and it never happened.<br /><br />My recommendation would be, just read the book. It makes more sense than the movie and it is 100 times scarier.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|its an okay case it serves its purpose but I might buy something a bit more thicker in case you drop your kindle or you have to go into battle leading an army with it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love the entire game. Has all the things I look for ....an interesting mystery,  hidden pictures,  clever puzzles AND a reasonable price ...WAIT!  I almost forgot to mention awesome graphics with zoom,  creepy sound track plus a choice of difficultly levels AND hints or skip options too. VERY nicely done .....do it again please!
B008N1V11U|2.0|The game is fun, but it constantly needs updates and takes forever to download, no matter how strong your internet is.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this band! Any Mumford and Sons fans I think would like this band too. Good acoustic music. A lot of soul.
B0013DDM3A|5.0|This is a song, I listened to it, and it played, I dont rate music, it is a matter of taste.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Nice job with this one I really like this the best out of all of the angry birds games.  Very cool.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I found this season to be tantilizing and provokative with Becket's and Castle's HOT chemistry for each other. Castle's humor offesets BEcket's serious side perfectly. They are a good match for each other. I like the uncortable air while at work when Csstle tries to be affectionate with Becket. Of course, everyone else pretty much knows what is going on by now despite the lovers best efforts to keep it secret.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This ruined the premise of the book, I am not sure why the writer signed off on it, another sign that when Producers get input on a film or directors think people just like cool camera angles and forget the story you end up with this crud.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|n interesting insight to a very difficult man even though he was brilliant.  Vey much warts and all.  But genius does bot excuse bad. Ehaciour
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Josh and company should be patting themselves on the back, they did a really nice job with such a big project.  Maybe this will rub off on Michael Bay and he will start paying a little more respect to source material.

B0089AD8IO|5.0|This was the season that started it all for me. bit of rocky start with the first episode, but all it took was the second episode to really get me hooked!
B000002GHH|5.0|These older songs of his have a freshness that is lacking in most other music today to my mind.<br />I'm loving Memphis in The Meantime and of course Have a Little Faith in Me.<br />John Hiatt rocks!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this series. I cannot get it on CW so being able to have the series is great. Fun to watch. Can't wait for season 8 to come out.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I was never into folk but then i heard these guys. Not one bad song. Heartfelt and emotional music with very raw tracks.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie was not an overly great picture. The plot was the overdone &#34;parent smothering daughter who defies her, does wrong, but all is happy in the end&#34; sort of thing. There were dangling threads of characters which were never resolved or resolved poorly. The animation was great. I enjoy animated movies for the entertainment value but this one seems to be a bit shallow.
0316227706|5.0|A brilliant book by an exceptionally talented photographer who has taken fantastic photos of dogs underwater - what more can I say?  This book is worth every cent.
B005TQAI6G|2.0|I bought this for a BIG Britney Fan who attended this concert recently. Her problem wasn't so much with the dvd but with Britney's performance. She remarked that Britney seemed to be walking through the show and how little Britney put into the performance when compared to her back-up dancers. If you put out a concert dvd, you want to make sure that it's the artist's best performance. Unfortunately, this isin't it.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|just great.a thought provoking sotpry every time you read it.dark, comical, mysterious, action packed and entertaining. everything you want in a great comic book. a true classic.
B009JTCBLE|5.0|I can't give this enough thumbs up! These guys just get better and better with each outing. It's too bad this might be their last album. Great classic rock feel with a more modern sound.
B00899DR40|5.0|I picked this up for my 2 girls 6 and 8, they just love it we play it all the time!
B0053O89WY|5.0|The fifth season of The Big Bang Theory has finally arrived on DVD! With the proliferation of the show in syndication, one might question the point of buying the complete season DVD set, but DVD's do give the viewer twenty-four hour access to their favorite shows. Getting to the DVD's themselves, you get all twenty four episodes from the fifth season and some pretty cool features including: The Big Bang Theory @ 100-cast and crew celebrate the 100th episode, Laws of Reflection-Cast and Crew reflect on Season Five, Professors of Production that looks at the various behind the scenes departments that give The Big Bang Theory it's unique look, and a customary gag reel.
B0064W667Y|5.0|a amazing take on fairy tell characters. vol 1 is a great introduction to this series. a pulp style murder mystery with a great ending and great characters. and the series gets better as it goes on.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Great band, great album, fun to listen to, if you enjoy southern rock this album is for you. Good Day!

0545425115|5.0|I was skeptical about reading the Hunger Games.  With all the hype surrounding the movie I was afraid it would be pop fluff, but I was dead wrong.<br /><br />I read through this volume in two sittings, it's just impossible to put down.  The writing style is immediate and you feel like you're seeing Katniss' world through her eyes as she stumbles from one brutal challenge to the next.  The subject matter is grim and there aren't many lighthearted aspects to the book, but it somehow achieves the feat of making you want to continue.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins illustrates her dystopian future with such realism, that you actually feel for the characters that live within that world and sympathize with their daily struggles.  Katniss has the right mix of defiance and incredulity that make her a charming heroine and you can't help but root for her as she murders her way to freedom.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Kinda corny, they could've done so much more with the storyline, but for the Starblazers fan it's definitely worth watching if not owning, so basically I dont' regret having it.  The costumes and special fx were pretty damn good. *KIND OF A SPOILER*  I just wish they didn't make the ending so final.  I could do with some sequels of this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i just got this game yesterday.  I  cant put it down.  Truly fascinating.<br />It gets more and more difficult, but you win plenty of hints along the way.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Since the book was written by a Neurologist, it give extra credibility to the near death experiences of the author.  The book does a good job of integrating the scientific method of deduction with the metaphysical method.
B009EE5SQ4|5.0|If u haven't seen it. Watch it. It's a great movie.  Who does not love Will Smith?? Watch it all the time.
B00004VW35|5.0|What more needs to be said?  Anyone who is a fan should have this!  One of those albums that is probably not well known but should be in your collection.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie is the greatest.Our son loved it as a child and now his children are hooked.Actually,after we receive our copy,there will be three copies in the family.One here,at Grannies home,they have a copy at their Dad's and they asked Santa to bring a copy for when they are at their Mother's home.<br />I don't think this movie will ever loose it's popularity.<br /><br />Another great one is,Eight Below.It's based on a true story.Probably not suitable for little ones.One scene about the leopard seal is scary.Even when you know it's coming next,the music and the scene will grab your attention.Fast forward the scene.<br />Our Grandchildren have been watching it since they turned six.They really like this one,too.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this series. We watch them again and again. Everytime a new season comes out on DVD we buy it, Watch all the way through and then loan them out. Awesome.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking! I felt like I was back in the movie theater, in a whole other world. A must have for fans of the motion picture.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|What can I say that isn't said over and over here already. But I do have a question for a real long time Fan. Has anyone seen a  version that had the out takes. What I'm talking about is in the DVD case when you open it there is a picture of the Griswolds at a Christmas Tree lot that has different color trees \\"Pink\\" \\"Blue\\" and Clark is talking to the owner. I'd love to see an out takes version maybe with the cast talking about it too.
B002ISID10|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. In my opinion its their best. Its why i Love Asking Alexandria. If you know anyone that like Bring Me The Horizon or After the Burial you know they will most likly like this CD.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|When I first caught a glance at the trailer for this film, I thought to myself, \\"Why the heck is the Batmobile flying?... this movie is going to be terrible\\" but then I caught the next trailer of Bane blowing up a football field and I thought, \\"It might be OK after-all\\"? Flying from Bali to Australia, I had 5 hours to kill, and we had hired an Ipad to watch movies on, and this movie was the one I was looking forward to the most... I dunno, maybe I expected it to be a major blockbuster just as good as the first two Batman movies of this directors imagination, but third time turns out to not be a charm for everyone.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises or Batman 3 doesn't start off too well as Bane and his men hijack a plain to kidnap a nuclear physicist. The scene is ok, but doesn't create a mind blowing beginning to a movie. The background scenery was nice, the idea was there, but it felt rather too unrealistic to be possible to happen in the real world, and what made it worse was no more action comes along in the movie for quite some time from then. The plot of this movie takes place 8 years after the last movie. Bruce Wayne has hung up the Bat Cow and retired into his own misery. Which makes me wonder if spin offs of Bat Girl are going to be the next set of movies to come along of what happened in that 8 year gap? Anyway, Bane comes to Gothom City and tears up the joint, forcing Batman to get back into shape and hit the town again. Bane uncovers an unused speech from Commissioner Gordon that reveals the truth about Harvey \\"Two Face\\" Dent and exposes it to the city during his \\"blow up the town\\" campaign. The kid from \\"3rd Rock from The Sun\\" is a hot headed police officer who idolizes Batman and knows who he is... no big secret by now even if you haven't seen the movie, but heard people talking about who he will be most likely playing in the future spin off. Also Catwoman joins the adventure, and tho some people have dismissed her as not being hot enough to play Cat Woman, I did like the fact that she is a cat burglar, and thats how she adopts the name... and that's about the only decent idea I think this movie had.<br /><br />Batman calls upon Morgan Freeman once again to show him some nifty gadgets the army made a prototype of, but never used, even tho they work so perfectly! This time Batman has a flying machine that has enough firepower to take out a Tumbler! 3 or 4 to be precise! Holy Cow Batman, i'd slap Morgan Freeman around for not showing you that thing sooner! Like I said before, it looked stupid to me in the trailers, but when you realize this flying vehicle may be slightly plausible on the way it operates as a hover copter sort of vehicle, you can suspend belief for a moment and accept it, but then when Hollyweed get there dirty little paws on it and say, \\"Lets have it act like a jet plane with enough firepower to blow roofs off of buildings\\" well, yeah... you're pushing it too far and trying to hard to make a kids movie more than a teen or adult action flick.<br /><br />What Bane does to the City and the speeches he gives are just... I wish I could swear on here to express my utter disgust in just how embarrassing it must have been for all the actors and crew of this movie to see the final results. Bane's speeches and voice is just eff in g terrible. Catwoman was a pretty disappointing role too. It wasn't her look or acting, infact I liked that the look was more like the 1960's Catwomen of Lee Meridith, Ertha Kitt and Julie Newmar (however you spell their names). But it was the script she was given that failed to satisfy fans. Especially the ending.<br /><br />Any fans of Stargate excited to hear that Christopher Judge makes an appearance (Teal'c), expect to be VERY disappointed in the 12 seconds he is on screen. Obi Whan Kenobi stops by for a flashback, and The Scarecrow has a brief moment or two for some comic relief. The rest is filled with a story that could have been so much better than the over the top rubbish that was filmed and exposed here in Dark Knight Rises Eventually.<br /><br />Overall, the weakest of the trilogy. Too much talking and boring dialog, stupid speeches and not much excitement. This bat has flown high, gotten tired, stopped flapping, gone into a noise dive and crashed pretty hard into the ground... oh, and \\"trilogy?\\"... nah, I expect Penguin and Riddler will be next, gotta help set up Robin and Batgirl for the spin off's, probably even set up Huntress and make 6 spin off movies, then combine them all for one big Bat Marathon of Super Bat Avengers taking on all the bad guys that aren't dead yet. So stay on the look out, same Bat company, same Bat money makers, Same Bat Franchise.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|It has a very full sound. Kind of sounds like old Pink Floyd and John Lennon made it with a synth. Me likey.
0618680004|5.0|This is a great book and very thought provoking! I recommend this to anyone, no matter you religious belief. Don't let the title scar you away. I was also very happy with the speed the book arrived and the condition of the book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started out poorly, got better then ended up with an ending that shouldn't be (and didn't fit the hero's prospective at all) and totally unrealistic! Without giving the book away it's hard to write an accurate review.  Let me just say grammatically and narratively it is well written. The beginning of the book had me screaming \\" ENOUGH SELF SABBATOGE\\" to the hero.  By the middle of the book I felt as if ok, now we're getting somewhere and it's getting good but the ending was so wrong and vile on so many levels that it wasn't even unrealistic. The sociopathic co-dependancy thing is very disturbing.  The only reason I've given it 3 stars and not 2 is because it is well written and I know that some may find it worth reading.
1594744769|3.0|The shipping and quality of the book were great. I was not happy with the story. I was expecting a suspense novel, and it is not even close to that.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One  of the best movies I've ever seen. Action,comedy, good story... really great!!! 3D makes a big difference to me in the way I enjoyed the movie. #d was much better, don't know why. Just the experiance I guess
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|The 6th diary of a wimpy kid book was entertaining but not as funny as the rest but it was still great:)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another outstanding Follett book in the Century Trilogy; can't wait for the next one in the series. Lots of world history throughout the book and plenty of action. Characters were well-developed and very believeable. Book was hard to put down as I couldn't wait to read what was going to happen in the next chapter. All in all, a great read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a classic Vince Flynn book. Mitch Rapp at his best! An absolute must buy for a true fan.
B003XRELEI|4.0|Vonnegut was tired and crankier than ever by the time he wrote &#34;Breakfast of Champions&#34;  but so are we.  We are reminded when reading &#34;Breakfast&#34; that some perceptive souls like Vonnegut understood and decried  long ago the America of economic and environtmental degradation. He was ahead of the curve. As I reread him I recognize not only the world Iived in but the world I still live in, none the better for the intervening years.  His outrageous characters, including the author who appears in the story, make us laugh and wince.  This is the thinking man's uncomfotable laugh at the world we have made.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my daughter and i have a great time playing this together. i recommend this for the little girls.  a great game!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|A classic story of the grey world of spies brought to a stunning climax.  I think one of le Carre's better books before he went off the deep end of world conspiracies and evil capitalist plots.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Wish more folk would write about the quality of the Blu Ray disc rather than provide a summary of the story or a treatise of the historical accuracy.  No opinions here on acting or plot, just a review of the transfer quality.<br /><br />I do have the Standard Def DVD and I did not notice that much improvement in the video transfer.  While this movie was one of the first to use such a great amount of color grading and much CGI, there are areas in the video transfer that do contain a noticeable grain.  Nothing too distracting but it is there.  This is especially so in the first several minutes of the film and during the scene at the end where the king's wife receives back the amulet the king sent back to her.  The grain appears not to be present during the majority of the film and good detail can be seen throughout.  The colors are fairly sharp (as I said, this was a highly colorized production) There were no artifacts that I could see, nor aliasing or stair stepping.<br /><br />The disc defaults to Dolby Digital 5.1 so be sure to go to the audio selection to highlight the Dolby True HD 5.1 which really is the star of this transfer.  There is excellent use of your entire audio system, including the LFE channel, with much use of discreet audio from both fronts and rears.  The audio's use of discreet channeling is something to be appreciated as it is often the first thing they put in less effort for to keep costs down I guess.<br />Bottom line, the audio is the highlight of this BR transfer and is certainly Demo worthy.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras, 3 deleted scenes, commentary and a couple of interesting documentaries on the historical accuracy and what life was like for Spartans back then.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankswith a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B00908DDZM|5.0|After reading some reviews about people receiving the censored version, I panicked a bit before listening again and realizing that some of the lyrics were unlikely to be on a censored version - my CD is the full deal!<br /><br />As to the music, this is my favorite disc of the at least the past 6 months!  A lucky search to find the music in an advertisement led me to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis on YouTube and an hour enjoying the music and their videos.  It was a happy surprise that \\"The Heist\\" was newly available (and a sad discovery that Amazon has no other Macklemore & Ryan Lewis on disc).  Between YouTube and the MP3 samples on Amazon, it will be easy to tell if you would enjoy this music.  To me, the music is excellent and the lyrics have far more thought put into them than most popular music.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not the best Vince Flynn book, but one of the better ones I've read, and I have read all of them.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love Harry Potter and this collection was great to have all the discs in a slim case.  Great for people who just want the movies and not all the extra bonus features.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another classic Grisham novel to keep you enthralled. Anyone looking for a good read with some suspense thrown in should love this book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excellent continuation of the Percy Jackson saga.  This book kept me entertained and the Kindle version still included chapter text used in the book.
B001HN69B8|4.0|Beautiful to watch, thought provoking, and Heath's last film. The addition of Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell really added to this film. This film is definitely better on Blu-Ray.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I bought this without having heard any of the songs and was happy that I made the purchase! KISS hasn't missed a beat.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|App does not run on the Nexus 10.  Let me know when this is fixed and I will adjust my rating.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|Great songs! Wish they could have been placed on the original album. I assume that they were unable to be placed on the original album due to the length of each song.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have read everything Vince Flynn has written and enjoyed every book.  Keep them coming!  He is one of my favorite  writers.
B007DIQC90|3.0|I can't rate this CD higher than a 3 since I haven't given it to my wife yet. She had heard a coulple songs from the CD and really liked it so I bought the CD. I hope she likes the rest!
030758836X|4.0|great read with twists and turns the whole time!  really enjoyed how the book went back and forth between the two main characters.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this the week of black friday as a birthday present for someone, so I got it for a steal ($19.99).  That being said, I also bought this last year for $60.00 for myself, and do not regret paying the price at all.  The set comes in a beautifully done box, with an awesome, sturdy book.  Each disc is held in its own page, with each page having a perfectly picked picture encompassing each corresponding movie.  If you love the series, or even just the first movie, this set is totally worth it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George RR Martin did not fail to impress with this final novel in A Song of Ice and Fire series.  I had a hard tim putting this one down and even stayed up reading all night a couple of nights.  I was sad to see it all come to an end and actually wish there was more books to come. Not knowing how things end for some of the characters was hard but, I was pleased with this amazing novel.  Enjoy, Cheers!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This was a real surprise for me, and not the kind of novel I usually read.  I couldn't put it down - intelligent and sharp with a psychological edge, the plot twisting and turning among the red herrings.  It is a story without a hero, full of flawed, but interesting, characters.  I was hooked in the first couple of chapters, the author's pessimistic (realistic?) view of modern marriage and relationships, and Amy's descriptions of 'perfection in the female relationship role', in her invented diary, was classic for me!!  I will definitely be looking out for more Gillian Flynn.
1401322786|5.0|This book was a great read - profound, interesting, and will definitely be on my recommend list.  Mitch Albom never disappoints!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Harry Bosch. Can't get enough.Very engaging. Michael Connelly is one of my favorite writers. This will keep you reading
0525953728|4.0|This book is very interesting,  Gives one an idea of what our security is and how wonderful these men are for putting their lives on the line.  Highly recommend.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I love Harry Bosch. Can't get enough.Very engaging. Michael Connelly is one of my favorite writers.  This will keep you reading.
030758836X|2.0|Am a quarter of the way through this book and will probably never finish it.  The language turns me off to begin with and there is definitely too much wording - straying from the actual plot. I am sorry I bought it.  Not one I would recommend.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Not very much, if any, plot or character development.  The large amount of bare male skin wasn't enough to hold one's interest.  Not a good movie and would not recommend it.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|The ends on this stylus are really too large to easily and effectively hit the keys on my Motorola Razor phone touchscreen.  They are too soft to work for my husband on his Blackberry Bold. I did not find it helpful for my kindle fire.  I found both ends of the stylus to be very soft and this means that the tip easily \\"collapses\\" and the larger metal end hits more area on the screen than we want.  The stylus does have two different ends one more tapered than the other.  However, neither end worked for us.  The pocket clip is helpful for keeping the stylus handy.  All in all we both found it easier to use our fingers than the awkwardness of a stylus.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The technology behind the animation was two thumbs up!<br />The story line was easy to follow and kept you interested.<br />On a whole a must see.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is one of John's best books.  This book kept my interest from start to finish and kept me wondering what was next.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|the fifth season was great.  love the detective work .  no volience, no cursing. no out landist sex.  just great enterining. this and the mentalist are my favorite series for now,.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I like hidden object games and this is another fun and exciting one from G5!  The graphics are really great and the game works well on the kindle.  I am glad I purchased it!
B0053O89IS|5.0|i love this series, could not wait to get this one.  was everything i expected the seventh series of bones left me waiting for season eight.
0385535147|1.0|Modern editors fear to edit bestselling authors--it could cost them their job.  Bestselling authors dislike constrctive criticism: why should they listen? Their books are bestsellers.  Child and Connelley maintain quality but they're exceptional. Mr. Grisham has turned out a constructed clunker.  He's written well in the past.  Let's hope he willing to accept input next time.  Obviously no one told him the truth about this novel when it was still in manuscript.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really do get lost in time playing this game,  almost to the point of not wanting to stop.  Gameloft is becoming my favorite game maker.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent reading for older teenagers through to grandparents. Well thought out plot and consistent characters.  Kept me turning pages through to the last full stop.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason Mraz is very soulful, playful and I just love every song on this album. First one I have bought after hearing &#34;I Won't Give Up.&#34;

B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you loved the first book...this book is even better. This trilogy is a great read. Not since the twilight series have i read a series so quickly and couldn't put it down.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Rather than making our Kinect experience better, as the product suggests it's capable of, it only made things worse.  After installing the device the Kinect stopped tracking entirely.  Calibration did me no good; at first it couldn't find the floor, so I adjusted the height and pushed it forward to the lip of the tv stand; then it couldn't find anyone to track.  The tracking screen it showed looked very cloudy, and I wasn't able to make out any humanoid features in it, so I can understand why the Kinect couldn't, either.<br /><br />A close physical inspection of the lenses revealed what appeared to be smudges on one of the lenses (though they couldn't be cleaned), and some scratching on another.  I'm only assuming this had something to do with the problems I was having.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews, it seems the lens quality on this product is rather hit-or-miss.  I didn't care to try any others, so I simply returned my unit for a refund.<br /><br />It just doesn't sound like it works reliably enough.  I would not recommend.  Get the over-the-tv mount ([[ASIN:B004XV6ST4 Kinect TV Mount Clip]]), instead, if you're looking to improve on your playable area.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|NOTE: This is the same book which was earlier being sold for $2.99 however it was sold by the author. Now that it has been picked up by Penguin, they have set the price and its still not that much. This is still a 500-plus page story with a slightly different cover & of course the author mentioned this would be happening nearly 9 days ago on his blog.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Blood Song is another of those books that I discovered a few months earlier, thanks to Amazon's cool algorithm for suggesting titles I might like based on my previous \\"Buying and Search\\" history. Previously I had stumbled upon Zero Sight by B Justin Shier the same way and the way that book turned out to be, I have learnt to keep an eye out for such Amazon recommendations.<br /><br />Blood Song begins with a first person narrative featuring Lord Verniers Alishe Someren, a chronicler that has been chosen to write about the main character Vaelin Al-Sorna and about the journey that they both will undertake.  The story then begins Vaelin's past as when as a child he's commanded to join the Sixth Order of the Faith of the Unified Realm. Thus begins Vaelin's journey wherein he will learn to wield weapons and become a famed warrior of the unified realm that will also earn him many names all across various nations and regions. Friends and foes alike will be drawn to him in differing amounts. But when all is said and done, Vaelin's journey has only begun as the reader will learn more about his past as well as that of his realm.<br /><br />One searches for the next best thing in fantasy, often going through many books in search of the book that will enthrall you completely. I almost missed on this beauty by buying it but then never getting around to reading it. I owe thanks to Michael Sullivan for reminding me about this book and what a book it is. Beginning from the events in the past to the current story going on currently, this setup has been explored in various fantasy, historical and other genre novels.<br /><br />The most recent famous example being The Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. In fact a similarity between those two books can be seen in regards to the protagonist's story and their growth via a university/military school setting. What differentiates these two books is a terrific conclusion to the book as well as themes about war and its follies. Also this was my observation but I found some shades of David Gemmell in Anthony Ryan's storytelling style and prose. It is heartening to see a Brit take up the mantle of heroic, epic fantasy from one of fantasy's most distinguished writers as well as a fellow British writer.<br /><br /> This book is more akin to a traditional epic fantasy wherein it's set in a pseudo-European setting and with a world history that is unveiled slowly and tantalizingly. At the same time, there is a core mystery at the heart of this plotline, why was Vaelin sent to the sixth order? What really happened with his parents? Who is the One Who Waits? These questions and much more abound this volume and will tempt readers into coming back for the later parts of this trilogy. The book focuses in the past as well as the present and the author has tantalizingly kept both time periods shrouded in mystery. This thread is what powers the book throughout and makes the story such a strong one.<br /><br />Characterization is also a strong point in this opening volume, even though we get a singular narrative voice for the majority of the book. The author has created a fascinating side character cast particularly King Janus, Princess Lyrna just to name a few, these characters make the story even more fascinating and with the increase in POV character cast in \\"Tower Lord\\" (book II). I can't wait to see which other characters get their own narrative voices. The book ends on a strong note and with a twist that is hard to anticipate, giving the readers a complete story if they want to read just this book however I'm sure once the readers finish this book they will want to read \\"Tower Lord\\" the next in the Raven's Shadow trilogy.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan's Blood Song is a tremendous debut; it has a fast paced, action packed and character driven story. Qualities to admire in any genre story and most of all in an epic fantasy one. Give this book a read, if you have ever felt that Indie books have no quality to them, give this book a read if you are tired of the same morass of stories in the epic fantasy genre, give this book a read if you want a well written story by a newbie author and lastly give this book a read if you want to read a story that's closest to those written by David Gemmell.ook they will want to read \\"Tower Lord\\" the next in the Raven's Shadow trilogy.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan's Blood Song is a tremendous debut; it has a fast paced, action packed and character driven story.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|I really liked the writing style of William Landay.  The story of Defending Jacob was good and kept my interest throughout.  The ending was a complete surprise which made an interesting twist to the story.  I liked this book alot but did not love it.  However, it is definitely a good read and would recommend it.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book was eye-opening.  I've always been healthy in my eating habits and cooking.  This book has caused me to re-think some things.  I have a thyroid disorder and the suspicion that wheat may be a cause of auto-immune disease is a new theory that I hadn't heard before.  After reading the book, I am modifying my diet to eliminate wheat products, processed food and buy organic as much as possible.  The book was well-written and intelligent.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of his best.  Seen Mr. Flynn on Imus and he looks a lot better than the previous<br />time he appeared on the show.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this story!! Although it was a little slow at first, it definitely picked up on the second half. Its a scary thought being lost and alone by yourself but he had more than enough courage to survive. Some details were very graphic so hope you have a strong stomach. We all have the fight for survival in us and this is his story!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Already a fantastic movie, but even better in Bluray!!!  I wish they would produce &#34;I, Robot 2&#34;, it would be a box office hit!!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|For the most part I like the way the cards automatically move when touched, but sometimes it chooses the wrong card or moves to a different stack than the one  I want. That can be annoying. Also, it sometimes does not load properly. Otherwise, fun game.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The clarity that Bluray brings enhances the home viewing of this movie filled with mind blowing special effects!!!  This is a must buy.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I called Lifeproof because I was having problems with it and they told me to give the serial number.  I told them and they said the serial number was a fake and that the case I had was not a real Lifeproof.  Do not buy this.  Get the real thing.
0802798225|4.0|\\"Perfect Chemistry\\" introduces us to the Fuentes brothers who each feature in the three part Perfect Chemistry series.<br />In this first novel our lead protagonist is Alex Fuentes, who is the eldest of the three brothers and the man of the house (since the death of their father). He has a tough as nails reputation and is bound by his sense of duty to protect and help provide for his mother and younger brothers. As a gang member of the Latino Blood he is also bound by the duties of the gang. Even though he is about to commence his senior year at Fairfield High School, he knows he has no future beyond the Latino Bloods ... until Brittany Ellis is assigned as his chemistry partner and the chemistry between them sizzles outside of class.<br />As the poor Mexican boy from the south side of town, Alex initially sees Brittany as the picture perfect white girl who lives a life of privilege without a care in the world. Brittany has spent her whole life trying to please her parents and create an illusion to the outside world of the perfect life ... the perfect daughter, student and girlfriend.  It is not until Alex enters her world, that she begins to realise that she does not want to be that person anymore. Breaking up with her boyfriend and defying her parents, Brittany begins to fall in love with the Alex the more time she spends with him. After realising that Brittany has been hiding her own pain and he uncovers the layers to her true self, Alex finds himself finally dreaming about a future with the girl who has captured his heart.<br />Alex knows that in order to have a future with Brittany and become the man he wants to be, he needs to cut his ties with the gang. The only problem is, the Latino Blood will not let Alex go. Alex finds himself face to face with the gang leaders, putting his life on the line for an attempt at a real future he never knew he wanted, until Brittany Ellis became is chemistry partner.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is an enjoyable and addictive read. The relationship between Alex and Brittany is engaging as they try to deal with not only their cultural differences, but also manage the expectations bestowed upon them. As they try to immerse themselves into each other worlds, you feel their angst when they are faced with the prejudices of family and friends. The dialogue between Alex and Brittany is well written and when Brittany shows her strength and matches Alex's wit and sarcasm, you cannot help but be entertained. The book is written from both Alex and Brittany's perspectives, which enhances the emotion of the storyline, as we get to understand more intimately how they really feel, what they are thinking and the reasons behind their actions. As a young adult novel, I believe that Simone Elkeles did a great job in delivering the chemistry between Alex and Brittany without writing more explicitly as would be expected in adult romance novels. When Alex and Brittany have sex for the first time, the scene was written in a simple manner and yet you felt the tenderness and your imagination was captured by the genuine love they have for one another.<br />I also enjoyed and found it interesting, for the author to end the novel by taking us 23 years into the future and giving us a glimpse of how the lives of Alex and Brittany turned out.<br />If you enjoy reading young adult fiction, this is a great series to pick up and start reading. It is an easy read and has you turning each page wondering whether they will ever be able to get past their differences, in order to find their happy ending. The next book in the series is \\"Rules of Attraction\\" which tells the story of middle brother Carlos.
B000GLDOXS|5.0|As a member of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) at Ft. Benning, GA, this movie brings back so many memories for me because this was the first time in American military history (and I think the world nations) that used helicopters (UH-1 Iroquois \\"Huey\\" helicopter) as gunships and ferrying infantry troops into the heat of battles, as well as for Medevac flights.  When the Division was activated into the Vietnam War, it's name was changed to 1st Cavalry Air Mobile.  Signed: \\"Sky Soldier\\" 1962-1964.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. My husband has a Kindle Fire too and we've been competitive with this game. I have advanced faster than him and he tries to keep up. It's a good game to keep your mind working. I'd recommend it.
B009FXIICK|3.0|this game is okay at best......granted it gets hard pretty fast.....its still only ok.....great time waster though.....and we all need those.....
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is addicting and challenging. Each round they throw something differi at you to keep you coming back. Runs great on Galaxy S III.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I won't review the show to me it's a great show and my favorite show but if your reading this then you pretty much know the show Smallville!!!!! This Review is for this release!!!!!<br />I love how they made this with the added exclusive bonus features!!!!!! Inside the box the two book style cases have a lot of pictures from the series and there very good quality pictures!!!!!!!! The Episode guide gives you a complete description of each episode and special features!!!!! The Daily Planet newspaper is also great!!!!! I think the Aquaman Pilot on here was really good I believe it would have made a great series the 1961 Pilot of Superboy was good too shows it on like one of those classic floor model tvs like my grandma used to have!!!!!!<br />Now for the issue I have is with how the DVD's are packaged they are in those book style cases and are in there very tight and it's not easy to get them out if your careful pulling them out the disc won't get damaged but the more you take it out and put it back in you will most certainly scratch the disc!!!!! So I reccomend buying a DVD Binder which doesn't cost very much to put the discs in that way you won't have to worry about the discs getting scratched then just put the box on the shelf as it is !!!!!!! Especially for how much you pay for this box set!!!!!! Now what I did is since the discs are the exact same as the individual releases just they no longer have pictures on the they have the Kryponian images on them but when u load disc it's the exact same!!!!!!! I own all the individual releases but I wanted this box set for extras and exclusive bonus features included!!!!!!!! So what I did was just left my individual relases in their cases butchanged a couple of the cases to be able to fit 7 Discs in the case so that i could put the 2 bonus Discs in there!!!!  I then took the rest of the DVD's out of this box set put them in a DVD binder took the little books out of the individual releases and sold it to a buddy of mine!!!!!!!So if you have the individual releases but u still want this do something like I did!!!!!! So you have the cool box it's contents and the 2 exclusive discs but you can make some money off it if you already own the individual relases by doing as I did and seeing if you know someone who would be interested in buying just the discs off you!!!!!! Either way if your buying this or whatever defintely buy a DVD binder to put the DVD's in to protect them!!!!! Every Smallville Fan new or old would love this release it's great accept for the way the DVD's are stored but as said the DVD Binder is a cheap remedy!!!!!!!

0385536828|5.0|I borrowed [[ASIN:B007T99ENE Sweet Tooth]]from my library and if I owned it would be covered with markings and notes I liked the book so much or if I read it on kindle I would have almost everything highlighted.  I know everyone won't like it the same way I did because it is not [[ASIN:B00354YA4A Atonement]]  Maybe you have to be more or less the author's age and remember when the cold war was still real.  I remember the IRA-- my father didn't like our parish priest sending them money, I remember when things weren't disposable.<br /><br />I felt from the very start the author was writing a personal book that revealed a part of himself.  The main character Serena is described as a compulsive speed reader. I felt the books she read were the books the author read. When we meet the character that I think represents McEwan he gives us even more books and authors and I did write them all down. I felt it was a little bit slow in the beginning and you do have to want to go along with the story  the author is telling. To me it is a love story but it also shows the way Britain was fighting the cold war with authors and books even after the terrorist act that killed the athletes at the Olympics in Germany in 1972 and the IRA was still active.<br /><br />The book is dedicated to Christopher Hitchens and the author in the book writes a short story with two twin brothers one an atheist and the other an Anglican priest another way I thought the author was letting us know a little bit of himself.<br /><br />The book made me want to read everything else I haven't read by the author and all the books he referenced but I know I won't but I'll try.<br />One thing I wrote down from the book \\"Writers owed their readers a duty of care of mercy\\"  and I felt he accomplished this.
0316228532|5.0|Yes, Pagford. No, not Hogwarts. Pagford.<br /><br />There's no magic, no heroes or heroines, no epic battle between good and evil. There's a sudden death, a vacant council seat, and a too-small town in which people know too much about each other and care too little.<br /><br />If you're looking for a feel-good, humorous book that leaves you all warm and fuzzy inside, this isn't it. But if you're open to a novel that requires you to challenge your (likely subconscious) preconceptions about people, love, struggle, circumstance, selfishness, and the shades of ourselves that we hide from the world in order to project a picture-perfect image.. well, you'll probably be fascinated by this story.<br /><br />You won't like all of the characters, but you'll recognize yourself and people you know in each of them. You may not like the swearing, the depictions of sex and violence, and the drug use, but you'll feel their authenticity and (hopefully) appreciate the honesty behind them.<br /><br />I loved this book, not because it made me happy or gave me a cheery, positive outlook on life, but because I'm grateful for the way it confronts the parts of humanity that we try to pretend don't exist, splays them open, and refuses to poke them back in for the sake of a neat-and-happy conclusion.<br /><br />Above all other books, I value those that are more honest than real life could ever dare to be, and this is one of them.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Of all the apps I have, cross me, and cross me color have the best support as far as updates. Of all the games I play, these two games keep me coming back for each update. I absolutely love these games. It's like Sudoku but with pictures!!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I'm so confused why everyone likes this book.  Maybe I didn't give it a fair chance.  It starts great and then its 100 pages of a couple people walking up and down stairs talking to people.  What am I missing?
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like these books because I am not normally a romantic novel reader.  I, however, found myself reading until 3:00 in the morning because I couldn't put it down. I would find myself totally lost in the book and hours would disappear. I like the fact that I could download the trilogy in one bundle so when I finished one I didn't have to wait to go on to the next book. I have recommended this bundle to friends.  This is one HOT bundle!!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was beautiful. I realize now how my actions effect others. I hope this book brings as much clarity and happiness into other readers lives as it did for mine. :)

B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading the first book, I wasn't sure if I wanted to read the second one. I'm glad I did. I didn't want to put it down. Now I can't wait until May for the third book.
0714864803|4.0|I was really pleased when I picked up a copy of The Lebanese Kitchen. This book is beautifully presented with mostly two recipes per page and some lovely photos of the food. I love Middle Eastern food so will be using this book often. I am a little disappointed that the directions of the second recipe I tried, Lemon, Rose Water and Cardamom Brulee, page 430, neglects to advise how and when the Lemon juice and Rose Water should be added to the rest of the ingredients. If you follow the recipe word for word you will end up with a basic brulee minus the Lemon and Rose Water. Such a pity the proof readers missed this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not much of a reader but I finished all three books on my Kindle within five days. It was a very &#34;adventerous&#34; read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but I just enjoyed this series too much to sit back and say nothing. Thanks for keeping me up way too late for several nights in a row.
0985081821|5.0|The Forever Girl is the first in a new series by author Rebecca Hamilton and I absolutely loved it.  Sophia is a tremendous heroine, easily loved within moments of beginning her story.  She is an outcast in a teeny town, shunned because of how others perceive her.  To make matters worse, she is virtually alone in the world, making her a character that you just want to hug and make everything all better for her.  All of the characters were wonderfully developed, many of them throwing me for a loop as time went on.  I loved that even the less central characters had their own distinct personalities and stories.  That made for a fantastically fun read.<br /><br />I loved the twists and turns that the plot took, keeping me turning the pages.  Just as soon as I thought I had things reasoned out, something would happen to change everything.  The story went back and forth in time periodically, but it did so seamlessly, strengthening rather than muddying the story.  One of my favorite parts of the book was the dedication to accuracy and detail to Sophia's Wiccan ways.  This can be lacking in witchy fiction and can be disappointing if you know better.  So I truly appreciated that aspect.<br /><br />I truly cannot wait for the next book in this series!
B004I744AS|5.0|more than just a dictionary! you can enjoy other activities like word games and trivia as well as perform searches for other languages

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I don't understand how people can sit here and rip on a format that isn't compatible with your precious iTunes (it is by the way). You have to calm down and look at what you have here- Not only the Blu-Ray for your 1080p TV needs but the standard definition DVD as well to go with the code. First let me say I am an iPhone & iPad owner but one thing we have to keep in mind is that not everybody has one or either of these devices. Typical of Apple users, we think we are the only people in existence that are on the right side when Apple is one of the biggest companies that limit our usage in one way or another other. Not only can you stream the Ultraviolet copy on the Apple devices, you can download each one to put on whatever you device you have. Sure, it takes a little longer (about 15 minutes) but it can be done, I have done it. Next- Read the package or product description. It says Ultraviolet Digital Copy not Digital Copy. In my eyes, the straight digital copy is almost useless to me and about 75% of the planet. If you have a smart TV or set top streaming box or a Google TV then you should have access to Vudu or Flixster or any of the other services that are UV compatible. I can access my account from ANYBODY's TV or box and watch a UV title and you are complaining that you can't watch this on a 9.7\\" screen? Give me a break, hardly anybody watches a film on a screen that small so much that they are fighting for its existence against a superior format. All that you folks are succeeding in doing here is actually reducing the rating level on the FILM ITSELF, not what is inside the case! Out of the (at this time) 46 negative reviews, most are only about the digital copy. Maybe do a little research first, not just on the item you are buying but also on a newer format that you don't understand instead of ripping on it because it threatens your 10\\" screens. We don't like what we don't understand therefore we will not embrace it, such as the case here.  I hated UV, hated it!  Until I actually read what it was, what it was capable of and who was backing it. When the big 4 studios and a bunch of the others are behind it then we can assume this may be around for a while, it could very well be the whole future of home video. I am not only buying UV titles but also titles from retailers like Amazon that are strictly in the cloud. This isn't for everyone by any stretch but it will be once ISP's get put in their place & the cost per film gets reduced more, which has been the case lately. If you are an iWhatever user then buy your films from iTunes, simple as that. If you have an Apple TV box you can watch them on an actual screen where you don't need to squint to catch the finer details.  I don't just own an iPad & and iPhone, I own a Kindle Fire HD, Apple TV box, Nexus 7 tablet, Roku box and a few other devices that have given me the opportunity to try all formats and in my opinion, this is the best route right now. They are giving us the best of both worlds, physical & digital. I thank those who took the time to read this and do not take what I am saying here the wrong way, just use a different forum. Best way to rail against something new is to not buy it. Though I think once you give it a try you will come to like it's convenience. Or not, but give it a try first. Adapt or die as they say. Oh yeah, the movie was awesome too! Nolan knows how to make 'em!t!  Until I actually read what it was, what it was capable of and who was backing it.

0399157565|5.0|I enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell's books.  This book exceeded my expectations.  It was an excellent read.  Recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B001GSTOAM|4.0|This common-sensical book allows coders to realize their potential by reinforcing concepts that should come naturally to a logic-driven profession.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Good Book, but a lot of it is common sense and it should be taught in College Courses as a textbook substitute.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is such a fun movie! It isn't your typical &#34;monster&#34; movie, but has a fun story line, great cast members and is just an all-around enjoyable hour plus of fun for preteens and adults too.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I had never heard of Walt Longmire before they made the TV show and after watching, I decided to look into the books.  They are very good and I wish he would write quicker.  I'm all caught up.
B00913P6G0|5.0|This kid is the truth.  Young hip hop artist who is lyrical yet true to the streets.  Disk one is a conceptual experience that takes you on a journey.  The second disk is short - three song.  But those three songs are bangers!  This album reminds me of a classic Masta Ace theme album combined with tupac-like tongue in cheek consciousness, and Ghostface-like layered metaphors.  Big praise, but I think it is warranted.
1439127700|2.0|The Kindle version is $4 more than the paperback version, which should never be the case. The Kindle version should always be cheaper than any new copy of a paperback, and the only way this will happen is for people (like me) to vote with their wallets. I want to read this book, but will seek it out at the library rather than overpay for the Kindle version.

B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Love this DVD.<br />Andre Rieu is fun to watch and the music is well performed. Great showmanship is seen in this presentation from an impressive ensemble of talented musicians and singers. The sights and sounds from a people not that distant from us.<br />In viewing, I am noticing the voyeur aspects. It is fun to see the audience enjoying the performances. Their faces are a treasure.<br />I read someone say there are too many audience shots. For me, that's part of the gold found here.<br />Enjoy<br />PS... on my display the video on this DVD is clear and crisp. No discrepancies were seen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is great, but it needs some things. like in creative mode it needs ways to blow up TNT, bedtime, and buckets. in survival mode it needs armor, buckets, caves, nether portals, and lava. now don't get me wrong, it's a great game! you can do lots of things in it. but on a kindle fire it doesn't have the stuff I said. great game though!!!!!!  worth 7 dollars!!!!!!!
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I'm not a fan of the Mummy series but my wife really wanted this set so it was a great (and easy) way to satisfy a Christmas gift.  I prefer this set of movies to the one about a scorpion king and while the female character in the 3rd movie was not the same as the first two, it's still better than looking at the Rock for 2 hours.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|great for driving with. takes at least 10 plays to appreciate all the details. these three geezers....threezers still got punch. triorrific!
0547569653|5.0|Like most of the world, I read \\"Born to Run\\" a couple years ago and learned about Scott Jurek at that time. When I found out Scott had his own book, I immediately dove right in, and am so happy I did. Much like Born..., this is a very inspiration story of an incredible athlete in a sport that doesn't get much mention in society. I greatly appreciate Scott's brutal honesty about his upbringing and struggles, and to get a glimpse on the secrets to his success. While this is a book that revolves around running, its appeal is for runners and non-runners alike.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Wow!  These 2cd's really do surprise you with each new track that you hear.  I kept hearing the cuts on Pandora and was amazed to find they were coming from the same cd, this one.  I had to buy it.  You won't be disappointed if hou do the same.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book was just what I was looking for at this time.<br />The book is about Tim's specific goals, but it's also about the METHOD by which the reader can experiment and improve his/her own life. I really enjoyed the book and read it completely in a few days in my spare time.<br /><br />There are hundreds of concepts and ideas in this book. Thousands of statements. Out of all of it I took about one page of dense notes. From that I created 19 goals. I started in on them immediately and am seeing progress.<br /><br />One thing which resonated with me was the Minimum Effective Dose concept. Wow, awesome. That alone was worth 100x the purchase price of the book.<br /><br />You could do the same thing for 'x' 'y' and 'z' in your life. Its up to you what those are, Ferriss demonstrates basically how to 'hack your life'. His enthusiasm in trying things, especially with regard to his own body and health and skills, is totally contagious.<br />I realized that even in my busy day I do have time to experiment with routines, food, supplements, etc.. to better myself.<br />And, there were a few facts in this book that made me just think WOW, of course; why didn't I think of that. It doesn't matter what it was for me, but you might find something like that in the book applicable to your own life.<br /><br />The author's style of writing is casual and entertaining. I found the use of the 'f-bomb' unnecessary except when quoting someone who actually said it; this book is for adults.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />I also bought his 4 hour cook book (on kindle because its a 600 page brick!)
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I shouldn't have to play so many levels hundreds of times to get lucky and get three stars.  Too much luck based repeat bullcrap for a casual game. F you Rovio, I'm done giving you money
B008XG1X18|5.0|My wife got me into Pinterest as we are redoing the house. I also use it to design my future back yard barbeque. Really like Pinterest and this is the perfect app for getting Pinterest on my Kindle Fire!  Works great! I've only accessed Pinterest through this app on my Kindle.  Never had a problem with it.  Works well definetly recommend it for anyone redoing a house, building a garage or any kind of do-it-yourselfer.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I absolutely loved this game. Great story line with amazing graphics. I felt like I was &quot;in&quot; the story. Option to play mah jong instead of h/o was a great option. Definately worth the money. Waiting for the next game G5!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is perfect for OCD people out there like me. it allows me to take notes for anything and everything. super easy to use and organize. everything is dated and easily accessable. I can link my email to it as well. its really amazing this is a free app because its so well thought out that I would even pay for it. cant say enough positive things about it!
B00271SFB6|3.0|Not a big fan of Daniel Craig in this role.  Takes himself too seriously.  Prior Bond actors appeared more comfortable in the role and were able to use sarcasm and wit more effectively.
B00ABWYG16|2.0|Another great band gone over the hill.<br />What possessed them to do something like this?<br />The whole thing is in French, PLEASE!<br />The female vocals are nothing but annoying.<br />Where is the METAL?<br />Save your money and hope they come to their senses.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sorry, but I quit reading about halfway through.  I'm not a prude at all, but it seems to be the same (very explicit) thing over and over again.  I got bored.  And I'm really confused how they're going to make a non-XXX-rated movie out of it... I guess it will be a short film?

0071422943|5.0|I originally bought this book because I was tired of my profs constantly referencing it but never requiring it for my courses.  As such, having a hard-copy in my possession that I can drag along with me to my unit operations labs has been an invaluable time saver.  As I grow more accustomed to using it, the more I realize how useful it is, whether writing UO reports or studying for the FE.
082300659X|5.0|I choosed this rating because the book impressed me and because it has been extremely helpful for me. I am following every exercise that J. Aristides proposes at the end of every chapter.<br /><br />I like everything, from the examples and images to the exercises and comments, including the references.<br /><br />It can be useful to every one who wants to start or practice drawing. It is much better than other texts that I have borrowed to my friends.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|It's hard not to appreciate one of the greatest poets this country has produced.  And we're so lucky he's still churning out wonderful stories like the title track.  A Dylan fan since his first album came out, there isn't an artist out there that can match his creativity.

B000MQPKVG|5.0|Thackeray's novel about the vanity of ambition has much in common with the apes in 2001 and the thugs in A Clockwork Orange. Barry Lyndon is a person to whom things happen, meaninglessly. He sets his sights on becomng important, but not on controlling himself, his impulsive ignorance. He floats through life, which thinks is one big gamble. He loses.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is very enjoyable and not formulaic.  The plot keeps you guessing and you are not sure which character you favor or want to win.  I definitely recommend it as a vacation/light reading!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|A devout worshipper here since late 70s. Have *every* album and a handfull of bootlegged concerts. All around great buy in quality. Love the rehearsal which was a great idea and in some ways a better performance. JP's guitar solos are very good but only sporadically perfect(can I use the word orgasmic?) and therefore not his best - i.e. LA forum '72 or Earls Court - '75, but what do you expect....<br /><br />Just got back from seeing The Who live and this blu ray is 10X better.<br /><br />Highly recommended and as I said probably the true and final CODA.<br /><br />BTW they all look remarkably fit after such a long period. No more drugs as far as I can tell - way to go JP!<br />JPJ has only got a partially receded hairline after 30+ years  - what cool aid does he drink?!?<br /><br />Hope they make a final tour -hint hint?!? How bout a ,mixture of LZ, RP solo, JPJscream for help, JP's DW2 outrider and JPJ can supply the cool aid :-)
0525952926|5.0|This book is second in the Trilogy. It is so easy to read and the 900 some pages just fly by. I love Ken Follett's books. They are all good. I can't wait for the third in this series.

B007PFD90G|4.0|Shocked that this book was such a page-turner!  A very personal memoir by Salman Rushdie, about the decade he lived in hiding, under the threat of the Iranian fatwa declared against him for publication of his novel The Satanic Verses.  A true blockbuster, although more cerebral and political than action/thriller.  Joseph Anton suffers from an abundance of name-dropping (hard to keep everyone straight), and a certain arrogance throughout.  I can't decide if that is nature or circumstance, but it was a fascinating read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp at his best. A thrill a minute with the right bad guys and the right good guys.Flynn does it again.
0547564651|5.0|The narrative and style of the book is very different from any other book you'd find about parenting and child rearing. Besides, I found most of the real stories and the research presented very entertaining reading and a fresh and natural approach to this eternal topic

1616614609|5.0|As someone who's played card games such as the Star Wars CCG and Pokemon (on the gameboy) many, many, many moons ago (and have somehow found my way back into this mess through deciding on going analog and collecting board games instead of video games the past few months), this reignites an old flame.<br /><br />There's a couple things I like about this game that stands out for me.<br /><br />Gameplay wise, the asymmetrical gameplay design is impressive. No player-designed decks that play themselves here. The game involves deck design as well as a steady handed player well versed in the bluff as well as the tell and call. Risk benefit analysis is made in every move. It's tense.<br /><br />From a fiscal spending standpoint, the game is much cheaper to get into as well with a predetermined set of cards released and no randomization in the setup of this core set as well as future expansions to come.  No having to buy rares here to beef up your deck here, its a level playing field.<br /><br />One must be warned that due to the setup of the game, it is complex to learn its rules. The rulebook does do its best to make things straight forward and clear, but a mild to moderate curve is present depending on experience. Videos are available online to aide in its understanding.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those looking for a 2 player complex card game requiring deck building in the metagame or for those that enjoy the essence of hacking or protecting their servers from being hacked. If you're curious. Give it a shot.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I was a little skeptical after the album Bionic being, not terrible, but not the greatest. This album is absolutely incredible and even though she may be weird and not like to cover up herself up, it's great. It's an album of rejuvenation and embracing herself and her weight. Does she care about her weight? Obviously, but as of now she doesn't care what people think. This album is not as good as Stripped, but pretty damn close in today's music standards. She is one of a very few singers that actually can sing and are not auto-tuned.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|The first thing people asked me when I told them I had seen \\" The Dark Knight Rises \\" was..is it as good as The Dark Knight ?  I couldn't really answer since they are two distinctly different movies and TDKR actually contains plot elements that started in \\" Batman Begins \\".  It would be impossible to top Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker so for that reason alone I suspect that most viewers' fave of the trilogy will always be TDK.  Having said that,the character of Banes is just as terrifying in that his is a much more calculated and intentional string of crimes. The scene where he beats Batman to a pulp is disturbing and hard to watch but makes the hero's eventual rise from the proverbial ashes that much more satisfying.<br />  There are plot twists that you don't see coming,a sneak peak at what could ( hopefully ) be a sort of spin off from this series,and a truly clever ending that leaves you wondering up until the last few moments of the film.<br />  As for the \\"elephant in the room \\"..it is a shame that,for some people anyway,this movie will forever be tied to the awful,cowardly,heartbreaking events in that movie theater in Colorado. I talked to people who refused to see this cinematic masterpiece in a proper theater because of some fear of the same thing happening again. These folks really missed out. This is one of those films that needs to be seen on a huge screen in all it's IMAX ,full blown,epic glory. I will be genuinely surprised if this movie doesn't get some nods at Oscar time. In my opinion,this is Bale's best performance as the Caped Crusader and Gary Oldman is,again,just splendid as Commissioner Gordon. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is fantastic as...well...a police officer ( I don't want to spoil it for those people that haven't seen the movie yet ).  This is a fitting end to an amazing series of films. An instant classic just as the other 2 films in this franchise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so erotic and funny!  That is a great combination.  It was a delicious romp through a sexual underworld!  Loved it!

B0000017CA|5.0|Acid Bath's debut full-length, 1994's \\"When The Kite String Pops,\\" is a shape-shifting, single genre-defying album that blends sludge, doom, and stoner metal with elements of thrash/speed metal, hardcore, grindcore, punk, death metal, black metal, melodeath, and groove metal. There are also a few industrial metal tinges present, here. So, in short, imagine Eyehategod playing at the same time as Crowbar, Black Sabbath, Pentagram, Discharge, Pantera, Amebix, old school Neurosis, Venom, Celtic Frost, Motorhead, Killing Joke, Godflesh, and Morbid Angel.<br /><br />Frontman Dax Riggs may opt for clean vocals quite frequently, but he is also known to bellow, growl, and shriek like there's no tomorrow. And his vocals are laid over an arsenal of killer, gripping, and brutally heavy riffage, thick, heavy, dirty-sounding bass fills, and bludgeoning rhythms. It all comes together to form one extremely diverse, intelligent, distinctive, innovative, and memorable affair. It is first-and-foremost a very heavy record, but it is not afraid to be tuneful and/or harmonic.<br /><br />\\"Kite\\" is also a one-of-a-kind release in that it made Acid Bath a hugely influential band, despite releasing only two proper albums (with the other being 1996's \\"Paegan Terrorism Tactics\\") that never garnered much of an underground/cult following. Indeed, Riggs and the boys would go on to inspire the next several generations of sludge and doom metal groups (see: Soilent Green, Down, Goatwhore, Watch Them Die, etc.).<br /><br />It all begins with an ominous wall of guitar feedback. From there, \\"The Blue\\" then adopts a droning, dirty-as-hell, swamp-bred main riff. Meanwhile, Riggs' vocals are trading off between Al Jorgensen-like angsty growls and accomplished clean singing. The song gradually gains speed and momentum, flowing smoothly into thrashy tempos, and tossing in a few whammy-bar solos along the way for good measure. \\"Tranquilized\\" continues this speediness, as a fairly brisk number, albeit one that retains a decisive doom metal feel. (The use of Black Sabbath-copped riffage sees to that.) Later, the number slows way down, to a sluggish, churning main riff, droning tempo, and dreary clean vocals. Needless to say, the song alternates these two styles/tempos to excellent, and very catchy and memorable effect.<br /><br />\\"Cheap Vodka\\" (and a later track, \\"Toubado Koomi\\") are both just-over two minutes long, but are nonetheless very epic and expansive cuts. They cover everything from ripping, chugging thrash to sludge/doom metal, and even venture into brutal crust punk territory. \\"Finger Paintings Of The Insane,\\" however, brings the tempo all the way back down again, with hefty, chugging riffs, really fat bass riffs, and thundering drums. Add whiney, squealing guitar feedback to the mix, and the end result is a very dense and sludgy, Eyehategod-inspired number. In fact, it could even be an EHG b-side if it didn't also have some creepily atmospheric choral voices (which add an interesting and ominous touch to the musical arrangements). Next comes \\"Jezebel,\\" a very moving and bullying song that brings stomping double bass drums, foundation-shaking rhythms, and thrashy riffs. Things slow down by the time the track reaches the chorus, but then it all speeds back up again, with brisk, churning -- and sometimes buzzsaw-fast -- riffing and catchy vocals.<br /><br />A tiny ray of sunshine shines through the mix for the next track, \\"Scream Of The Butterfly,\\" which is a gorgeous, gothic-tinged ballad that is comprised of pretty acoustic guitar strumming, an epic acoustic solo, and impressive clean singing. (Some very dark and disturbing lyrical poetry is also included, here.) Immediately following that, though, Acid Bath drop the doom metal anvil with a bang. After a fade-in, feedback-laden intro, the comedy-tinged \\"Dr. Seuss Is Dead\\" drops a huge, crushing, pure doom riff in your lap. From there, the tune proceeds to gain energy and momentum so that by it has speeded wayup (to near thrash territory) by its end. \\"Dope Fiend\\" similarly uses both fast and slow tempos, and does so very well and memorably. It begins as a fast-yet-simultaneously doomy piece with crunching, steamrolling riffs before slowing way down and droning on-and-on with one looping, and almost hypnotically-repetitious sludge riff.<br /><br />Later on, tracks ten and twelve, \\"God Machine\\" and \\"What Color Is Death\\" are two uncompromisingly crushing songs backed by huge, brutal, double-bass-led riffage that lumbers over your eardrums like a truckload of falling logs. In between these two tracks, though, is a far-less threatening number: \\"Morticians Flame,\\" which plays like a piece of Southern-tinged hard rock. It features crunchy, churning, industrial-strength riffage, a good use of clean backing vocals, and some noteworthy bass work (including a bass solo near the beginning).<br /><br />Then the listener is allowed to catch a breath, as \\"Bones Of Baby Dolls\\" is another nicely melodic oasis that is long on dreamy acoustic strings and warm, soaring, almost Opeth-ian-worthy crooning. As good as \\"Bones...\\" is, though, it is almost overshadowed by the album's closing anthem, the very Melvins-esque \\"Cassie Eats Cockroaches.\\" It boasts one dangerous, mesmerizingly repetitive sludge/doom metal riff, a deep, massive groove that could wipe out a whole city, and plenty of tight and precise, death metal-derived double bass pummel.<br /><br />To this day, \\"When The Kite String Pops\\" remains an undisputed masterpiece, and a sludge/doom/stoner metal landmark, even going on twenty-whole-years after its initial release. What else needs to be said?up (to near thrash territory) by its end. \\"Dope Fiend\\" similarly uses both fast and slow tempos, and does so very well and memorably.

B0049J2CKE|4.0|We watched this movie with our 3 year old son and he loves it. It's a cute movie that has inspired our son to pay more attention to what we do in the kitchen.<br />The only thing I didn't like about the movie is the use of the word &#34;hell&#34; and a few other words we'd rather not have our 3 year old learn just yet. Seemingly all Disney movies have SOME &#34;bad&#34; word in them you have to deal with. Otherwise it's a cute movie that might spark your child's interest in becoming a little chef one day!
B009POCG2C|4.0|Clint Eastwood stars in (but not directs) \\"Trouble with the Curve,\\" a drama about a veteran Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus Lobel and his estranged 33-year-old daughter Mickey (Amy Adams). The film is directed by Eastwood's long-time collaborator (assistant director/producer) Robert Lorenz making his feature film debut here.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, whose latest (and possibly last) assignment is to travel to North Carolina and scout a promising high school player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill). Being unsure of his ability to see whether Bo is really worth the No.1 pick, Gus's friend and boss Pete Klein (John Goodman) asks Gus's daughter Mickey to accompany her father, whose eyesight is failing. Mickey, herself an able lawyer (who has an important presentation to deliver), reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />The film is always fun when Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams share the screen. Justin Timberlake as Johnny Flanagan, a young Boston Red Sox scout (and romantic interest for Amy Adams's character) is also very good. Except for John Goodman, however, supporting players fare less well, including the talents like Bob Gunton, Ed Lauter, Matthew Lillard and Robert Patrick, with one-dimensional characters that almost look like caricatures.<br /><br />That the film's story is predictable didn't bother me much. I could even forget the incredible turn of events at the end of the film that is too good to be true. I know this is a Hollywood film, sentimental and melodramatic, and as such it is enjoyable. But with a pair of a grizzled Clint Eastwood with understated charisma, and always reliable Amy Adams as his daughter, it is obvious that this film could have been something more.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|nothing more to say....if your a fan of John Hiatt his work has been generally very good to excellent, and this cd is on the high end in my estimation.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and surprisingly addictive.  Once you level up and collect a few pride tiers it is almost unlimited play! Have fun!

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|A riveting story about a group of heroic SEALS that go to rescue a kidnapped CIA operative.  There's plenty of action with 'head' shots, quick-moving operations and a ton of reasons to be proud of our elite fighters. It was particularly noteworthy that there were active duty SEALS in the movie, and obviously many of the sequences were real and authentic.  A good action flick.

B001TCNSOI|5.0|This is by far, one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  There really isn't much more you can be said.<br />Angelina Jolie was a perfect choice for this roll.  She is not only beautiful, which is really irritating, but talented on top of that.  She's good in verything she dones.<br />Clint Eastwood deserves high marks for a sad, but true story that no one should have to go through.<br />Those police officers should have been drawn and quartered.
B0086700CM|2.0|I suppose I just don't have very good coordination as I find this game very difficult to maneuver when playing on the Kindle Fire. I end up doing the same runs over and over again as I try to meet the objectives to advance forward in the game. Even if I was a more skilled player; I just don't see the hype nor do I understand why this game is so appealing and popular. I do appreciate that I was able to download a free version of the game so thanks to the developers for that!

B0006AAS5G|4.0|I've had this watch for about a year. I have a Rolex Sub and Rolex Thunderbird which do to sentimental value I don't wear much.  My last watch was a Tag Professional which I decided not to spend 400.00 to repair. Again! I have always enjoyed a heavy watch and this fits the bill. It feels just like the ones I'm used to. It feels like you have a quality piece on your wrist.  I set my watch my my cell phone and I kid you not when I say it has not lost a minute in 11 months. The chronographs are crap though. But I don't like the idea of having to unscrew the buttons anyway.<br /><br />But for a watch under 100.00 this is perfect. If you want a great looking watch that keeps great time then this is it.<br /><br />The reason I am only now writing this after 11 months, I'm buying my father one for Christmas.
0307120007|5.0|Okay, it was half a century ago, but I still remember learning things from *Pat the Bunny.&#34; Some things will seem dated to newcomers to the book, but it's just a great little tactile experience for itty-bitty ones.
0316226424|1.0|I was confused after \\"Twilight\\" became so big. I thought it was written by a Mormon mom for tweenagers to sigh over the romance. No sex, very clean, great for my tweener goddaughter and her crowd. Then I saw grown women reading and sighing over it and I heard they made pilgrimages to dreary little Forks to eat bad Italian food in a dressed up diner. Was I wrong about the content? I saw my dearest friend reading it, and when I asked, she sighed \\"Don't bother. You'll hate it. It's awful.\\" Why was she reading it? Because as the mother of my 12-year-old goddaughter, she wanted to make sure it was as innocent and pure as it claimed before she allowed her daughter to read it or see the movie. She was bored to tears and struggling through it.<br /><br />Still, it called to me. I enjoyed Harry Potter, Suzanne Collins, even Darren Shan's series. I was not above reading a YA novel, in spite of my friend's warning, in spite of (my favorite author) Stephen King blasting Stephenie Meyer's writing and in spite of rumors on the overuse of the word \\"perfect.\\"<br /><br />I borrowed the unabridged book-on-tape of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" from my local public library. Nah, I didn't bother with any previous setup novels (and I'm usually anal about reading everything in order). I just plunged in to #4.<br /><br />It was hilarious! Every time I heard the word \\"perfect\\" on tape I happily shouted \\"PERFECT!\\" out loud in the car. This was roughly every other minute, for those of you that have yet to crack a Meyer novel. Has the woman never heard of a thesaurus?<br /><br />After a while, the \\"perfect\\" fun wore off and it just droned and on until it was like a marathon of bad prose that centered around \\"perfect.\\" I could not have conceived of a best-selling novel that likely contained close to 1,000 instances of one word. And really, girls...if you met such a \\"perfect\\" individual as Edward (who has perfect hair and perfect teeth and perfect skin and perfect perfection of a perfect person...ad nauseam),you would find him perfectly DULL. The lead characters have zero personality. And although now that I've seen the movies on TV and am sure that Kristen Stewart is faithful to the vision of Bella that Meyers wrote, be honest: Don't you just want to SMACK her? Moody, whiny, insecure, hesitant, twitchy, semi-hysterical at times and does she ever look anyone but Edward in the eye, ever? This little girl is a sad and scary teen.<br /><br />Twitchy and whiny. You can see why a man who's existed long enough to be a great-great-grandfather of 93 or thereabouts would be attracted to a 17 year old like Bella.<br /><br />Huhn. Now that I think about it, maybe Stephenie IS a lot more honest about men than I gave her credit for! Well, call me a cougar but let's face facts: the only reason a real woman would want to see these films is to ogle that 17-year old Jacob's very nice biceps. The rest is crap, and that includes these waste of trees.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|I could listen to this album over and over and over. And I have. Not a dud on the whole CD. Florence Welch is the queen of vocal hooks; at least two, usually three in every song. She just blows me away. And the lyrics are just phenomenal. I know this isn't a very helpful review. It's just: I LOVE IT!!!! :)

B000H8SFMK|5.0|It was 1988, I was a senior in high school and I was sitting in my room listening to WXRT here in Chicago and the song \\"Thousands Are Sailing\\" drifted in over the airwaves and I was hooked.  The combination of the absolutely poetry of the lyrics, the driving Irish band and the unmistakable raspy voice of Shane MacGowan were something I'd never heard before.  I went down to the local record shop and picked up a copy of \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" and have never looked back.<br /><br />The album is so stocked full of great material from start to finish that I cannot really even pick a song or a handful of songs to highlight here.  I can say definitely that it is my favorite Pogues album that has been released.  It is also an album that comes up constantly when I'm asked what my favorite album of all time is joining albums from the Beatles, Springsteen, Frank Sinatra and Dire Straits, it is that good.<br /><br />The Pogues defined the Irish Punk genre and here on \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" they mix the Irish Punk sound with bits of jazz, Middle Eastern music and Flamenco music to great effect.  What makes this album, and the Pogues overall, such a great band is the songwriting.  There is such a poetry to their songs, whether written by Shane MacGowan, Phillip Chevron or Terry Woods that the lyrics more often than not stand on their own without the music.<br /><br />That is not to say that the music is not stellar as well here, the band is firing on all cylinders and Shane MacGowan is at his best.  He's not a great vocalist in the true sense of the word, but he is one of the best at conveying emotion with his voice.  There are songs on this album that will make you laugh and there are songs on this album that will make you cry and Shane's vocal delivery is a big part of the magic.  It has only gotten better in the 24 years since this was released as the years of drinking, smoking and hard living have only added texture and depth to Shane's voice and I'd highly recommend you check out the recently released [[ASIN:B009LIQ5FQ Pogues in Paris: 30th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]]] to see for yourself.<br /><br />This album shaped my music world and I have to wonder if I didn't discover the Pogues back in 1988 if I'd have gone on to be a fan of bands like the Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, The Tossers or Flatfoot 56.  All great bands in their own right, but none that have been able to capture the magic that is the Pogues.<br /><br />The bottom line here is I can't give a higher recommendation for this album, it's one of the few \\"perfect\\" releases that rise above most other albums released and stands as a perfect snapshot of a band at their prime and an album where 5 stars just doesn't seem like enough.nd I'd highly recommend you check out the recently released [[ASIN:B009LIQ5FQ Pogues in Paris: 30th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]]] to see for yourself.<br /><br />This album shaped my music world and I have to wonder if I didn't discover the Pogues back in 1988 if I'd have gone on to be a fan of bands like the Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, The Tossers or Flatfoot 56.

Their outstanding LP, Breakfast In America, has been a favorite of mine since it first came out in 1979: I was only 10 years old at the time and have loved it ever since.  Because I never had the chance to see the classic line-up of the band perform in its prime, this is the next best thing I could hope for.  And what a wonderful show it is!  Among many highlights are the excellent sound quality and fine camera work, with many close-up shots of the band; Rick Davies' amazing piano solo during Child Of Vision; and Roger Hodgson's timeless anthem, Give A Little Bit.  I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of the package are the terrible, \\"newly created videos\\" that accompany the bonus tracks, which look like they were created by automated, PC slide-show software.  Totally unnecessary.  Thankfully, you don't even need to endure those bits: Just watch the show!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This is not my first order with you and certainly will not be the last.  Product arrived in just a few days... Popped them into my unit and the lights are back on.<br /><br />Quick Service, Great Price and they Work!  Only thing left to say is, Thank You!!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|One of the things missing from the Kindle Fire HD was video recording. This app allows the Fire HD to record video, and still photos as well. It records stills better than the other still cam apps for the Fire HD. Video quality is OK for web video clips, but it's a little grainy in low light (the camera's limitation, not the app's.) Still, it's good enough for the intended purpose. A must-have for two bucks.<br /><br />After downloading the app, it took a day for it to be activated even though it says instant use, and even then, I wasn't sure how to get it into the Kindle (I've added other apps successfully without issue, and this one uses a different, more complicated, not well documented procedure.) Once installed, it worked as advertised.<br /><br />The user interface is a little cumbersome at first, until you notice that the initial menu can be turned off, allowing instant access to the camera. Manual controls are available for white balance and resolution modes. This app was designed to work up to 1080 HD on other devices, but the Kindle itself only works up to 720 HD. If you set it at 1080, it will lock up the app, requiring a roundabout procedure to reset the camera. At 480mode, the image is OK but the audio is too compressed. The default 720 mode works perfectly for video and audio.<br /><br />Granted, this app should have been included with the Fire in the first place, as I was unaware that video could even be recorded until I found this app. Including this low cost app would undoubtedly add value to to Kindle Fire, and I am sure would open the market for sales of the device even more than it already is. Or at least have it available as an option. For two bucks, it's well worth adding the video capability to the Fire.
B00846REIS|5.0|This series is awesome!!! Great read after indulging in 50 Shades. I actually liked these a little more though, more story to them, and a little less sex. Dont get me wrong though, I'm a huge 50 fan :) Impatiently awaiting book #3 to come out.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|This app seems to try to be broad based. I am still learning how to figure it out. I guess that time will tell, but it seems good.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Enjoyed the story but the ending was a bit too abrupt.  The writer did a good job of fleshing out the characters and it was an easy read.
1619695006|5.0|I was anxious to read this as I was thoroughly entertained by the HP series. I have listened to close to 300 audio books over the last 10 years and as such, have been exposed to many styles of fiction and non-fiction. My figure of merit is \\"am I pulled in.\\" Do I finish my 50 mile each way commute and think \\"I don't even remember it?\\" Well, this one passes that. Rowling is the queen if villians and victims. This was certainly the case in HP and we see much of the same thing here. You are compelled to hate some characters, love some characters, and change you mind through the reading.<br /><br />As some critics have complained, this book would get an R rating, barely. Perhaps NC-17. Boundaries are carefully observed, however, and there is nothing there that doesn't help you get into the mind of the particular character...<br /><br />An unreserved \\"must read\\" in my opinion for any mature fiction lover.
B0015F1VY8|2.0|I've always liked this movie. Price was good, delivery was good. Unfortunately, the sound is a little off which makes this not a good purchase.
B00181JGI2|5.0|this is the funniest dysfunctional group of chsaractors! Jeff Bridges is great in it as are all the charactors! Hilarious!
0545265355|5.0|These books are fabulous and it was a great deal for the set. They suck you in and all you want is more. Enjoy. :)
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite author.  I have read the series from Term Limits and on 3 times.  It has been great to have new novels to read,  and The Last Man was terrific.  I loved the ending,  as I know there will be another book in the near future.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This movie is everything Hollywood and more.  Entertaining, captivating and amazing are only the few words I can think off the top of my head to describe how great this movie is.  A must see, especially if you are a RD, J. fan!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's great to see these characters come to life. As usual, Robert Downey dominates as Ironman. His commanding presence is by itself worth the price of the DVD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have used this app on my laptop and IPhone now loaded it on my Kindle Fire and it runs great!
B004IHE2B4|4.0|Two minutes spent visiting lego.com and checking the lego-direct price of any item can save you a lot of $$.  In this case, the Lego price is $19 for this set... 20 dollars less than what amazon sellers are trying to make you pay.<br /><br />I give these tracks 4 stars based on the item, not the third party pricing.  The tracks are good quality and comparable to other lego tracks.  These flexible tracks allow more creativity in track layouts, because you are not restricted to the angles and lengths of the regular straight and curved pieces.<br /><br />These tracks do not conduct electricity and therefore are not compatible with the older 9V trains.  RC trains only.<br /><br />I give these tracks 4 stars instead of 5, because the flexible tracks look significantly different than the standard track pieces, and not realistic at all.... to the extent that the normal lego tracks look realistic.  If you are trying to create a scene, the flexible tracks will stick out.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these tracks, but do NOT pay more than $19 (Lego direct price).
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app loads quickly but only about the first ten messages on Facebook news feed!  An update is needed to address this problem
B00973DDN2|3.0|I hate to say that I was not so impressed with this album. Did it really take them so long to put out something only of this quality. It seems like they just wanted to re-hash the familiar killers sound with a bunch of contrived lyrics. Part of the secret of the old The Killers albums had to do with having a bit of ambiguity in the lyrical content. I am a really big The Killers fan, and thank them for helping introduce me to the genre, but I found this album uninspired. There were a couple songs trying to almost win me over. Overall, this one is not going to get much playtime in my library.
B0087X728K|4.0|would have given this product 5 stars if it came with mini instructions, only came with what you see. but product works very well, beyond expected. repaired a PS3 and still had some left over to repair another PS3 with YLOD.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I truly enjoyed the book, the plot and the characters.  I would read the author again and I have recommended this book to friends.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so good! I enjoyed every minute of it! Now can not wait to see the movie! Loved it!
B000IKQMFO|4.0|Gosford Park is a classic British murder mystery and a step back in time for everyone who played the board game Clue as a child.  While I will tell those thinking of renting or buying &#34;Gosford Park&#34; that the butler didn't murder the lord of the manor, I won't say who did.  I will say that I rented it because both Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith grace this film.  Whether she's channeling her inner servant or her inner queen, any film featuring Helen Mirren is a film I will watch.  She's brilliant.  So is Maggie Smith, as always.  Enjoy!
B008MEM24S|3.0|This app is nothing more than a &#34;fancy&#34; version of &#34;Where's my Water&#34; with some additional gizmos.  The concept is neat and my kids like it.<br /><br />The sound is awful though, the sounds themselves seem to be distorted, as turning down the volume on my device doesn't help.<br /><br />Also, the UI isn't very responsive.  The hotspots for the UI's buttons seem to be both too small and/or improperly aligned with the images used to represent the buttons; they'll only work if you hit a certain part of the button (usually the lower-right quadrant).<br /><br />If the UI and the sounds were better, I probably would have given it a 4.  It's a cute reasonably fun game, but it's definitely not a 5.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I received it on time and good condition. my daughter loves it and price was right. great service and product.
B002722R64|4.0|Even so, the female villain is too kinky, and neither Pierce Brosnan nor anybody else nobody beats Sean Connery as Bond.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Super Cyber Monday Deal that I know my granddaugher will love over and over!  Disney Movies are Awesome and a true collectible.
B00004RF9B|5.0|After reading Amazon reviews of all the different DVD releases (how many are there?) I decided to find the older 1999 version that has both Widescreen and Letterbox format so I can watch either format depending on how big I want to see people's faces or the overall background.  It's almost like having 2 versions of the same movie, and this is better to me than any bonus features the newer versions might have.  I wish all DVD's came this way.
B0088EDMMS|4.0|Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy serve up a delicious Halloween tale about the Sanderson sisters, three witches who come back after a virgin lights the black flame candle.  You probably know the rest of the story so I will just say that the PQ/AQ transfer is great and this was worth upgrading from DVD.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|it came to my backdoor, open it it and voila! a neat package i was looking for. open it and there's a bag cleanly wrapped and secured. i try to use it with my Nikon D5100 DSLR Camera + 18-55mm lens, it fits perfectly! this is a very recommended bag for all beginners (like me) with normal DLSR kit.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I have her other CD and love it so I decided to get this one as well.  LOVE every song on it. SO glad I got it I like much better than some of the big name new releases. She is great.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is the best drama in TV from the last 10 years! Season 1 is obviously the beginning but also the start of an obsession for TV viewers due intensity, spectacular acting, and a plot that keeps viewers glue to the story unfold more and more. A must buy if you are a fan of the show and if you are not already, try it and you will be have a new addiction!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I definitely liked the first book a little more. However, this was a great addition which kept you thinking. If you liked the Hunger Games, you'll enjoy this one as well. Now, on to book three.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game! the graphics are not terrible and the story line is fun. i would recommend this game to other people! great work.
B00881PPTO|4.0|This gives you the same tools you can get on the main website, just on your phone. It works really well, but I didn't give it 5 stars because it actually costs money to buy, which I think is ridiculous. It would be like if Amazon charged you to shop online with them.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's novels are always filled with intrique and adventure. Well written and an easy read. I am already looking forward to his next book.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|This was a great walk through the past classic games before there were game boys and xbox. Hoever, it is a bit hard to play on the smaller screens so you will need a large screen tablet to play well.
0307593525|5.0|Very happy with this boxed set. Was given this as a gift for Christmas by a friend. Great simple explanations.
B008M721MS|5.0|This application allows full functionality of Skype on your Kindle Fire HD 8\\" with the camera interface. Free calls on Skype between skype users or if you have an account paid with them, you can call any home or land line phone for free/reduced rate around the world. LOVE IT!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Starts where the first volume left off. A bit hard to connect the dots at first because there wasn't a transition piece. Initially, I found the writing a bit stilted and simple in form, but it smoothed out and took on a more complex prose after a hundred or so pages. The historical context was good and the interwoven plot lines kept the action interesting.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is another version of the popular angry bird collecion. This one is HD and is great for the new Kindle Fire HD. Good senarios and graphics.
146500632X|5.0|This product arrived very fast with no damage, great product, great price. My niece is going to love this for Christmas.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the classic card game of all time. Hours of play for skilled players of this popular game. Graphics are good, and game play flows very well.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Absolutely hilarious show. Smart and funny...hard to find on tv these days! Highly recommend this show for people who enjoy intelligent comedy.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read - funny, poignant and true-to-life.  Now I'm itching to go to Guernsey!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I just practicing my English, but the story is very nice remind me to my childhood. It is my favorite from  Mark Twain.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|I'm so happy to finally have this on Blu-ray, and with the sale of the 3D/2D/DVD/Digital Copy at $20, it was definitely worth it. I would have easily paid the $35 because this film is a classic and one of my all time favorite movies! Pixar and Disney make such amazing films! The packaging is beautiful! It has the 3D-ish slipcover shown in the picture, which is pretty neat! Great price for a great film!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch is great as usual, and more humane.  You will not want to put it down until it is over.
B008R14YBK|4.0|i was very pleased with purchase at first i was not sure about the artist but listen to the cd the more i enjoyed it
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Even though I only played this game once it was very fun. The game does not get boring because you can trade cards anytime during the game even if it's not your turn and you can change the board set up every time you play so you get a different game every time.  I love playing games and this is one of my favorites!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Ok, I have to admit, I was never a huge Muppet fan.  We lived in a small mountain area and only got one tv channel so I never saw the show, but I did enjoy the one movie they had at our local video store.  As an adult  I enjoyed Muppet Treasure Island and Muppet Christmas Carol.  I know, I know, I grew up in the 80s, but I just never saw it that much.<br /><br />When my toddler got a stomach flu, I was looking for something to rent for him, something I would feel comfortable showing him without watching first myself.  I got this movie for him.  I wanted to see it myself too, and I was hoping the new Muppet movie wouldn't let me down.  It was a hit with the whole family.  My son is now a huge Kermit fan.  It helped keep his mind off his stomach and helped him relax, and it was a good introduction to the Muppets and also entertaining for adults who have already seen the Muppets.  Even though I didn't see a ton of the Muppets, it did bring back some memories, not just of the Muppets, but of the 80s too :)<br /><br />I think this movie has a few things that could be thought of as inappropriate for young children, like Piggy punching another pig, and Piggy kidnapping someone.  It depends on what you are ok with letting your kids see.  I was worried the ending with the bad guy might be a little scary, but my toddler seemed fine through it.  It is all done with the usual Muppet silliness, but I wasn't sure a toddler would get that.<br /><br />Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Seems like a great family film, and it is hard to find movies the whole family will enjoy together.
0385512058|4.0|Most of this book will have you saying, \\"I already knew that.\\" Ferrazzi acknowledges that possibility, though, which is admirable. Instead, he sticks to reemphasizing the point - saying that yes, you may have heard this before. Yes, I'm saying it again because that's how important it is. A lot of these moments will come up in the chapters about how to network (follow up right away, have a purpose to your conversations and end with an acknowledged future meeting or get together, don't be obnoxious, everyone is valuable to know, etc.) but there are also parts to this book that were so great, I found myself writing down notes like I was in class.<br /><br />Ferrazzi adds personal anecdotes throughout and also highlights world-class networkers. These are some of my favorite parts. He writes about his personal life and rise with a nice balance of pride as well as humility. It's written in a straightforward, simple style, and his voice is likable - you never feel like you're being lectured, and you never feel like you're reading someone's ramblings. It's more like one man's thoughtful reflections on how and why he got where he is today.<br /><br />One chapter that really stood out to me is his bit on dinner parties. He covers everything from the extravagant - hiring musicians for the night - to the simple (Have people over in a few hundred square feet of space? Done that). He also breaks down his chapter (loosely) into 1, the concept and 2, the skills/tips and tricks, which is helpful. You will definitely walk away with tangible social skills. And yes, social, not networking skills. One of the most valuable takeaways is that you shouldn't network. You should make friends by taking a genuine interest in people.<br /><br />This is a must read. It applies to everyone in every situation simply because we are all social beings.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Not sure what all the one stars are about.  The story is interesting, the characters may have a lot of flaws, but that is what makes it authentic. Read it.  It is very enjoyable.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these headphones specifically for running, so I was pretty disappointed. In-the-ear buds have never stayed in my ears while I run, so I was looking forward to getting this pair with the wrap around.  While yes, they are very light, and can be banged around in my bag without any damage because they're so flexible, they do NOT stay in my ears. If I'm sitting on the couch they're fine and feel pretty snug. But when running, they inch their way out.<br /><br />Even when I'm not moving, I can't say that these are the most comfortable headphones. It's hard to adjust them to just the right size. Because they're so flexible, you can tug on them quite a bit to fit your head, and then they'll pop back up eventually. So it takes some fiddling with to find the right length.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|Of course this movie isn't scary! If you're still expecting to go to the theater and freak out, grow up. We're too desensitized for that these days. However, if you want to watch a good suspense-thriller of the horror genre, then watch this movie. It was shot well and the acting is superb. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is one of Hollywood's most underrated should-be leading men and the young starlet was brilliant and creepy. Worth the watch.
0312430000|4.0|Gawande's crystal clear writing makes this a five-star book. Drawing heavily from the airline industry and their move towards checklists (and subsequent decrease in crashes), Gawande demonstrates how checklists can be the method to success in a variety of industries including healthcare and finance. His message is simple: a checklist can slow people down just long enough to catch the stupid mistakes they might otherwise make. The use of the checklist is closely tied with working as a team player and letting go of your ego, all of which help you (or your team) make the best, most thought-out decisions possible.<br /><br />-1 star because of the length. 3/4 of the way through this book, I was ready for it to end. Yes, it's a very simple message, but it deserves being turned into a book because of how vital it is to success. Gawande also gives great examples of how it is used, which does a lot for his argument. But his point only got so far and eventually, with the anecdotes and examples repeatedly reaching the same conclusion (ah, the power of the checklist!) it became tiring. Luckily, Gawande is such a fantastic writer, it's totally painless to keep reading to the end.
0553582038|5.0|I love this whole series and I'm always surprised when people say this is their least favorite. It is beautifully written and has a poetic subtlety that makes Martin the great writer he is. My favorite of the series.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Love this movie its a great kids movie and an easy one to watch for adults as well my kids love it
B008MEM24S|5.0|version this is an interesting game. im realy njoyin it! i payed for the full version and so far seems like it was worth it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Cool but sometimes to busy. And the force play bothers me. I think the starting land is to small as well. But overall its a great distraction from the day to day.
B007EECSFA|5.0|There is nothing bad I can say about this book--- the author is wonderful at developing her characters and keeping you guessing until the very end.<br /><br />The book begins in the 1960's when the central character, 16 years old at the time, witnesses her mother murdering a strange man.  Then jumps to present day, when her mother is in her 80's, dying in a home. She starts to remember bits and pieces of what she witnessed as a child, as she is taking care of her mother.  Throughout the entire novel, the author jumps from the 1940's in London, told from the young mother's perspective to present day told from her grown daughter's perspective. You get a since of what people were going through in WW2 in London and how it affects their families in present day.  I felt like I could not book the down as I wanted so desperately to find out what happens to all the characters. And just when you think you know something, bam-- huge twists!! Loved, loved, loved this book!!
B008SVS3FC|4.0|One of his better albums in recent years, although his peak efforts (especially Slow Turning) will likely bew diificult for him to ever match.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I ABSOOOOOOOOOOOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD!!! REAL HipHop @ its BEST!!! He's actually rapping about reall life,not about what he drives, how many girls in the vip etc.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This one is really is very hard put down once you start to read it.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B0041CGP02|5.0|Love it!  Good purchase for the price and in good condition. Smooth transaction. Great CD! Would recxommend to others who love Bon Jovi.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love listening the Rod Stewart's raspy voice singing these Christmas melodies.  It certainly brings on the Christmas spirit.  Merry Christmas to all.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is the first of Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy, in which the young Sabriel must cross in to The Old Kingdom to find out what happened to her father, the Abhorsen. During her journey she picks up some interesting traveling companions: Mogget, a rather aloof and slightly malevolent cat, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage still trapped by painful memories of being imprisoned by magic. As the three travel to the heart of the Old Kingdom, they must face ever increasing threats, culminating in Sabriel's destiny.<br /><br />This book began my love of dark fantasies. It's beautifully written, and the characters keep the reader in the story even when the storylines become darker than the reader might be comfortable with.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This is not your mother's witch story.  Steeped in a lore that is colorful and complex as a cup of wild flower tea, Rebecca Hamilton delivers an utterly unique take on the Wiccan life that will leave you thirsting for more.  If you like your fiction coated with a nice thick layer of dusty, dreadful gothic moments (and who doesn't!), fear not.  You'll find those moments tucked away in here.  But Sophia is fair and golden and free of black nail polish.  She is a forever girl, and that is an altogether different thing.<br /><br />Like a breath of fresh air in a spidery attic, The Forever Girl mixes up a heady brew of blood-suckers, shape-shifters, and all manner of immortal beings that are both comfortably familiar and surprisingly strange.  Always, there is a sense of purity blossoming amid the forces of darkness, giving this story a magic that's all it's own.  When Sophia steps beyond the veil, a mysterious new world is revealed where all the rules are changed.  A lick of blood heals bones and makes the air smell like watermelon candy.  A moat of daffodils repels unwanted guests.  And a green-eyed squirrel carries the ability to read auras.<br /><br />Don't look for any quick answers here.  The Forever Girl is not a book about black and white witchcraft.  Rather, it's about the wide range of colors that fall between evil and grace.  And best of all, there's going to be another book!
B001PJRAUS|2.0|Sorry but this had all the promise and none of the charm.  The lead character was extremely annoying and half the time you wanted to shake her.  Mr Darcy was nothing.....no charm, no looks and no personality.  Its a shame because the rest of the cast were excellent, the story line intriguing and sets wonderful.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I first watched the shows and decided it was time to come back and read the books. While the show is great it doesn't even come close to these books. They are rich with fantastic characters and truly take you into the book.
B001E454FC|5.0|This to me is the definitive adaptation of the novel.  Every character is perfection personified and Colin Firth is sublime as Darcy.  Handsome, aloof with romance in his heart.  To be honest a series to die for
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just a good read. Very fun and fast. Would recommend the book to anyone looking for a easy to read exciting book.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|The quality on the past couple episodes has been very low.  I have had better luck just streaming them off the web than buying through amazon.  I've purchased videos though amazon in the past and they've been great...not sure what the problem is...

B004TMPJP6|4.0|I am still looking for a notes program that compares with the old Palm Pilot. This program is good but does not prioritize.
B0031RSA24|2.0|I found this book difficult to read. It was technical (hard to follow at times) and boring. I also thought it was very self indulgent on the authors behalf and defensive. I didn't finish the book. PS. I am an atheist
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Once again, the Hunger Games series has kept me fully entertained. This book is full of plot twists and turns that will keep a reader engaged, I found it hard to put down because I was always waiting for the next big thing to happen. In the end, I found that the series (especially this book) teaches valuable lessons on trust. Sometimes it's hard to admit that we put our trust in the wrong people and things. Sometimes the people that are most loyal to us are not the people we trust the most. It's an interesting things to think about.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have always loved Patricia Cornwell's novels. This one was no exception, thought the dialog was difficult to follow at times.
1594203334|5.0|I loved this book, so insightful, well-written, funny, and so interesting! And contrary to some reviews, I think it is well-researched.
B005LAII08|5.0|I love this! A strong princess that wants control of her own choices in life!! Not a damsel in need of rescuing! Great connection that touch on mother /daughter trials.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book is a very Interesting historical fiction. Large number of characters sometimes hard to keep straight, but was well worth the effort.
B00005JPSM|5.0|We bought this for my birthday in 2008..I love to watch it over and over..Very funny and has a tear jerking part..
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was torn between purchasing the DVD's or the Amazon online streaming I went with streaming thinking that I could use it on my ipad over the holidays.  Once you sign up and activate it you have to download an app to your ipad which didn't take any time I just wasn't aware of it originally and it runs great, so much easier than wondering what to do with the DVD's after, I wonder if there is a way to share them with other members though?  I do recommend it and the season 1 so far (3 episodes in) are awesome!
B009E3EXMU|2.0|The DVD is another example of someone that went to film school and decided to make a concert video, using multiple cameras and every video editing tool available.  What the film maker failed to realize is that the average age of Zeppelin fan is 50+ years of age.  We did not grow up with the multiple camera angles that switch to a different vantage point on every quarter note.  I wanted to see the band play, and did not want to be taken on a dizzying roller coaster ride.  The bonus DVD contained footage of a practice session that was taken by a low resolution, some distance from the stage.  They played almost all the same songs that were in the concert DVD, and with the stage lighting, and the footage looked blurry.  I'm sure that the actual concert was fantastic, but this film is not.
1475143389|5.0|After about a year of intermittent exercise, I decided it was time to get back into shape. I set out on Amazon to find a good lifting book because I wanted a program to adhere to.<br /><br />This book is great. Like many people interested in seriously working out, I've read/heard some of the nutritional information in this book, but my eyes glazed over by how complicated it seemed to really manage nutrition that carefully day in and day out. Mike lays it out as simply as possible, and gives you the tools to optimize your nutrition for your fitness goals (in my case, gaining size). I never paid careful attention to my nutrition because I'm naturally thin; well, after 1 day of actually eating properly, I couldn't believe how much better I felt. Eating and sequencing meals properly takes some discipline, just like every single other thing in life worth doing, but the immediate positive effects make it very worth it.<br /><br />As for the lifting, it's a no-shortcut, no-nonsense program with all the classic (squats, deadlifts, etc.). I personally really enjoy lifting in the rep range advocated (4-6) -- it's just a very satisfying mixture of strain and satisfaction.  All the workouts clock in under an hour, totally key for maintaining intensity and working around busy schedules.<br /><br />And beyond the intrinsic merits of the book, Mike is a great guy. I emailed him after reading the book, and he got right back to me. He's happy to clarify anything from the book, provide advice, or just offer some motivation. This book is a total steal at this price, especially when it comes attached to such a helpful author.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved books 1 and 3 better then 2.  Though you need the details of 2 to under stand 3.  Highly recommend.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|John's characters are smart and funny. There are lots of references to other literary works and a rich vocabulary that helps us learn new words as we read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Great read.  Keeps you moving at a great pace.  Intertwined many different perspectives.  Thought provoking in an easy carefree way.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John, you can still do better. I believe in you! But this is still amazing. The characters feel real and brings focus to the person and not the illness. This story hits me in the feels. It made me contemplate my own life and what I'm choosing to do with my time on this earth. It's inspirational and makes me want to help reduce world suck.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Yeah, I'm exaggerating, but only a little. These headphones sound great. For $10, you need to be braindead to go and buy a $50+ headphone. Yeah, the cushions on the ear could be a little bit better, but if you need cheap sound quality, these are your buy.<br /><br />For $10, they offer some really good sound quality. However, there is barely any noise-isolation for low-volume sounds. So if you need a noise-isolating pair, this might not be what your looking for. And these leak noise at a moderate point. If you want to melt your brains with the sound, expect someone to say something, however lower-moderate sounds the sound won't leak as much.<br /><br />Finally, the two last things you should know are the fact that this comes with one moderately long cable. I estimate it to be 4-5feet by looking at it. So if you need to go down to the grocery store listening to your music at home, you're gonna want a cable extender. And the other part is that these things can get pretty loud. Depending on the volume of the actual track you listening to, and the volume on the device you have these plugged into, you won't have any trouble hearing.<br /><br />Overall, great set, for a low price. One more note, if you're getting these for yourself, or a little one, be advised that these will fit medium to larger heads. When I first tried them on, I was thinking that the headphones would be too big since I have an average size head. They look big, and they are. They currently are a pretty good fit, but these are more for people with heads between medium and large.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book talks about our perceptions of other people through a scavenger hunt for clues. This book is hard to put down.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Good read. She is a real survivor. Her story in her own words is life changing. Its hard to believe anyone could survive such an ordeal.  She was stronger than her years.
0062071017|3.0|I bought the audio version of this (from iTunes) after seeing an article Montgomery wrote in Inc magazine. I was expecting an insightful look of how to be a master strategist. Instead, what I got was essentially case studies of 3 businesses (Masco, Ikea, and Gucci). There were some valuable tips mixed in and the book is well written and skillfully presented, but most of the insights are the kind one would get in most business books (focus on value, make decisions based on data); good stuff and reminders and maybe there isn't much more to say. I was just expecting more so was disappointed. If you're new to business management type books, I think you'll be happy with it.<br /><br />After finishing this, I was still interested to know more about strategy, and am happy to pass on I found an excellent book in [[ASIN:0307886239 Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters]]. The author can be slightly arrogant at times, but when he points out the generalized popular misunderstandings around strategy, it kind of makes sense.
B0045XICB2|5.0|My daughter and I are entranced by the star crossed lovers!!  It is great to have adult books and children's books, too.  It gets my daughter into reading!
B008NHS5K4|5.0|When I say that your whole world has opened for you - i refer to my Feeling when i first encountered Mireille -\\"The Fabulous New French Singing Star\\"in 1973- 40 years ago.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|good game though the ponies are not the same.......<br /> i love the ball games... i want princess celestia but shes expensive...
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I was delirious to buy this after spending 145+ hours on Persona 3 Portable. This game lived up to all of my expectations and more. Being ported from a PS2 to the sleek PSVita allowed for Persona 4 Golden to be enjoyed with higher resolution graphics, a wonderfully voiced cast, and more activities to do around the city. What I absolutely loved was how the new elements - new team scenes, personas, and battle suits - enhanced the game's overall aesthetic appeal with its unique RPG style. Also new are the bikes that the protagonist and friends get to ride, and they are very cool! Not to mention the new personas as well, as *SPOILER* Teddie and Nato get new personas.<br /><br />From the game's graphics to music and plot, everything is superb. I can't wait to play the next game in the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona series!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Is a good romantic novel, were you find the troubles to realize if the love is real or is just revenge. I worth it to read
B005DL9O5S|3.0|Only recommend to big fun of Tchaikovsky but with few collection.<br />I used my computer to play the CD but for lots of them my computer can't read through in some points. Computer is Lenovo 410S year 2010.All my other CDs from DG/Philips/Sony plays well.<br />The pro is inclusive.<br />The explanation is not emotional enough. They just transfer score into sound, not so much kind of music.
0307887448|5.0|Just beautifully written. Got me very into the characters and was definitely sad when it reached the end. Can't wait for Ernest Cline's next book.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I don't know what else to say.  It is a awesome show and hate that it will be the last season coming up.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is everything you could want in a hidden object game,  adventure game,  puzzle game. You name it this game delivers!  Well worth the money and then some. Whoever created this game  . . . they're. tenuous! Can't wait to see what's next!  5 STARS
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|This is a good CD overall but I'm disappointed in a few of the songs and Christina tends to screech through this quite a bit.  Subtle and softer at times would be better.  We all know you have the pipes
B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators held my interest from start to finish. It was as good as any of his earlier novels. Thanks again and again.
B000W746GK|5.0|I bought this because I had all the other movies EXCEPT this one. It was a great price and is a great movie
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I LOOOOVE this group. We saw them in concert recently and I had to have the CD. They are even better live than on the CD. Definitly worth seeing if they have a concert near you. I'm sure they'll be &#34;known&#34; soon!! Easy to listen to, energetic. Unique.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read them all.  I cannot say which is the best, but this one ranks up there.  I find it hard to wait for the next book from this author.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When I'm doing some figuring then get interrupted, it's really great to see what I in the middle of doing<br />  Thanks for this very easy to use app.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another of my favorite authors.  I have read several of his books many times.  I enjoyed this book and found it hard to stop reading for any period of time.  I was unable to guess the ending or the movement of the story.  Hard to wait for the next one.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|it was quick and she is good very happy with the service and quality of this product. have a nice day
B007HACDLK|5.0|Happy to have Mitch Rapp back in the mix.  And so many recent events - it made it even more interesting!
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|quality was good it was a lil slow but happy its here you should get it and enjoy her  /smile
B0063IH60K|5.0|i use solitaire to take my brain out of gear so i can relax. this is aparticularly good solitaire app -- easy to use and it's easy enough to win so i enjoy playing
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I bought it for a Christmas gift for a teenager. Never heard of it before. It looks good to watch.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have to admit, I bought all 3 books at once and read them cover to cover.  I didn't want to work, to cook, to clean - just wanted to read.  There is a great plot - it's not all about the sex.  Would recommend these books to anyone....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is really good and effective. The simple and basic operations make it perfect for a no hassle calculator. Added with the big screen of the Kindle Fire it makes it easy to read and typing in the numbers.
0307719774|5.0|I had attempted actual journaling for years but I could never keep up with it.  I keep this little book by my bed and I answer each question as I head to bed at night.  Some are really easy and some are more thought provoking.  I've been working on mine for almost 4 months now and I can't wait until I cycle back through to see how my responses change.  I like it so much that I've picked up a few to give as gifts.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved the game, very addicting and fun! It is a long game but that means you get your money's worth. Get this game, you'll love it!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Not as good as Matched, but certainly worthy of being in the trilogy.<br />The story was a huge surprise, but it was really good!<br />Definitely couldn't stop reading it.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Couldnt miss an episode, had to purchase.Lots of action and bloody in all episodes. I can take it, some may not
B000002TWN|5.0|This is a classic, the whole C.D. is great, u can let it play entirly and groove. I just love it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|AS ALWAYS DEPP IS EXELLENT, I'M A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL DARK SHADOWS. GLAD TO SEE IT IN A NEW TWIST.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was far superior to the movie.  Once I started reading it kept me hooked.  It had a rather slow start but was going full throttle once the games began.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|GREAT STORY,IT WAS DONE EXELLENTLY, THERE WAS'NT ANYTHING I WOULD SEE CHANGED.THATS WHY I GAVE 4 STARS,WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS GOOD
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I started this knowing the author had been inspired by Twin Peaks but thinking it was an average mystery thriller. The scifi element took me completely by surprise and while I enjoy scifi a great deal, the difference between what I exposed and what I got  is why I don't give this a full five.
B001AITH50|5.0|I gave this movie 5 starts cause its one of my all time favorites. Being it was onsale for cyber Monday I had to jump on it. Before there was Twilight and all the cheesey vampire movies of today, there was Interview W/A Vampire
B000TGJ7ZY|1.0|I've always liked this film since it was released in theaters but the Blu-ray is one of the worst transfers I have ever seen.  It looks like the creators used a very worn work pint of the film for the transfer.  I see no difference in the picture quality of the Blu-ray disk and my old VHS copy.  None.  Very disappointing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've Read every Book in the Mitch Rapp Series & If it is Possible...Vince has out-done himself with &#34;The Last Man&#34;! The only thing I hate about finishing a Vince Flynn book is... Knowing I have to Wait for the next one! I would Highly Recommend &#34;The Last Man&#34; or any Vince Flynn novel to anyone that just loves a Good Read! 5 Stars From Me!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|one of the best ho games I have played. I for sure got my money worth, its a long game and the story is interesting.  I will probably play it again!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander's individual story, to me, was just okay.  He only lightly touched on his experience out of body and with very little detail about what his visit to heaven included.  Maybe other NDE persons have had a more vivid experience and encounters with multiple persons who have passed on or with energy forms, angels, etc..  Then again, he can only describe what he personally experienced which is evidence enough.<br /><br />His recovery from the bacteria attack on his brain is a great story in itself.  I'm sure this is a great case study in the neuroscience field.  However, I'm not rating the book on this part of the story.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wonderful movie, my girls 3 and 5 love it! We watched it all together and we all enjoyed it as a family. Wonderful lessons!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I think Bosch has some kind of 'term limit' (LAPD special contract) that will bring this particular series to an end. I have mixed feelings about it. I think I read everything Connelly has written and, almost without exception, it is good to very good.<br /><br />On the other hand, lot of stuff is repetitive, not in details but conceptually. Connelly knows more than almost all of his readers about the real LAPD world but as a Californian living not that far from LA I would prefer if not so much of LAPD brass were so moronic with Bosch solving his case only by defying them and fighting them, sometimes being abused by them.<br /><br />This may be the reality but in my old age I would prefer to read more uplifting stories where hard working and truly dedicated cops do not have to waste so much time with their nasty bosses. That, of course, has been an intrinsic part of Bosch's stories and that is the reason why I would not mind if Bosch retires within a couple of years.<br /><br />Perhaps Connelly can create another dedicated and very smart LAPD cop who can spend more time solving cases and less time fighting  his incompetent superiors.
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|The first half of this album is excellent.  The second half slowed down and is the only reason that it did not earn 5 stars from me.  If they had been able to keep the song quality up it would have been even better.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book is an absolute riot. The Author clearly has quite an ability to build a scenario, and follow through with all possible outcomes/solutions, and to top it all off, it's just a very fun read. Well written, and engaging.<br /><br />While im not expecting any zombie apocalypse any time soon, i will say that this book is a great survival guide for any form of long term disaster planning. Mostly common sense, but at the same time - probably stuff you might not consider when you're in the midst of disaster.<br /><br />Definitely check this one out!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Intense creepy movie has kept me on the edge of my seat so far, I don't know yet if it is better than the first one though I'll have to see the rest of the season
B009E2U7L2|5.0|Anyone who loved Lisa &#34;left eye&#34; Lopez would love and appreciate Cher Lloyd's talent. This girl can sing and from what I see has positive vibes. Honestly, my favorite singer at the moment!
B009FXIICK|3.0|This game isn't bad, it could be better. I would never pay money to get this app. It isn't horrible.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Cool. very awesome. Outstanding diction. Very well done. Good for homework, essays, poems. Nothing like it. Best choice. Get it.
B002VHI8FE|2.0|I'm not what you would call an &#34;avid&#34; fantasy reader, but I'm a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice and Fire.  The characters in this book are very 1 dimensional and the dialogue is not very interesting.  At this point, I'm very unsure whether I will read the second book or not.
0226264211|5.0|...required reading for college Juniors.  A real, practical and logical lesson in economics that makes current economic policy (both here in the U. S. and globally) look like the idiocy that it truly is.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn amazes me that he keeps out doing his previous Mitch Rapp books. He also leaves a teaser at the end that makes you hungry for his next book. My favorit author. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|...with his politics, but have always loved Springsteen's music.  Favorite song on this one - &#34;Jack of All Trades&#34;.  On a lot of the songs here, The Boss's lyrics are a bit more awkward than they were many years ago, but he still gets his message across. His drive and his heart are still in the same place.  Great stuff!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is wonderfully responsive, so easy to play and I am hooked! Finally a &#34;ready to use&#34; game at my fingertips!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book probably the best book I've read ! You should get this book its heart racing .
B00003A9QL|5.0|This is my favorite Metallica cd by far and is easliy in my top 5 favorite cds of all time
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mr Flynn has written another stellar story.  Once you start this book, it is very hard to put down.  Mitch Rapp takes us to the middle east and solves many problems his way.  The story line is well written and leads you through an amazing investigation Rapp is involved in.  I just wish Mr Flynn put out more Rapp novels faster.  What great movies could be made from his books!
B00000FCBC|4.0|Great collection of covers, especially liked Turn the page. Probably my second favorite Metallica cd  it's a good buy for any metallica fan
B00005214X|2.0|This is a remix of a previously excellent compilation.  Not so much now, though.  The cuts have been remixed, cuts have been added, and the quality just isn't there.  Total disappointment.
1476719071|5.0|I have read this book 5 times. I couldn't get enough of this book. I felt like I was in the book. I could also picture everything going on in my head I have recommended this book to several friends. I love the story line. I call this book the book I cant put down. I disagree with alot of the negative reviews the book has gotten. This was my first book by the author and I will be buying the following book called Walking Disaster.
B000002JK2|5.0|This is classic Townshend.  It's become hard to find for good reason - it's really good.  Took me back down memory lane.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great for checking conditions at home and across the country where my family members live. I use the satellite map just to view other parts of the world.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked it i should read the next book<br />After I read diary of a wimpy kid yea, ha ha!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Nothing really special here. It's ok as a flashlight, but I was expexting emergency flashes and such. Can't expect something for nothing.
B0098VXMNE|2.0|This show was awesome in the very first season. Unfortunately the lead died and the replacement guy just does not have the same heart and soul. I was disappointing in this season overall but will not stop watching. If you are squeamish about graphic blood and violence or full male and female nudity and graphic sex I would also avoid this show because it has it all.
B00993FEUK|1.0|We didn't get to see this one in theaters so we were really looking forward to the DVD release. My 10-year-old and I were the most excited about the release. He walked away to do something else after 20 minutes or so into the movie. He was the smart one. My wife kept asking \\"Do we have to watch this?\\" I kept hanging on, hoping for some improvement. We wasted our time. The plot has been done about 100 times in various forms. The scary scenes weren't scary (we expected this or we wouldn't have let our 10-year-old watch it) but the funny scenes weren't funny and the character interaction was very predictable. If there were 10 jokes in the movie, maybe 2 were funny. The only bright sides I can think of are that I now have this behind me and that the stop motion was okay to good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very good read!  The events in the books lead to great discussions with middle school students on reality tv shows and their audiences.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books were great, I couldn't put them down.  While I'm a little late jumping on the Hunger Games bandwagon, I'm so glad I did.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|FANTASTIC. Johnny Depp is delightful once again, and Tim Burton's genius comes shining through. This is one I will watch over and over.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|excellent movie !great effects and decent plot! jewel from 80´s  and this version comes with a lot of interesting extras
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There will never be enough words to explain just how wonderful this TV show is. Even if you hate science fiction, westerns, or action shows, this is a must see. Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy and Angel) once again creates a complex world full of defined, interesting characters and plot thrills that had me watching episode after episode. This show is great, and I always think about how much more could have been accomplished if it hadn't been cancelled.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The DVD arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition when it arrived.  This movie was my stepdaughter's favorite and I am looking forward to giving it to her son for Christmas!  Thank you for the quick shipping!!
B0025KW29U|5.0|Another great addition to the wonderful works of Joss Whedon. As a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly I knew I would love Dr. Horrible, but anyone who is entertained by sharp wit, cracking humor, and meaningful substance will enjoy Dr. Horrible. I absolutely loved the songs and not to mention Neil Patrick Harris. My only regret is that it is only one episode, but still totally worth it.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|But the story line abruptly ended. I thought that the ending could have been much better. They spent so long building up the story and then just ended it kind of dumb.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|the movie is good, however it was to long, there were a lot of parts that simply the movie could of done without, as far as the villain bane, they did a good a good job of making him a smart criminal master mind, however i felt they should of added some of the characteristics of the batman cartoon bane i used to watch when i was a Kid, in which he has cables hooked on his body and head and when he presses a button he gets pumped up with steroids or something making him mader bigger and stronger, kind of like the hulk, google it you can view pictures of what the original bane looked liked, i wasn't impressed by the sleep apnea mask he wore in this movie , lol, ok its not a sleep apnea mask, but it sure looks like one, it's just kinda of long, i guess after 2 hours i start getting bored with a movie, and this movie is about 3 whopping hours long, overall it is a great movie, you will definantly enjoy...gave it one star because it was to long, and im upset they didn't make bane like the original cartoon bane. but like i said, it is a great movie.
B008Y78QIY|5.0|It is hard for us to agree on a movie that everyone will watch. This one fit the bill. We all enjoyed it.
B00A12VW86|2.0|This is not the innovative and fun Green Day from the last few albums. This sounds like forced and recycled sounds to generated to feed the marketing machine they are stuck in. Twilight soundtrack? Really? The only thing worse than this album is the posts from their facebook feed.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Loved this book, couldn't put it down- didn't love the ending though. I actually looked up facts because it was so interesting.
B0031ES8P6|3.0|Even that the doll its small, it’s a perfect gift for a little girl or girlfriend (if she likes Hello Kitty).
B000003NA4|5.0|I think this is one of her best offerings.  Who can remain uptight while listening to DK and band?  My customers even comment.  She's good for my business (cabinet shop).  She's good for my head.  BW.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It came in great condition, new. Have no problems with it and would definitely recommend it to others!
B000TDFKVW|5.0|I've always loved this album and had lost my cd years ago. Just got it again through amazon mp3 and still love it :)
B002M3SOWO|5.0|I have the other books from this saga. Definitely was a great book. It came to me in new condition so I have not had any problems.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I've used this app several times on various devices for several years and it's always been very easy to install and use on just about anything. Currently using it on my computer, my Asus Eepad, and my Samsung Galaxy S3 with no issues.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very good and accurate app.  I am really pleased with this one.  Even alerts you to weather advisories and warnings.
B002DD46P2|5.0|No regret about paying for this one. Still on my Kindle, and I listen to it often. Only complaint is that Amazon appears to some times not have his Transformer related albums in stock (even as a download).
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love facebook but this app doesn't seem to work correctly. it only displays a few posts at a time and then it doesn't let you refresh like the regular website does.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great series you really get hooked on it and hate to see it end! Can't wait for the next season to start. Great service, On time!
