B000MRA5NS|5.0|Action sequences and plot as well as Bond quips make this a terrific movie.  The Blu-ray is crisp and clean, sound and music are great.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game is the best ever I love it my high score is 20 mil I love it buy it!!!!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Love the movie.  Cute for kids. The deal was unbeatable.  Gotta love a good deal on movies like these! Excellent!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I choosed this rating because the storyline was about guy that had a vision and went after it.  As I anticipated,  the movie was not all about male stripping but was about a young man that love the fast life but had personal goals in mind.  I believe I like the lady that played the sister the most in this film because when Mike(Channing Tatum) runs across her it was love at first site.  She is a bright, strong and sophisticated woman that is concern about the welfare of her younger brother which couldn't find himself.  Moreover,  she is a responsible woman which Mike was inspired by and it didn't hurt that she is cute.  I would recommend this film to anybody that is a movie buff because I definitely think they will enjoy it.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I especially liked the way that Ian McEwan ended the book as it was satisfying to me as a reader.  He is one of my favorite authors.
034580404X|5.0|I loved reading this series! This is also a great price! I would recommend these books for sure...now on to the bared series
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the continuation of the hunger games. Fast paced and riveting, gotta go now book three is calling. Excellent
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I've just finished reading this stellar offering for the third time. I've referred to it countless others. If you're an author and you want to make progress on multiple levels, buy this book - NOW!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved the movie and wanted to read the book. The movie is very different from the book but the book has very thoughtful details. It was a fun read.
B001TH16DI|5.0|The original star trek movies, in blu-ray high quality format!  It was great going back and seeing the originals in better video quality.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although I could not say that I liked the characters in this book I had to read it until the end as I needed to find out what happened.  Therefore I have to say it kept my attention.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is so much fun. It had enough different elements to make it interesting. Star Wars and Angery Birds is a great match!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't<br /> stop reading. The story was utterly believable. My only disappointment was the rather abrupt ending but still a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not stop reading!  Finished the volume in 4 days between working full time and 5 hours sleep a night. Looking forward to seeing what happens next!
B007UWBQEU|2.0|every time I try to listen in my cloud player i hear one song & it  stops, once in a while I get 2 songs.  very frustrating
0385535147|4.0|As the New York Times said, &#34;“The Racketeer” is an unusual book for Mr. Grisham. Unlike many of his others, it has no soapbox to stand on and is not out to teach lessons about justice. This book is much more duplicitous than that. In its early stages it does follow the familiar Grisham template, in which a lawyer finds himself unexpectedly in legal trouble. But then it breaks out into the exhilarating tale of how Mal, a disbarred attorney, now a savvy, self-taught legal scholar, leads his pursuers on a long, winding chase.&#34;  I concur!
1884883303|4.0|There is a ton of great info here, and i don't want to be too critical, but some well established brands have no prices at all or very gerneral prices.  Owners of Schecter, for example, will be disappointed.<br /><br />Good acknowledgement of lots of builders , but again, some are missing specific prices.  Great coverage of Gibson, Fender and their subsidiary companies, but if you're a &#34;bottom feeder&#34; like me, you won't get a lot of detail on Teisco, Kawai, etc.  Though Harmony is covered well as is Kay.<br />It's a good resource.
0345803485|3.0|If you've read NINE AND A HALF WEEKS and THE STORY OF O (not to mention the Victorian-era underground classic, A MAN WITH A MAID), you'll probably be underwhelmed by FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.  It's far too much Harlequinn romance fantasy and much less psychological depth, not to mention a complete disregard for reality.<br /><br />And I'm not talking about the sex scenes.  They're fine, as sex passages go.  They get less interesting because Ana continues to have spectacular orgasms and Mr. Grey is quite the maestro of leading into the BDSM lifestyle.<br /><br />But here's what I didn't believe: Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />Christian Grey is the perfect man.  Devastatingly handsome, impeccably groomed and always smelling fantastic.  Dressed in the best.  Fiercely intelligent, a stern, commanding presence, a dominating but compassionate businessman.  Witty, driven...so...am I to believe that a young woman would be so hesitant to be with a man like him?  She refuses all gifts.  From a billionaire.  She has reservations about his kinks.  From a billionaire who gets her off every time he touches her.<br /><br />Let's take a glance at reality for second, shall we?<br /><br />I've seen some of the most beautiful women in the world with old, fat, disgusting men with a fraction of the cash Christian Grey has.  That this story doesn't address the legions of hot ladies out there willing to do anything to get close to a rich man pushes it into the Harlequinn fantasy landscape.  An aloof and very elderly Hugh Hefner takes a half-dozen young beauties to bed every night of his life.  Am I supposed to believe that Christian Grey is so freaky (and he's not in this book) that he's only had a dozen lovers who indulge him?<br /><br />And that Anastasia and her friends & family don't talk to her about being wooed by a billionaire is another unbelievable omission.  Her best friend is \\"suspicious\\" of him?  Are you kidding me?  I've seen the best of female friends stab each other in the heart fighting over some blue-collar bubba who stays faithfull to no one.<br /><br />So, by the end, this book is just a romantic fantasy that flirts with a kinky lifestyle.  I didn't believe a word of it.  But, if the ladies dig it and they loosen up a little with their lovers, boyfriends or husbands, I can't completely trash it.  (At 514 pages, I don't think I'll be reading the rest of the trilogy).fighting over some blue-collar bubba who stays faithfull to no one.<br /><br />So, by the end, this book is just a romantic fantasy that flirts with a kinky lifestyle.

B001EN71CW|5.0|If you're a sci-fi fan I think you'll love this series!! It's fun and different from most science fiction but very entertaining! Give it a try!
B000JMKNVK|3.0|It is a good book but not the best Dennis Lehane. Some cliché scenes were not necessarily needed. Writing is great as usual.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|It doesn't condition the battery but for free it's ok. The app gives a lot of info, but not all is relevant to the Kindle HD.
B003VIWO8Y|1.0|Other than remind us every two pages that Megadeth has sold millions of albums and brag that he's got laid with more women than inhabit the globe, Dave Mustaine reiterates that he's the sole mastermind behind it all (not Megadeth only, but the whole genre, actually; perhaps the music industry itself, as he appears to believe himself to have surpassed the Beatles, Shakira and Michael Jackson combined in regard to fame); and then, this fellow slates anyone who ever came in touch with him throughout his pathetic life - to most of whom, he claims, he imparted his ancient ninja moves.<br /><br />There is exiguous mention of other bands (as though he belongs to, and therefore perceives, an alternate universe that will never have enough room for anything but Megadeth), and if he drops a name, it's merely and strictly to disparage them, same as he berates his own bandmates, no exception made.<br /><br />Moreover, I would add \\"William Burroughs reloaded\\" as an apposite subtitle to this book, since Dave talks at length about his recurrent addictions.<br /><br />In short, blend Einstein with Napoleon and Mozart, and you'll get a glimpse of Dave Mustaine's grandeur and contribution to save, mould and re-define our modern civilisation. What a prick!
B000ELJBAA|5.0|This was an excellent solo effort from 1984, if you like Pink Floyd you will like this album even though style-wise it is very different sounding. This is a strong album all the way through, with 2 songs co-written by Pete Townshend,
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters. But, I was so glad to get it on DVD.  I'm deaf and I just love closed caption.  The theater we went to had close caption, however watching it at home, SO MUCH BETTER.
B009AY04A8|4.0|All of the Nevosoft games are an enjoyable combination of levels -challengi<br />ng enough to keep me playing,  but easy enough to keep me from being frustrated - I find these games very entertaining.
0307277887|4.0|I am not a big ready, but I know of the TV show. So, I bought this book for someone else and they absolutely loved it. That made me happy
0307719774|5.0|smaller then expected but oh so cute and excited to use. Full of unique questions and looks so pretty sitting on my shelf
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series had me at the first  few pages. When the first book ended I was breathless. By the time I had finished the last book I knew without a doubt that I had found one of my new favorite authors. I will be purchasing many more of this authors books.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|this is a great game. you can zoom so I am not sure why other reviews say you cant. the story is fun and the hidden objects are well done
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie made me want to watch the first two again,  a great ending to the trilogy.<br />Would make a great gift for any BATMAN FAN!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|this game is great good pictures items are challenging but not too hard. I can zoom in just fine on my kindle fire. I wish that you could skip the dialogue parts but overall great game!!!!!
0761163808|5.0|We bought this as a gift for a little one who loves animals and action books after seeing one at ToysRUs.  Each moving picture has a page of text about the animal shown.  Best for older children, as pages are thick (due to image insert) but fairly fragile in construction, similar to pop-up books.  Text is very small and fairly technical, reading level seems like at least 4th grade.  But totally fascinating for small children, could make a cool book to read together!
0786962984|4.0|I played the original Dungeon! board game with my family and friends as a child. Now that I'm a father of an eight year old boy I was excited to find a remake of it available since most vintage games are incomplete and overpriced. This version is wonderfully done with beautiful artwork, clean design and quality workmanship. The only improvement I would suggest would be to include molded miniatures instead of card board stand ups. The D&D tie-in is a nice bonus. Bravo Wizards Of The Coast! Keep the remakes coming and keep the prices accessible for families that want to play and not just collect these games.
B003ES61EE|1.0|Bought this product. The tip broke off the first time I used it. It didn't cost very much, so I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is super funny and entertaining for all ages. It was a great price so I couldn't resist buying it as soon as I saw it on my reccomendation list.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|My son watches this movie over and over. Its funny enough to keep us adults watching. Good movie to add to any kids collection.

B004HX4RT6|4.0|Play against the computer. Challenges your skill level with various skill levels. Fun to play. I like playing it and I'm not very good.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love American Horror Story. I look forward to watching them every week. It's the best thing on TV. The characters are awesome the story line is so suspenseful. I love Jessica Lange she makes the series excellent
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love it the only thing I do not like about it is it takes away the coins but I love it so much I think you should get this app.
0143121006|4.0|Interesting historical whodunnit, suspenseful, good period context, but could be richer, with more detail and description.  Even so, great account of an historical moment with the backdrop of global events in Asia in the late 1930s.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|I love this movie and originally owned it on dvd. When I saw it at a good price in blu ray I had to get it.

034580404X|5.0|If you are uptight about sexuality do not read these books. Also remember that this IS a story and it's fiction. That being said...I have read through one and a half books in two days. They are those can't put down, where did the time go type books. Very good imagination E L James...thank you!
1595828753|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Avatar series and was not disappointed by this series. I read all three books for this series in about an hour and then read it again. When I was done I gave them to my godson and he has not stopped raving about them and is excited about the next installments. I will definitely be purchasing the whole set of Avatar books.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|saw this movie today and denzel was great in it..storyline was great..never a dull moment pretty much..kept me completely focused the whole movie...im a happy customer :)

B002G1YPH0|5.0|My old fan was stock, dirty, and poorly mounted so when I say that this fan brought the temperatures down 40C from it's highs, that is perhaps an unfair accolade since the stock cooler if properly cleaned, pasted, and mounted would have probably been pretty good too.  But it does keep temperatures under 60C and for an i7 120 watt CPU that is pretty good.  For under 25$, it is just what was needed.  I considered water cooling systems, but didn't have the need.  I don't overclock and just wanted a good cooler, not a great one, which would bring things in line again.  This did the trick for a cheap cost.  I could have had it idling at 30 perhaps with a water cooled system instead of the 40 idle I have now, but I would have had to put a whole lot more in the case, and dealt with a lot more aggrevation.  This assembly was fairly simple and straight forward and worked well.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I think everybody love it. It's very fun game and makes you think. This game help to entertain myself sometimes
B00753MBHA|5.0|Udo who? Just kidding. Although the legendary frontman wasnt a part of this new CD it still shines. My first thought when an older band releases some new material is \\"here we go again with another band past their prime looking for a quick cash grab\\". Sometimes I'm right and sometimes, like this time, I'm wrong.<br />If your looking for some excellent music that sounds like it jumped straight out of the 80s than this is for you. Upon first listen I really thought this was recorded back in the 80s. The new vocalist sounds comparable to Udo but stands on his own quite well. The guitars, drums, production are all top notch. I had to do some research on this CD first because I really believed this was something from back in the day. To my surprise it wasnt. No dissapointment here and no filler. These guys went into the studio with a plan and they certainly delivered the goods.<br />So if your a bit nostalgic like I am with my 80s metal than you'll love this slab. Dont hesitate. Buy today!<br /><br />P.S. Thanks Amazon for making this CD available for $4.99 MP3 Download.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book used - only to see why everybody seemed to love it and why it was so successful.<br />Never got that question answered, however: I for my part have hardly ever in my life read something that was so utterly, completely boring as this attempt of an erotic? porn? story.<br />Plot: better than barbiturates to make you fall asleep.<br />Style: Aaaaargh!<br />Topic: yaaaaaaawwwwwwn.<br />Characters: flat and utterly unbelievable. I mean, come on - are there really people out there that do their thinking in their genitals solely?<br />Why is this book so successful? Honestly, I have no idea.
B005R5U5B2|1.0|first was coming from FANBABY , then found a new place was sending , never got it even though I have to wait to the 17th of dec. which will be this coming Monday, I hope I get it, I have seen alot of complaints about this FANBABY
B000065V42|5.0|The reason I buy used DVDs is to save money. Most of the time I get them in good to fair condition, but this DVD was in great condition. The movie showed good with no problems at all. I was very pleased that the case cover was also in good shape. There were no scratches or nicks.<br /><br />Mother form Denver
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app it is challenging in a fun sort of way for all ages, it is addicting and makes you use your brain
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it and I think everyone has to to have it. it shows everything to have to know about the battery.
B009RH973I|5.0|Fit the kindle perfectly and snug. I loved it, it is going to be a great gift for my kids.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|As has been said before, the visual quality of this release is a huge disappointment - especially when compared to the stunning visual quality of the first season blu ray release.<br />The most obvious failure I've seen so far is the cut-off saucer section in 'The Schizoid Man'.<br />There are however also a couple of shots when the Enterprise (which is kind of the star of the show) looks just blurry and lacks much of the detail that you can see in other shots. It looks like the various layers from which the ship is composed (model, lights etc) are not layered correctly thus creating a positional offset which eg. detaches the running lights from the ship and creates a fuzzy image which is totally not blu ray quality!<br /><br />I encourage everyone to speak up and I really hope that CBS will reconsider outsourcing any more seasons - and if they do they should CAREFULLY review the work from the external studio!<br />I was really looking forward to the second season, but this leaves me with a bitter taste of being ripped off!!<br /><br />Though some episodes are really great (I loved the extended cut of \\"The Measure of a Man\\") and the picture quality is not consistently bad, this whole release leaves me with the feeling of having bought a new car (which I was looking forward to for month) which than arrived with a flat tire and a small scratch in the painting...
B004LWZWGA|5.0|thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks very much  very satisfied . I didnt want to write a review this long

B002XTXFU8|5.0|Great movie just a out there great movie about a man trying to stay sane atleast you can Call it that lol.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I had never read the books before I saw the movie, but I liked it instantly. Then, I went back and read the book. Different may be an understatement. Things that happened in the book weren't in the movie, and things in the movie didn't happen in the book. However, I like both the book and movie. I kind of see them as somewhat different series because it seems so different, except for the basic plot of the story. After I did read the book, however, I was a little disappointed with a few scenes left out, making me rate this 4 out of 5 stars. All in all, the movie was very good and I can't wait for Sea of Monsters to come out.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|If you like angry brids, you will like this game to. Love the game the few times I play it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The Oregon Trail is a great game. I love it! Way better than the computer version I played back in the 90s. I have been hooked on this game since the moment I started playing it. I definatly recommend this game for everyone that likes playing interactive games. The more you play the more items you earn. It is awesome!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Good story line.  Interesting and captivating all the way through.  Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys Will Smith's acting and has followed the MIB movies.
0198325002|5.0|All of the Oxford shakespeare products are very helpful to me. the definitions of uncommon Shakespeare words and images in the play have proved quite helpful. there is only one small downside for teachers; at the beginning of the play, there are summaries in layman's terms and students might use those instead of reading the actual Shakespearian text.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am glad they released this for the Kindle Fire, so finally I get to play it. Everything in this game is pretty fun and it really reminds me of Sim City and that series is awesome. I like the free to play even more with the micro-transactions ability. It is a great MLP game and a good time killer for older fans of the show and a good game for kids too. I plan on spending a little money on it to support the developers as well. And to the people complaining that kids can spend a lot of money on this, just change to an empty card on your Amazon account or take it off, don't let that drive you away from this nice game.<br /><br />So five stars to Gameloft on this game, I have been waiting a while for this on the Fire.<br /><br />And Pinkie Pie is best pony.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|It is a good case but it would be a lot better if it had an opening for the power cord and mini USB cable. The way it is now you have to have the case open to recharge or take it out of the case.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|It's like 10 movies.  But its a TV series.  Well acted, well scripted, beautiful sets.  I look forward to watching this every year, it's going to be a bummer when they stop producing it.  I'm in Season 6 now and it has yet to lose the suspense or mystery.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Worth it's weight in GOLD !<br />In less then 5 minutes, took two dull blades and got them back to razor sharp status.<br /><br />  Easy to use.<br />  Lightwieght yet good and sturdy.<br />  Small and compact (so don't forget where you store it).<br /><br />Great item for a gift - ya just can't go wrong with this one !
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  I was introducing the art of the debate to my grandchildren and this was an excellent reference plus a great history lesson.
B002SRQ214|4.0|This CPU was the fastest supported by my motherboard. I wanted to upgrade to the AMD FX 8350 or 8150 but I would have to buy a new AM3+ motherboard and memory. I decided to extend the life of my existing motherboard instead hopefully for at least another year. I upgraded from an AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ processor. Although it was fast for my needs, it became sluggish with playing Blu-Ray and HD videos as well as video/photo editing. Free Shipping delivery was reasonably fast and received on time. Installing this new CPU to my ASUS motherboard M3N78 Pro was quick, about 5 minutes. I powered my PC and noticed the CPU was immediately recognized on my Windows 8 Pro system. I checked BIOS and all was good. Noticed that boot-up was way quicker and loading the Metro/Desktop was very fast. I immediately tested playing HD video (1080p) and my Blu-Ray movies and was pleased to see that they now play smooth without any freezing. Video editing was somewhat faster but not enough to excite me which is why I took off 1 star. Fan noise is about the same as my old CPU fan, only slightly louder. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|This was a requested Christmas gift for my uncle. It will really make his day to add it to his collection; and it really made my day coming in under the pre-order price, And, getting here in time for me to mail it out of state in time for Christmas. Bravo Amazon!!!
B004L79VUI|5.0|Robbie Robertson is a master story teller within music. Love his stuff! This release does not disappoint. CD arrived on time, no damage and its great~
B008N1V11U|4.0|This is probably my favorite to 2nd favorite app I play it at least once a day. $6.99 is a little steep but I waited for it to go on sale. There are plenty of missions and side quests to keep you busy for along time. Over all I give it a 4.5 and highly reccomend it (works great on kindle fire)
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Every song is so beautifully sung, I simply don't get tired of listening to it. One of her best albums.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Bought this for my son-in-law. He absolutely loves it. Sound is awesome. I need to buy one for my husband as he also loved it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I wanted to get the movie after having read the book. Both were equally satisfying. it is a great snapshot of what life as the hired help is like when their employers aren't looking.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I kinda dislike it because it wont let me play it!!! '-' this is the first day I bought it and it even doesn't let me open the app. maybe it's because my game has a problem
B002RVZV9U|5.0|We saw this at the theater & loved it.  It is ridiculous to have a word count requirement for a review. Makes me want to ignore review requests.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love the settings in these type of movies...that was back when women were women and men were men and you didn't have to look twice and wonder.
0062060554|1.0|First, I must say, I am someone who gives a book a chance before forming an opinion.  And I am not overly hard to impress but, THIS BOOK DROVE ME CRAZY!<br /><br />Going though the motions of this women waking up everyday not knowing anything couldn't have been more annoying.  Now I have read books with a similar premise and enjoyed them.  But, the way Watson chose to write this story left me waiting for things to pick up, and sadly it never happened.  Even at the end when I thought I might get some answers, I was left completely unsatisfied.  The only way the ending made sense to me is if there is going to be a second novel.  Otherwise, it was just a terrible way to end a terrible book.  I beg of you, hit the back button and order something else.  Do not waste your time or your money on this novel.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love it. Works great and looks cool. 20 word minimum. review is kinda a pain in the butt though. Using the app is much easier than writing the review.
0439023513|5.0|Suzane Collins really outdid herself in this series.  It is the first series I have read where the story got better with 2nd and 3rd installations.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Still need to watch the last 3 hours.  Hated what happened in the last 2 episodes I watched, but it's a good series.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|To know that original Abba members were involved in the production of these recordings, definitely makes it worth<br />your while to purchase, if you are a 'true Abba Collector!<br />Benny and Bjorn  give all to this album tribute to Abba.  I have my album collection of Abba , and love to listen to them often,<br />knowing I will hear 'upbeat songs of Love. Chance and  Awsome Vocal arrangements, with easy to remember storylines.<br />I sort of had my doubts whether or not this album would keep the same level of  'High-end 1976, Abba excitement! which you would want to play over and over, but, YES it really has all that!  To listen to the Mamma Mia Soundtrack, The Idea of Benny, was not to Imitate Abba, but present an explaination to each song though storyline in the movie. This gives each song much more meaning when taken from disc, to screen.  You really must 'see it to love it, but, owning the soundtrack to relive Abba again, Is also a 2 thumbs up for me!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Interesting mix of Silicon Valley technology and good old fashioned books. It was a quick, easy, and very entertaining read.
0439023491|5.0|The second novel was better than the first in The Hunger Games series.  I can't wait to read the third one!
B00164KYV4|5.0|Got this as a gift for my sister. She said it arrived on time and was new. The price was great.
B00364K6YW|1.0|I thought this was the one I saw on TV but it wasn't!!!! This one was edited and had alot of things taken out
B005LAII1C|1.0|This is strictly a technical review, specifically I can't get the dang thing to play! I have a Samsung blu-ray player (Consumer Report top-rated) and when I put the disc in the Universal logo cycles but then the screen goes dark and nothing happens.  The DVD disc works fine but nada on the blu-ray.<br /><br />By the way, the movie is hilarious but definitely not for everyone! But the folks who gave it one star must be Boston women who ran out of Pepperidge Fahms!:D

B00005ATQD|5.0|The movie was awesome...slow but keeps you on the edge of your seat...The piano music was still playing in my head when I went to bed though.
0316228532|4.0|I Thought the story was engaging and the characters very believable.  It was a bit long (503 pages), but a fairly quick read because you were eager to find out what would happen next, with and to the people of this small town.
B00A04BKA0|5.0|What an unforgeattable book! This is someone's experience told in simple words where logic, common sense, trust and acceptance of non-tangible realities come together beautifully. Anyone who can embrace and accept someonelse's experience will be encouraged to open their own consciousness to infinite possibilities and forever abandon any fear of death, our next adventure!
B008M721MS|5.0|I downloaded this app because I wanted to stay in touch with my mom and close family. It was the best thing I ever did!  Now, my kids can stay in touch with there Grandma. No need to rack up your phone bill nor your precious cell phone minutes. It's so easy to use my Grandma uses it a lot! Thanks Skype for making it possible. When you need it the most, communicate with Skype!  Download it today! Works well with any tablet!!!
B008OOYALE|3.0|this is fun but I can barely move up Bc things cost so much. it'd be better if the prices went down to clear ur own land. 50000 coins to clear a tree is crazy.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was an excelleng movie. I loved every minute of it...This was one of the best Christian movies I have seen!
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this for a friend since it has brought so much entertainment to my home!! My children are all different ages and all are glued to the tv when this is on!! I also must admit, as skeptical as I was about this movie before I watched it, I can say Rapunzel is my new favorite Disney Princess!! There is something for everyone in this movie, there is love, adventure, and humor! This a movie we have watched probably a million times and will most likely watch a million times more!! Buy it and you will not regret it!!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Played on Kindle Fire.  First, you CAN zoom.  Not that it's needed all that much.  The variety of games keeps the game from being too boring and the story is interesting enough to keep your attention.  Overall this is a solid game if you enjoy seek and find.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|So what isn't to like? I can read this story over and over. I'm very glad I could get it for free to enjoy. Thank you Amazon!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining and really fun to help pass the time away. definitely would recommend to puzzle likers
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I purchased this gaming system for my son, but after using it, I had to purchase one for myself too.  This system is simply awesome.  I was worried about the viewing angle on the High Def screen based on some of the reviews, but it is highly viewable from a wide range of angles, although straight on is best.  I highly recommend this product, it is probably the coolest thing I've purchased since the XBOX 360!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't sleep well at night, so when I'm awake, I tend to turn to this game. I have it on my Kindle Fire and it works terrific. Smooth play and the colors pop off the screen.  The many, many puzzles mean you will stay entertained for a long time.  I like puzzles that make me think and this one fits the bill. It gives you stats as to how you did and challenges you to do it in less moves. Right up my alley! I hope Big Duck Games comes out with more like this....I really won't get any sleep!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|So much going on in this psych mystery.  I really liked the story because of the complicated themes. Not something you can read if you are prone to interruptions.  Overall great book, in the end mystery solved BUT no details given on what happens.  I seriously hope this is a lead in to the next book, if not My disappointment grows.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Good selection of all the best Bond songs plus an interesting selection of soundtracks. I'd also bought a book about the Bond music so it was interesting cross referencing between the two.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I love Channing Tatum and I am trying to get all his movie. But wow this movie was really raunchy but it did have really funny scene.
0689878451|5.0|This is a really sweet book.  My daughter loves it and we often end up reading it 3 or more times.  Thank you.
B0013TTLDE|1.0|I tried very hard to like this book. Even putting it down and coming back to it a week later, but I just couldn't get past the first 50 pages. Slogging dialogue, shallow characters. The plot sounded so interesting but it just didn't flesh itself out enough for me. It seemed as if the author got so bogged down in the interplay between characters, that the thread of the story got lost. It just didn't 'move'.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|I generally like Rob's movies but this one was too weird for me.  We saw it in a theater that plays unusual movies and this one must be among the weirdest.  My friend wanted to leave about halfway through but I convinced her to stay thinking it will get better.  She did leave before the final (awful) ending.  I couldn't find anything worthwhile and regret that I wasted two hours of my life watching it.
1401923127|5.0|i TOOK THIS BOOK WHILE i WAS RECOVERING FROM A HERNIA OPERATION. The surpise of dr's teaching other dr's and then looking at me, like, what was I dioing with this book. like oniy dr's should have it.
B005FISC52|5.0|This was the last season of the series. It was really good I just wish it was longer. And wish it would have more of James Lafferty in it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire:  i'm addicted so this was a must for me; i like my kindle one because i can play at work
0062215507|5.0|For those who love the movies and want to read more about the movie-making experience, this is a great book. There is a copy of the letter to Harry Potter announcing his admission to Hogwarts, brochures from various shops in Diagon Alley, and the infamous Marauder's Map.<br /><br />A great gift for Harry Potter movie fans.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Love it. Great app to have to keep up with the latest, from news to entertainment to everything else. Highly recommend this app
0425263908|5.0|This is my favorite book. It got it all a hot man hot sex and a hot love story. It a must have.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book is a quick read and very informative.  As a result of the book, my family and I are trying to eliminate all wheat from our diets. We started after Thanksgiving and already feel better. More energy, less aches and pains.  I have been craving more sugar foods, however, now that I am aware of this, I am making a conscience effort to manage sugar content.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Enjoyable action and characters but definitely not as good as the other Bourne thrillers. The ending was especially disappointing and kind of cheesy. I would've liked a richer script and deeper story in this movie. Interesting but undeveloped. I might watch again if it were free or nothing else on. I have all the other Bourne movies so may consider adding to my collection but not really motivated to buy at this point.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am a senior citizen and rather new to the new e-reader technology and I found this version of the Bible to be easy to use. The menu selections were simple for me to navigate. The feature that allows me to make my own notes on a particular passage is one of my favorites. The concordance and Bible dictionary features are also easy to manage and allow for quick tabbing between them and the daily study verses. The audio is another fine feature that I appreciate. The voice talents reading the Scriptures are a valuable asset to this verison of the Bible. The many different versions of the Bible are easy to access for comparative study
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This is a very dark version of the classic Snow White. This is a real good movie I think all the actors did a fantasic job doing their part.
158270208X|5.0|I was truly surprised by the quality of this 5 x 7&#34; journal.  It has a hard cover with thick pages.  I liked the journal so much that I reordered 4 of them to give as gifts.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|I love the Men in Black concept but i believe Will Smith is too awesome to be in this half good, half bad movie. I loved the first movie it was flawless but greatness doesnt deserve this type of treatment and they could of done better in part 3. Writers need to stick with what works. Better writing less CGI. See it then buy it. You may want it just for WILL SMITH.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|You don't really get many special features but its still worth it. Its good quality movies for a low price
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is one of the best classic movies from the 80s. This is the movie that made me have such a big crush on Emilio.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|came in less than a week and in great shape. good movie for all ages. the movie is so real at times right down to their hair moving in the wind.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The whole movie is done well. The animation, the script, the story line, and the voice acting were all beautiful. I recommend to everyone; it's not just a children's movie.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|i like her books alot but this one paled -it seemed as if she wrote this book trying to figure out an ending as she went along-rather than add some hints  and a character in earlier she suddenly had a character appear at the end who we knew nothing about -this is too easy-it is not satisfying to be guessing all the way through a novel to only have a brand new character added in-
0425263916|5.0|All I can say is wow. This is also part of my top favorites. I kinda guessed some of it while I was reading it but it was still WOW. Love it.
B008G59IBI|5.0|It sets a very different mood than the rest. It's not as crazy and more mellow, well sorta. It has a more serious tone to it. It was overall very enjoyable. ESPECIALLY, if you have all three. Depending on your mood, You have a little bit of everything. This really completes a great trilogy. Everything Green Day makes is gold, in my opinion.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Well, obviously this movie isn't for me. I couldn't care less for it. Looks like some people who get the movie like it. Suffice to say, it's not for everyone.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of the more heartwarming movies I've seen.  Best of 2012.<br /><br />Though likely targeted at an over 50 crowd -- features people in the sunset of their lives, no sex.  There are a few younger people in the film, most prominently the leading actor of Slumdog Millionaire whose name this 60-something is forgetting.
B00866JL96|5.0|I think this is one of Zac Efron movies. He did such a good job in this movie. It was such a wonderful love story. But then all of Mr.Spark are.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a must have app. It's simple to use and very complete. It is well supported and is updated with new features.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am forever hooked on Pinterest! I just can't get enough! This app runs great on my kindle fire. I could set for hours<br />and  go through this. It just keeps going and going. full of endless information.
B0098460O4|3.0|I want to add something to the discussion about Jonathan and Charlotte being paired.  Jonathan has an incredible opera voice, while most people consider Charlotte \\"pop.\\"  In fact, I bought the record from itunes and it was listed under \\"pop\\" music.  One musician and critic on this site corrected those calling Jonathan a tenor, saying he is bass/baritone.  When, in recent history, has anyone inspired the general public to care about the difference?  It matters because of Charlotte.  Jonathan can leave Charlotte and pursue a career in the opera arena where he will no doubt become famous, existing among the rest of the opera gods, but with Charlotte, the pair invites a musical conversation between youth and tradition.  It's an opportunity we shouldn't pass on.  Charlotte takes the present back through time, meeting our mythical Western heritage in the guise of an enigmatic actor somewhere on a stage in Vienna.  It's really beautiful and better than sheer nostalgia.  They're young and will grow.  There's a tough road ahead but it's a cool story and worth the anticipatory reverence for music and its power to move the masses.<br /><br />There is one BIG problem with the CD: what the heck with the back up singers?  Jonathan is a once in a lifetime experience; the choir in the background is a crisis!  I don't see how this wasn't OBVIOUS to the producers.  The pair are pure together so keep it simple, please.  Go minimal.<br /><br />In the event Jonathan and Charlotte have a moment to read some of these comments, I'd like to direct my thoughts to them.<br /><br />Dear Jonathan,<br />Feel free to be an a!@#$hole because there's no charity in the judgment of your voice.  You are simply gifted; that's it.  We are at your mercy.  But, PLEEEZE know that the teasing you suffered as a young child/young man does not escape us, even as you ascend to your rightful place.  You remind many of us of what potentially could have been lost if cruelty had won the day.  Your success is not simply based on your overcoming abuse; it also happened despite the abuse.  Violence had no hand in bringing you to the stage; it wasn't the motivating force; it did not inform your determination and it gets NO credit.  Charlotte loved you and that's why we dodged the \\"bullet\\" that would have robbed us of a 21st century master.  Many of us know that this is where the gratitude belongs; it wasn't an accident and it's not one of those \\"against the odds\\" stories.  Charlotte is the one who acted to let the world know what it was missing, and she did it knowing people would compare her voice to yours and say some of the meaner things that have been said since this started.  Though suffering might have informed your passion, your road was unnecessarily difficult.  I pray that your fame and success go smoothly and that you find the acceptance and kindness that you were denied before.  Most importantly, I hope your bond with Charlotte remains strong, whatever circumstances or wherever you find yourselves.  Your voices inspire us but it is your genuine ability to value each other, whether or not you conform to standards of beauty or greatness, that really makes your story potentially legend.<br /><br />To everyone else,<br />BUY the CD, if for nothing else, so that it's clear that the buying public wants to hear more.  You'll want to hear this and start a collection.
B000K4X5XA|3.0|Blu Ray quality is good but the movie went from great while on Krypton to stupid. I remember liking it as a kid but once Clark Kent got to earth it turned cheesy and slap stick and Superman turned out to be an undisciplined idiot who is prone to self pity. Lame hero.

B003V2HWP0|5.0|Not knowing anything about his movie, I had passed it by a couple of times because of the strange picture shown. I am so glad I chose to take the chance and watch it!! It was so much better than I had expected it to be, Sophie Marceau is wonderful! I loved it.<br />It is not fast paced, not a funny/witty movie.  It is so beautifully done, and well acted, you can feel what they feel! She is strong, but you can still see her pain, her love, her heart. Just so good.
B001B07KQA|4.0|Quicksilver Messenger Service's debut was a fiery and energetic rock and roll record that took away some of the structure to allow the basic instrumental setup of rock music to express its emotions much more freely that was possible within structures songs. The idea is one that is obvious mentally, but which was only really devised by [[ASIN:B0018AM2QG the Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], though bands from the 1970s and the 1990s/2000s post-rock era used it on many occasions to exceptional effect.<br /><br />For the follow-up to their debut, Quicksilver Messenger Service produced a far more ambitious project with \\"Happy Trails\\". Largely recorded live at New York's fabled Fillmore, the album consists of two distinct sides. The first is based around Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love\\" and aims to transform the song into a complex suite through the used of four of the band's own compositions, titled \\"When You Love\\", \\"Where You Love\\", \\"Which Do You Love\\" and \\"How You Love\\". This part of \\"Happy Trails\\" is the album's weak link, however, because too often the passion needed to sustain the epic instrumental playing Quicksilver aim for is not present. Cippollina's soloing lacks energy and the necessary contrast after the passionate vocal on the first part of \\"Who Do You Love\\" disappears except in the fourth part \\"How You Love\\", making this part a rather difficult to get through completely. The change of tempo to the softer, quasi-tribal \\"Which Do You Love\\" fails to reinvigorate the first side, but with another Bo Diddley cover, \\"Mona\\", Quicksilver even manage to better their masterful debut on the second side.<br /><br />On \\"Mona\\", Quicksilver use the live setting to get into perhaps the tightest groove seen with any rock band before [[ASIN:B0000ADY9I Duane Allman and Dickey Betts]] in their legendary concerts at the Fillmore in 1970 and 1971. The opening whisper \\"that's rock and roll\\" gives a perfect idea of what the bad does over the next seven minutes: the contrasting textures of Duncan and Cippollina that anticipated the two legendary pairings of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts followed by Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine support a fierce vocal from David Freiberg and hard-hitting drumming by Greg Elmore. The instrumental \\"Maiden of the Cancer Moon\\" is short but equally passionate and tense, moving rapidly from quiet passages to short, fierce, loud parts. \\"Cavalry\\", based on the crucifixion of Jesus, extends the basics of \\"Maiden\\" to create a work of sustained power from the opening unaccompanied guitar solo that is just so, so stark, to the epic band grooves that form the majority of the song. The album closes with the title song, a simple lullaby that manages to avoid the worst pitfalls of some of the first side.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Happy Trails\\" is an uneven record and not as easy to recommend as its predecessor; however, it is still worth owning if you can get past the flaws of the overambitious first side.of Duncan and Cippollina that anticipated the two legendary pairings of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts followed by Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine support a fierce vocal from David Freiberg and hard-hitting drumming by Greg Elmore.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|The BBC Life and Planet Earth series are the most amazing footage of Mother Earth and all her glory. So much thanks to the crews who spent years gathering all of this footage. I would be happy to pay 10x as much for these DVDs.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After watching season we couldn't wait for season 2 to arrive; once it did, we watched all the episodes within 3 days!  It was as full of pageantry as season 1, it even had its own twists and turns.  So glad that we pre-ordered season 3!

B009HV2JT8|3.0|While it will not win an Oscar, it was entertaining to watch as a vampire movie.  What I really liked was the way this movie incorporated historical facts into this movie.  I seriously hope that no one thinks that this movie is entirely based on facts. Overall I would say not a bad movie if you are looking for just someting to watch.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|I like Johnny Depp and he is great in those types of rolls.  As always he plays the part well, the movie on the other hand is well kinda strange and doesn't seem to pull the story well together.  I would say watch it if you have nothing better to do or if you are just a big Depp fan.  I think it was just ok.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I was looking at replacing a stereo in our kitchen, and original Bose sound dock - but I really wanted to look at the options.  I switched to and Android phone and my wife now has the iPhone 5 - now making the sound dock (without aux input) nearly obsolete.  This adapter came to the rescue - we can all listen to our phones or other media through the Bose.  Great investment.

B00AE2IJIE|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch, maybe a little scary for very young children.  There was a bit of adult humor mixed in (think Shrek) that would pass over most kids' heads.  However on the end (spoiler alert), some parents may have issues with this part and that is why I decided to point it out.  Norman's sister asks the older boy whom she has a crush on to go see a movie and he says his boyfriend would love that.  My ten year old son turned to me and said:  She just found out he's gay right!  That one did not get past him.  There are several topics this movie pokes fun of and if you can catch it, there is even a Scooby Doo reference.  Our family enjoyed the movie.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'll keep this one short, I admit I was a bit worried when this movie was about to come out, but was relieve to see that it lived up to the hype and the build up was worth it. Now onto the bluray itself, what can I say, the movie looks great and sounds great as well, the 3D is done well and I definitely enjoyed it on my 3D tv, the 3D doesn't look last minute like other movies and I'd say adds to some of the action. I recommend to all marvel fans.

B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I have loved Jack as a character from the first \\"Reacher\\" book I read, waiting impatiently for the next one. Unfortunately, I can't same the same for A Wanted Man.<br /><br />I won't repeat the synopsis, everyone knows it.<br /><br />The Cover:<br />Whoever chose the cover is a bit of a twit. Reacher is standing waiting for a lift, but the car heading toward him is approaching on the LEFT side of the road! When we were in the USA a few weeks ago, they were still driving on the right side.<br /><br />The story:<br />I \\"got\\" the first bit, where Reacher gets a ride in the car with the three people, but where the plot should escalate into full blown thriller mode, it remains flat and lifeless. Things go downhill from there. I feel there were way too many characters in this book, so many as to be utterly confusing. Law enforcement from all agencies charge into the fray until I don't know who is who or who is manipulating who. The sheriff is an unnecessary character along with plenty more.<br /><br />The novel is full of details about what the characters were seeing, how they were dressed... it was very boring and long-winded, as though the author couldn't think of a decent twist to hold the plot together, so grabbed at straws.<br /><br />The ending is a sorry mess. Reacher, single-handedly takes on a myriad of baddies and mows them down, and none of them manage to even touch him. I almost didn't finish this and that is a dreadful thing to have to admit about a Jack Reacher novel. Oh dear, Mr Child, please think about what you are doing to a beloved character, an icon of strength and justice, and one who thrilled your readers for many years.<br /><br />Lastly - and this is nothing to do with this story of course - but One Shot, the book of which I loved,  is spoiled for me. Tom Cruise has had a lot of bad press in recent times, he is the wrong age for a young Reacher and he is physically NOTHING like the character. So much so, that no long shots or close-ups is going to help the movie-goer to get over who is playing Reacher.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|<3 my heart wont ever be the same, its broken but kind of hopeful, just like what Peeta does to Katniss, he's the light to her darkness, the soothing balm to her fire. I simply love this trilogy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a really fun game there is a new uptate on this game so yah and one more thing I was playing it and I saw HEROBRINE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|All the Mexicans really were portrayed as Savages, and the white people were the good guys. Ridiculous movie, they're all drug dealers. The entire movie was absolutely pretentious, with the \\"brilliant\\" pothead that went to Berkeley, gets an idea from his Marine buddy to get Afghan marijuana and grow and sell it in the US. Like no one else has ever thought of that before. LOL. Blake Lively proves that she has no business ever acting in Hollywood again, and her voiceovers are absolutely annoying. Really annoying. John Travolta is annoying. Benicio Del Toro was not convincing as a hitman, and neither was Salma Hayek as a drug lord. The whole movie was one big farce, laughable to the nines. I would seriously avoid this. Oliver Stone is a hack.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|While I'm not a great fan of world politics,  I found this book fascinating.  We listen to the news about North Korea's growing missile and nuclear capability.  Read this book and you find out the whole country is one big  charade ... they are really bankrupt and their population starving.<br /><br />My book club read this book and agreed, it was an eye-opener.  Written in an manner that you just didn't want to put it down.
B00AAU2QA2|1.0|For one thing, I have to give Kesha credit for daring to try some songs without the use of autotune on this album in contrast to Animal. That might not be a bad thing, if she didn't sound even WORSE without it than with it. This proves that her ability as a singer is very limited at best, as is the case with all the other mainstream sound-alikes we have being produced just to make money off the masses. I will not blindly blame Kesha for 100% of this typical, generic-sounding, cookie-cutter dung heap; The majority of the blame goes to that loser known as Dr. Luke, who produces a handful of the other mainstream sound-alike puppets. He is a control freak beyond further investigation, and he never lets anyone whose records he produces have much of a say, if any at all.<br /><br />Also, I know people might try to defend this atrocity by saying that it was meant to be funny and that I &#34;have no sense of humor,&#34; but when it gets to the point of becoming downright dirty and sexually explicit... that is when I no longer see the humor. If anything, it just makes me want to puke. Call me a prude all you want, but anything as sexually explicit as some of the lyrics on this album is an automatic turn-off for me. Sexual innuendo can be done tastefully, such as in the case of Depeche Mode, i.e. &#34;Let my body do the moving / Let my hands do the soothing....&#34; that is as far as it goes. Also, if I want some humor in music once in a while, Devo takes care of that just fine, thank you. At least their humorous elements, with a few exceptions, are actually CLEAN. The same can hardly be said about this album, I hate to say. It just goes to show the standards of what is deemed &#34;acceptable&#34; in today's society, as sad as it is.
0345803485|3.0|I was eager to read the book everyone was talking about.  My copies were in excellent shape thanks to Amazon.  However the books leave a lot to be desired.  The &#34;sexy&#34; parts are repetitious and banal.  The word &#34;delicious&#34; is used in EVERY sex scene.  I found myself &#34;scan&#34; reading most of the book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The game is just plain fun.  My grandson loves it.  The graphics are colorful and the sound is hilarious. Super.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You would think I would be depressed reading this...my very young mom is currently in hospice with cancer. But I have never felt sad or scared for her. Maybe being a nurse helps me, but it doesn't protect me from lame euphemisms. This book was centering and grounding and adorable.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I don't know what everyone is talking about there is a zoom at least for kindle fire and it was very fin to play
B008U0FJF8|3.0|I have been following Manu Katche's CD's on ECM and for the most part, I have liked what I have heard. This new CD: Manu Katche, with Nils Petter Molvaer ; trumpet, Tore Brunborg on sax and Jim Watson on piano and Hammond B-3 is an interesting release. In my opinion, this CD is a mixed bag. I like some of the pieces here but not all the CD.<br /><br />One of the most interesting facts is that the band does not have a bass player, so the bass lines have to come from the pedals in the Hammond B-3 and this is very interesting. Follow the bass lines in all the songs and you will find them really interesting.<br />One thing is for sure: Manu Katche's drumming is fantastic throughout the entire disc. I love to hear him play the drums the way he does it...... if you can separate your attention and just follow the drumming lines, you will love this CD.<br /><br />Regarding the pieces of this CD, probably the best song in my opinion is Beats and Bounce , where the band, really takes off. There is some real jazz coming off here.<br />There is some introspection to this release. You need to work on it to like it.
0785156593|3.0|Was hoping for more based on the reviews, but there are too many plot holes and assumptions. It was a good story that could have been told better.
0375507256|5.0|Great book. Bought it for my husband. He enjoyed it and read it in three days.  He cant wait to see the movie now.
B00867GHS8|5.0|lo recomiendo otra experiencia totalmente diferente en 3d realmente sus ninos lo disfrutaran mucho, como los adultos tambien rapido envio
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever because it. has 101 games and then 31 more and there all differed and free . its the best game for my kids
B009FO908A|5.0|I love the 1D they have very good talent and good taste of music. Currently my fav band.<br />The music downloads form amazon have been good quality so far.
B00A77II0U|3.0|Great visuals and cut scenes with just enough creepy thrills to make this a lot of fun. I enjoyed the storyline and brief bits of character development. The puzzles were easier than I'd like and the hidden objects were repetitive at times. The puzzles were basically of the find all the right parts variety that amounts to a remember where you've been and what you've touched. They are very intuitive and I never became stuck. I beat the entire game and bonus content in just over 2 hours. That is a bit short in my opinion and I wish there were more and that the puzzles were harder. Fun game and I recommend it, but urge hardcore puzzle seekers to look elsewhere.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Wife and I just finished watching this. I have to say the original movies are way better. Please rent this movie first. Movie started off like a Senior citizen running a 100 yard dash. I was hoping this would be great like the ones with Damon. It seems like every time the main character in a great series is replaced the quality of the movie suffers(the last Spider-Man movie is an example) the acting was good but the director may need to think about a career change. Some may like it some may not. But like I said before RENT it first.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I had this book when my children were small. I read it so often that I wore it out !!!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix puts a great twist on classic Christmas songs.  The tracks are fun and mostly upbeat, great for listening while doing work around the house.  I like it so much that I wish there were more songs on the CD.  Definitely a great purchase!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love this series!  Follett is a master in developing characters, plots, story lines.  He has always been one of my favorite writers but this series is extremely well done.
B000007WNN|5.0|I bought this in the late 80's in vinyl & have the cd now.  In a time when fake, smiling, hairspray, video-loving \\"bands\\" were red hot and many of my friends had completely bought into the hype, Electric was a breath of fresh air.  I didn't know them previously but took a chance.  Not only was it the right move then, it's stood the test of time.  This things rocks & is gritty and rhythmic and easy to get acquainted with.  I'm not going to compare it to anything else - don't think that's relevant here.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Okay, just took my boys to see this-- it was AWESOME!<br /><br />Santa-- or \\"North\\" as he was in this movie-- as a Cossack Warrior (Alec Baldwin)<br /><br />Jack Frost as the star-- kind of the teenage rebel of the group (Chris Pine)<br /><br />The Easter Bunny as a badass Aussie (Hugh Jackman)<br /><br />The Tooth Fairy as a hummingbird-like creature (Ilsa Fisher)<br /><br />It was amazingly creative, and the story was at once touching, adventurous, and funny. And, down at it's core, it had real HEART, with a clear and blatant MESSAGE, that as long as there is hope in the world, it can outweigh the fear and darkness in it. 10 out of 10, I gotta say...
030758836X|3.0|I recently read one of Gillian's Flynn first novel and really enjoyed her writing style and the details of the characters, however with Gone Girl I did not enjoy the way she would input comments from the characters directed for the reader, I do not need to be given this information when I can figure it out as I'm reading the story. The ending was not conclusive nor does the reader have an opportunity to see where the husband will go from there. If would be great if she can pen a second novel that will tie up loose ends.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|Fantastic animation.  Great story!  I love this movie.  We have already watched it 3 times....and counting.  Can't wait to find others in this genre.
B005HIREJK|5.0|This is a very nice watch with a very, very nice face and cool features. It looks very nice on the wrist. I highly suggest for everyday wear.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|The 1947 version is the best of them in this Christmas classic.  It is a Christmas tradition. Good for the whole family
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Don Corleone: We have known each other many years, but this is the first time you've come to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you feared to be in my debt.<br />Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble.<br />Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say &#34;Don Corleone, give me justice.&#34; But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me &#34;Godfather.&#34; You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder - for money.<br />Bonasera: I ask you for justice.<br />Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.<br />Bonasera: Let them suffer then as she suffers.<br />[the Don is silent]<br />Bonasera: How much shall I pay you?<br />[the Don turns away dismissively, but Bonasera stays on]<br />Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by some chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies. And then, they would fear you.<br />Bonasera: Be my friend... Godfather.<br />[the Don at first shrugs, but upon hearing the title he lifts his hand, and a humbled Bonasera kisses the ring on it]<br />Don Corleone: Good.<br />[He places his hand around Bonasera in a paternal gesture]<br />Don Corleone: Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day.<br />[a gratified Bonasera offers his thanks and leaves]<br />Don Corleone: [to Hagen] Give this job to Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren't going to be carried away. I mean, we're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker thinks...[to Hagen] Give this job to Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren't going to be carried away. I mean, we're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker thinks...
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I cannot believe this was free w/Amazon Prime!  I was entranced by this series.  I never knew history could be so exciting, seductive and enthralling.  The costumes were amazing.  I even recommended to my parents who are English history buffs.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is good and lets you know when you get emails, easy to send emails, but I still have not figured out how to get to the contact from my email account from device. But overall it is great!
B007SWZVBQ|3.0|wish that more songs from the season were included. overall not bad - just had some great songs that didn't make the &#34;cut&#34; - where is the &#34;mean&#34; song by Beast and Puckerman?!
0525952926|5.0|After reading Fall of Giants, I waited to long for the 2nd book to be released.  However it was worth the wait.
1401322786|3.0|What if Adam and Eve had not disobeyed God? Wouldn't they have lived forever? Would life then be less precious?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and get use too. I love the audio part, where It reads God's word to you. It is great to have this with you when you forget your Bible!
0783225857|5.0|Although the book and movie rarely resemble one another, in this case, the movie is so well done, that if there are discrepencies, one hardly takes notice...who can watch this movie and not be changed?  Gregory Peck as Atticus is impeccable. He makes you want to be a better person, a better parent...  you forget that this is a story - that this is acting - it becomes real, and draws you into the lives of the characters, the time, the setting. Certainly something every person should see at least once...at least.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Very Great, anyone who has a vita needs this game.<br />Buy it without regret.<br />Also you guys need to take care of zero escape, too
B008RA3X5E|5.0|like the look and the features....better than having to get on a laptop or to turn the Tv on to check the weather
B003WUYRGI|1.0|To many words that Don`t even make sense that all the worlds are almost the same with just in numbers that do not make sense at all
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Katharine Hepburn is absolutely hilarious in this slapstick comedy with Cary Grant (oh boy!) I love this movie and the beautiful comedic prowess of the actors - and although KH and CG are in the leading roles, the entire cast is what brings the movie into full bloom!  This is a true classic - and I will never tire of watching it!  Love it!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Awesome. A little disappointed with the ending. But over all it was great. I think the dance was funny. COOL!!!
1849904251|5.0|This book is quite good and very enjoyable to read.  It's nice to be able to just pick it up snd read any part or all of it.  There is also interesting insight into Sherlock and his Science of Deduction.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Well written, with enough suspense to keep you guessing.  I had most of it figured out before I got to the end, thus earning it a 4-star review.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was skeptical about this book. My grandmother had bought it for me for my birthday, and I was very hesitant to read a book that is narrated by a dog; I didn't think I could possibly enjoy it. I was wrong.<br />I don't know that I can properly describe what I love about this book, except to say that the spirit of it is amazing. I read this book several years ago, and have been recommending it to friends and strangers and my patients at work (I'm a dental hygienist) ever since.<br />This book makes it clear that even if life pushes you down you have to keep going and that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a fun game. a true time waster! have not played it in a while because my tablet stopped working. but a replacement is on the way. then I can get back to enjoying this fun game.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|this was the cheapest set I found, everywhere else was any where from $9 to $29  more expensive!!! My son will be so excited Christmas mornig.
0525951652|5.0|As a writer of thrillers, Follett has few equals. And his researchers are obviously top-notch. His sex scenes aren't the best in the world, but I don't think this worthy of much discussion.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Pinball is always fun, don't like that you have to hold it only one way as supposed to landscape or portrait
B0097UO87U|5.0|Of all the music I've acquired this year, two collections have stood out in terms of going beyond pleasing my ears.  This is one of them.  Jeff Lynne's genuine sentiment for these classics infuses every performance, making the whole package a remarkably authentic homage to some truly great songs.  And yes, I said great songs.  The selection (which, in agreement with other reviewers, one could only wish was a bit longer) is splendid.  Yes, this music is pretty, but not cheerleader pretty.  It's pretty like that girl back in school who sat a few desks over and made your heart ache.  The tempo mix is just right, the arrangement and orchestration also.  This one is a true gem.<br /><br />Oh, the other album?  The George Harrison retrospective, \\"Early Takes\\".  And no wonder George and Jeff got along and collaborated so well.  Listening to Long Wave, you almost feel Jeff waving at his old friend and fellow Wilbury.<br /><br />Well done, Jeff.  Encore!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The life of pi is one of the best books I have ever read. It has  a lot of action in it
B001AIRUP4|5.0|If you're familiar with Tim Burton's oddly unique creative mine, then you know what to expect.<br /><br />But if you're not - then you could be left with a feeling of \\"what in the world is this?\\" going on.<br /><br />The perfect film to break out on Thanksgiving and have it become a new tradition for you and your family.<br /><br />The clarity of this title is just amazing.  After watching it originally on LaserDisc (and the truly SPECIAL special edition) and then upgrading to DVD (which was an improvement of LD's limited pixel count and resolution,) I didn't realize just how much detail was in this film until I saw it on Blu-ray.<br /><br />This is the perfect medium for this film.
0307346617|4.0|Interesting approach to the zombie world of literature.  Could have used more details on the retaking of the U. S.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is an innovative product, excellent for storing any type of professional or semi-professional camera has compartments that adjust to fit any camera as off and back are molded to fit the different camera models! innovative design and very versatile to go for a walk with your camera
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love flow free there is so many things u can do with this game. When u try to find the mystery it is fun because u dont know were to go.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|You could look at just the screen presentation, or surface, of this movie, and say it is about a kid who becomes a stripper.<br /><br />If you go beneath the \\"surface\\" of the movie, we find it is about a guy, who is OUT of a job, has NO skills, NO experience, NO education,  and NEEDS the same things in life we all NEED --  money .  When nothing permanent comes his way in the form of a job, his friends help him out.<br /><br />Instead of collecting unemployment, and sitting back, he  becomes a part of a male stripper group.  It pays the bills, he doesn't have to collect unemployment, he's not feeling sorry for himself because he can't make ends meet . . .  He is not being told \\"NO\\" in job interview after job interview -- and the pay is great.<br /><br />Regardless of the fact that most of us would NOT  become \\"strippers\\" to stay off the unemployment line -- you do have to respect a person who does choose to stay off the unemployment roles, even if he does choose stripping as the way to do it !!<br /><br />HE is NOT what he does, he is something else.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My kids and I love to play it on my kindle fire. It's a ton of fun to play and it runs great.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it works for me. I wanted multiple alarms and this app provides it. I pike the different alarm choices and snooze.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I just got my kindle fire had...the guide says that there is a camera...but when I go to the photos there is no camera Icon in the right corner...what am I missing here????  Do I have to buy this app???
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My family was amazed with the 3D effects that were included.  We saw this in 3D at the movies and were impressed, but seeing it on my 3D tv with the active 3D glasses was better than the movie theater.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the book. Good story line. Love my Romance novels. Any woman would like it.  It is a little racy,but, I loved it.
B009MF56GC|2.0|Miserable dialog, completely predictable plot, wooden or trite acting.  Total waste of more than 100 minutes of the viewer's lives.
B00884GR0W|5.0|things this app has minecraft doesnt<br /><br />bigger world<br /><br />quests<br /><br />sky world under world<br /><br />more animals like megladon and dragons<br /><br />cheaper<br /><br />this app is so fun it
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Brave was really good, but not quite up there w/ Finding Nemo and other Pixar hits. This movie inspired me to get my 7yo a bow and arrow set for her birthday. I didnt care for the whole 'marrying my daughter off to the best suiter' theme. Not what little ones need to know about, you know.
B00979CS50|5.0|This is typical Neil Young and Crazy Horse.  Long loping grooves of songs that tell a story.  With that Crazy Horse, fuzzed guitar, grunge sound.  Well done.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|Slow moving, not interesting (which is hard to do when semi or complete nudity is the norm).  I've seen documentaries on strippers (where there is no plot or story at all), which were much more engaging than this movie.  The actors phoned in their performances and the director apparently just glued the transcripts together.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|Modern kids movies that attempt to do the classic Santa type story usually face a dilemma, which is that the core elements of those stories (sleighs, wooden toys etc.) is quite dated at this point. The usual result is a painful attempt to update and make the old relevant.<br /><br />Arthur Christmas takes a different approach. Not only does it fully embrace modernity, but it acknowledges the contradictions between the old and the new.<br /><br />In fact it brings it front and center, giving us a story about three generations and a clash of ideologies. All wrapped round a central message that the method doesn't matter, just the end result.<br /><br />And it works. I'm not sure I'd go quite so far as to call it a Christmas classic, but it's really enjoyable. The anachronisms work for the story and it definitely has that seasonal feel.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't hurt that it's funny or that it has a brilliant British voice cast. Really there isn't a single bad one in the lot, and some of them are just pitch perfect for the characters.<br /><br />It's beautiful to look at too. Truly lovely animation. If you haven't seen it, you should definitely add it to your holiday viewing cycle.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very comprehensive tool. Seems to give fairly accurate estimate of battery life based on various uses.  I highly recommend it.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This is part one of the classic motorcycle movie which launched a generation of bike riders and may still launch them today.  Then there is also Steve McQueen.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Some of us thought the beginning was a bit slow, being mostly non-dialog Renner-doping-in-the-wilderness.  The backstory was handled well though (this movie is set about a week after the end of Ultimatum).  Renner's character (Aaron Cross) is a bit more contemplative and likable that Jason Bourne (played by Matt Damon who basically does not appear in this movie).  Viewers are left completely hanging at the end, there will obviously be another sequel.
B0098VXN2Y|1.0|I'd have to say that this id the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so adicting I love it everyone should play it<br />it is sonso so so so so so so so so so so so so so<br />FUN
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is one of Van Morrison's best CD's in years.  The singing, the song writing, the mood- all good.  One of the best CD's of the year.
B005LAIHZE|3.0|Given the plethora or vampire related movies/shows in the last 15 or so years, you really have to go the extra mile to stand out from the crowd.  This movie's premise is quite unique, but the acting and action and effects are merely average.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|A sucker for a feel good love story with a holiday theme. I smile every time I watch this movie.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Awesome!  Reminds me of Harry Potter, Twilight, and a little bit of Lord of the Rings.  If you like witches, vampires, fantasy stuff... and also like more adult-like romance, you should read it.  I haven't been as addicted to a book in a while.  I can't wait to read the 2nd book in the series.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob's newest release is surprisingly coherent.  He tells story, his voice almost sounds good.  His epic story of the Titanic is worth the price.
B00881PPTO|5.0|Put this on my new Kindle Fire HD and it was great tracking my son as he flew from Portland, OR to Phila., PA to visit and then I tracked him going all the way back home.  Great information provided about each flight on a timely basis.  One app to keep for future travel info at your fingertips.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|Overall, it's very well made but it's a bit smaller than.... what I expected. And the dress is a bit lighter than what it shows in the pictures. But it's still great quality
B00AE2I4B6|4.0|I love the choreography. The dancing was innovative. It was good to incorporate some of the previous characters. II love dancing
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|My kids are Lego fanatics and they really wanted this calendar . I have to say I'm disappointed with it, not them. It is a lot off net for very tiny builds each day, usually from about 5 of the smallest Lego pieces. It is a bit of a rip off in my opinion, but I'm sure the boys will give it 5 stars ,
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is very worth reading!! All of them are awesome! Good story line. It skips a little. I would love to read more!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I simply loved The Piano Guys CD.  The music was fresh, exciting and complex, which i love!  I would recommend this CD to any one who is bored with traditional classical music and wants to listen to a more modern expression!  I never buy classical music but i loved this CD.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I rented this movie for my husband. He found it entwining. He loves the action. He loved all the actors. He loved that the movie had all of the old action hero actors
B0028RXXFC|5.0|If your an adult history buff like myself this series is a must have!<br />The audio and video is very well done. If you've seen this on TV or DVD you'll love the Blu Ray version. Watching this more than once was neccesary for me to get more history from the story. I'm sure I'll watch it several more times.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I really liked this book and it was a very easy read.  It kept my attention and I had a hard time putting it down.
1449410243|5.0|Great book.  Exactly as expected from the Oatmeal.  Taught me some very important lessons about the &#34;harmless&#34; cat I share my house with.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD it works like magic amazing, in one month my whole life had changed my whole body looked so different
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|fun at first, but the hidden items are repeated too much. Also on my kindle fire, many items are hidden under the menu bar where it is impossible to find without using a hint.
1451695195|5.0|Non believers should read this I found it to be quite thought provoking ! My husband purchased this as a gift as he's so thoughtful and thought I would enjoy this .
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Good Lord this is a great CD. Tight band, amazing layers, great lyrics and oh so musical. Fun, gritty, soulful, sinister a real roller coaster ride.<br />Chris Robinson is the current torch bearer of rock and roll the way rock and roll was meant to be played.<br />This is an absolute must have CD for any collection.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Would have loved it, if I could have found a good Wide-screen two disk DVD set. But, it seems that Blu-ray is Knocking DVD out. I liked the Movie, but, would have been nice to have had more of the xtra scenes/features, that I had on my Previous sets. Don't think I will be using the UltraViolet. Never used it before.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is the best fantasy film I've ever watched.  The scope of the film is tremendous.  All the characters, whether you love them or hate them, grab you and keep you looking forward to their next appearance.  Having my own set of DVDs allowed me to revisit portions of the film as often as I liked.  I'm looking forward to the next season's set of DVDs.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The first time I heard about this it was only on the iPad, so I'm happy to see it on Kindle apps.  The game is lots of fun to play, getting started is easy.  Audio of the ponies voices is include making Ponyville even more appealing to me.
1401230423|4.0|Sandman is extremely popular, so I was expecting quite the tale when I first read the original book. However, I was slightly disappointed. The next book improved a little bit, and the third one really showed promise, but it wasn't until this fourth book, Season of Mist, that I finally embraced Sandman as a great comic book.<br /><br />Season of Mist does something that the first three failed to do: start the story off on an interesting note. I felt that the first three books took a while to get into the story, and once I was there, it wasn't so great. Not here. The book starts with a meeting--of the Endless. It's a great idea, and a great reunion. Death and Desire are welcomed returns, while Destiny is an intriguing addition.<br /><br />From here, the story gets better, with Dream preparing for a trip back to Hell. This premise alone is exciting, but the way it played out was even better. It was surprising and unexpected, which is a good thing. It didn't get too cliche or predictable, keeping me engaged. By story's end, I recognized this as how Sandman should have been from the start, and I could hardly wait to get the next book, which was not my feeling after reading the first three.<br /><br />The art is generally the same, with slight variations from time to time. If you liked it in the first three, then you'll like this. If not, then sorry. I think it's pretty decent, certainly appropriate for this kind of story. The only time I felt the art faltered was the issue drawn by Matt Wagner, which is surprising, seeing as how I really liked the job he did in [[ASIN:1401210910 Batman and the Monster Men]] (highly recommended, by the way).<br /><br />If you liked the first three books, this one should be even better. Like the other books, these stories get very dark, disturbing, creepy, and possibly terrifying. Keep that in mind if you want to start reading Sandman.<br /><br />Overall, this is a marked improvement over previous installments.<br /><br />8.4/10ng at least the first book before this one, and maybe all three. I do warn new readers, though--these stories get very dark, disturbing, creepy, and possibly terrifying. For ages 14 and up, I'd say.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great story and a marked improvement over previous installments.<br /><br />8.4/10
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|yes! another good take off on jewel quest.<br />13 more words required and I don't have that much to say
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game to play and addicting - definitely get this game and enjoy. I highly recommend this and the Flow Bridges.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Does pinch and zoom. Timed activities have plenty of time. If you read quick, just touch the screen to move on.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is great. Not the smut sex filled book i was expecting but a complete mind #@!* Can wait to read the rest :)
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I watched the entire series in about two weeks. I love the sense of humor of Daria and all the different personalities and characters that were included in the show to show amazing distinction between one another.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I read the stories in reverse, but they were still a good read.  Balsamic is a writer I am just getting to know.  The more I read. Him, the better I like him.  Puller is a good character and I am looking forward to reading more about him.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|What's not to like about MJ. I love evrything about him, needless to say I'm a diehard fan. Needless to say since his passing I try to get my hands on everything MJ. The price was right for this product and it shipped quickly. I would purchase from this merchant again!!
B009LDXQGC|5.0|We love our music and this group is perfect for a child that is into music and enjoys the peace.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Just my kind of fantasy book, can't wait for next book in series, highly recommended, you won't want to put it down!
0446580848|2.0|I found The Panther to be tedious & boring at times.  In fact, I actually skipped several chapters to get to the end.  The book should have been much shorter.  If I decide to read the next Corey book, I'll get it from the library, instead of buying it on Kindle.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I have not been able to get this app to work properly. It seems to be set up to drive you to certain sites that you really don't prefer to see. Maybe it is just me but I have not been pleased. Try it sense it is free and see if it works for you.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Lonesome Dove is probably the best western movie ever produced.  Great story line.  Beautiful scenery.  Fantastic cast and superb acting.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show is really fun to watch because its not you normal zombie show. Its has real internal conflict along with the zombie outbreak.
B000002VSN|5.0|I'm replacing a lost cassette of this album and I finally ordered the CD; it is so very uplifting and just a great example of Whitney in her element!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|When this item came in, the case appeared to have been run over or used as a pets' chew toy and it had sand or dirt in it! The cover within the case was wrinkled and torn. The only reason I did not return it was because the disc played well. I'm sure this seller has loyal customers but I will not be one of them. Fool me once......
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was a really good book and I would definitely read it again!! Recommend to anyone wanting a daring, romantic book
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game. I like dragons a lot so this game is GREAT!!! You can simply make all these cool combinations of dragons and you get to design your own park. Get this game right now!!! The only thing I do not like about the game is that it can take up to hours for you to hatch build or remove stuff. Think you should work on making it shorter.
B0091REZMW|1.0|They want your cash....plain and simple. the game is simple and unchallenging too. the graphics. are nice but so are all the other apps...what sets this one apart? the amount of money they want from you.
0765350386|5.0|The first book of the Mistborn Trilogy was excellent. There was a lot of action and character development. There were even character backstories. The interactions between the protagonists was very reminiscent of Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen.  Author Brandon Sanderson created an internally-consistent world, which means to me that there was a reason or explanation for everything so there were no plot holes. There was also a lot of politics but this never bogged down the story. I have already read the other two books of the trilogy and I recommend this book and the series for all fans of the fantasy genre.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Good puzzle game. Not too hard but good to pass the time. Worth the 99 cents.<br />I would recommend this game.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This CD was wonderful!  Michael Buble has an amazing voice and sounds like one of the old crooners.  This is one of my favorite Christmas CDs and I highly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could hardly put it down! Such a unique story, characters and the idea of the future. I'm ready for Catching Fire
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Love the writing style of the book but not quite sure I feel about the ending of the book,was so short in a way
B000OY8NII|3.0|i was sorry to see the show leave tv. but the set was worth the price. now i have to collect the rest.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really think this game is great! well, you know, if that opinion is okay with you...<br /><br />but seroiusly, this app is fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The whole trilogy is well written and cleverly thought out. I love this authors style. Its a must read for everyone, especially since we are just a few steps away from holding our own hunger games-- think tv shows like survivor and real housewives. Ick.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Soundgarden,and i have learned more about the band and its dirrections in the last 2 years than i have ever known about them,explains alot about the band and their musical journey.Almost everything they did was so different,not because they were trying to find something new or great but because they saidLets try this because.They have been grand experimentalists in their art just because thats what they wanted to do.Album is almost conceptualby uts design.
B004N868DS|5.0|The pad works exceptionally well with my Logitech G700 on both sides.  The gel rest does not work very well for me, but it is a great add on and exceptionally smart to be a separate component.  Tracking is superb, and come on it will remind everyone of the Thundercats.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Love this app. Learn new stuff all the time playing as well. And the adjustable difficulty is great as I get used to playing again.
B0007TKNII|5.0|For someone who loves operas and musicals, this is a great movie. It is worth watching and having for your movie collection.
B000ERU6QC|4.0|By the very essence of this music,it is highly stripped down and uncomplicated.It is on the family twigs of Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age.I own htis because of that.If you are looking for complicated overproduced music,this aint it.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud! If you're looking for a new comedy show to watch, you won't be disappointed with this. And yes, men like this show too, it's not all girlie with Jess being the main character. The guys add a whole other dimension to the show!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|IT IS DARK, MAN! IT IS CREEPY! IT MAKES YOU FEEL EXTREMELY SHIVERING!!!!! And IT IS ONE OF CLASSICS THAT EVERY BATMAN FAN OR NON-FAN WILL Like!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Justice never retires. You read this book and you will know it. All potential buyers, trust me, you are in for a show.....
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It will not disappoint. I am loving blu-ray movies. They have a great picture!
B008MZPVP4|5.0|Lets say I am a huge fan of down.Aggressive hard rock with a southern tinge to it.Phils vocals are great and peppers and Kurts guitar playing are superb.The only problem is I hate eps.Not enough on the disc.Witchtripper is great song.
B001HC8516|5.0|Read this book after a bunch of friends recommended it while I was in a bad relationship. All I can say is OH MY GOSH. Greg is right. It sucks. Brought a new perspective to me of the male mind and how it works. I read this book while in a bad relationship to see if it would help give me any clarity and it definitely did. Needless to say it showed me that my man was just not that into me anymore despite all the lies he continued to tell me just to keep me around at his beck and call, and I broke up with him. It sucked to hear it then, but thanks Greg, I'm so much happier now!!!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I watched this with my 12 year old when we were both home sick. The movie has several very strong actors in brief cameo appearances, and all the acting is fine.  My son asked several times &#34;how long is this movie?&#34; during the entire first third of the movie. My problem was the pacing and the writing.  It's also semi ridiculous when Batman speaks, with his electronically altered voice.  The was a well done plot twist, which is great when you don't see it coming through the whole movie. There are so many  Batman alternative retellings that I shouldn't have been surprised when the movie did not remain true to what I understood to be the Batman/Bane story.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I knew going in that this movie will consist of some actual military personnel so I was not expecting Oscar winning performances. However, what I did get was a lot of emotion some great action and a new found respect for the families that are left behind.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I was having coffee at Everyman Cafe.  The coffee guy was belting out \\"Cold Water\\" from behind the counter.  I felt so...hip.<br />But seriously, if you listen to this album a few times, you'll be working on your best ragged-voiced crow.<br />Some say this album is a parody...I think Tom would agree.  GET IT ANYWAY!  It'll make you a happier person, which is not to say it's all slap happy.<br />Look, I don't even know why I felt compelled to add my voice to the cavalcade of positivity, but if I had to discover him all over again, and I was only going to buy ONE CD because mom was cutting up the cards and shutting down the amazon account...this one would make me wanna get a job so I could afford the rest.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I don't know why but everytime I try just a blank page comes up. other than that its a great app.
0399160450|4.0|Again this is written by a co-author and Clancy. Although not as good as many that Clancy did by himself, it was very good and I had a hard time putting it down to do essentials like eating and sleeping.<br /><br />I did not give it 5 stars because the ending seemed rushed and not enough pages alotted to it, although the book is 800+ pages long. I also thought the subplot with Jack Ryan Junior's girl friend seemed not to have been done well.<br /><br />Again, I elected to go to the library and not pay over $10 for the Kindle edition; however, the book was good enough that I will get it when the price drops.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|It works, but it's not as easy to read as the Kindle's regular calendar. I was hoping it would sync to that calendar. Also, it lags some when turning to the next month or trying to select a specific date. It seems like the HD should just sync my Google Calendar properly, with all the separate calendars, instead of having to pay $6 for an app.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!
B00009W0U4|1.0|The synopsis of this movie should warn viewers that it contains violent scenes of murder,rape, & assault!!! I can appreciate the different camera shots, but beginning with the opening credits the director just had too many & too extended length of these weird music cues and camera angles. That was more annoying than creative.<br /><br />I have never witnessed such a brutal attack & murder, Tena deserved it, but it was sickeniing to watch. As far as the rape scene it always the tried & true victimization of a woman. According to the beginning scenes & the Tena'smsexual preference it should have been a male victim, but no one will show that except for HBO's Oz. This film was more brutal than 9MM. Like 9MM, it appears to be a rouse for sexual deviants to feel free to enjoy a film in the open, instead of hiding in their basements to watch it!!<br /><br />What was the purpose of the two men talking in the bedroom flat, because it added nothing to the movie, but in hind-sight i wonder about the mentality of the director for seemingly excusing child molestation, another victimization of a female.<br /><br />Honestly, I do wonder about the mental state of the director & writers because of the brutality of this film. Based on this film I am not interested in watching any more of his films. I have seen more creative work from graduate film students.
0756405890|5.0|I've been reading books lately from genres that I do not ordinarily choose. I would not have selected this were it not for a book meetup that chose this title. In short, I loved it. I blew off chores and almost blew off clients to keep reading. Great creation of another world, well, more another milleau than a world. My first reaction after reading this was to get the next in the series. It's just as good. Maybe even better.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I've read all her books and have enjoyed each.  This kept me in suspense until near the end.  Can't wait for another.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book series and have loved just about all the movies that have come out. Big Harry Potter series fan and I'm so excited to finally be completing my movie collection!! Although I will admit, this is probably one of the most boring movies in the series because not as much happens (first half of this book was the same way because they are searching for some things).
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I read a lot of the good and bad reviews of this album.  The poorer reviews must have come from people who have inferior sound equipment or a bad ear for music.  I could not believe the differance the remaster was over the original CD release!  the first time I listened to it, I was compelled to play it again, which is something I have never done.  This sounds so much like the first release of the album on records that I was blown away.  I play this album more than any others in my extensive collection.  Tom Scholtz's work on this was well worth the effort.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|The case is attractive and well made. Originally I said I was going to return the case because it didn't hold the Kindle-- it fell out. A few days later I tried it again and it works perfectly.  I guess it had to warm up. It was outside in the cold for a few hours. Lesson learned!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've seen many adaptations of this story and I really enjoyed this one the best.  The two leads had great chemistry and even though I know the story some scenes still brought tears to my eyes.  A must see movie if you love the story as I do!!!
0316098337|5.0|I love this book.  It grabs all of your emotions.  I had a hard time getting into the book but I was lucky enough to have a friend run into me and say &#34;Isn't that book good?&#34; ( I was almost ready to put it down.)  I kept on and WOW  Thank you Kate!
1416550550|5.0|This book has all the elements of an adult fairy tale but with real characters!  I loved it!  It read like classic literature and was mesmerizing!  Once again, as in The House at Riverton, the chapters jump to different time periods, and this author handles that so well.  The mystery of Nell's birth keeps you guessing as you live the lives of the past and present generations.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|It has been quite awhile since I have discovered a new band that I instantly fell in love with within minutes of hearing an album.  They have such a unique sound unlike any other band out there which is what I love the most I think.  All I had to do is listen to the previews of each song and I was hooked!  I've hardly listened to anything else since finding this a couple weeks ago!  There's really not much else to say....just listen to the samples of their songs and you will see what I mean.  Also, the PERFECT 5-STAR RATING should obviously be another indicator of how AWESOME this really is!!!
1451620829|5.0|I know my grandson will love this  book--he has been wanting it for a long time.  I will order more for him.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|ok acting--not by the bad guy. wish tommy lee jones was in it more. three stars. Wasn't like the first or second.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|We loved this movie and knew it would be one we'd want to re-watch as a family every year!  Could not have been more pleased with the price and it arrived timely as usual!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|what a great collection of beatles songs......sound quality is really great and i now have all the beatles best recordings.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Bought this because when it was out in the theaters, I didn't get a chance to see it!<br />Plus, Robert Downey, Jr. should have won an academy award for his role as Sherlock Holmes
B004AQR29C|4.0|good action, the second is better. stallone does a good job as the 'leader of the pack'. I'd watch the second too.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|For those who are not quite as financially solvent, free is the way to be. If you find yourself looking for free apps, you know most can be a waste of time. Not this one. This app seemed to me to be almost as fun as the full version. Of course, there's not as much that you can do, but it does entertain! I recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I got it the same day and i love it.  I would recommend this seller to anyone who wants to purchase from them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|One of Michael Connelly's better books, but I like all of them . This is story telling at its best. Harrys daughters role in this book was an added plus.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great action, good acting, overall good movie--better than the first. Van Damn plays a nice bad guy. Good job acting.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I just could not be bothered to sit through the play. Oh, I know it got rave reviews, but ugh! At least the book made a bit more sense. Even though this is not my genre for reading enjoyment, I found this book bearable, and interesting enough to continue turning the pages.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|The author is getting lazy.  Would like more serious content, maybe a little history or based on a true story.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Daniel Craig was outstanding in this movie. A great thriller and you would never guess the ending either.  Outstanding and keep you thinking
034580404X|5.0|Great story, sure it has the kinky stuff everyone is talking about but it's a good story as well.  Each book was a good read and quick too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you are looking for a bible app, this one does the job just fine. I've seen more intuitive versions, but this one is nice and straightforward.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|This bag is just about the perfect size for my Nikon P510. The zipper pulls have a nice rubber coating and the bag has plenty of pockets for batteries etc.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|If you enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan in James Bond. You will enjoy this thrilling movie. Thanks for the good service
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my brother has this game on his ipod it is so fun you get so much cool dragons in village it is like soooooo awesome!!!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|someone did not watch the original dark shadows soap oprah this was far from the original. johnny depp and tim burton need a time out. I thought this movie was terrible and ended up falling asleep through it. I wish could get a refund 3.99 WAS WAY TO EXPENSIVE FOR THIS MOVIE.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like how you just touch the card and it goes where it needs to. I play usually every day. App runs smoothly.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Have seen this series many times. Yet still have not been able to watch it without shedding a tear or two ( or three. . .). Brilliant actors! Superb casting! Screenwriting at its best! Fine musical score! Great directing! What more can I say?
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Purchased this season as a way to pass the time when traveling and it does the job.  Still have enough episodes for at least one more trip.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is really sweet.My high score is 2,000,000+.Also I think its a good time waster when there isn't much to do or for fun.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is well-written and so interesting that it kept pulling me to the next page.  Intriguing and rewarding read.  Excellent characterization and plot lines.  Thank you.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Held my interest. Could not wait each day to see what would happen next. The ending was a good wrap-up.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a most amazing movie, how the different characters connect in some way.  Of course, you will love it actually.
B006O6F932|4.0|I bought the Monster High School for my daughter who is obsessed with Monster High! She had been wanting one for a year now but every where I looked the price was outrageous. I saved over $30.00 with Amazon and my daughter absolutely loves it!
B002VECLVO|5.0|Super fast shipment description of the item is very accurate.<br />Great experience.<br />Looking forward to continue doing business with you.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Loved playing when I was younger and I still love playing it now. Minus a star because your energy runs out rapidly.
B0012268N8|5.0|This LP/CD has been a staple of my extensive collection for 40 years. If I had 25 disks to take with me on a deserted island, this would probably make it into the top 10. The breathe of genres is vast and covers most popular styles of music with great aplomb due to the experience and talents of this tight band. The first side kicks off with verve (rocks), side 2 slows a bit with the country influences (laid back & contemplative) but side 3 is exquisitely beautiful (Johnny's garden and Move Around) and side 4 brings it all home with The Treasure & Blues Man. This was truly a band in every sense of the word with Stills at the helm and Hillman providing great support as second in command in front of a cracker-jack unit (with a prize in every package). Stills was at the peak of his guitar powers here with the best musical support of all time. A steal for double disk.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|no stress, engaging game. no speed involved, just thinking skills.  so much more than boring hidden object apps. completed the adventure and will look for another by fire maple
0553386697|5.0|A fabulous read for parents and therapists alike!  Very readable, well written and interesting.  A good tool for students as well.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a holiday gift for our son in law.  I hope he enjoyes it as much as he wanted it
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This was great as a faotd. The only issue I have is that the 'find the difference' games are hard on old eyes&ndash; you can't zoom in. Otherwise it has a cute story and the puzzles are entertaining.I'd give it 5 stars if not for the difficulty seeing some of the screens. Fun game!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I was able to download this for free. Fun to play on the kindle fire hd and the graphics are good. I would recommend this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|being a walrus I love sitting at my computer all day and eat clams. So now I can play minecraft wherever I am.  I love this so I can show my brother Turtle12312 how redstone works.<br />  thank you,<br />  mojang
B006L4MWVE|4.0|I think this movie brilliantly portrays what can happen to human beings taken from their comfortable society to absolute peril.The Hunger Games certainly copied a lot from this classic.
B005LAII08|5.0|Has a good message for adults and a beautiful story for kids.  We enjoyed the video with our grandkids. Great!
0767853636|5.0|I've loved this movie since I first saw it in the theater in 1982 as an 11 year old.  The cast is perfect, the songs are wonderful, and the dancing is out of this world.  What's best about this version is the widescreen option, which isn't available on the recently released 30th anniversary edition, for whatever reason.  Although the widescreen tends to crop off the top of the actors' heads, I consider that an acceptable trade-off to being able to view almost the entire frame.  I saw more of Ann Reinking in this version than I have since the original theatrical release!  As a great Ann Reinking fan, this was a fabulous surprise!  Even my two year old daughter was surprised to see so much more of &#34;Grace&#34; than in the anniversary edition, which we've been watching.  I enjoy this version so much that I purchased it as a Christmas present for my niece.  It's worth every penny.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Best app for photos ever. A must have. Easy transfers from one device to another even for the nor so savvy techie.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I'm a Beatle fan of 67 years old. I grew up in the generation of Beatle mania in the 1960s and I've got on Blu-ra, &#34;A  HARD DAYS NIGHT&#34;,& &#34;YELLOW SUBMARINE&#34;, I'm waiting for the film &#34;HELP&#34; to be released on Blu-ray!!. There is a Video not to many people know about, and it's on the Roof top of ABBEY ROAD Studios building called 'THE LET IT BE CONCERT&#34;,I've seen the video on VHS VCR tape. and it is good!!!.MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR has a lot of good songs on it. As far as Albums on CD or Vinyl this one is my favorite Beatle Album then my next favorite Album is &#34;Help&#34;<br /><br />  With graditude, Mr. Bruce H. Moir
B005NNUKF4|3.0|I bought this to get the live version of the album.  Compared to &#34;Pulse&#34; album, it does not even come close in quality.
B00867GHS8|5.0|An entertaining movie for all ages. best part is the Digital copy that can be used on any device anywhere anytime...
B0015AARJI|4.0|I been a big fan of the PlayStation Controller since the PS1. I have played many consoles and i feel this controller is the best one that fits perfect in my hand. When the Ps3 came out the system came with a controller that wasn't dualshock 3. The First controller was so light but no rumble. When the Dualshock 3 was released I had to buy it quick. Since right now the controller still alive and playing well. the grips on the analog sticks do get warn out after years of using. buttons work fine and no problem not like my two non-dualshock controllers some of them buttons don't work no more. With a controller that has last me this long is a product that would last long. The controller does have couple of negative things about it but they are not too big. The left analog stick is slightly out of place. For example, When I play Battlefield 3 and using the heavy machine gun and need to use the bipod it wont work. i have to slight move the analog down to use it. its not a big problem that i had with other games only battlefield 3. The second negative I have with his controller is the L2 and R3 buttons sometimes I will be playing a game and I put down my controller down and it accidently press the L2 or R2 buttons. Its not a big deal but when playing online and you put down controller down it and it press the r2 button and throws a grenade. Overall this controller is really good and last me since they first dualshock controllers for the PS3 came out. Soon Ill be buying a new once since I need a second controller and I know I will be doing a great buy when I do.
B005LAII1C|3.0|The movie is full of raunchy language and a ton of drug related scenes. Its very adult oriented as I expected but over the top in foul language and abuse. It would of been much better if toned down some. Not a very good Wahlberg movie considering his previous ones. Gen Y half high will probably love it though.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I could listen to this for hours and hours at a time and not get tired of it. Iz has a wonderful soothing voice.

B000VAQX0A|5.0|Rush - Permanent Waves (1980), 2007 Mobile Fidelity Recordings<br /><br />  Ok so who doesn't have at least one Rush album in their house?  Well my childhood was full of Rush music and Permanent Waves was a staple!  Next to Moving Pictures this is my favourite Rush album and era for these Canadian rockers!<br /><br />  Album was produced by Terry Brown and skillfully remastered by MOFI by Shawn Britton using their GAIN 2 system technology from the original masters so the sounds is pretty awesome and way better than the remaster CD version.<br />  Who can forget songs like Spirit Of Radio or Entre Nous of Freewill......this music is timeless.<br />  Everytime I hear RUSH I get that certain High School days melancholy feeling as these albums were part of me back then.....and still today !<br />  Lets hear from all of you out there.....what is your favourite RUSH album ?????
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I confess I am addicted to this series of movies, but this one is quite different as it delves into the science behind the agents in the 'Program'. Don't expect Jeremy Renner to replace Matt Damon, as this is not the intent. Renner is quite a good actor in his own right, and has risen in the ranks of action stars recently, most notably as 'Hawkeye' in the Avengers. The Bourne Legacy starts slow, but picks up tempo quite quickly as it intertwines with the plot of the Bourne Ultimatum. There is a great supporting cast including Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz. The car chase is replaced by motorcycles, but in all a great follow up to the previous three movies. If you liked them, this will not disappoint.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very interesting book. Can't wait to start the next one.<br />I hope it is as good as this one.

B001ACY8D2|5.0|Sigur Ros -Með suð &iacute; eyrum við spilum endalaust (2008)<br /><br />  Með suð &iacute; eyrum við spilum endalaust (English: With a Buzz in Our Ears We Play Endlessly) is the fifth full-length studio album by the Icelandic band Sigur R&oacute;s, released on June 23, 2008 and ranks as another great bright spot in this bands discography!<br />  After hearing this summer \\"Inn&iacute; m&eacute;r syngur vitleysingur\\" live in Toronto over warm winds, standing beside 2 good friends (Allie and Simon) simply put me in a different world.  Allie I cant thank you enough for this GIFT !  That evening was just so extra special that I can not even tell you how much it meant to  me.........<br />  I first discovered Sigur Ros after their second album and never looked back......it took me a while to pick up some of their later albums but \\"Meo\\" simply is yet another magnetic album that you live as much and you listen to.<br />  If you honestly have not heard Sigur Ros then you have missed out......life is too short to  not hear this album....go out and buy it !!!<br />  G&oacute;ðan daginn may make you even cry !  Stranger things have happened !
B000JIHP88|4.0|My little one loves staring at both the mobile and the light up part.  She's just mesmerized.  It plays rain forest sounds (her favorite) along with a few classical music selections. I do wish the timer was longer than 15 minutes though, maybe 30.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Love her accent!! Funny movie that is full of adventure and makes you want to watch it with your mom!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Excellent chemistry between the two main actors and the dialogue is so fast paced that you actually can enjoy a 'rerun' or two and never get tired of the story.

B004132HZS|5.0|'Season' one is only three 90 minute episodes, but they are cleaver and riviting stories that sweep you into the ploy immediately. Terrific recreation of the classic.
B007TML4EI|5.0|One of my own top favorite games, fun to figure out how to keep the dummy safe from all the dangers out there.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Laughed from beginning to end. The story is two guys who from HS are complete opposites reunite in police academy. Things change and they become friends. They don't fare very well as police officers and get sent to undercover in 21 Jump Street. That's where the fun begins. If you wnat to laugh yourself silly then this is the movie to see.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|My grand daughter wanted this for a Christmas gift.  It arrived very promptly.  It is wrapped and under the tree.  Good service!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is the best show on the air right now, I just wish that I could get more episodes faster.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm in love with Christian Grey. He is the man I've been waiting for all my life. If only he was real.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This is a classic for good reasons, but someone should issue an abridged version for modern American readers who are not interested in French political history. I am a college grad plus, with strong English skills, but I nearly put the book down after seemingly endless chapters describing the Battle of Waterloo in so much detail I felt as though I were enduring it. Several other chapters I had to skip because every other word was the name of some French personage I had never heard of and could not pronounce even inside my head.<br /><br />I am still working on this tome after several weeks. What keeps me coming back night after night is the beautiful writing, most of which survives translation. The characters are finely drawn and I find that I truly care what happens to the protagonists. I might wish that someone could do for this book what has been done for Moby Dick -- i.e., extracting the wonderful parts -- most of the book -- and hiding away some detail that is not highly accessible to the average modern reader.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Another win for angry birds, being able to use lightsabers and the force in an angry birds game is more than you could hope for.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|One of my favorite love stories. It is timeless and would appeal to anyone who likes a love story that lasts<br />forever. Yes I would recommend it.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Having the live CD was a great addition to this package.  I have seen the original Countdown Tour in Fairfax, VA right about the same time this live show was recorded. One the best albums ever made and the songs still stand up today, both on record and live in concert.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Don't know why I downloaded this, but it was a mistake. Quickly uninstalled and when about my way as soo as I could.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm even more in love with Christian Grey than before. If only he was real. They have gone through alot but the finish was worth the trip. Great series.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I love the doctor and this show, the beginning is a little dry and it takes them a few episodes to really find a grove, but they do and they never let it go.
B00164KYV4|5.0|One of my favorite movies. A group of friends and all their ups and downs withs relationships. it's funny, sad, romantic and hopeful. It's got it all. Yes I recommend it.

B007VUA7VO|2.0|I was trying to find a replacement for a meter that I had on a previous phone and tried this one and then uninstalled a day later.
B0099114WO|5.0|This is one of those movies that is probably not going to appeal to all ages but my husband and I loved it. I would guess it's because we are in our upper 50s and can relate to the characters in the movie. I should also mention that Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did an excellent job. There are not that many movies that are about older characters so I'm glad when there is one that it's a good one.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|This item was shipped on time, and received on time with no damage.  The dvd is a present for my daughter

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm still in love with Christain Grey. I don't know how the author was able to create the perfect man. Well, not perfect but lots of potential.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has done it again.  A great read with a plot that keeps you turning the pages.  I recommend this book to anyone and suggest it as a great gift.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|No real mystery why this game has gotten so popular, it is a great game that updates regularly with new content.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I never seen a non-sense movie like this one. The first one was very good, and that's why i bought the second dvd as well. But it was a total disappointment. Don't spend two hours of your life watching this movie.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I Love The Big Bang Theory and will continue watching it until it goes off air, which will not happen anytime soon! I Love Season 3! The Spaghetti Catalyst is one of my favorite episode! Sheldon is my favorite character. He truly earned this role; he is great at it and not any actor could do what he does every week!<br />The product itself comes with two discs and an insert that has a brief description of each episode, which I appreciated. I am glad they released this show on Blu-Ray!<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone who likes The Big Bang Theory!
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|This was a dissappointment from the beginning, lucky that a quick uninstall fixes every problem as quickly as they can disappoint.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|I will never let go...of this film! I remember when I first saw this as a kid. I was perhaps too young the first time, but it is an amazing film that will live in your heart forever. I had been waiting for this film to come out on Blu-Ray and I was very excited when it did. It looks amazing on Blu-Ray! I highly recommend upgrading to Blu-Ray for anyone that has been on board Titanic and to all of those who never have, you are missing out!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is an awesome keyboard interface and really learns your typing style for those that like typing things accurately, eventually it really begins to make super accurate predictions and makes texting easier than ever.
0375851569|5.0|I give this pack a 5-star rating because there is no higher!<br /><br />This Beginner Book Collection is exactly what a pre-schooler or child learning to read needs. It makes reading a lot of fun and the laughs make the progress from simple to more complex words very enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend it for any of you who have young learners!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is truly a great film. Great to watch with your family! I have seen it several times and will continue to watch it for years.<br />If you haven't seen this film, I definitely recommend that you do.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for future episodes, each season has been an absolute delight and I can't wait for the next to come.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|I love this film. It is in my top 10 favorite Christmas films and I watch it every year.<br />Whether Santa is magic, the Spirit of Christmas, or the big guy that eats your cookies and leaves you really cool presents is your decision. Kids and adults will enjoy this film and learn that you are never to old or too silly to believe.<br />I am glad they brought back this classic on Blu-ray. Mara Wilson does a great job in this film as Susan Walker and brings an innocence to the film along with curiosity and questions.<br />Miracle on 34th Street is full of Christmas Magic and surprises along the way and I recommend to all people that love the Spirit of Christmas and that is exactly what Santa(played by Richard Attenborough) embodies.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this series and cannot wait to see everything that they come up with. I hope that they never jump the shark.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I saw this film when it came out it theaters...3 times! It was on my Wish List for almost a year and when it finally released I bought it to add to my Blu-Ray collection, Section: Holiday, Sub-section: Christmas.<br />This is one of my Top 5 Christmas films ever. It captures the Magic of Christmastime. I immediately identified with Arthur because we are very similar. I love Christmas as much as he does. It is the most magical time of the year to me and I have felt that way since I can remember. The lights, trees, carols, santa, elves, presents, snow, giving and receiving, gingerbread cookies, stockings, snowmen, skating and sledding, Christmas films, hot chocolate and being home for the holidays.<br />There are about 12-15 Christmas movies I watch each and every year and I am proud to say that Arthur Christmas is now included :)<br />I highly recommend Arthur Christmas for your home during the holiday season. It is a great film for the family to enjoy together.<br />Also, it is nice to see how Santa gets around the world in one night. I still don't understand how he eats that many cookies - his metabolism must be extremely high!
B00632HWOG|1.0|The email app on the phone is the best, a few platforms ago it wasn't but it is the best now and you don't have to download anything.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar has done it again, and again, and again. I love Pixar films and this one was no exception! This is a great family film with an amazing story to it, as well. I love Merida's spirit and long flowing locks of red hair. The triplets are absolutely adorable and their personality and mischievousness comes out even when they are bears. As a daughter, it was great to watch with my mom. We went to see it together while on vacation in FL (awww) and it was a perfect choice. Also, this came with the Pixar short: La Luna, which is now one of my favorites! It is so good! I love that it came with the Blu-ray and DVD. I kept the Blu-Ray and gave the DVD to my mom. Thank you Pixar; keep them coming!

0316226130|1.0|I bought this book and Eclipse as a Christmas present and I thought they were the bigger books. When I received them they were the small books. I returned them and when I got my refund, I discovered that they charged to ship them back.  I have never paid to ship anything back to Amazon before.  This review is not about the book, but about what Amazon does. I will not buy anything from Amazon again for fear it may have to be returned and I will have to pay for shipping. I told them I wanted the shipping charges back. They did return the shipping cost to me but said they would only do that one time.  Now that we have to pay tax on Amazon items now, I will buy my stuff at the store from now on thank you.....

B006ON41FC|5.0|I have enjoyed it for awhile now, never really sat down and got hooked into it like others, but I have been going back to it here and there.
B004HX0P2Y|3.0|I had intended to see this movie in the theatre & somehow missed it. Turns out it was really a better movie for streaming (or DVD). It was just ok. I expected it to be funnier. The action was decent. More of a spoof-type movie to me, which brought a little more humor. I probably won't see it again any time soon...
B0051HNMTI|1.0|Not really anything special, it gets old quick and then you don't use it again until you go to clean up your phone.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|good levels. average story line. fast responsive play. it's a nice way to pass the time. a game that's worth the cost
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is an absolutely gorgeous album. Susan, I look forward to your next, and your next, and your next . . . .
B00177YA1K|5.0|This movie is way under-rated. I'm surprised it wasn't talked-about more. It's really, really good, and has a sincerely moving ending.
0765348276|5.0|Enjoy the creative nature of the story.  Easy read but hard to put down.  Bought a copy for my friend who likes SF because it was really good.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I've been a huge Batman fan for years and was really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately this was the most boring film I have seen in a while. The scenes are really drawn out and I feel like the script could have been written a lot better. Wasn't really feeling Anne Hathaway as Cat woman at all either. She has about as much acting skills as that girl who does the T-mobile commercials and I felt she brought the movie down tremendously. Saddened to say that this film did not meet my expectations... at all. Disappointed.
B008JF8O9M|3.0|Limited prints on this version and i haven't used them all yet.  Also heard the pro doesn't work on kindle fire. Anyone know if it works on kindle fire hd ? Or if it works with an hp print shop c4700 series?

B0023SDPS6|1.0|too slow mooving. like the tv series. book not as good.<br />give me jack reacher or Mitch Rapp any time
B005IQZB14|5.0|Read this for my book club, everyone really enjoyed reading it (that doesn't happen often).  I heard about it as an Oprah pick, but that usually doesn't sway me to choose a book.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the story based on all the reviews I read.  The story encouraged me to look for more information on the internet, particularly those showing pictures, movies of the hike.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is one of those classics from the 40's that makes Hollywood films so spectacular. Not because of its scope (i.e. Ben Hur) but because of its heart!<br /><br />The original is Black and White (which I prefer) and although a bit grainy, has a softness that is warm and inviting, and matches the softness of the characters. It has a great script, great dialog and is wonderfully directed.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot, it's too much fun to experience as it unfolds. But I will mention the cast:<br /><br />Cary Grant - He fits the role of Dudley perfectly. I cannot imagine anyone more graceful, gracious, elegant or caring and loving. He is THE ultimate angel!<br /><br />David Niven - Another perfect fit -- for the role of the Bishop. He gives a fantastic performance as the struggling man of the cloth who has gone slightly off direction and needs divine help to get back on track.<br /><br />Loretta Young - Almost too good to be true, she is the perfect \\"wife\\" of the 1940's bishop. Supportive, kind, loving, but so worried about her marriage difficulties and the distancing of her husband (Niven) that she can't seem to fix herself. Beautiful and innocent performance.<br /><br />Monty Wooley - As the professor, he is a sort of Everyman -- those of us who have been knocked about in life by experience and are in need of inspiration. He gets it -- and then some -- from Dudley (Grant) in the most delightful way. Charming performance.<br /><br />Gladys Cooper - As an elderly dowager, richer than an entire town, she gives a great performance. Her character is somewhat reminiscent of the old biddy in \\"Now Voyager\\" but not as sharp or cruel. But she is still a force to be reckoned with -- headstrong, proud and arrogant... until Dudley (Grant) unfreezes her heart and releases the gentleness within.<br /><br />There are many more stellar performances in the film especially from Angela Lansbury and James Gleason.<br /><br />While this film has a definite religious overtone, it is respectful and does not get preachy. It is a kind and gentle movie that says more about unconditional love and the hope that all can go right in the world, if only we would relax a bit and see the true value of each other and our relationships.<br /><br />This is a charming classic movie, I wish there were films like this being made today!<br /><br />Highly recommended.overtone, it is respectful and does not get preachy.

B00936A0RU|2.0|I wanted to see this movie because it appeared to be great a period piece in the tradition of Bonnie and Clyde. This movie did have some interesting segments and the acting was pretty good but, the pacing seem to drag and my interest kept fading in and out. Be prepared for some very graphic violence. Was this movie bad, I don't think so, but I do think it had the look and feel that could have made this into a real winner.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great collection of mini games that are very fun to play. There is a lot of variety to keep you entertained for hours. This contains something for everyone. Having to collect points through playing the games to unlock more games adds to the fun. The interface is easy to navigate and the graphics are nice.  This definitely has replay value and I see myself playing these  games for a long time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I just finished this book today.  I've always been interested in history, especially Civil War history, which of course includes Abraham Lincoln.  I recently watched the movie \\"Lincoln\\" and thought it a wonderful movie.  However, though it was very good, the book that it was based on, \\"Team of Rivals\\" was far, far better.  The movie focused on the last 4 months of Lincoln's life and we were taken through what it took to get the 13th amendment passed which made slavery forever illegal in the United States.  This fantastic book goes far beyond that.  It tells briefly of Lincoln's life before he became a lawyer, then it goes into much more depth in the telling of his political life, his personal life, and on to becoming president, all the trials of the Civil War and to his death.<br /><br />What makes this book so incredibly good and very interesting, are many things.  You get to know Lincoln and his rare ability to see into human nature and how he uses that to become the great man that he was.  You learn about his cabinet members in a way that has not been done before.  You learn of their characters, their faults, their abilities, and also their often dislike of one another.  Lincoln was amazing in his ability to put aside the fact that these men were before his rivals.  He knew that even though they were rivals, these men were the best to be able to serve their country in their positions.  By the time I was finished with the book, I feel like I knew these men personally.<br /><br />I loved the way I was brought to know Lincoln; his great ambition, his love of telling a good story, especially when it made a point he wanted to make.  He was very intelligent, however folks did not always like him at first, but once they spent any time with him at all, they realized his greatness.<br /><br />I've always known that Abraham Lincoln was a great man, but before reading this book, I didn't know how very great he truly was.  This book does NOT read like a dry history book.  It is written in a way that is very pleasant to read, and I stayed interested in it the entire time I was reading it.  I could not wait to get back to it each day and had a very hard time putting it down.<br /><br />This book is so wonderful in so many more ways.  I recommend it highly to anyone that is interested in history, or just the man himself.is written in a way that is very pleasant to read, and I stayed interested in it the entire time I was reading it.

B000BC8TBE|5.0|this album is everything, often imitated, never ever duplicated.  there's big ballads, fun upbeat songs, and gospel anthems.  it is a Christmas classic and tradition.  the 2 bonus tracks add something even more stunning to the album.  nobody can ever or will ever touch this.
1416972242|3.0|The story itself could have been amazing. Unique plot. Unique spins on angels, werewolves, vampires, and demons. Humorous dialogue. Witty pop culture references. Bad writing ruins what could've been.<br /><br />So basically in this second book of the Mortal Instruments, Big Bad Valentine gets a hold of the second of the three titular Mortal Instruments. Meanwhile Clary angsts about Jace being her brother, Jace acts like a douche and somehow remains remains likable (until he begins to fantasize about Clary. Ick.), and Simon gets taunted about being a mundane. The Inquisitor comes along and becomes the most irritating character in the series with her habit of jumping to conclusions and generally acting like an idiot who really shouldn't be in charge of anything, though I must admit, Jace would seem pretty suspicious after he sees his father, the bad guy. But pegging him as bad because of his father and not believing he honestly didn't know that Valentine was his father?<br /><br />Allow me to rage quit the book for a few minutes while I regain my patience.<br /><br />The prose is as purple as purple prose gets. Sometimes trudging through the descriptions were painful. It's not like in other stories where it is imperative to scene setting and mood. None of it is really foreshadowing for anything that I saw. In a few places the narration likes to go around the world, repeat itself, contradict itself, and then end, leaving a wake of inconclusion in its path.<br /><br />The characters sure are lively though. Jace's snarky comments on just about everything made me giggle. Simon being a nerd was adorable. Clary is a spitfire. Luke was the cool old guy. Valentine is bent on clearing the world of demons, believing it is truly for the best, not just for the evulz. Sometimes it sounds like all the characters have the same voice, which is irritating and detracts from each character's individuality. I liked the characters and their conversations were colorful and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Another one of the things that got to me was *SPOILER ALERT* Clary's ability to create new runes. It was really far fetched and came from WAY out in the left field. It wasn't hinted at that as far as I could tell. It kind of screams 'Mary Sue'! *END SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />Over all, it is not the best book I have ever read. However, it is far from being the worst, so this merits a three. If you are interested, I would recommend it. Read it for the funny conversations. Other than that, it's not the first book I'd pick up out of boredom.
0385742886|2.0|I have the Maze Runner series in my library. First editions. I have all 3 on audio as well. They were a little \\"young\\" for an adult reader but still well worth it.<br /><br />This book seems like it was written for a 10 year old by a 12 year old. Sappy, poor choice dependent, uninteresting characters and situation. A bad zombie book really.
B0011XBLUS|4.0|With more Italian actors than The Godfather triology combined and most of the movie shot in deserts of Spain, the movie at times looks out of place. But Clint Eastwood's brooding as the Good; Lee Van Cleef's snake-eyed stare as the Bad; and Eli Wallach's wretched but likeable the Ugly compensate.<br />Wallach steals every scene he's in. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is haunting and was imitated in other westerns.
0525953728|5.0|This first hand account makes you proud to be an American, that is proud of the American men and women of the military, not the ones in Washington. The matter-of-fact way our Navy Seals and other Special Forces go about their business with boundless courage and skill makes one wonder why politicians try so hard to stick their noses into military operation. This is a fast read, exciting and satisfying, and best of all... true.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Recently had to go into a dark shed at night and this was a life saver.  So glad I have it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book! I really enjoyed the character development and plot kept me up reading whenever I got a chance. I'm looking forward to reading more work from Hugh Howey when it becomes available.
B000J103PC|4.0|My friend bought me this film last X-mas because she knows it is one of my all time favorite films. It made me laugh so much. It was very enjoyable and I would recommend it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I had never seen the whole of Lawrence of Arabia, only clips and abbreviated versions in dubious color and quality. The wide screen presentation on this Blu-ray disk is magnificent, desert scenes are breathtaking, cinematography simply gorgeous. I highly recommend this disk.
B003YYKPMM|5.0|i love this movie this is a great christmas present for a lot of people dvds are great i love christmas
B002ECJZ76|5.0|I would highly recommend this DVD, even though it's dubbed/subtitled.  It's a bit cheesy in some places, but overall, brings a tear to your eye.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|i love the culture club music he is so cute i love all of his songs he is very talant
B0000542DJ|5.0|I am a huge fan of this film.  This special edition director's cut comes highly recommended.  You get some great insight into the making of the film.  highly recommended.
B00000J7J4|5.0|carlos is a great good looking man i love his songs i love it when i can buy off of the internet
B008D36INE|1.0|If you can get through the initial maudlin 5-10 minute introductory piece (ceaseless, syrupy violin), you will only be rewarded by a story of a woman who has nothing in her life but two men, neither one satisfactory.  When one of them hasn't stopped by whatever dreary rooms she is living in to either use, pity, ridicule, or ignore her, she seems to have nothing better to do than sit around and smoke, waiting for the time one of them returns.  A world claustrophobic & narrow.  I couldn't finish it, so maybe it turns around and really gets better.  From what I saw the main character as well as any viewers lose out when her initial suicide attempt fails.  It might have ended all our pain so much sooner.
B000086EOB|5.0|i love this kind of music he is so cute the leader of this band this is awsome good i love it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|tis is the genuine article to replace a cord that turned brittle and flaked apart after beng transported in the cargo area of an aircraft--evidently it got frozen and deteriorated
0783240236|5.0|this is a scary movie i like it this is a great gift for anyone in the family to buy
B007J4T2G8|3.0|after he first few chapters it turned oout to be rather boring -- don't think I'll read the sequals- bummer
B008ULM7HU|1.0|This is one of the worst recordings of D2 I have ever heard.  The sound is incredibly tinny (even a word?) and distorted.  Its a crime and an injustice to this awesome music.  Imagine hearing Simon LeBon at his highest notes...it just crackles through the speakers and is unbearable painful because the recording is SOOOOO bad, especially disc 2. Buy the original albums.  So much better.  I'm a HUGE fan and this is just the worst.  If I could give negative stars, I would. And if I could get my money back, I would as well.
0425263908|1.0|would not recommend this book to anyone.  it's boring, boring, and boring.  don't waste your money.  same plot and personality types as the more interesting books it tried to copy.
B0092G1O8A|2.0|Imagine taking reality TV, Star Wars, Gladiator, and The Lottery, throwing them into a bag, shaking it and then spilling out the contents. Voila! Instant Hunger Games. The beautiful part about this mashup is that since there are so many themes, so many cliches, so many tropes you really don't have to bother with a good script, or character development, or logic. The only thing you really need is a nice score and someone behind the camera.<br /><br />But, what about all those pesky logic problems? Everyone in the downtrodden districts hates the Hunger Games, and yet they are proud of the winners. (It was awfully hard to cheer the two finalists on. I really wanted them to die and make a point.) And, if the districts are so downtrodden, so hungry, how can they afford to have bakeries? Frosted cakes? And, if the rulers are so advanced, why don't they just buy off the downtrodden, exploited people they rule? Wouldn't it be easier to simply give them food and nice houses and a bath along with their TVs? Nobody would rebel against that. (We certainly haven't.)<br /><br />But, I am getting ahead of myself. Stories like these don't need to make sense. They just need enough hijacked symbolism to make them appear profound.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think this is the best game ever. its so cute. I love the animals.its fun to see the animals level up and change different colors.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Take note than 5 seconds for every stage load. When panning it record the touch as a selection even if finger never left the screen for panning.<br /><br />Aside from these 2 issues, the game is pretty good. I never get into the story, just going after the puzzle only.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app it is so fun but very challenging.there are so many different  power ups you can use
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie- well, it ties with Tank Girl, though they are INCREDIBLY different movies.<br />Frida is an AMAZING story about Frida Kahlo, an incredible Mexican-born half-Mexican half-German Jew artist, and Diego Rivera's wife. She's the picture of strength and determination, not to mention skill and talent. She's my personal hero, and, having grown up in the Borderland, this movie only underscored what I already knew and believed about this heroine. I can't say enough good things!!!<br />This movie is on the long side- good for a movie night, but might not be one for an early evening with young children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It`s the best GAME EVER because it is kinda like the computer version but it dozen`t have a lot of thing and needs update really bad because I have it on my phone and its version 5 alpha and its better than kindle v so it need update BAD
B008XNZMOU|5.0|An amazing and emotional album with so much musical variety! Simply fabulous.  Taylor never ceases to deliver songs girls can really connect to.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Enzo is like a pet we all have had. We all believe our pets talk and this story proves it. Very good reading and highly recommended
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Thank you, this item was exactly as described and will make a great Christmas gift. Very fast shipping and the cost was fantastic also!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Good story line with interest for all ages.  Some draggy areas, and maybe a little 'deep' for the preschooler, but a very good story that I believe offered enjoyment for most.
0802473164|4.0|This book was a recommend by my wife for me to get a better understanding of her and her ways,Ilearned so much more and would truly ask friend to read this and get a better understanding of what's going on in his relationship for the long haul.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is by far one of the top 3 shows on television.  I have never been in such anticipation for a new season to get here. Classy, classic, funny at times and the best set of actors and characters on Television.  This is a must have-all of the \\"extras\\" on the CD's are awesome!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A classic. Written in the old English and seafaring slang made it a little difficult to read but enough to understand.
B001F290E4|5.0|Very good album.  Seal is so talented.  Love this album and listen to it often.  No one else sounds like him.
B008V59AF2|5.0|I rarely duplicate collections of music, but decided to replace my vinyl with this CD.  I hadn't hear this entire collection in years.  What an memorable throw back to a very formative time of my life.  The songs are so well constructed musically, and the diversity is very notable.  I can't think of a song that sounds anything like &#34;Big Time&#34; or &#34;Sledgehammer.&#34;  The lively and whimsical feel of those two numbers contrasts very nicely with the low key and ethereal &#34;Mercy Street&#34; and the solace of &#34;Don't Give Up&#34; with side vocals of the lovely Kate Bush.<br /><br />This is a profound and wonderful musical work of art not to be missed, and is definitely a must have for any collection.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I bought this as I was really into Dire Straights back in college.  Forgot how very talented they were.  Distinctive style.  This will be going on our next road trip for sure - I buy both CD's and MP3's depending on the price.  I then download my CD's and have one huge library.  But for the (2001) car - it's CD's.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love the app. but I cant use it without an Internet connection. disapprove. not all great ideas come within reaches of wifi. but besides that, I have the app on my phone, tablet, and computer and the synching across machines is a godsend.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Buy this and also The Dreamer if you want to truly experience this talented songstress at her best.  No one can sing like Etta.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Great book. Author appeared to do an excellent job in describing the time period and what was occurring at the time. Kept me turning the pages from start to finish.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The visual presentation of the app is very nice.  The real feel temperature is also a handy feature.  It also allows you to save multiple cities (worldwide) and to move through them with one click.  There are extended forecasts, current radar maps, and more I haven't even discovered yet.  All this and it's free!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|so I was into the slender games and youtube videos and such so I go on my kindle to find some good slenderman apps. all of them are either photoshopped,pictures,or just horrible overall. this game however is the best so far. I like the fact that it is somewhat open world. graphics are decent and the terror rate is, in my perspective, 9.2% out of 10%. the. only reason I am giving it a 4 out of ten is because slenderman isn't excactly the best. they should make it so he becomes more frequent as you gather more pages. also the sound effects I don't think are the best. if they could make it more suspensful it would be a great game! anyways that's my review. Buy this app you wont regret it! !!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle fire. It runs very smooth, no hiccups so far and the card movement is smooth. I highly recommend getting it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is really fun and entertaining. It requires you to think but at the same time, it's fun so you barely notice. It's enjoyable for all &agrave;ge groups and definitely worth the money.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This item is just as it looks. It has a great feel to it and I love the functionaluty of the portait and landscape rotation feature.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is really awskme<br />lets play some more wow wow wow owownowowowbdhf.  cool game. so scoop wow cool wok
1451696205|5.0|Good quality book and was in perfect condition. I would recommend to anyone who likes books for young adults. hi
0688156819|5.0|I love Tim Burton's work. I had know idea that he also wrote books. I received this right on time and finished it in a day. One poem almost made me cry it was so sad, but over all the entire book was well written.
B004UVYIIA|5.0|Like all of his live concerts, this one is fun to watch and listen too! Beautiful music!! And the interaction of band members, the audience, and Andre Rieu himself, makes it that much more enjoyable.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I really was not an Angelina Jolie fan because of the situation that occurred between her and Brad Pitt while he was still married to Jennifer Anniston. However disapproving I may be of her moral standards, I could not deny that she did an awesome job in this movie. Her moral standards may leave much to be desired, but you can not deny that she has excellent acting skills. Great movie.
B008476HBM|5.0|All I had hoped for and then some!!! Having watched the movie in its various forms numerous times, I had wanted to read the book for years.  I finally did, and am so glad!!
B009NCM248|5.0|I was starting to loose faith in Stone Sour after a very disappointing album in Audio Secrecy.  But this album kicks you in the teeth right from the beginning and remains strong all the way through.  There are a couple slower songs for good mix, but nothing boring.  Cory Taylor said this album would be a monster and I agree!<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Part 2 has in store for Stone Sour fans.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Excellent Calculator,I could see the numbers better. Excellent Calculator,I could see the numbers better.Excellent Calculator,I could see the numbers better.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|As a fan of Shinedown from before Leave a Whisper was ever released, Amaryllis continue where The Sound of Madness left off.  I was a little worried after hearing the songs they recorded after The Sound of Madness was completed (Alice - was terrible and Boom-Lay was almost annoying), but Amaryllis doesn't disappoint.  There are some good upbeat songs with some punch (Enemies and Adrenaline) for those who like the heavier side like I do.  There is also plenty of ballad like songs as well.<br /><br />It ranks 3rd on my Shinedown album list, after Madness and Whisper but still strong and Shinedown fans won't be disappointed.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Thank you for listing this item.  I have found your product to be great.  Thank you, again.  I shall be a repeat customer.
098478280X|4.0|Pretty good book. Well written and good choice of problems. If you are planning on attending a interview, this wont be a bad buy at all.
B005LAII1C|3.0|I just had to run out and but this movie from all of the hype I heard on how it was one of the funniest movies ever. I also really enjoy Seth's humor. I don't understand why some people get so offended by certain comedy styles. Family guy never gets old to me, and always puts a smile on my face.<br /><br />In the first 10 minutes of this movie, I was certain I was going to be in for a hilarious ride. I was already laughing hard. Then the movie progressed, and I anxiously awaited for it to get funny again, but it stalled. What happens far too often with these kinds of movies is they try so hard to stay to a plot, and unfortunately for this movie, it was a love story. Also, the pot and beer references are only so funny. Again, I'm not offended, but I'm not going to continue to laugh because a teddy bear shouldn't be a pot head. What irony!<br /><br />I was terribly disappointed. I love purchasing comedy movies as I will watch them over and over, and each time they are still funny. At the moment, I feel let down, and don't know when I wil watch this again. Hopefully, it grows on me.

B00AKFGSPQ|5.0|\\"Elementary\\" is delightful. It took me three episodes to really \\"get it\\" and you are missing out if you gave up. Sherlock's \\"personality\\" initially seems somewhat cold and unlikable. This may account for the learning curve. However by Episode Three the character fills out and the viewer is riveted by Johnny Lee Miller's portrayal. Of course, like the Conan Doyle character, Sherlock has extraordinary powers of observation and deduction but a nuanced, multidimensional and at times \\"lovable\\" character also emerges. He is brash, brave, bold and really funny from \\"laugh out loud\\" to \\"makes me smile.\\" There are also brief but poignant displays of kindness, compassion, honor, sensitivity, hurt, camaraderie. We see that the larger than life personality is in part a construct to protect his ultimate vulnerability. Miller gives us an eccentric but also real and authentic character - endlessly watchable, entertaining and surprising.<br /><br />Watson, played by Lucy Liu, is a dream - beautiful, sexy, silky, svelte, and soft but also a gal with strength, character, confidence and a keen sense of comfort in her own skin.  I fell in love with her at first sight; she sparkles and is endlessly sensual, charismatic, and watchable. She must be thick skinned to bear up under Sherlock's occasional abrupt, tactless, condescending antics but she is no pushover: smart, cool, confident self- possessed. With all this, pithy common sense and her own repertoire of zingers she is the perfect foil and straight-man for her \\"boss.\\" We sense a growing mutual respect and even at times fondness. Never fear, Sherlock will always retain his edgy genius and will be himself no matter who he (with justification) skewers or what social conventions he my skirt.<br /><br />In each episode, Sherlock is a consultant to N.Y.P.D. Homicide Captain Tony Gregson, played with a deft touch by Aidan Quinn. Quinn's character is fully realized with depth and character. We quite like these three characters, root for them to solve the case. The plots are original, intriguing with unexpected twists and surprises but always credible and all the more fascinating because of our growing understanding and fondness for Sherlock, Watson and the Captain.<br /><br />This is intelligent, intriguing, funny adult entertainment with a unique sensibility. Not for everyone but in my view that is a good thing.m to solve the case. The plots are original, intriguing with unexpected twists and surprises but always credible and all the more fascinating because of our growing understanding and fondness for Sherlock, Watson and the Captain.<br /><br />This is intelligent, intriguing, funny adult entertainment with a unique sensibility.

0385340567|5.0|This is the 12th Jack Reacher novel and it is every bit as good as the 11 previous ones. Reacher, nothing to lose and hell bent on dispensing justice.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|So many catchy songs. Not much country, but I think what she is doing now is something that's never been done. I actually like the three deluxe songs more than many of the ones on the actual album though. I wish I got the deluxe version, instead of buying the songs separately.
0470913029|5.0|Although I love bread and pasta it has not been kind to me. And apparently I am allergic to ice cream (or most dairy) because I would suffer through incredible times of complete bone-crushing fatigue the day after eating it. So, the things I love to eat versus feeling great all the time. No contest. Luckily though I do love salads and veggies and there is plenty to eat with this meat diet. Not really a &#34;diet&#34; as much as a change in eating habits. I do feel better, more energy and no bone-crushing fatigue since I started following this way of eating. Oh yeah, I'm losing weight too without feeling deprived or starved.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Wow, what a ride! Such an exciting storyline. Such a fun & unique love story. A lot of ups and downs. Definitely a shocking moment that happens, but the story leaves you wanting a 2nd book!
B004R2DS9C|4.0|I gave it a 4.  I like the design but I wished it came in larger sizes.  I have two grandsons that have more Lego Star Wars than the store !
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie is not the worst I have ever seen. It is maybe a 2.5. It isn't very funny, maybe if your 12. I was deceived by the positive ratings, every other place where this movie is rated it gets terrible reviews. When I read in one of the other reviews \\"Funniest Movie I Have Ever Seen\\" realized that this person must have been paid for his review.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|this game is really awesome. I couldn't put it down once I started playing it. I cant wait for enigmatis 2.
B001EBV0NU|2.0|The Martians' ack-ack was funny. I laughed at them. I didn't laugh at any of the actors. This was hit-you-over-the-head with a rubber chicken humor, not sophisticated or clever humor. If you're going to do a satirical spoof you have to work harder than Burton did here.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I loved the special effects. Kristen Stewart does a pretty good job, but since I had seen all of the Twilight movies up to the last one, I thought she had no different kinds of expressions than in the Twilight movies so seemed kind of like Bella playing Snow White. I love to see special effects and is the main reason I rented the movie. I thought it might have been a little more in the romance. I loved the Sanctuary \\"fairy forest\\" and again for the special effects. It was pretty amazing. Overall, I'll probably watch it again before the Jan.2013 deadline. Even though I rented it for 48 hours, it says I can watch it until Jan.6 I think it said. Not really for young children though, I'd choose the Disney version for children under 10 or so.
B004GYY714|5.0|Like the fact that you can record the radio stuff you like.  And it came with most of the radio stations I like
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever i love how it is so many games in one and only ten games to start out with gives you something  work to
141659521X|5.0|This book was great from start to finish.  There was enough material to have written at least another book if not two.  Best book in the series.  And I loved the rest!
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Really good copies of everything.  Even the rarities.  I finally can listen to &#34;Always Unknowing&#34; in the car. (Only on SACD?)  Anyway, its there.  Not the live stuff, but they said STUDIO.  Love it.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This was a really good twist to the original Planet of the Apes, I love the graphics and the story line was really great.
1401937268|5.0|When my oracle deck arrived, I opened it, as usual I go through the process of clearing the deck, then one by one observing each card.  This deck consumed me, I saw myself in each mystical card as if I have been there, the energy of this deck for me was unbelievable and I have many oracles (almost all of Doreen's and so many other authors) but this will be my number 1 to use!  I connected with this deck like I have never connected with before, and believe me I do not write reviews often but I felt compelled to share my experience.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I was at first a little worry seem so many famous actors in one movie, however this was really well done. It had a lot of action and comedy in it.  I love they way everything played out, I was a little disappointed that Jet Li was not more into the movie, but over all I love it.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|I bought this for my grand children.  I really enjoy this as well.  The series is meant for children but adults will like it too.  It's a lot like the old Rocky and Bullwinkle in that respect.  It has situations that adults can laugh at as well.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, I wished I would have seen it first before seeing the Aventures, it explain how everything came into play. I would recommend it to those who love the old time Marble cartoons and great family movie as well.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Loved the ideas behind this, especially with the rewritten documents.  I was annoyed when she blindly jumped into a few situations without a plan and just had good luck.  Generally, though, I thought it was great!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds is endlessly entertaining! Love it! The sounds, the graphics, all one of the best games out there for anyone...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had no real expectations, but was surprised to find I loved this story!  Book one, even though heartbreaking, left me wanting to see what came next.  I loved the characters and the way they functioned in their world.  I also liked that there was a little bit of everything and several layers to this.  I could see all sides at some point, but still liked to hate the bad guys. I hope there is a sequel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! it isn't as good as Pc but its as close as I can get! those who give it bad reveiws just haven't figured out how to play (dub of course hoist cant craft on creative mode) I ale heard someone say you can get it free on a website but unless, its not by mojang,  then its illegal!
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I loved reading more about his childhood and his sister!  I like his perspective and twisted humor too!  It kept me laughing!
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|To be brutally honest this movie sucked. Lousy<br /> plot, lousy acting, lousy script. Don't waste your time or your money on this bomb.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|I really liked the ideas behind this series.  The rewrites of the Bible, etc. were great additions!  There were times, though, when I felt the main character just jumped into the unknown without even a plan and it just worked out.  That seemed unlikely.  I love the way the author ended this novel though.  I was frustrated that the next one was not yet written!
0061780308|5.0|THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE BOUGHT, I MADE THE MISTAKE OF LOANING IR OUT AND IT NEVER RETURNED, SO ORDERED AND BOUGHT THIS ONE - THANKS.  IT IS A GREAT STORY TOLD BY THE DOG WHO LIVES WITH HIS OWNER AND FAMILY.  THE ENDING WILL GIVE YOU GOOSE BUMPS.  LOVE IT ... LOVE IT ... LOVE IT........ I DRIVE ALOT.  I LIVE 70 MILES OUTSIDE OF LAS VEGAS AND MAKE WEEKLY TRIPS INTO THE CITY.  I WOULD NEVER BE WITHOUT A BOOK ON TAPE OR CD, AND THIS STORY IS A WINNER.<br /><br />ENJOY.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is just a wonderful romp. Sure, there's a moral to the story and all that, but it's just intended to be a fun ride for all. Enjoy!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I've been a long time fan since first album ...chino has an amazing voice ...everything he does is so amazing! This album is so beautiful! his voice its music porn for the ears ! It takes you away into this whole new world...of beauty, chaos, landscapes , and just pureness ...and when I say chaos I don't mean horror I mean \\"free\\" to do what you want to do...every song paints a picture...this album just like the rest is my favorite...it may not be the heaviest but chino has a way with his voice that traps you and makes you crave for more ...the rest of the band members make you fall in love even more with their pure talent ....I wish I could give more stars then just 5 it is a beautiful well rounded album! And with their creative level to put out even more music and side bands ...the deftones screams \\"music\\" ....not group but they are \\"music\\" ...
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I am so happy with my order. It was brand new and it came on time. It was perfect. Very very satisfied
B00003CX9E|5.0|With many movies out there, this one is by far the finest film ever made. The cinematography, directing, and acting are nothing short of superb. Orson Welles is clearly a genius and deserves the highest recognition for his brilliance shown in this film. I sincerely recommend this film to everyone, young and old, for not only the outstanding technical and acting aspects, but because of its beautiful and heartfelt message.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I love this movie. Feel of a futeristic sci-fi movie combined with an old classic. I would recommend this movie to friends and family.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Loved this book...  It is detailed and well thought out and explained in simple terms each step in preparing books to submit for kindle.
B005GSVFF0|5.0|I love this movie because so many children and adults can relate to the characters and story. Teaches loyalty and trust among friends and family. I recommend to all people of all ages.
078322947X|4.0|I watched this movie in the theater in the 70's and liked it then. I could never find it on Netflix so I bought it. The movie starts a little slow but it pcks up speed as the story unfolds. If you like action movies I would recommend, but this isn't for everyone.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This product is awesome. It is simple and perfect for sharpening your axe, pocket knife, hatchet and any blade you need for camping/hunting. It does a great job at creating a new edge with the carbide side and maintaining the edge with the ceramic side. I am very eased with my purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the app.for those of you that don't know you can play survival when you make a new world.Thanks for reading!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Easy to use nothing wrong with it but it also carries multiple sources for the next generation and more. Thanks
B00062J00S|5.0|no disc scratches, the cover has one little flaw but its not very noticeable, it is in great condition for being a used movie. glad i was able to find it for a decent price (half of what most other sellers were asking for a new copy) and even more pleased that it has arrived before christmas because i purchased it as a gift
B007QNRMUU|3.0|It's typical Jason Mraz. Consistent sound and a new duet (doesn't quite compare to &#34;We steal…&#34;<br /><br />If you enjoy Jason's recent work you won't be disappointed. .
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The funniest part of the movie is when I turned it off.<br /><br />The sad part is that Wahlberg is a really funny guy based on his role in The Other Guys but this is beyond bad.  Don't bother with renting this.  If you buy it I really feel bad for you.<br /><br />Terrible, beyond bad.  Negative stars would be to kind.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Even after being around for my entire lifetime, I still look forward to each new release by Mr. Zimmerman. The item arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.. Thanks!
B0013ND30M|5.0|It came on time, New in Package, and no problems. I have not had any problem with the DVD. It was well priced, eventhough it was taken off the shelves in stores.
B0015KO52S|5.0|This man knows how to rock!  A wonderful and welcome new addition to my cd collection. This item arrived in a timely manner, in great condition. Thank You!
B0038JN6VA|3.0|I would've liked it to have a better battery life. It dies too fast for me, but I still like the product overall.
0062018205|5.0|After reading this book myself and enjoying very much, I bought it as a gift to a friend of mine who always look for new ideas and insights about &#34;how we think&#34; and &#34;why we think like that&#34;.<br />He told me that the day he got it he stayed awake until 5 am reading it... ;)
B002ZG976U|5.0|One get to hear 2 great women singers in a great setting. They both are excellent actors as well! Great fun and wonderful costumes!
B00005JM02|5.0|This is another one of those magical movies that is great for people of any age.  If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out!!
B0041KVX1K|5.0|This is my 7th and possibly final review on this remaster series as it is the last of the vinyl records that I had planned to purchase. In order to compare this record to previous recordings, I played it back to back with Capitol's \\"The Early Beatles.\\" It has 11 of the same 14 songs on it.<br /><br />This was probably the 3rd pressing because it was on the Apple label. I was surprised to hear how good this still sounded. It was also in excellent condition.<br /><br /> The remaster was a very flat pressing and was almost dead quiet. The sound is dynamic and detailed. It would be a great match for those that have a stereo system that may be a bit on the dark or midrangey side. However it does sound different from the older pressing. I could see where Beatle fans would like both for different reasons. The song Please, Please Me definitely sounded different. However, I would not say it was better than the Apple version. The remaster has good definition and detail and bass. It would sound great on most modern stereo systems.<br /><br />A note on the Rainbo pressings:<br /><br />There has been a lot of critical backlash to these. Some may be warranted and some may not. Out of the 8 titles I have purchased, 7 of those were almost perfect. I had a lot of problems with the Sgt. Peppers album of which I had to return 5 copies to various local records stores as well as Amazon. I could not get a good copy to save my soul. I have decided to wait on that until they fix the problems with that one. The issues with that record are well documented by not only myself but others as well.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am batting about 88% on these. I think that is pretty good odds. I was never interested in the whole box set but wanted the British versions for my collection. I still highly recommend the first eight LP's of this 2012 vinyl remaster series.
B005T87QCI|1.0|This game was fun at first but I could not get past metro. if u get it upgrade ur armore only.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I love HIMYM.  I purchase every season, regardless of if the plot for that season.  If you really love the character and the writing it doesn't matter- it'll always be entertaining.
B003F3NDOO|4.0|Awesome shipping. Received my package sooner then expected. I ordered a new first season of Cougar Town and i received a dvd cover that was worn out along the edges. The cd was perfectly new with the factory wrap but the sleeve cover did have the worn out edges.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I am somewhat ashamed to say that I love this album. Every song is great. I can listen to the entire album on repeat, and that is a rare thing nowadays.  I didn't really pay attention to Taylor Swift before this album but now it's a guilty pleasure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. I can add and subtract. I can multiply and divide. it helps my mom correct my math papers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the customization and game play options!<br />So many hours of enjoyment...I would recommend this game to  anyone of any age.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie always makes me laugh.  If you haven't seen it then you really need to sit down on your night off and watch it!
B007SGM084|4.0|Excellent trilogy each book left me wanting more.  You want to know more and more about each character as you read each chapter.
B006H8BIIM|4.0|I like defense games like this. This one was a fun play and handled well on the kindle fire. The only problem was long gaming killed the battery quickly
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I purchased this cover for my mother for her kindle fire.... While it is very light weight and some may consider it to be cheap... I found it to be the exact opposite i found it to fit the kindle well and stand worked great.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Ever since hearing Randy Hansen's solo guitar work on apocalypse now, and more recently \\" feedback in vienna\\" on the 2010 Carlos three part movie I gotta wonder if I'm alone in liking solo distorted guitar only music. A few Hendrix releases on dagger records, Pete Cosey on Miles Davis's early 70's lineup, that sort of sound resonates with me, and this album meets my desires.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It's almost too hard to believe...but believing is what life is all about..<br />We really are just a memory in time..
B0055S348W|5.0|I had a problem with the last update and in less then 10 minutes of my email I received full support on how to fix the problem. It is hard to find that type of great customer service.
0811875040|5.0|I have tried several of the recipes from this book and have found each one meets or exceeds my expectations. I always use the best ingredients since I live on a small homestead farm. The gingerbread cookies were the best I have ever tasted and they kept firm in a cookie tin for 2 weeks. Try her recipes for her essentials and you will not be disappointed.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book for my 4-year-old granddaughter, and we read it together. She loved pressing the dots and seeing what was on the next page. A great interactive book that's still a 'real' book.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Strangers in many ways – classic song &#34;For All We Know&#34; from The Carpenters.<br /><br />This movie starts out sort of strange. However after watching it for a while it gets sort of strange. Everything gets wrapped up in the end as it is sort of strange.<br /><br />Two twelve-year-olds fall in love and run away together. They are pursued by all who care, from relatives, kaki scouts, police, welfare, and a storm.<br /><br />Lots of exadurated personalities. However it is just as I remember it as a youth. So maybe it is not so exadurated. There is a welfare lady could be a character right out of a Roald Dahl story.
0307960471|4.0|I thought this was a great book, except that the ending has me worried. Spoiler alert: The last paragraph leaves Harry's life in question, and after seeing a video interview with Jo Nesbo, I'm wondering if he intends to continue the series. I certainly hope so.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|A movie about a whiter shade of pale<br /><br />I have to admit that I never watched the original \\"Dark Shadows\\" (1966-1971), as I spent decades ignoring soap operas and most weekly serial entertainment programs with the exception of a few classics. However even though I keep saying I do not like the Jonny Depth sort of film I find that I strangely enough purchased just about all of them. After watching \\"Dark Shadows\\" I guess I will just have to admit that I do like his body of work. Turns out it is a lot of Burton's films with which I am not enamored.<br /><br />Just in case I am not the only person to have missed the original story line, this film is about the head of a household \\"Collinwood\\" or more of a financial empire that returns to a crumbling future to rebuild that empire.<br /><br />In his youthful lusty way Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) besmirches a young which Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and soon must turn to the dark side to protect himself and the new love of his life. It is to no avail as he is transformed into a vampire and force to covet his neighbor's blood. He is boxed for a couple hundred years and on his return he now must cope with a new world and his reencounter with his gorgeous lustful nemesis.<br /><br />This looks like it is probably a pilot to a new series of films similar to his previous \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" series.<br /><br />Now I want the sound track. I have most of the songs now but it is a nice mixture and will remind me of the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Secret Room\\"<br />\\"Nights in White Satin\\"<br />\\"Season of the Witch\\"<br />\\"Superfly\\"<br />\\"I'm Sick of You.\\"<br />\\"Highway Star\\"<br />\\"Theme from a Summer Place\\"<br />\\"Top of the World\\"<br />\\"Crocodile Rock\\"<br />\\"Paranoid\\"<br />\\"Happy Nightstrums\\"<br />\\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\"<br />\\"The Joker\\"<br />\\"Bang a Gong (get it on)\\"<br />\\"No more Mr. Nice Guy\\"<br />\\"Ballad of Dwight Frye\\"<br />\\"Go all the way\\"<br />\\"I would like to teach the world to sing (in perfect harmony)\\"
1442444053|5.0|Sadly might seem slow-paced for today's kids, but these pictures will attract their attention to the interesting, interwoven adventure story.
B00664AM5C|3.0|There are some really talented actors in this movie. It's too bad that they had so little to do. It's an ensemble cast, but nobody is really supporting anybody. They all have little bits of action that never really overlap. It's one story, but told from so many points of view that you never get a satisfying bite of anything. Then, it abruptly ends. When that happens the viewer can't help but feel, \\"So what?\\" They took me through all that to do what, exactly? It wasn't entertaining. It didn't teach me anything. It didn't make me go \\"hm.\\" It just took my time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It keeps you glued to the TV and you cannot wait to see what is next after every episode. A must watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|...I love this game. you can make you own world. There is monsters you can fight it is so so so fun
034580404X|4.0|It was not book for me, I am not fan of erotica, but it was easy to read. There were so many grammatical mistakes, and it could use some editing. Good book for people who enjoy this genre. Good book for romance lovers:[...]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this app is fun and a great way to let time pass by.<br />I would like it to be easier to get games though.
1451629184|5.0|I really love this book. She is an amazing person Really inspiring book to read. I Say Good job! .
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I can't get the alarm to turn off upon first use. STILL trying to figure it out. Deleting the set alarm did not help.
0792839730|5.0|People in this country forget the sacrifices our soldiers went through during WWII.  While this movie is typical Hollywood, it shows the sometimes stupid decisions that our generals make, and the suffering of soldiers who must carry out those plans.  Market Basket was a disaster from the very start.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is so cool. I can download Youtube videos when I am connected to WiFi. I can watch the videos I have downloaded whether I have WiFi or not. A great app for road trips and bus rides.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|Great HD quality. The movie itself was a great storyline. My boyfriend, who hasn't watched any of the movies, watched this one and said it was actually good!
B000000XB9|5.0|Great music from the Creedence Clearwater Revival.  Brings back a lot of memories listening to the sound of their music.
B008220AVW|5.0|If you are a Jaty Perry fan than you will Love this movie.  This is her story and how she fought her way to make it big.  It gets pretty personal too with her love life and all.  If you love Katy Perry than you will definitely Love this movie.
B000000XBC|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband who loves CCR music and he liked it very much.  Great classics if you like the CCR sound.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. There isn't a single song on here that I don't like.  This cd has all of her hits that made it to #1!
B008K8U13K|1.0|This is not a sequel to my favorite Sonic game, Sonic 3 and Knuckles. It is simply remade Sonic 1 levels. Splash Hill? Lost Labyrinth? Those levels sound a lot like Green Hill and Labyrinth Zone from Sonic 1. Don't get me wrong, I am all for redos, but the game has other flaws. The game only has 4 knockoff levels, so your basically paying a dollar per level. The controls are garbage, as the D-Pad is too small and slippery. As for speed, it occasionally lags and every time Sonic runs through a loop the entire screen does a 360 degree turn. Get Episode 2, the true sequel to a game like Sonic 3. As for this, it is quite a dreadful try to bring back the golden Genesis era.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A love story without all of the smutt.  Already ordered Walking Disaster.  Based on Beautiful Disaster that one will be just as good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game so much that i would marry it. first i built underground houses then i started flat roofs then regular roofs then a really awsome house that looks well awsome!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Story was very. boring.  Not much happening.  A lot of politics and uninteresting events. I would not recommend this book.
141659521X|5.0|Flynn hits all the marks one more time. Never get tired of Mitch Rapp!<br />Keep up the great work-can't wait for the next one.
1878424319|5.0|Ideally, if you've been on a journey of personal and spiritual growth, you already hold the values in this book to be true for you. And even though the information wasn't news for me, I found it helpful to see it so clearly laid out. It helps to bring clarification to that which I already believe and know to be true for me.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Bar far the best show on tv. Season 2 is amazing. I loved all three shows. The only downside is that the show only has three episodes, I wish it had more!
B0083I90HU|5.0|A beautiful book about a very sad time in our world's history.  Very moving.  It made me want to read more of this author's works.<br />As a history buff this was a time during WWII that I did not know much about-what it was like in Vichy run France.  It makes you vow never to forget and swear to never let it happen again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great app with several gaming options to choose from!  Love the best time mode and the challenge too... wish it had the option to play with friends.
B004US4K2C|1.0|I was looking for a good launcher and this looked like the best one. Unfortunately it is not Kindle compatable.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Its Led Zepplin...what else is there to say? I grew up listening to these most awesome artists,and I am so lucky to have been able to listen and enjoy their music. I have passed my love for them on to my sons and now I have to look for my CD when I want to listen to it!:)) These cds are some of my favorites and the music brings back lots of memories. It always makes me smile when I think about what it meant to &#34;get the Led out.&#34;
B006TJXZ30|5.0|This version on hotmail is clean and works great on the kindle. It makes things a lot neater and easier.
0142419850|5.0|I really love these Alex Rider books. They are very fun and fast to read. Hard to put down. Can't way to read the next one.
B00632HWOG|5.0|A nice version of an older program. It works great and has a clean concise look to it. I want this app on my PC.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Recommended by friends we bought season 1.  The story starting simple soon developed to an intriguing drama that grabs one and you can't wait for the next sequence. The acting is outstanding by the main characters.  In short it is a series we will follow to the end.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It took a while for me to figure out how to use it but now that I know I love it. Nice clear picture and good sound.
B003DNN0L2|4.0|This movie has a great story and the stop animation is great.  The dialogue is more for adults than kids though.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|A good browser would be a nice addition for the Kindle and I was hoping that this one would work. No such luck.
B005NS5CX4|1.0|Call me a purist, but part of the experience of listening to a great album is reading the liner notes and songwriting/production credits ... without that, it's not even worth my time to download it .... I'll just have to save my pennies and buy the CD later.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well. Now I have to figure out how to get multiple addresses.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Game progress does not save buyer beware!!!Shame on gameloft shame on you for destroying what could have been great app. Do not buy this at $6.99 wait for the discounted price of $0.99. No as a matter of fact don't buy it at all unless they complete the game first.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family! It's tough to say which is better, this one or the original Miracle on 34th Street.  The stories are a bit different, but just as magical!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I have no opinion of this DVD because I ordered as a Christmas present for a little friend of mine.  I only hope she likes it.
0385535147|5.0|this is the best mystery i've read in decades.  it has all the elements.  great plot, great ending, great prose.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|This is a Christmas present to go with the DVD I ordered.  I hope my little friend likes it.  That is what she requested for Christmas.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It's an iconic Disney film and as an adult, it makes me laugh so hard. I love these films. Get yours..
B007U1FEJE|4.0|I did not like the CD but it was delivered like advertised.  I am a huge Beach Boys fan so I was really disappointed in this CD but that wasn't anyones fault except the Beach Boys.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|My reason for getting this book was to see what lay behind the film &#34;Lincoln&#34;, as Kearns's book is the credited source for the film. Actually the film has to do with the book in only a miniscule way, as the battle over the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery forever--the proper subject of the movie--is almost a sideline to Kearns's major task, which is to define the political environment of the Lincoln administration. Political liberals like director Steven Spielberg and his screenwriter, Tony Kushner, like to focus on Lincoln as &#34;the great Emancipator&#34;. He was that, but he was very much more. At any rate, Kearns has the man's full measure. She is a skilled historian of presidential politics who also knows how to weave a tale and to keep the reader involved. As she reminds the reader at the outset, her focus as a historian has been the presidency in the 20th century; but in the course of creating this group portrait of the Lincoln cabinet, she found &#34;that after nearly two centuries, the uniquely American story of Abraham Lincoln has unequalled power to captivate the imagination and to inspire emotion.&#34; This cannot be more true, and could not have been more truly said.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I find this game a lot of fun. I am sure that my niece and I will be enjoying this game for a long time.
075669812X|5.0|I suggest buying. I searched at tj maxx or Marshall's and I feel this item was a good price and good quality.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Seemed a little tricky at first but when you get the hang of it you will be surprized at how far and fast you go.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an excellent story with plenty of mystery and surprises. I hate to see the end, because it has been so entertaining. Well one more book to look forward too. Then I will have to find a new adventure to read.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game kicks ass! Not a huge fan of anime but decided to give P4:Animation a shot. Never looked back ever since.<br /><br />All in all, P4G is a near-flawless JRPG game that will leave you wanting more and more and more.<br /><br />5/5 rating is obviously an understatement and demonstrates how you don't need insanely stunning graphics to be one of the best game out there.<br /><br />Well done Atlus. My soul was sold.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My friend code is: 55a5e. This game is very fun. It is more for little kids, but I have a lot of fun playing it. The animals are really cute and the mini games are cute as well. It plays a lot like MyLittlePony friendship is magic.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This game is fun and challenging for the whole family to try to play.  Watch out for the bombs.  See if you can win.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Catchy music with very entertaining and interesting lyrics.  It is just was I was expecting from this album and I wasn't disappointed.  Most people only know her singles that show up on the radio, but I really recommend you pick up the album to hear the other tracks that are just as good but didn't make it on the radio.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I got into this book.  After a while, it got too strange and intense and almost inhumane.  I wasn't motivated to finish it, and I can't see where they'd go to in the 2 books following.  I know there are people that have LOVED the series, but I just can't keep up with the intensity of his demands.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|good story. good graphics. can't wait for the next one. even my eight year old enjoys playing this game &amp; has no trouble navigating her way thru it.
0307346617|4.0|By having a large number of characters recounting their own stories instead of telling the real time stories of a smaller number of characters, it's easier to understand an event but harder to have a narrative. I didn't have a clear sense of how time was moving as I read the different stories in this book. Aside from being an exciting story by itself, a zombie epidemic is a vehicle to explore how people behave in extremely stressful and strange situations. I would have enjoyed reading more about society reforming itself after this disaster. These are my comments about the style of the book. As for the mythology of the book, the focus on zombies being underwater was unusual, and I'm not sure if I liked it. I find it easier to believe in zombies that seem physically realistic than to believe in zombies that can only be killed by destroying their brains. Really I think that the best way to do a zombie epidemic is to make it an infection that really is similar to rabies, as in 28 Days Later, instead of making zombies actually undead.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I love this movie, when I watched it at the cinema the first time was not so great like the second time.....probably when I will watch it again it will deserve 5 stars......
B0058YPL66|5.0|This has got to be the best tv series released in a long time and it's even better without all those annoying commercials.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|That's what les miserable translates to. In all reality, he was right. Every single being in the human race has been miserable at least once. This book has been, and always will be enlightening boy all those mature enough to read and understand it.
0307959856|3.0|Pride and Prejudice as a murder mystery!  I like a good mystery but this one had too much detail and way too many main characters.  It was difficult to keep them all straight. P.D.  James is one of my favorite authorsd but she missed on this one trying to emulate Jane Austin.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is without a doubt one of the funniest i've seen. I love the music and the plot is good. I recommend this movie to anyone who whats a good laugh.
B009JNXK88|3.0|this game looks fun and probably is. the problem i have is that the Kindle fire HD 8.9&quot;  screen is too big to hold and control the game at the same time. my thumbs can't tap the on screen controls quick or acurate enough to effectively get through the levels. on the smaller Kindle fire it might be just right. i like the concept of the game and the cute retro graphics. this would be great on a handheld system like Nintendo DSi or 3DS as a download. if that ever happens i will get that version.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Christopher Hitchens, \\"the beau ideal of the public intellectual\\" had entered tumor town.  As he notes this town is very welcoming with no racism or agism.<br />As he was dying of cancer of the esophagus, he took the time to write letters to shore.<br /><br />Among my favorite contributions is the handbook of cancer etiquette.  Perhaps I would be forgiven if I extend it to all mortal illness.  His ban of saying that one knows exactly how he feels is a cast iron rule.<br /><br />\\"to the dumb question, \\"Why me?\\" the cosmos barely bothers to return the reply: Why not?\\"  As a guide to this corner of the cosmos, this book presents comfort precisely in its lack of real comfort.  Having been to this country with a loved one, I would recommend this guidebook.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used a lot of weather apps and none of them work even close to as good as this one dose.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I ordered this DVD set and received it in a very timely manner. Great experience overall and cannot wait to watch and re-watch every episode over and over again.  : ]
B00271SFB6|5.0|Haven't really kept up-to-date with all the Bond movies, so I'm not the best critic, but this had all the elements I expected: crazy stunts, a couple twists, lots of action, little romance.  We rented it for a double-date at home, and was a good all-around pleaser.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|not worth the time it takes to download. one problem after another. game closes for no reason when trying to complete certain task. ie: everytime I try to plant cabbage the entire game shuts down.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Nothing new, just the same amazing characters and astounding storytelling that Mr. Abercrombie continues to produce.  Outstanding work once again!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|It was very good to see RUSH at thier best, and everything so clear, so it's good to see them record thier tours, i like how they admire thier audience, very cool.

0385335997|5.0|I love it! Great series, I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Diana Gabaldon is a great author and I love the creativity of the whole story line.

B009186E3O|5.0|A very interesting documentary on an early Stones tour.  I was amazed at how much of it was used in &#34;Crossfire Hurricane&#34;.  Only goes to show how definitive a film it is in capturing the &#34;Satifaction&#34; era Stones, and the weirdness surrounding tours by British Invasion groups of the time.  It's nice to have the CD's of the music, the DVD and Blu-Ray together is a plus, but I truly love the 10 inch vinyl of some of the live material.  I also thought a good job was done on the book and other print material.  All in all, a pretty class package.  Can't wait  to be able to afford the Deluxe &#34;GRRR&#34; set.

1567184855|5.0|I have read over 100 books on reincarnation and life between lives, but this is the very best.  The techniques Dr. Newton uses gives him unprecedented insights into that time between our lives on earth.  The cases studies are fascinating.  Of special interest is the process we go through when we select a new life and the body we will use, and the signals we learn to recognize our soulmates in the new life.  This book is the gold standard and you will read it over and over, and recommend it to many others.

0446343129|5.0|The author of Sugar Blues, William Duffy, had migraine headaches, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, all of which I have, and he cured himself by eliminating refined sugar from his diet. He goes through the history of eating refined sugar and how as people began eating refined sugar, there became more illnesses. Mr. Duffy said that refined sugar is not only empty calories, no nutrition, but refined sugar also depletes your body of the nutrition it has. I quit sugar for two months and decreased my migraines by at least half.  I take Relpax pills for migraines and I am usually almost out of pills by the end of the two month period when I can get them again, and now I have at least 15 pills left. Now that the holidays are almost here, I have allowed myself to eat some refined sugar and some Diet Coke during the last two weeks, but often when I do, I start to get headaches and sometimes migraines.  Since I love chocolate and Diet Coke, it is hard to give it up completely, but I know I will feel better if I do. I still have the fatigue, anxiety, and depression, but I'm sure it will take more than a couple months of not eating refined sugar to cure myself of those, if it's possible.  I also read a book called Potatoes not Prozac, and it seemed to describe me very well, which tells me that I may be sugar sensitive. If that's the case, I not only need to quit eating refined sugar, but I also need to eat more protein, and I am in the process of doing so.  If I am successful, I'll write an update.
B006LSZECO|4.0|good book you will have a love/hate relationship throughout. i would definately recommend to friends and family.  lots of twists and turns.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is a easy way to know rare and unuseful words, I like it. If you want to see the meaning of a word you can use it.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Contrary to other reviewers belief, there is a pinch zoom on the hidden object screens.  And when you zoom in, if you keep your finger on the screen, you can scroll around.  Very useful.  However, I just played a find the difference that had an object under my upper toolbar that I could never have found without a hint.  That is frustrating &amp; unnecessary.  My Droid 4 isn't a kindle, but I do expect to be able to see everything on my screen, albeit maybe needing zoom.<br />The menu options are not helpful and the dialog is very stilted.  Also, I thought my program had frozen when it loaded a screen with a wizard in front of the school but it had no words or buttons.  Luckily I waited and found it to just be a random pre-screen.<br />  The non HO games (which are what I wanted) aren't particularly challenging, but they do add a nice layer.  However, clicking the room you are moving from to another room (that has a giant red arrow telling you where to go), is useless.  If I could choose the rooms to go to, that would be a different story.  Why do I need to click from/to if I can't choose it myself?<br />  Overall, I feel it was an interesting framework with detailed graphics that needs more work.  The speech bubbles are glaringly ugly &amp; annoying &amp; when I click to go faster often double up.  Improve these basics (delete room transfer, no more top edge finding, toolbars can move) and even without upgrading the &quot;puzzles&quot;, you have a better game.
145470246X|5.0|This book is amazing. The jewelry and colors are beautiful. With the list of beads used in the product. Must get to be amazed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I use it yo help kill time and its a ton of mini games in one and all different types of them too
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|Fun movie, but the character played by Scarlett Johannsen made me want to smack her with Thor's hammer.  So one dimensional.  Love Ironman, Thor and  Hulk.
B0067QPVD2|2.0|Well there goes a little over an hour I'll never see again. While the special \\"monster effects\\" were grotesque and well done, the characters lacked any empathy at all. I could not have cared less about any of them. The ending didn't make sense and was inconclusive. The female lead was flat and had no spark at all. The characters were 2 dimensional and not at all developed. What a waste of time! The only good part was the little song the Norwegians were singing after they found the \\"thing\\" in the rec room.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is from my 11 year old son, Lewis.  This book was awesome! I just think there should be less kissing and violence but other than that it's fine.
B00170DEM8|1.0|Yeah, it may have been cool back in the day, but racism is stupid. People who like this movie like racism. You should be ashamed of yourself. Liking this is like being a fan of Triumph of the Will; you like things that are terrible.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|I am an music enthusiast for a long time. I am mostly into alternative and underground music. I found The Weeknd when it was for free on his site and fell in love instantly. It is in the mainstream of what youth likes today, BUT it is perfect from a musical point of view. The melodies are not obvious, his singing is perfect, and all tracks (30!) hold up to the same level of perfection. I have allready bought 8 of the albums and gave away among my friends because he's still quite unknow in Poland.<br /><br />Highly recommended to .. everyone who loves nice melodies.
B009PQ5Y4M|5.0|Needs a follow up like Prometheus 2. Being an allien fan, this goes to the sub-begining. Really liked it. Going to watch it again to see what i missed the 1ST time.
B007L6VR12|5.0|i love this movie. I bought this just so i would have my own copy. There is not much else to say.
B000Q67876|5.0|What can I say, this is a great classic movie, with the culprits being those who run the prision. A classic well worth adding to your movie collection.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|It is a little bit confusing as there are no clear directions, but I am a novice at this, so it is not intuitive for me.
B000K7UG20|4.0|Its a older title, but I never watched it before. Movie is decent to watch, plus this older HD format is cheap to buy. Not to many titles left for my needs or likes. Worth buying and veiwing.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I love most of her songs she performed on her first 3 CDs, but this selection of songs did not blow my skirt up I think she could or whomever could have chosen more familiar songs. I love musicals but I just didnt like the selections. There are only a few on there that I liked winner takes it all is ok memory also and as long as he needs me and you will never walk alone Wasnt impressed by the duets except for all i ask of you  so out of the 11 songs I only liked 5 of them  Hope her next CD is a little more upbeat because I know she has it in her to perform a much better CD.  I was very disappointed with this particular one. I have the first 3 of hers and will listen to them much more than I will listen to this one. I was so looking forward to her 4th CD but find that it was overrated somewhat.
B009OXS8RQ|3.0|I just got this on vinyl and while its in the same vein as BornToDie and is a companion piece to it, its kinda boring! I do love Ride, American and Gods and Monsters it lacks the original wow feeling i got when i first heard her debut! its not that i dont like it, its just that i didnt obsess over these songs and i did the first set of songs. Its typical Lana sonically but with a bit more cursing for the \\"shock\\" value which doesnt come off as authentic imo. ^ts not badd justg not great!
B0026P3G12|5.0|The first impression is usually the best and that is so how it is with her first CD  I really love all the songs on it and will continue to enjoy it over the years.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I absolutely love this CD, and the best one I have purchased that every song is great on it. This CD is the best I bought in several years.  I listen to her everyday in my car, and never get tired of hearing it. After buying this one, I will have to checkout her earlier CD's, and can't wait for her next one to come out.
0446547646|3.0|Despite the title, I didn't think this was his best book.  I won't be reading it again. Not the best of Nicolas Sparks

B004LWZWGA|5.0|I think this is the best Batman movie - loved the story- very well written and the actors did a great job.  It was a great ending to the trilogy.

0062073192|5.0|This was a great gift for my friend. She absolutely loves Supernatural and having the journal that is filled with John Winchester's entries gives a cool inside look into the show. I recommend it for any Supernatural fan!
0307120007|4.0|My babies have LOVED this book.  I've bought it twice now.  They love interacting with Paul & Judy, but shortly after both purchase, my babies have destroyed the book.  I wish it could have been made more sturdy.
0670824399|4.0|Great reading for kids and adults.  Family fun during reading time. A fun and funny book with great emanation and story line.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Yes vampires are old news but you never saw a former president slaying them! A little slow here and there but on the whole, very entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I do not believe I found this book by accident.<br /><br />It provides, in my opinion, the proof I sought for many years.  I recommend it if you want a glimpse of heaven and to know our loved ones who have passed before us are in a good place.  They are with God, in Heaven.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Unusually large app considering how plain-2d it is.<br /><br />Ran ok on kindle fire hd.<br /><br />It's a free to play where everything has a timer.  I'm getting to the point where every single free to play game like this feels exactly the same.  Build and wait times go into multiple days in no time.<br /><br />I enjoyed smurfs village more... And that's saying something :)

0395389496|5.0|Arrived in MINT condition and it is a true classic. Purchased for my girlfriends son. I'm sure he'll love it for Christmas. I recommend purchasing the DVD and/or BluRay with it.
B000O19EWK|5.0|With the release of TASM this past summer, and fanboys boasting about Andrew Garfield and the reboot, I can't help but remind others of the original Spider-Man movies. This movie and Spider-Man 2 unfortunately have gotten a lot of undeserved hate recently because of the reboot and also because of Spider-Man 3. But not to worry, I'm here to defend this one! I'm not here to rag on the reboot, I actually really liked it but I feel that this one needs the recognition it deserves.<br /><br />This movie really amazed me as a kid because before, I never really cared for superheroes that much especially Spider-Man. But all that disappeared as I watched this in the theater with my Dad. When those opening titles with Danny Elfman's music started, I knew I was in for something special. Even today, I still think this is an awesome movie. Yes some of it does get cheesy, especially with the Green Goblin and the damsel in distress act that Kirsten Dunst keeps playing gets annoying but overall I think this one still holds up.<br /><br />Shy and awkward science nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider and discovers the next day that he has these extraordinary powers such as superhuman strength, \\"spider-sense\\", wall-crawling abilities and the ability to shoot webs out of his wrists. He's so amazed with his newfound powers that he decides to use them to win money and hopefully to impress the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). It's only through the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) that he decides to use his powers to help those in need, and becomes Spider-Man. It gets even tougher when Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) looses his sanity during an experiment at Oscorp and becomes the Green Goblin.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire is outstanding at being the guy who can rarely catch a break, and perfectly embodies the 98 pound weakling becoming a changed man once he becomes a heroic figure. Kirsten Dunst is good and very easy on theeyes as Mary Jane even though the damsel in distress act gets very repetitive at times. Not her fault though. Willem Dafoe always plays a great bad guy, even though his character is over the top. I like how this movie accurately captures the estranged relationship between Norman and Harry much like in the early comics, and how Norman always seemed to favor Peter over Harry. The other actors such as James Franco, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson (RIP) deliver also, especially J.K. Simmons who was perfectly cast as Jameson.<br /><br />The movie looks great and feels like the comic book in a lot of ways, especially since Sam Raimi was a huge fan of the character as a kid, and honors the comics from the 60's and early 70's very well. I never read that many comics before seeing this movie, but now that I have read some I really like how Raimi sticks to the comics in a lot of ways in this movie by bringing a lot of scenes from Amazing Fantasy #15 and \\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" to life even though he made a few changes. The effects are a bit dated, but this came out in 2002 so I can't really fault the movie for that but for me it's still cool to see Spider-Man in action along with Danny Elfman's great score which gives a great Spidey vibe.<br /><br />A lot of fans now hate this movie and the other two to death since the release of the reboot, and honestly I don't see the point in that. Yes the mechanical web-shooters aren't in this version and Gwen Stacy isn't in this either but everybody is always going to put their own spin on the story. I get that the web shooters are an important part of Parker's intelligence, but I don't think it made him stupid. Plus why can't he have the ability to shoot webs out of his wrists?<br /><br />It saddens me to think that this film and the other two are being considered as the \\"Batman & Robin\\" of the Spiderman franchise, and it angers me even more that fanboys will now talk so much trash about the original trilogy's legacy because theygot the reboot they cried & whined for. Sure the series may have lost it's way with Spider-Man 3, but Raimi did great with the first outing, and aced it with 2nd time around. Do people not remember how great this one was? If it wasn't for this movie and the 2nd we wouldn't have TDK trilogy, The Avengers and it's tie-ins or the new Man of Steel which is set for release next year. Heck, we wouldn't even have \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" if it wasn't for this movie. Hopefully some people can watch this again and recognize what makes this a great film and maybe it can get the respect it deserves.<br /><br />Rating: 4.3/5 stars

B0085KGHI6|5.0|I've had a number of video bootlegs of this show in various levels of quality over the years. It traded heavily on VHS in the 80's and 90's under the title &#34;Champagne & Reefer&#34; but the sound and video quality this issue is so far superior to those as to allow me to toss all previous copies. Muddy is just wonderful here. &#34;Pops&#34; was nearing the end of the road and in two short years whould be gone but he still had his mojo working and he shows it off for all to see. Jagger isn't really all that impressive or maybe is just overwhelmed by some truly legendary blues men on this night. Junior Wells and Buddy Guy rip it up and Keith and Ronnie are just having a ball. Lefty Dizz is on fire and while virtually unknown to almost all but hardcore blues fans accords himself very well here.<br />This is an historic document of just one night in the lives of these men but it was one hell of a night and is a must have for any fan of American blues.

B009O07NDY|5.0|I, like many other Tolkien faithful, have been anxiously awaiting this movie. Naturally, it should come as no surprise that I should invest in its soundtrack, especially after the amazing job Howard Shore did in Lord of the Rings. All the familiar notes and chords remain, reminding you that you are indeed back in Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth, but the Hobbit is distinctly its own. Solid and stirring, tranquil and chaotic, all the sounds that we remember combine with the new elements to make an excellent soundtrack. Every fan should have this in their collections, it's as simple as that.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Movie was what I expected it to be.  The graphics were wonderful.  The excitement was great.  I would recommend it to everyone.

B0090YHSFC|4.0|This is one of the most addictive games I've played in a while. It's fun and simple, but gets hard as you progress. When they start introducing the bombs and the walruses, it gets interesting. It's a must-download if you're into games like Fruit Ninja.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great book.  Love Stephen King.  My daughter recommended this book to me.  I remember the day of the Kennedy shooting and have visited the site.  Found the descriptions interesting.

B008G59IBI|3.0|MY REVIEW OF UNO, DOS, AND TRE:<br /><br />After listening to all three installments of Green Day's new \\"trilogy\\" of albums, I am baffled why they thought it was necessary to release ALL of these songs to the public. Throughout the albums, there are great songs that pop up here and there but unfortunately, there is just much more filler and songs that would have been better off as b-sides, bonus tracks, or the new Foxboro Hot Tubs record. If they had taken the absolute best stand-out tracks while including just a minimal amount of filler, they could have ended up with a pretty solid album.<br /><br />There's definitely a hefty handful of solid, catchy jams to be found here!<br />I really like the idea of these songs as a 3-sided album:<br />1. Nuclear Family<br />2. Stay the Night<br />3. Carpe Diem<br />4. Stop When the Red Lights Flash<br />5. Let Yourself Go<br />6. Fell For You<br /><br />7. X-Kid<br />8. Sex, Drugs & Violence<br />9. Little Boy Named Train<br />10. Lazybones<br />11. Ashley<br />12. 99 Revolutions<br /><br />13. Angel Blue<br />14. 8th Avenue Serenade<br />15. Stray Heart<br />16. Sweet 16<br />17. Rusty James<br />18. Oh Love<br /><br />I'm a huge fan and I write this out of love for the band. It is frustrating to hear the potential for a really good, solid album buried amongst a ton of bland mediocrity. Most bands usually write about 30 or 40 songs for an album but there's a reason why they don't actually release all of it - Most of it simply isn't that good!<br /><br />Quantity doesn't always equal quality. Just one release of good songs would have been fine with me.

B005LAIIPS|4.0|Upon seeing the trailer online back in the Summer, when the film was 1st in theaters, I was hyped-up. As a fan of the Bourne Trilogy since the 1st film (The Bourne Identity) in 2002, & as a collector of the films, I knew that I'd purchase it as soon as it was released. There are enough reviews regarding the plot of this film, so I'll leave that out. When the release date was announced on Amazon.com, I Pre-Ordered the DVD (w/out having seen the picture). I was especially excited that Edward Norton was added to the cast as Ret. USAF Col. Eric Byer, who happens to be the film's primary antagonist. Norton rarely portrays villans, so I was looking forward to his performance. 2ndly, I was thrilled that for the sake of continuity, Joan Allen (Pam Landy), David Stratharian (Noah Vosen), Scott Glenn (Ezra Kramer), & Albert Finney (Dr. Albert Hirsch) were cast in this film! Sadly to say, the amount of screen time that these 4 great actors (& characters) recieve amounts barley to cameo appearances. Heck, Finney's main scene was deleted & can only be viewed on the Deleted Scenes Special Feature! As for Jeremy Renner, his role as Aaron Cross is quite good, given the script that Renner was given. All-in-all, I was a little let-down by the film as a whole. It didn't have the Bourne film \\"feel\\" that the 1st 3 had, & felt more like a stand-alone picture. Although Director Tony Gilroy tried to attach a sense of continuity by bringing back actors/characters from the original trilogy, they didn't have nearly enough screen time to make it stick! In my opinion, the film's saving grace-Edward Norton! As 'Ric Byer, he's as ruthless, cold-blooded, & mechanical as ever & you can see that Norton loved playing the part. Any film buff should know that Norton is an extremley versatile actor. It is really cool to see him play the main antagonist-a role that he really hasn't done before (unless you count \\"Primal Fear\\", \\"American HistoryX\\", or \\"The Score\\"--but those were different types of antagonistic roles than this 1). If you're a Bourne fan, I will say that it's worth a look-but BUYING it, that's for Bourne film COLLECTORS only!stic roles than this 1). If you're a Bourne fan, I will say that it's worth a look-but BUYING it, that's for Bourne film COLLECTORS only!

B005I4JG80|5.0|I love this book. The writing style is funny and engaging. About half of the learnings in this book are actionable for an American mom. The other half require French cultural immersion.
B003L77G6K|5.0|Just finished watching the last episode and the series just keeps getting better. Excellent visual quality as you would expect from BluRay. Now to start Season 5.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book. It is very unique in its story telling and is definatly a page turner! It is sad though and doesnt really have a happy ending for those of you who prefer that
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I've yet to see an episode where I didn't bust out laughing at least once and for most my sides are aching before it is through. The visual quality of the BluRay is outstanding.
1475143389|5.0|As a physician, I am skeptical of most body building books.  Most are based on anecdotal evidence or meant to sell a specific product or service and are not based on good scientific research.  However, this one is different.  It recommends proven muscle building techniques that are backed up by decades of research.  I have confirmed almost all the recommended techniques from secondary sources such as the American Academy of Sports Medicine and individual research papers from peer-reviewed journals.  This author has no other motivation except to help you reach you full potential.<br /><br />The author reveals all the \\"secrets\\" of weightlifting in a easy to read and entertaining style.  It's focus on compound exercises with heavy weight is 100% correct.  After reading this book, I can't help but laugh at all the other people I see in the gym wasting their time with worthless routines.  As they make no gains, I come back every few weeks with new lbs of muscle.<br /><br />You won't waste time in the gym with these simple and efficient workouts. Also, provides a great nutrition plan for maximizing your results.  I highly recommend this book to a beginner or intermediate weightlifter.
1451695195|5.0|This is by far one of the best books on this subject. It is truly groundbreaking because of the length of time spent in an essentially brain dead state and the fact that the author is also a neurosurgeon. Beautifully written and life changing.  Many of the insights he has gained in his basically short but intense experience can be attained by deep prayer and meditation over many years. Read this book.

B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Quite enjoyable.  No problems with zoom or losing progress for me.  The quest was fun too.  Not sure about replay value but we'll see.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|1.. Sure, zombies are cool, and I like the show because I can imagine myself among the people trying, scrapping, clawing to stay alive.<br /><br />2.  I HATE the thousands of shows nowdays solely centered on over-the-top dysfunctional people.  If Shane was still around I think I would be gone, because he acts like a crack head, and Rick never checked him - until the MUCH needed end.  Shane was so malicious at the end, it would seem completely unrealistic that Shane and Rick were formerly best friends, or even great friends.
0385363133|4.0|A veryGood read.  Very suspencful and it activates the senses as you read the book. Great characters and story line. It could happen in real life.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|this is the best of sacha baron cohen's movies, in part because it was his first endeavor using all actors!  Awesome fun
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This is a really fun game. It shoots where you want and keeps it fun. However it keeps crashing so bad that it restarts my phone. I tried things to work around it but it kept  happening. If they can fix it it is worth playing.  Otherwise don't waste your time.
0593070631|5.0|Came 3 weeks before it was supposed to, which is bitchin' because I'm going to watch it on my flight to England this month!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|super fun... additive ;) can't put it down.. my 5 yr old loves it too. this is a game id actually pay for. graphics are good
B009DKCBM8|5.0|I am a huge Neil Young fan.  I was a little leary of getting this, because his last album hasn't sunk in yet and I've only given it one listen.<br />But this one... I love it!<br />The visuals on it are stunning!  The kaleidscope with the camera during the guitar breaks, interlaced with old archived footage during the lyrics...<br />Not only do you get an album with a visual art track, but you get a game too!!!<br />Trying to figure out what the heck you're looking at!<br />It's great!  It's fun!<br />TWO <whack> TWO <whack> TWO products in one!<br />I LOVE Neil Young's humor!<br />2 thumbs up Neil!<br />I loved cranking up my Stratocaster to the Greendale DVD and just playing along with it.  A pure pleasure.<br />And I think this one is going to be the same way!
B002GYI96U|4.0|A really Fun book! Lots of surprises around every corner. A sweet, romantic and fun novel. A nice easy read.
0446554995|5.0|I love the Pendergast book series and hope that Preston & Child continue on writing this magnificent adventure series.  This book I pre-ordered and it has not been received as yet.  But I am sure I will enjoy it as I have done all the Pendergast books.  Something tells me by the title &#34;Two Graves&#34; that this might be the last of the Pendergast series.  That will be a shame.
B003O86FMW|5.0|READ NOW! I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GOOD THIS FREAKING BOOK IS! CAN'T PUT IT DOWN! THIS BOOK IS NOT OVERRATED AT ALL!
B00170DEM8|2.0|Soooooo glad they remade this! The best part was being able to see other angles of the White Christmas set.
B003Y5H574|5.0|It was New, a Great Movie,  and Arrived within 2 days. Can't ask for much more! :) If you haven<br />'t seen it, watch it!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I thought without Matt the movie would flop. I'm glad I decided to watch it. I was not disappointed. Awesome action!

B000021Y77|5.0|For not generally being a fan of foreign films with subtitles, this was fantastic.  Great perspectives when shooting the film.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|great game to play to pass sometime...I usually play it when I'm in bed getting ready to go to sleep.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Quickly downloads videos from youtube and searching is easy. I find it easy to navigate and easy to use. Gets my Thumbs Up!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great book. It is nice to read the true story of what happened on that day without all of the PC we get from everyone else.  It is always nice to get a little insight into how the Seals function.  These are some of our finest warriors and certainly deserve our respect and admiration.
B008458O3S|4.0|This is a great puzzler. It starts out very easy and becomes harder. Eventually it takes some thinking to figure out the right pathways.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Easy to play. Good storyline with very nice graphics. Played on my Kindle Fire with no problems. HO games fairly easy to complete. Built in strategy guide if you really get stuck. Another great. Alawar game! !!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a great game. Most objects easy to find but where to use them THAT is the question. Requires thinking.
B008S0IJAM|5.0|I'd heard bits and pieces from Aimee's solo career over the past decade, and finally committed to buying this album. (I guess some artists just take time to sink in.)<br /><br />Aimee is a fantastic storyteller; like my favorite songwriters, she can inhabit a character and let that person tell his or her tale, within 3-5 minutes before moving on to the next one.<br /><br />Her music wrings about all it can from the fairly standard pop melody verse-chorus-verse-bridge-verse-chorus structure; the music may feel familiar, but I mean that in the most complimentary way imaginable.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to tell longtime fans, since I really don't have a lot of album-length experience with her work (I'm going back to her debut release to start catching up), but if you're new to Aimee and you love your singer-songwriters sharp-witted and eager-to-please, musically, get it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Plays well and not that hard to see. My old eyes were able to play it quite easily. Good story line also.
030726999X|5.0|ANOTHER SERIES THAT WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN.  I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH AND WANTED IT TO CONTINUE.  WORTH THE MONEY FOE THE SERIES
B004EPYZUI|4.0|The sum of the parts don't quite add up but if one makes allowances, and I did, then the parts of the movie can be unabashedly enjoyed.<br /><br />With a bit more time and effort the Extended Cut could have fleshed out the part of Dr. Gorski a bit more and thus tied things together. Imo.<br /><br />Dr. Gorski's desire to help the girls through their dancing is strongly suggestive of something very special but, perhaps due to time and narrative constraints, leaves the viewer to connect, through conjecture, some very widely spaced out dots.<br /><br />In my mind I think of something similar, in effect, to \\"tiersian therapy\\"* as having gone on. (*Might be worth a google search.)<br /><br />Obviously, copyright issues could be involved also but in my minds eye I can see Dr. Gorski finding in Baby Doll a transcendent candidate (\\"the one\\") for this actual therapy. A candidate who explodes its boundaries and finds a measure of true liberation.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm too critical and my desire for a more fleshed out explanation is just because of my semi-extensive reading of the SF genre.<br /><br />I do see Zack Snyder as strongly suggesting something along the lines I mention, perhaps that's enough on its own.
034580404X|5.0|HAD A HARD TIME LAYING IT DOWN WONDERFUL AND WISHED IT COULD GO ON FOREVER!!!!  WORTH THE MONEY AND JUST A WONDERFUL SERIES!!!
B004G600A4|5.0|The kids love this movie!  I really love it myself actually. Really wonderful family show to sit down and watch together.

B009MF56GC|2.0|I don't like Ultraviolet!! You have to open an account with them to get you digital copy!! The movie was awesome !!
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Starts off slow and gets worse from there.<br />Starts off with the character going from one place to another in Alaska seemingly on a training exercise. The journy is less believable as he progresses. Of course there is some incident that turns him against his organization and the stroy trots along with him trying to stay alive while getting to the next phase in the story, which is in the Philippines. After a few close calls everything works out just fine, as predicted.<br /><br />They mention Jason Borne a few times in the movie and bring back Pam Landy just to make the connection to the original series.<br /><br />Overall a 2 thumbs down.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|ok it was great great great,the best best great the best best ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
B0063IH60K|5.0|Keeps me busy when I'm waiting for things to get done. Love the game and the features. Plus it's free!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|The story and the production of the movie is just great. The actors did a wonderful job and I finially got to see Master Chief live, I was so impress.  I strongly recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed the series.  I initiallty thought these were books for kids/teenagers.  But they are very entertaining for adults as well.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Beautiful graphics and nice variability  in the puzzles. Not to hard fun and relaxing.  Would play more of this company's games.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My 3 1/2 year old grandson loves Angry Birds so I ordered Bad Piggies for him. When I saw it I was afraid it would be too difficult for him but I was wrong. He loves it and we share the the play with discussions about strategies, outcomes and what we can do better. Best of all we share a lot of laughs.
B00866JL96|5.0|Despite a couple of pretty graphic/suggestive sex scenes in this movie between a couple not married, this movie was not only a great portrayal of some great elements of love (like the way Efron's character, Logan, really strove to protect and take care of BOTH the woman he loved (Beth, played by Taylor Schilling) AND her son.  I liked the way there seemed to be a great desire and effort on BOTH characters' parts to be completely honest with each other, as well as the value that the movie seemed to place on communicating about \\"trust\\" issues and how to mend things when trust seemed to be violated.  Because of the pretty explicit AND non-married sex scenes, I would not let my kids (under about age 16) watch it, and then, only if we discussed GOD'S design and view for sex, as opposed to what was shown in the movie).
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I logged into my facebook account then it wouldn't. load.......... don't get the app unless you want to reload it again......
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|There are two types of task in the game:  find the differences between two pictures or find objects in the room by either a silhouette or by their name.  There are 21 levels of this.  It gets boring quickly.  Occasionally, there are some low challenge side games like solving a puzzle by rotating pieces that are already in place or sliding pieces into place that are already properly rotated or matching pairs, but they are not challenging at all.  On the positive side, the game works well on Toshiba thrive.  Not sure what age group this game is targeted at, but I'd regret if I'd payed for it.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Great series once you get into it.  KMM has a very smooth writing technique that keeps you guessing.  At times it was hard to put the book down.
0307744434|3.0|A little far out..not enough character development..overboard on the illusions for me.  For a first novel, the author really came up with a fantastic journey.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|I had been looking for this DVD but couldn't remember it's title. Once Amazon showed it, I knew I had to get it. I love these movies with real life saving events.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just as in the previous stories in this series, the action is non-stop and the mythology is flying. I have to say, even though I was giving Jason and Piper a chance, Percy is still my favorite hero and Annabeth my favorite heroine. It may have to do with my long-time admiration for the Perseus story and the goddess Athena, and my not-much-fondness for the personality of the original Jason or the goddess Venus. Leo, however, is the best of the New Rome heroes to be added.<br /><br />I eagerly await the next installment. Can't believe I have to wait another year!
B001JRB16U|5.0|I had seen this many times when I was younger.  In our family we had 8 children, my grandmother she would take one child at a time to see this movie at the theaters no matter how many times she would see it. It was a fabulous movie. A great movie of family life and how things can change.  It was hilarious too. Especially with Dick Van Dyke in it.
1419705849|5.0|My 7 year old grandson read the entire book in 1 sitting.  Be loved it.  Can't wait for the next one.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie to all of our friends, hang on to your seat it will have you jumping
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a ok book. I will continue to read the series hope for more in the next book.I keep having comparing to fifty shades somewhat just cant help it.Still a great book & storyline.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|What an outstanding movie. The graphics are just as amazing as the story. No filler. Never a dull moment. This was an edge of your seat joy ride in the comfort of your own home. If it is  your selection for date night or family night this choice will be a winner.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book! So much so, that my husband is wanting to read it now,! Can't wait to read the next two books!
B009DJB9HC|4.0|Was familiar with BCC previously and know Glenn Hughes,Jason Bonham & Derek Sherinian but never had the urge to purchase their music until this one and perhaps their last...Will go back and purchase their first two efforts.As for this one,it is strong from beginning to end...Modern type rockers with that classic feel...Nothing much else to say,but if you like straight,in your face rock,this is for you...  Aloha!!!!
B008220C38|2.0|I went to see the Keira Knightley/Jude Law version of this Tolstoi masterpiece with the highest expectations; after half an hour, I was ready to walk out because the artificial staging and screenplay were so terrible.  Aside from Vronksky, who was totally miscast and unbelievable, the acting was adequate, though unexceptional.  The staging, which at first interested me, downplayed the character motivations, and it made Anna's and Karenin's actions unbelievable.  The entire movie came across as choppy, unedited, and eccentric.  I also expected a more lush rendition, considering it was Imperial Russia, and that also disappointed. There was no grandeur here and no grand scenes.  I would recommend that anyone interested in the novel see the great Vivien Leigh/Ralph Richardson version instead, where Anna's death is so beautifully portrayed.  Even the Garbo version was better than this melange of jarring scenes. The movie was a waste of both my time and my money. I gave this movie only two stars because the novel is so great; otherwise, I would have just given it one as I hated how this novel was butchered in the name of \\"artistry.\\"
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille is my all time favorite.  I love the character John Corey and laugh out loud as I am reading it.  Both mine and my husband's favorite!

Now tell me who would want a DVD in Blue Ray in Black and White. Highly Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!would like a return but it would probably cost more to returned that what it is worth..........<br /><br />Lillllly42@aol.com
044654759X|5.0|I was surprised how much I loved this book. I wasn't sure about it but wanted to read it before the movie came out. If you love Nicholas Sparks you'll love this book. But if you really don't like chick lit novels then this is not for you, but it is very well written.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Before ordering this, i did compare on other backpacks also. But none of the backpacks suits for me other than this one.<br /><br />I was looking for a good backpack not only for my laptop it should be comfort while travelling as well.<br /><br />This guy makes me feel good and comfort with my laptop and other accessories while travelling. Meanwhile worth to spend money on this.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I never been into Hawaii Five-O before but I really grew to love it. My grandmother is Hawaiian so this makes me think of her. I really love this show.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that the game is great because the levels change in hardness each time you buy a game in each catagory.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|It would help if REM would organize the songs into the titular categories i.e.,  Which songs are Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, and Part Garbage?
B00110K62U|5.0|The performance was wonderful and well produced and directed, the story line was very close to the novel by Hugo..
1426308469|5.0|There's a photo of a Velociraptor in this book but they call it something else.  Was &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; lying to us?  Otherwise this book is a gem of information.  I never realized there were so many dinosaurs!  But, sadly, they left out &#34;Dino&#34; from &#34;The Flintstones&#34;.  But happily, I didn't see any early humans among the dinosaurs so this book isn't some religious fantasy story.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album is far removed from her first album and has a completely unique sound.  All of the songs have a different feel and are well produced with a definite presence of emotion in each song.  No filler music as each song is enjoyable to play through.  Great pickup!
B008KE3960|4.0|fun from the gate, but once you figure the patterns just watch, it gets a bit boring : ) oh well round & round we go.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is one of the best hidden-object / mystery games I have played. The aesthetic is too creepy and dark, like we need more of that in our lives right now, but overall I like the mixture of logic and strategy it takes to solve this puzzle.  Play in expert mode unless this is your first of these kind of games.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This story ties in themes like the power of ideas, the thin boundary between thought and reality, and the construction of identity through perception, while balancing the cerebral with incredible imagery and consistent action that would entertain any action fan. When warping reality, blu-ray is always a good choice.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I bought this movie so my son could watch on his new Kindle HD Fire.  I love that you can store it either on the device or in the cloud.  It is a great movie and he loves it too.  He loves there are so many super heroes in one movie.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|my only complaint is that when I trying to touch something it sometimes hits the wrong thing. oh and it is also not always clear about what your looking for
B003L77FYS|5.0|What a well thought out, written show. I love the attention to detail and storyline development.<br />This has become my absolute favorite series ever!
B0063M22QO|3.0|I enjoy the game but it is a little slow. I do enjoy the challenge to my memory which is great at any age!
B001NAT05W|1.0|what a colossally huge waste of time. one of the worst movies I've ever seen. halle berry can't act - her best scenes are the topless ones .. too bad there are no topless scenes in this movie
B003O86FMW|4.0|Once again I thought I knew what to expect but it didn't disappoint. Look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|It nice Paul did these classics. It nice to listen & these types of songs that I otherwise wouldn't have tried to learn to play.
0061733199|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, not sure if it was what I was looking for, turns out to be a great buy and a must read for the serious adventurer in all of us.
0425264351|4.0|Killing Floor Review<br /><br />No spoilers in this review...<br /><br />This book came recommended by a coworker who is also an avid fiction reader. It was my first Lee Child book. I read it at about the same time trailers started for the new Tom Cruise movie. Although this book is not the movie based story, I always enjoy reading a book before watching the movie. The movie is based on One Shot, Child's ninth Jack Reacher story.<br /><br />Why I enjoyed the book:<br /><br />The book is written in first person. I love my first person shooter games and a book written in this format makes me feel like I'm looking over the main character's shoulder. I only see what he sees (more or less). It's a wonderful way to capture a story and scene (much like how we experience our own life's stories).<br /><br />Chapters are short 10-20 pages (in mass-market paperback size). There are also breaks every 2-4 pages which allow me to read in small increments when I don't have much time but want to keep up a steady pace. I hate to put down a book in the middle of a scene and get frustrated with authors who never put breaks in their writing to let you know that scene has ended and now begins a new scene.<br /><br />The main character is my ideal protagonist: He/she must be strong, fearless, intelligent, witty, and of course a highly skilled killer.<br /><br />The character uses deductive reasoning when evaluating a scene or interaction with another character. Although I think some of his deductions are a little far fetched. E.g. the method he uses in Chapter 31 to find a certain character in a certain hotel. I glaze over those few instances and admire the others.<br /><br />I learned something by reading it. Whether any of it is true or not, I think I learned quite a lot about US currency and counterfeiting. I also learned some useful hand-to-hand combat techniques. When choking a man from behind you ball up your fingers and apply pressure with your knuckles, not your fingers. Read Chapter 7 and you'll understand.<br /><br />It had excellent dialogue. Nothing anyone said felt out of place or just inserted to progress the plot.<br /><br />Everything including the characters and places/locations were easily visualized based on the descriptions and my own imagination. I could see every scene in my own mind. That's very important for me to get engaged in the scene.<br /><br />Terrific action scenes involving fighting, shooting, and driving. The ending has a grandiose climax of action and visuals.<br /><br />I will definitely read the next Jack Reacher novel in sequence.<br /><br />My previous read: The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest. The trilogy is maybe the best I've ever read.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|very entertaining game! has great hidden objects and puzzle games that are not too hard therefore it is fun and relaxing!
030758836X|4.0|This was one of the few novels that I can remember that kept me on edge. My sympathies changed depending on where I was in the book, which I found to be quite enjoyable. All in all it was a very solid novel with complex characters and story lines.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is amazingly usefulfor keeping track of all the things. I use it daily for keeping all my thoughts together.
0740745271|5.0|Relaxing and therapeutic for the eyes, even the whole body/mind, like looking into another world.... I really like the 'Tranquility' photo.... looks and feels like I'm on another planet where no one has gone before...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer. An okay read, but slow unfolding and not very gripping. Didn't find it up to Grisham's earlier books.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This novel was one of the best I've read in a recent years. 11/22/63--that date has been in the back of the American subconscious since that infamous day, and I think King pulls off that concept quite well. I knew as I was reading it, and this was confirmed as I scoured the negative amazon reviews, that some readers would be disappointed in the fact that this novel treats that date--11/22/63--just as I described it above: something that is always there in the back of the mind.<br /><br />King doesn't take 800 pages to describe the JFK assassination. In fact, it only directly shows up very briefly. But that isn't the point. The point is, that date, like many of the other infamous dates in American history, the watershed moments like 12/7/41 or 9/11/01...and so on, are always there in your mind, sometimes on the surface, sometimes below, but still always there.<br /><br />Jake steps through the portal to 1958, 5 years before the assassination. He has to live 5 years in the past before he can hope to change the event. But it is always on his mind, controlling his actions. He makes a life for himself back there, but that dreaded date is always there, always haunting him.<br /><br />This is a great novel that really has a lot to offer. And like I said before, those who complained this novel didn't detail Oswald's heinous crime in 800 pages kind of missed the point.
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|I have been a Lego fan all my life, my son's life, and now my grandson. I now have serious reservations about that continued loyality.

B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Not bad if you take your time.  Some items are very small and well hidden.  Small android devices may be harder to see detail.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you sucked in by all the detail, action and drama as the story unfolds. If you enjoyed the movie you will love the book even more.
B004G6VQDE|5.0|This is a gift for my son who likes to read all types of books.  He seems to really like this book!  Quick delivery!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I watch a pretty fair amount of movies, and now even have Netflix. I was recently given Ironman I and II as a gift. I would say those two movies surpass this movie, but this one was still good. This was a good buy, just not the best I have ever purchased. Action is good, characters are good, quality is good, but story was not quite as good as the Ironman movies. I still recommend it though.
0345803507|3.0|Like the second book, the third is much better than the first in my opinion. I enjoyed the action parts of the plot where we learn more about Ana's crazy ex-boss.  I thought this was a nice twist.  We also learn a ton more about Christian's past and the abuse and neglect her endured.  I can understand why a million female readers everywhere could read this and decide that Christian is amazing and worth overlooking his many dominating and controlling tendencies.  I however am not one of those women.  He still was too over the top.  He decides to buy the company Ana works for and turns it over for her to run.  Ana puts up a rather brief episode of anger and \\"oh, I am not ready to run a business\\" abut soon agrees to please Christian.  You know that if I worked at that company, I would have serious problems with an Intern coming in at ground level and within a month or two being owner and president of the company all because her rich husband decides it should be so.  One other thing later in the book grossed me out. Lets just say it was a comment Ana made after sex about her soon to be born child.  Icky! Oh good grief.  Now for the positive.  I loved the chapter at the end of the book about Christian's first Christmas with his adopted family, the Grays.  It was adorable and a very good insight into this scared and damaged little boy.  If you have made it through the first two novels, you might as well see how the story unfolds by reading \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\".
B002BSHXJA|4.0|In 2009, I bought the Beatles' stereo remasters box set on the day of release. I briefly considered buying the mono box set instead, as it had been hailed by critics as \\"the way the Beatles intended their music to sound\\" and was supposed to be a limited release. But I chose the stereo box because the stereo catalog is now considered \\"standard\\" and the box set included all of the band's album (Abbey Road, Let It Be, and Yellow Submarine are only available in stereo). I'm glad I chose the stereo remasters. They turned out to be very nice.<br /><br />Earlier this year, after reading the rapturous reviews on this site, I decided to purchase the mono mixes. Overall, I would say the box set is good, but has not lived up to the hype surrounding it. I own a good sound system and I'm a musician, so I consider myself to have an ear for music (though I'm not audiophile). I found the mono mixes to be interesting, and often times better than the stereo mixes, but ultimately not a life-changing revelation. If you're intrigued, definitely go ahead and buy them. Certain parts of the music have more punch. But if you're very much on the fence about this purchase, maybe you should hold onto your money (or put it towards the stereo mixes if you don't have them). Here's how I rank the albums:<br /><br />BETTER IN MONO<br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<br />The Beatles (White Album)<br />Please Please Me<br /><br />TOSS UP (it often depends on the song)<br />With the Beatles<br />Revolver<br />Magical Mystery Tour<br />Rubber Soul (it has a very good sound in mono, but I also like the more detailed guitar work that can be heard in the stereo version)<br /><br />BETTER IN STEREO<br />A Hard Day's Night<br />Beatles for Sale<br />Help!<br /><br />Sgt. Peppers is great in mono because you hear all the effects Geoff Emerick, George Martin, and the band wanted to put on the record, many of which are absent on the stereo version. You can tell the mono was treated with a lot of care.Also, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" was like an entirely new experience as it played at a different speed. I could really appreciate the beauty of the song like never before. That being said, I think you hear some of the guitar work better in stereo (which makes sense because you hear better detail in stereo) and \\"A Day in the Life\\" is also better as a stereo version.<br /><br />Probably the most unexpected treat of the mono set, though, was the White Album. Its pleasant sound surprised me because the Beatles were on the verge of releasing all subsequent records exclusively in stereo, and I didn't see many reviewers laud the White Album in mono like they did with others. But with a few exceptions (notably \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"), I think the album sounds better in mono. Somehow it is much \\"warmer\\" and more cohesive. In stereo, it sounds like so many disparate elements are coming together and the music practically mimics the disunity and tension that was occurring within the band at the time. The mono just \\"feels\\" so much better to me. It came across as warm and pleasant, words I would not necessarily associate with the White Album prior to hearing it in mono. If every Beatles album was such an improvement in mono, I would be more enthusiastic in my praise of the box set.<br /><br />Once again, I find the mono set interesting and well-done. But it's probably not as \\"necessary\\" as I originally thought. As the title of my review says, it's interesting but not essential.
1451695195|3.0|It was a decent read, but methinks the title over reaches. I'd love to believe that everything he writes is true and settles the question of where we are going next, but the fact remains that medical science is still at a loss about fully understanding the human brain. While the evidence seems compelling, there is just no way to know if it wasn't all just happening somewhere in his head; occurring in some part of the brain that science still doesn't understand.<br /><br />Now combine that with the fact that he doesn't reveal anything that even resembles an ah-ha moment. In fact, as one reads his descriptions of the places he 'traveled' to, one is reminded of any one of several movies that have depicted similar scenes and details of what life looks like on the 'other side.'<br /><br />I was annoyed by how the story jumps around, and spends most of it's time on what his family and friends were doing. (Plan on skimming over much of this Lifetime TV movie stuff--two thirds of the book--if you're reading this in search of answers.)Then, most annoyingly, he never really gets to the several bombshell revelations he promises to reveal later in his story--save one.  And while that one is interesting, well. . . I would love to point out my specific problems in detail, but I'm not one to spoil anyone's reading experience.<br /><br />If you enjoy made for TV movies, and/or already have a solid Judeo-Christian faith based mindset, then you will probably think it all a wonderful story or confirmation. If not, the few fuzzy, and all too short, details are not compelling enough, to my mind, to move one to such faith, or prove anything beyond a miraculous recovery from an insidious disease. And that, for me, was a huge disappointment.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Not only is \\"Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2\\" the best movie so far. It is the absolute best of the soundtracks.  With a whole new lineup of bands like Passion Pit, Feist and The Boom Circuits you can't go wrong.
6304498969|5.0|I'm a guitar player, and I bought this in hopes of seeing exactly how Eric plays these arrangements and to try to separate what he plays from what the second guitarist does. I was not disappointed! The camera angles allow you to quickly identify exactly what is being played and by whom. Providing that you are advanced enough, as a player, you cannot find a better tutorial!<br /><br />For all you non-picking Clapton fans, this performance is not to be missed. And if you have good audio for your DVD playback, or surround sound, you will be amazed at the quality, and feel as if Eric in the room with you. I could have used a few more stars!
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I have four words for you: Erebor, Thranduil, Rivendell, and Elrond. (In order of appearance, of course!)<br /><br />This movie was absolutely gorgeous. Costumes, effects, design, everything was amazing. The Radagast sections didn't need to be quite so long but I do appreciate that PJ's trying to get the Dol Goldur/Necromancer bits in. Similarly, Galadriel's comments about Angmar and Rhudaur probably will be incomprehensible to the average watcher but they do hold a deeper significance. (Elrond's 'watchful peace' comment, anyone?)<br /><br />You can tell where the scenes slow a bit - in a more 'taking our sweet time telling the story' fashion - but it does take some energy from the Lord of the Rings in its battle scenes. It is a fresher, younger look at the world of Middle-Earth between Morgoth and Sauron and the environments and attitudes of the characters reflect that. Each dwarf manages to be unique (Bofur turned out to be my favorite, honestly, for his frank oddness) and makes an impact, and McKellen and Freeman are fantastic. There's a very Arthur Dent air about Bilbo, but it works wonderfully.<br /><br />I hadn't expected Thranduil in this movie, so his appearance nearly sent me into a faint.<br /><br />This is a MUST SEE.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|This was a great package. I was surprised to find a CD and a DVD in this package. And, both are masterfully put together. Loved this CD. And I love Leonard Cohen for his heart, his voice, his words, and his great and generous spirit. It all shows up in this package.
0446580848|4.0|The John Carey character is always entertaining.  Great sarcasm.  The story line did seem to get a little repetative, but I always enjoy his work.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|This book has been reviewed ad nauseam (with PKD roiling in his grave, mumbling \\"just enjoy the story you dolt!\\" And Mr. Vonnegut rejoining \\"here, here you nincompoops!\\") so I am reviewing the kindle version, not the actual story.<br /><br />The reason why I'm giving it three stars is that in the electronic version there are parts where the book has a note saying \\"666 underlined...\\" Thank you Mercer, but I don't care what 666 others in the fused collective thought they should underline, especially since 665 others before them had done the same, and do to maintain the facade of not being a chickenhead underline the same tired passages. This option should be turned OFF as the default and later if I want to see if I'm still hip and connected I can dial in to see if I underlined the same crap as everyone else. I suspect they are doing the same with other books as well, and if this option is not turned off I'll be throwing my empathy box out and will stick to paper versions of books where I'll at least be expecting my used (not new) books to have someone else's drivel on the pages, whereas I was only expecting PKD's drivel here as he's the only author listed on this electronic version.<br /><br />UPDATE: after talking with amazon.com, it seems the problems needs a \\"work around\\" (their words), though they never were able to figure it out (the problem actually got worse as I worked with them on it). It doesn't seem to be a prevalent problem with all digital copies though, and you might not have this issue, so hopefully they can figure out what's going on and send a patch in the next updates to resolve the issue.

0470932139|3.0|Despite the majority of rave reviews, I am going to post a contrarian view. First, to describe my level of photography, I have shot about 70 weddings and events, some portraits and of course a lot of pictures for personal use. So I'm not a pro, but more than a hobbyist.<br /><br />On to the review. The book describes a lot of very basic photography concepts like depth of field, rule of thirds, etc. If this is the type of information you're looking for, I would recommend a straight photography book, which might provide a better foundation for the fundamentals of photography and lighting.<br /><br />Second, composition is the extent of guidance on how to shoot food. I would have liked to see more food stylist tips like crushing aspirin in champagne to intensify the bubbles or substituting heavy cream for milk (photographs richer). To me, and this is just personal opinion, the shots look like still lifes and lacked that mouth-watering wow factor.<br /><br />The book is well written and laid out nicely. The information just didn't quite hit the mark for me.

B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I must admit I had my doubts when I rented this video \\"I Am Number Four\\", but no doubts remain anymore! This is an excellent, well put together action, thriller, suspense movie, it is all in there even special effects! I am like a lot of others who have done reviews on this, I hope they make several sequels!! Love the Beagle dog, #6, and Sam, in this, watch it, you will see what I mean! If you like aliens, and people with super-powers in movies, you will like this!
B009LROCJI|5.0|This is a beautiful reinterpretation of an old war horse.  As beautiful as it is, the original has been so overplayed as to become elevator music.  This reminds me of how fine it is.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I got Bean's Quest as a Free App of the Day, but after playing, I would have no problems paying for it.  It is a fun, retro-style platform game with a great 8-bit soundtrack and enjoyable, although tough, gameplay.  Controls are simple, as you only direct Bean left or right with on-screen touches; Bean constantly bounces up and down, and it is the combination of his jumps and your guidance that moves him throughout the levels.  Stages become progressively difficult, but the controls are responsive and up to the task.  For completionists, each stage has three level-specific goals (i.e. find the hidden collectible) that will keep you playing for hours.<br /><br />If you enjoy old-school gaming that is both tough and rewarding, definitly check this app out.  It is worth the price of admission.
1936891026|3.0|This is kind of a bootcamp, bootstrap kind of exhortation to put your butt on the chair and do the work.  It could well be quite useful for someone needing that.  The last chapter is pure new agey align-yourself-with-angels, if you like that kind of stuff.  What I objected to was something Pressifeld mentions several times, the idea that if you get to work meaningfully there's a good chance if you have cancer it will go into remission.  Which ignores the facts -- what about Christopher Hitchens, Susan Sontag, Alexander Cockburn, to name a few who worked hard all their lives in extraordinarily productive fashion and worked until the very last, and who still died of cancer?  Or someone like Tony Judt, with Lou Gehrig's disease, who also worked all his life up until the end, even though almost complete paralysis.  The moralistic tone and premise of Pressfield's that it is shirking from what you should be doing that leads to illness seems to me quite wrong.
B003L16FAE|3.0|I just bought this BR from Walmart in a discount bin for $8. I also own the DVD so for this price you can't go wrong. I read all  the reviews for the BR but I still love the movie. The extras are great to watch.

0756697875|5.0|My 7 yr old son loves this book. He has recently become a batman fan. He reads and looks at this book everyday. The only bad thing about this book and him being so young is they have pictures and listing of older lego sets. Showing all batman Legos that have been made and that is great if you are not a 7 yr old that does not understand completely these sets are not able to be bought because they are no longer made and are collectors items now.  Other wise the book is fantastic!
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This movie is boring. None of the characters are worth spending 2 hours with. The story is your usual rambling Seth McFarlane script with no real plot but lots of empty cultural references that have nothing to do with the story or the scene. No one evolves. Nothing happens. While this works fine for a 22 minute episode, it gets incredibly old starting around minute 23.<br /><br />On the plus side, the animation of the bear is incredible. The texture and integration within the scenes is perfect. Too bad they didn't spend as much time on the story as they did on animating the bear.<br /><br />If you love fart jokes, a rambling plot, one-dimensional characters and a well animated teddy bear, the is the movie for you.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is so much fun! I'm not usually a Will Farrell fan, but this one is great! Highly recommend it for all audiences.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|In my opinion it is hard to say anything less than superlative about GENERATION KILL.  This three CD set is a definite GO-TO when I need an action thriller, second, so far, only to the Bourne Trilogy.<br /><br />Marines of the First Recon Battalion arrive in Iraq in 2003 and I will not tell you anything about the plot.  Suffice it to say that you are embedded with these Marines in every respect and your physical presence is in the lead Hum-V in the person of a reporter from Rolling Stone Magazine.<br /><br />Each member of this team is unique and the casting could not have been better.<br /><br />Do not sit down to watch GENERATION KILL thinking that you'll see one or two chapters a night.  Forget that.  You will compulsively watch all seven chapters with an annoying need to know if certain individuals will get what's coming to them.<br /><br />Among other feelings you will be pissed-off and glad that your tour is over.  When the First Recon Marines go home, you will go to bed happy that you are out of Iraq.
1400052181|5.0|I read a lot and this is one of the best books I have read in a while. It was well written and entertaining to read.
0380820498|3.0|\\"Wednesday's Child\\" is the sixth book in the Inspector Adam Banks detective series by Peter Robinson.<br /><br />Seven-year-old Gemma is kidnapped from her home, willingly given away by her confused mother to a well-dressed and well-spoken couple who claimed to be social workers. A couple of days later, the body of a young man is found in the ruins of an old lead mine. Two seemingly unrelated cases which (surprise!) converge into one intricate case for our dear Inspector Banks.<br /><br />Except Banks plays somewhat of a secondary role in this book. Robinson has chosen to make Banks' boss and sometimes mentor, Superintendent Gristhope, the main lead of the kidnapping investigation. A similar case many years back haunts the veteran detective's memories as he frantically tries to get to the abducted girl before she is murdered. Finding Gemma's bloodied clothes in a field does not raise hopes that he can win this race against time.<br /><br />The plot of this book is less surprising that in previous Alan Banks books. The abductor/murderer character is revealed well in advance of the ending. It seems Robinson took somewhat of a pause in \\"Wednesday's Child\\" to develop some of the characters that surround Banks, most notably Gristhope but also others. In a way I found this book to be a more relaxing read, despite the gruesome crime committed in the very first chapter.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This is a gift for my gdaughter who is an ultimate One Direction fan.  Its for Christmas, but I can tell ahead of time that she will love it.  Beatles for these teenaged girls - ah, the memories.

Along with &#34;Lonerism&#34; I've now found the next best thing to synth'd out, popped up Flaming Lips. Zowee wowee kazowee.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I really like this game and see no reason for the bad reviews....it took no more than a few seconds to get the hang of zooming but nothing to fuss about. I do not have the best vision and didn't find the need to zoom in very often.....it really pays to read SEVERAL reviews before you decide not to try a game. I just about passed this up because the first few reviews were bad. Glad I didn't....Thanks Nevosoft!
0670023329|5.0|This book is another important read. People all over the world should read this. It's another story that will help people appreciate where they live more. For the first 24 years of his life, Shin Dong Hyuk thought the whole world was a giant prison camp like the one he was born in. In 2005, he escaped from the camp. He now lives in the United States and works with American human rights organizations. According to this book, North Korea is poorer than Sudan and is the most isolated country on Earth. Remember, when ever you think the country you live in is bad, be thankful you weren't born in North Korea. The whole country itself is a prison.
0451232852|5.0|Great book! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. Anyone that has any interest in British and European history would be interested.
1932735410|5.0|For those wanting to do the PMP exam (and pass on the first try), you cannot go wrong in purchasing this book. However, I recommend you get the book for the latest at least 2 months before the exam. Go through the notes, the information is laid out in way where you gain understanding and do not necessarily have to memorize. Do especially the practice exams, and try to understand the solutions.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

1419705849|5.0|I am a fifth grade teacher so I knew this would be a much in demand book upon release.  I ordered 5 copies from Amazon at a terrific price.  I did random drawings of student names and allowed them to take the books home to read.  It was a great experience as the students waited with excitement to see if their name would be called!  All 25 students had read the books in less than 2 weeks.  I am now sharing with other classes on my team!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I've never had a problem with it force-closing like some reviewers.  It's a very handy little app.  Lots of different choices for how you want to be woken up and how long you want to snooze, and if you want the time between snoozes to decrease with each successive snooze!  I also like that you can set it to require you to solve some math problems before it will let you turn it off.  You can even choose the level of difficulty for your math.  It's quick to set up, and you can keep more than one alarm set up in your profile.  I like it!

B001VNB54A|5.0|Band of Brothers does a fantastic job telling the story of the relationships between supremely brave men under fire. The Pacific tells the story of the relationship between men and war itself in an environment that would have been unfathomable even to those serving in the European theater. Don't compare the two series against one another. Don't be of the mindset that The Pacific is trying to be like Band of Brothers. It's not. It doesn't want to be. Please don't let the negative reviews discourage you from buying or at least viewing this series.

B007FRHZ4A|1.0|I can't believe they think a 5 year old can actually create these building structures....or a 50 year old for that matter. I just spent 30 minutes trying to build these 'castles' (I'm 42), unless it was the easiest level, I couldn't get any of them up. This game is great in concept, awful in execution. The pieces were made extremely poorly. With a simple locking structure could have made the pieces fit together easier, and not taken anything away from the integrity of the game. I'm actually thinking about taking it back. Did anyone actually test this game with kids? I'm totally disappointed in Mattel on this one and it feels like they just leveraged the Angry Birds brand to get a game to maket as fast as possible to earn a quick buck. It's terrible, don't buy it.
B00AI7G2YS|1.0|I'm disappointed, I really wanted to read it.  This seems like a very careless mistake that the author should be having addressed.<br /><br />edit: 8/31/13<br /><br />They finally made a Kindle version that works and I have to say it's formatted pretty nicely.  I couldn't figure out why they locked the orientation though or it seems they did.  On the whole they did a pretty good job with it.<br /><br />But the content is a different story.  So the whole point of this Sketchnoting is to what?  I never really became clear on that.<br /><br />Before reading this book I understood the helpfulness of breaking text up with pictures, that's obvious and that's why we see so many obnoxious stock photos on the web that add nothing to the stories.  So in this book we're told to sort of draw the equivalent of those stock pbotos.<br /><br />For instance there's a page where he shows the difference between detailed artwork and average artwork - so that the reader who makes average artwork won't feel intimidated and will understand that it's ok to be average.  But whether you are doing the detailed one or the average one - it's just generic drawings of a laptop or a person running or something like that.  So my point is, if you are listening to someone and trying to take notes, why would you take the time to be drawing a laptop including its keys or a generic running man (or whatever) when that really adds nothing to your understanding of the notes?  He even has some examples of fancy lettering with details, etc,  I mean really, you're going to do that when you're trying to listen?<br /><br />It's not like nobody has ever utilized drawings when taking notes anyway.  Most of us draw WHEN IT'S MORE ILLUMINATING then writing.<br /><br />Most of the examples that he showed felt smooshed together and difficult to follow also.<br /><br />I could see it if there was something specific about the laptop or the running man that did enhance the notes, but otherwise, it seems like a waste.<br/>You could just draw a box around the word \\"laptop\\" and have more time left to take other notes and listen.  If you really wanted a boring useless picture, you could have printed a laptop picture later and pasted it in, still saving your attention for the lecture.  Don't get it!!<br /><br />What would have made this book useful and also made sketchnoting useful would be if he would have told us how to assess information in way that we would know when drawings would actually be relevant and helpful and what to draw in that case.  And I guess then it would be to recognize visual elements that we wouldn't ordinarily think of us a visual element because if the lecturer draws a graph, chances are we will too.<br /><br />What is it that's NEW and EXCITING and USEFUL about sketchnoting?
B000026EQP|5.0|Just what I was looking for at the perfect price.  Thankfully they had Mariah's Second Christmas cd as well. :)
B007I2BZIE|4.0|There's not much to say here other than it's a solid Rush album. I did not start listening to Rush until late 80s/early 90s, so I never was exactly in love with their 70s stuff (though I later learned to like it).  The musicianship is great, as always.  Seeing them on tour a few years ago was one of the best musical experiences of my life.  I would definitely recommend that if you like their stuff, go see them live and damn the price of the ticket.  It will be worth it,  believe me.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is one of the most forward-thinking and best shows on television.  What makes the show so great is that it is basically surprise proof.  When so many current shows base entire seasons around the reveal of a single secret, AHS is so all-encompassing that the big reveals barely even matter.  In other words you can probably see the \\"big reveals\\" coming an episode or two before they happen and yet you still feel the emotional impact when they happen.  It is a huge compliment to Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for devising such a twisty, ridiculous show that the mysteries are just plain beside the point.  It is also a huge compliment that they have such wonderful actors who continue to want to come back for more.  Jessica Lang is the obvious choice for praise but there is also Zachary Quinto, Sarah Paulson and Lilly Rabe who had breakout performances.  All of them deserve awards for their rolls.  This season in my opinion far exceeds the first in story telling and American Horror Story has become more then just a guilty pleasure for me.  It has become an outright pleasure.
B00ADYYY50|1.0|Like most, I was very excited to finally get some \\"fresh\\" Wiz... I have seen you in concert and have every album you have ever made...<br /><br />Think is hands down the worst album you have put out, and I wish I could get a refund.<br /><br />You lost your way Wiz...<br /><br />Im still a fan, but not of this new person on this album... Ill stick to my mixed tapes of the Wiz we all came to love.
B005K01VZS|3.0|Mitch Albom shares a story about a man seeking faith while running from it.  The novel begins with a Rabbi that knew him growing up making a request:  \\"Will you do my eulogy?\\"<br />How would you answer this question?  The author's answer was to get to know the Rabbi.  The rest of the book chronicles their journey of what he learns while getting to know the Rabbi.  The author asks questions that we all would ask.  Is there a God?  Are you really a man or woman of faith?  Also what did he learn?<br />My Thoughts:<br />This book came as a recommendation to me from my father.  I didn't know if I would like this author or not.  I had never really considered reading any of his novels in the past.  The author's approach is very direct and straight forward.  The plotting of this story was interesting to me.  The author would discuss his meetings with the Rabbi and then share about Life of Henry.  He is a pastor that the author meets in a homeless ministry.<br />He never left you waiting to find out what would happen next.  I feel that the story ended for me with some hope and faith.  I don't know if I will continue to read some of his in the future or not we shall see.<br />Please feel free to contact Mitch Albom and check out his new book the Timekeepers.  You can reach him on Facebook or his website.

B00008OWZC|5.0|This 2003 release of archive material from two big arena concerts in California in 1972 contains probably the best available material of Zeppelin playing to a live audience in their heyday. The compilation was put together by Jimmy Page from material he discovered \\"...while searching through the archives for visual and audio material for the Led Zeppelin DVD\\". The gigs were at the LA Forum on 25th June & Long Beach Arena on 27th June, so several months before the `Houses of the Holy' album was released in March 1973 (though a few numbers from that release are performed here) and prior to any of the material for `Physical Graffiti' being composed or recorded.<br /><br />You get 3 separate CDs.<br /><br />The first disk is the real star of the show, with `Immigrant Song', `Heartbreaker', `Black Dog', `Over the Hills & Far Away' & `Since I've been loving You' (definite highpoint especially from a highly expressive Plant with beautiful lyrical phrasing) moving into the familiar 1970s Zeppelin acoustic set, which is truly sublime: `Stairway' is followed by `Goin' to California', `That's the Way' & `Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp' with phenomenal acoustic playing from Page's open-tuned 12-string & Jones on mandolin. It's here above all that the high quality of the recordings & mix shines, with perfect balance of sound doing justice to the exemplary playing & Plant in top form giving astounding vocal expression to these great numbers.<br /><br />Only on disk 2 do some of the notorious 1970s excesses of self-indulgence make their presence felt, with `What is & what should never be' & `Dancing Days' sandwiched between a 25-minute `Dazed & Confused' medley & Bonzo's overlong `Moby Dick', surely of interest only to rock drummers (but it gave the rest of the band a welcome break in mid-concert).<br /><br />Things pick up nicely again on disk 3, with the 23-minute `Whole Lotta Love' medley, a storming `Rock & Roll', new track `The Ocean' & 9-minute `Bring it on Home' as the closer.<br /><br />This really is the definitive live Zeppelin album. If you're of a later generation and don't understand why your parents' generation speak of Zeppelin with such reverence, then put Disk 1 into a big sound system, crank up the volume & listen. You'll start to get it, and might wish you'd been of an age to see & hear this great band live during the definitive & never-to-be-repeated golden era for rock music./>This really is the definitive live Zeppelin album.

B004GJDQT8|5.0|it does a good job of letting you navigate through  Amazon with a small screen device such as a tablet.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|this game is decent, especially since it was free. i don't like the fact that when you have no more moves it automatically gives you moves so you can complete the game. Where's the challenge in that? like i said for free it's okay but I will be searching for another one as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that most of these can be played in a minute or two. Waiting for an appointment and playing kills time and I can usually finish when my name's been called, if I do have to stop without finishing then it's not a big deal since not much time and energy were put into getting to that point in the game.

B000I0QL82|4.0|Great casting top to bottom, and a charming notion...a country inn is the \\"in\\" place to go for dinner and a show, but just on Holidays! The romantic twists and turns are completely implausible...but who cares? This is a unique and historic film which spotlights the best work of Crosby and Astaire on the greatest songwriter's palate. If Irving Berlin had called it quits after just writing \\"White Christmas\\", it would have been a heck of a career. One cannot overstate the significance of the performance of that song in this movie, and its impact in recording lore. 70 years later, it's the biggest selling pop record (perhaps 40 million units sold) ever...and Americana par excellence. This \\"special edition\\" single DVD presentation features a great picture and dynamic sound. The commentary is extremely thoughtful and informative. Lots of cool insights. I found the \\"Two Song and Dance Men\\" documentary excellent and fans of Fred, Bing, and Berlin will love it. Mr. Astaire's daughter is a delight....classy like her dad. She shares personal thoughts and artifacts you won't want to miss. In the interest of completeness, the film has one defect for me. \\"Black face\\" as a stage \\"bit\\" was for some unfortunate reason popular in film well into the 40's. Even as a kid, I was uncomfortable with it. When, in the film, Lincoln's Birthday is celebrated, the song is presented in that regrettable fashion. The balance of the film, though, is truly special and a song and dance showcase of true genius. What can you say? Arguably the all-time greatest singer, best all-time dancer, and top songwriter all treating us to their finest work. An entertainment landmark.

B0059XTU1S|5.0|\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is a unique film that appears to obviously stir the concept of benevolent forces colliding with malevolent elements.  \\"Ian Mckellen\\" returns  in the pivotal role of  Gandalf the Grey. He persuasively plays the wizard who strives to foster unity among Bilbo Baggins and the company of dwarves.  Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth, Ponyo,Hanna) and Hugo Weaving (the Matrix films, Captain America, Cloud Atlas) also play important roles with the characters of Galadriel and Elrond. The artistic detail of the orcs and goblins are done in a one of a kind fashion, but I admit that they also remind me a little of some of the villain characters from my husband's World of Warcraft computer game. Many of the characters played an integral part to the plot of this film. However, two of my personal favorite characters were that of Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) and Thorin Oakenshield (played by Richard Armitage). They both seem to be two sides of the same spiritual coin and challenge each other in way that brings out their spiritual growth. \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is great for those who enjoyed any of the Lord Rings trilogies or like fantasy movies.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE this app! It's visually stunning and elegant as the background of the information on the page displays a gorgeous sky from first light to sunset complete with clouds moving by. It displays a page for any city you choose and it is chocked full of information from wind speed to humidity to barometric pressure to forecasts. I have Rising Fawn, GA and Socorro, NM pages on my Kindle HD Fire 8.9\\", so apparently no city is too small to have its data displayed. I had to travel last week and it was a mighty handy and visually stunning companion on my trip. I highly recommend this app and it is well worth the pittance charged for it!

B001BKVWYG|5.0|I am so glad i discovered Rodriguez, every song is different, beautifully written, beautifully delivered. No two songs are alike. his lyrics hammer you, then soothe you, then enchant you. Unlike Dylan and Cohen (the comparison made elsewhere in comments is unwarranted) he does not whine,writes better and can sing. i listen over and over to his 2 CDs, always find nuances here and there that i missed. It is sad (but obvious why) that this country let down this unique artist and instead promoted other \\"finger-faced out-of-tuners\\".
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game is challenging and fun app i enjoy it and will buy the full version when i can thank you for the great game keep up the good work !

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|One of the greatest children's books of all times by Mark Twain. It is usually a must-read in schools and teenagers enjoy it due to its sweet romantic narrative, down-to-earth dialogues and lovely descriptions of times already gone, but dearly cherished by us even nowadays in our fast-paced modern and technological societies.
0385535147|4.0|As usual, Grishman has turned out a well written, fun to read book. It's a tricky little story, but believeable and I love the main character. He's sneaky smart with a bit of a rascal in him. If you like to escape into a really good relaxing bedtime read, this is it.
B005LAIH54|4.0|This is a good movie, one with great special effects and plenty of action, but after one kills the Kraken, lesser monsters seem somehow tame. So, up pops Chronos, the ancient Father of the gods seeking to remake the world but needing the power of Zeus to break his bonds and get free. Before his capture and imprisonment engineered by Hades and Mars, Zeus seeks out Perseus to enlist his aid. It is Poseidon who finally manages to convince Perseus to help and gives him his Trident to this end. Perseus finds another like himself a demigod named Aegnor to help find Haephestus the Smith of the Gods to seek a way into Tartarus to free Zeus and seek a way to destroy Chronos before he destroys the Earth. It's good, but I don't think they could come up with anything to trump it without repetition.
B006H5120E|5.0|I have a nice Samsung 3D plasma.  The 3D picture is fantastic.  This movie in 3D is like you were there.  Loved seeing Titanic again, this time in 3D.  Just like Avatar they made both movies fill your TV screen and what a difference that makes.  I wish others would learn from them.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|When I saw the first Toy Story, I wasn't sure what to think but it was great! This took it to a new level with comedy digs to Star Wars and Jurassic Park and yet stayed true to the main theme. Woody and Buzz were great, as usual, but the introduction of the Round-Up Gang was wonderful. What was surprising, was that there were Two villians in the plot. The man who kidnapped Woody to complete his collection of the Round -Up Gang to send to Japan, and Stinky Pete, who lived up-er down to his name. While this is a great stand alone story, it fit seamlessly with the first Toy Story picture, and it will with the third one.

1400067820|1.0|I was so impressed by Nicholas Nassim Taleb's book Fooled By Randomness, which I read about a decade ago, that I had to read it again. There were just so many ideas bursting out of it that it was too much to take in in one reading. I was less enchanted with The Black Swan, which seemed to be a rehashing of the ideas in Fooled By Randomness, with a large helping of ego added. But I was still eager to read Taleb's next work, Antifragile, hoping for a return to the Fooled By Randomness originality and unexpectedness.<br /><br />Sorry to say that Antifragile is The Black Swan on steroids, and I think that is an apt description, since Taleb is so full of himself in this volume that he even regales us with his workout routine, which is a dead giveaway that a person has run out of things to say.<br /><br />Taleb has an idea which is that many things are improved, or strengthened, by breaking them or otherwise harming them. These things are antifragile. It works the way a vaccine does, exposing the organism to the virus in small doses in order to build an immunity to it. This is actually a pretty interesting idea, although possibly not as original as he seems to think it is (no language in the world has a word for such a notion!), but he can't seem to get out of his own way to explain how we can apply the idea to various fields or how it may have limits. He bangs on about his own background, his pet peeves, his theories about diet, and some fictional characters that he finds more entertaining than the reader does.<br /><br />I think I've built an immunity to Nicholas Nassim Taleb now, and will have no trouble resisting reading about his next brilliant idea.

B0041KKYGU|5.0|It took me a few years and possibly the movie KNIGHT AND DAY and THE BOX to really see the amazing talent that CAMERON DIAZ really is. She's a riot and out of control in this movie. I love it!!!.<br /><br />If you liked OLD SCHOOL, this reminds me in some ways of that movie as far as the sense of humor involved.<br /><br />Cameron plays in this movie a teacher that will do anything for money. To hook up with the right guy and ultimately to put enough money together for boob implants.<br /><br />As a middle school teacher she does anything in her power and succeeds. Probably the hottest part in the movie is the car wash where she is wearing short shorts and all the fathers of the kids are drooling down the river.<br /><br />It is hysterical, I really have under estimated Cameron for a long time.<br /><br />She rules and she's still hot after all these years and can pull any role you want, off. If you don't believe me watch THE BOX with FRANK LANGELLA and and you'll see a different actress you never seen before.<br /><br />I hope she's here to stay with us for a while and doesn't think about retiring because there's a lot more fire left in that furnace for all of us the movie goes.<br /><br />On another note, this is the first time I see British actress Lucy Punch(Amy Squirrel) that plays this bubble gum teacher...but if you google her in real life shes HOT too!! Great actress as well.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake but he probably took acting lessons...great performance as a geeky teacher that both Cameron and Lucy fight for and in the end Cameron goes for the gym teacher that she wouldn't give him the time of day through the whole movie.<br /><br />RAY ST JOHN

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not traditionally a science fiction reader.  At least I wouldn't consider myself a big fan of the genre.  But I LOVE the Wool series!!  The characters really grabbed me right from the very beginning.  And while it technically is science fiction, there's an element of real-ness to it too.  It's not vampires, crazy aliens, way out there stuff that I think of when I think \\"science fiction.\\"  It's relatable.  It's thought-provoking.<br /><br />It's rare for me to not want to put a book down.  I can always easily stop reading and pick it up later, at any point.  But with this book I did NOT want to put it down!  I wanted to keep reading and reading and reading, to see how it all would work out!  Some of the best writing I've read in a long time.  The story is engaging, entertaining.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, not knowing how it'll work out or what will happen next.<br /><br />I read that the movie rights for this have already been acquired.  And I'm already excited to see the movie too!
0385523912|5.0|Barbara collected a mass of information that is important for us to know. Less American Idol, political propaganda and more reporting on the state of the world in crisis now.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I went into this book &#34;blind&#34; - I had no idea what it was about - I was just reading it as a book club selection.  My initial reaction was shock that this somewhat &#34;brutal&#34; book was a Young Adult book -- I think it might be too harsh for many teens. This is why I held back one star.<br /><br />That said, it was interesting. The narrative is done in a way that might take some getting used to  -- at first it annoyed me, but, shortly, I got into the swing of things. There are a lot of Holocaust stories out there, starting with the Diary of Ann Frank, but this takes a different tack, a different point of view.<br /><br />In the end, I was glad to have read it, to have stuck with it to the end.  I would recommend it to people who are interested in this kind of reading. As a matter of fact, if it is just the title that attracts you, then you will probably enjoy it.  When all is said and done, though, I don't think I will read anything more by this author.
B000P0J09C|5.0|One of the best movies ever depicting the Vietnam war, fantastic in all respects, directing, acting and scene creation. Truely one of the classics,.
B000089RVR|5.0|What can be said here?  Dido classics: White Flag, Sand In My Shoes, Life For Rent.  Well recorded, well sung, well played.  Come on, it's Dido.  Definitely recommended.<br /><br />And Dido, do you hang out here?  (Yeah, I know, who am I kidding?, but just in case...) Congrats on your new son.  From a parent of three teenagers currently, it is so worth it.  Wouldn't have it any other way.  And so pleased to hear about a fourth album.  Released track sounds great.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's fun and easy to learn how to play. Easy to play and watch tv too. Kids love it and the prize feature is neat
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Then you will like this.  If you are a Dido fan, you will love it.  There are some truly beautiful songs here.  A couple were written when her father passed away.  You can tell there is heart and soul in this album.  You can feel it.  Quiet Times is one of my favorites.  Northern Skies is long, but appropriately so and totally mesmerizing.  Dido's brother did a remix of it.  Equally enjoyable.  Check it out on YouTube.  The Day Before The Day is beautiful.  Strong, emotional lyrics.<br /><br />I rock to Zeppelin and love Porcupine Tree.  But when I am in a quiet, contemplative mood, Dido gets my ear.  Highly recommended.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I had not seen any of Pretty Little Liars on TV. I started watching it on Netflix where I saw Season 1 and 2 but they didn't have Season 3. I was interested enough to purchase Season 3 from Amazon.  When I first started watching Season 1, I quickly came to the conclusion that the title of show is misleading. I suppose it is a way to get attention so viewers will watch the program. The four main characters are high schools friends who had a friend who was murdered. The friends weren't involved in the murder but their murdered friend had commit a crime with tragic consequences and the girls were afraid of being accused of their deceased friend's actions. They become paranoid and then rightly worried when they begin receiving notes and text messages signed &#34;A&#34; the first initial of their murdered friend's name. While the girls deal with these alarming messages, their lives continue with all the drama of being a pretty teenager: boyfriends, peer pressure and issues with their parents.

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I was excited to watch Hope Springs both because of the actors and the story line. The couple who have been married for 31 years now live like to two roommates. For their 31st anniversary, they gave each other the extended cable package! The woman wants the passion they had in the beginning so she forces her husband to attend a week long marriage counseling session. The husband has no interest but goes along complaining every step of the way. Then, just as we expect, he has a change in heart and they live happily ever after. What a waste time, money and energy from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. I expected so much more from them.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Definitely enjoyable, especially if you love the show. The voice acting is a great bonus. Gives me something cute and happy to brighten my day.

B009L6UDUG|5.0|I actually bought this movie from Target for $9.99, not the $26 + it's being sold for online. It's a great movie with lots of action and suspense. A must have for James Bond fans.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I can't wait until I have time to sit down and watch this movie again!! I have been aquiring Marvel movies and finally got this one, love it!! I love to have Marvel marathons!!

B001CTDH4Y|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. She was constantly borrowing it from my neice so I finally decided to buy it for her. She watches it at least once a week!! It has become a family favorite!

1449410243|5.0|Ok, so I have always loved a good bit of cat humor (since childhood), and this book subscribes to my adult yearnings for a good cat laugh. =)
B003UYV08E|5.0|I had watch the first Iron Man with my kids (unwillingly) and really was glad that I did, it was a great movie. Iron Man 2, another great movie. My kids and I are hoping for a 3rd to come out within  few years....we will buy that one too, used as well!!!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book is really great.  It is a story of a young boy, Frank going up in poverty in Ireland in the 1930's.  It's a must read book for anyone who enjoys true stories.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|My son has been afraid of the Hulk movies he's seen. I bought this one for him and he loves it. He said it isn't scary like the other ones. Great buy, especially for only a few dollars!!
B008NMT684|3.0|My three year old loves this and the planes trains & boats one made by the same developer. However if you don't buy the full version there are several &#34;grayed-out&#34; puzzles that your kid will want to do. So he will touch them and get frustrated when he can't because you haven't gotten around to upgrading the App.
B0034G4P80|5.0|My son has gotten into the Marvel movies, I unwillingly sat down and watched with him, I am now in the process of collecting all of them!!!
B008QMMEOE|3.0|My 3 year old loves it. Especially the spinning puzzles (only three of them spin) I however am getting tired of Amazon's free aps of the day requiring an in app purchase. If I have to spend money the app isn't free!
B004GF244K|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! I am a music lover and grew up watching everyone on this video. It was so wonderfully done and such a wonderful tribute to Mr. Harrison.<br /><br />The music was great and everyone that guest starred loved it. The girl in the beginning playing the sitar was phenomenal. She just blew us away. Watching Mr. Harrison's son on stage was such a joy to see as well. He looks so much like his father, it's almost spooky. But everyone appeared to be having fun. I was also happy to see the Monty Python crew do their thing. It was such a treat to see those sketches!<br /><br />In all, if you love George Harrison, the Beatles, or just music, it is worth having in your music concert collection.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Solid, and good material and roomy. My only complain it's the sipper flies. One broke a few hours after I started using the bag. Should had been made of metal instead of plastic.
B0059XTU1S|4.0|Peter Jackson has done his work well. Once again, staying very true to Tolkien's vision, he has brought everything to life, sharing with us this adventure. Because I haven't seen the HFR version, I won't be talking about it, but the 3D worked relatively well!<br /><br />Many minutes of this film were focused on the Necromancer, and I think that degraded the experience somewhat. Here, we are given two great evils (Smaug and the Necromancer), and Jackson only delves into the Defiler to momentarily satisfy viewers, which is hard to do after this long wait. We'll simply have to appreciate the fleshed-out story world before our eyes, and scour the internet tirelessly for Cumberbatch's voicing of Smaug. Even a single word would do.<br /><br />What does satisfy dedicated fans is the attention to detail in the books, and for hardcore fans, the striking nostalgia of scenes re-imagined from the 1977 animated Hobbit film. One that comes to mind is Gollum paddling across the water.<br /><br />I have to admit, the battle scenes were once again incredible. Indeed, sometimes unbelievable. Near the end, the company seemed to have the luck of leprechauns. Everything happened conveniently, with no reason for it. Also, Gandalf suddenly uses powerful magic at the end. Why not use it before?<br /><br />Anyway, those qualms did little to sink the pride I felt for Jackson's accomplishment. Gollum was fantastic with his riddles and rhymes, and his selves were quite distinct this time, which was great to see. The dwarves were so much fun, but I wish I'd heard more of certain ones (such as Bombur). I love the energy they have with each other, it's very enjoyable to watch, especially their songs at the Shire.<br /><br />In conclusion, Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's story further to light, and with much skill. The characters were great, and I look forward to seeing some new ones in particular. (cough) Cumberbatch (cough)
B007EECSFA|5.0|i would highly recommend the book the secret keeper  i loved the ending the whole book was good  thank you.
B000Q66HBE|4.0|First off, this album is amazing, by an amazing band.<br />Second, I found it well worth the extra $1 (I bought this used) for the bonus tracks well worth it. All 4 of those songs are as good as the rest of the album.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good sequel..... sets up third book well<br />A little slow yo start though. Could of got going a little more quickly.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|this book was so cute. i was hesitant at first but the story kept taking different turns to keep me interested.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Casino Royale is one of my favorite movies, and certainly at the very top for action movies.  So it was with much sadness that I saw Quantum of Solace.  Few things can make me cry, but that movie was an abomination that essentially led me to tears.  So it was with some apprehension that I looked forward to Skyfall.  Knowing both ends of the spectrum, I didn't know if Skyfall would be more like Casino Royale or Quantum.  Luckily, it is right on par with CR and good enough that we can forget Quantum and act like Skyfall is the second movie in the Daniel Craig series.  This bond pays homage to old bond films and also leads us into a future bond era.  Not many franchises can leave you this excited 50 years after it began, but 007 is just as relevant today as it was back in the day.  It really is such a tight rope for films such as this, and it succeeds as very few franchises have been able to do (Star Trek).  Javier Bardem is amazing as Silva and has shown that few can play the psychotic villain as well as him.  The influence by The Dark Knight (my favorite movie) is apparent and Sam Mendes deserves a lot of credit for his ability to bring Bond into a darker era.  The cinematography is amazing and the action scenes are just as exciting as CR.  The opening scene rivals the opening scene to CR.  Instead of the romantic plot in CR, Skyfall focuses on Bond as a character and does a great job with his character.<br />  Skyfall is one of the best movies of 2012 and while I entered with reluctance, I left just as satisfied as I was when I saw Casino Royale 6 years ago.  The break in films was needed and they came back fresher than ever.  Special props to Daniel Craig as well, for continuing to give amazing performances for a timeless character.  Quantum of what?  I don't know what you are talking about.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the app doesn't load any posts past 10 this is suck a let down. fix this problem and you might get a higher rating
0143034901|5.0|While preparing for a 3 hour flight, I chose The Shadow of the Wind over the others in the airport for reasons I am still not sure of.  Maybe it was the awesome book cover or the high Amazon rating, but I eventually reluctantly chose it thinking I may have just wasted $15.  My intuition was dead on, as I read 150 pages during the flight I realized I just picked up one of the best books I have ever read.  You know all of those words you find on the back cover of books?  Words like \\"classic\\", \\"tragedy\\", \\"romance\\", \\"hilarious\\".  This book actually lives up to all of those words and more.  Its premise didn't hook me and I didn't find myself overly excited about where the book would go.  It wasn't until I got a ways into it that I realized it wasn't the premise that was important.  It's the wonderful scenery and very well written characters that you care about.  So many characters are introduced and many go by multiple names, but all of them are so well defined and introduced that you are never confused about which characters are which.<br />  It's introduced with a young Daniel still mourning the loss of his mother, and it flows well from there (I won't spoil more).  Daniel is a great main character because he is flawed and makes mistakes but you are always rooting for him.  Fermin is a brilliant character by Zafon.  Always giving great quotes that are funny or informative.  All the other characters have great story arcs.  Many sad stories are told with the characters wondering if it was the cards they were given or the way they played them.  Zafons writing really shines the whole way through as well.  He makes the characters relatable and easily transitions from romantic sections to suspenseful sections.  It has a little bit of everything in it.  The pacing is great pretty much the whole way through, with at least one story line always moving forward.  Subplots have subplots, and you can't wait until certain characters show up.<br />  All of that makes the relatively disappointing reveal acceptable.  Actually, I shouldn't really use disappointing as word because the mystery is very satisfying from a storytelling standpoint.  However, it was predictable and I guessed it very early on.  I'm pretty average at guessing the \\"who-dun-it\\" mysteries, sometimes I am way off and sometimes I surprise myself.  I'll bet a large percentage of people will guess the mystery.  Still, it doesn't take away from the story.  It is still a very satisfying ending with a few minor surprises along the way.  I highly recommend the book and have no doubt that if you pick this book up you will consider it time well spent.<br />  Unfortunately, there has been little to no word on a movie adaption.  Maybe someday a director will take on the task.  It would/will be a tough task indeed, with so much of the story being told through flashbacks.  If anyone ever does take it on there is a great movie that can be made from this book.<br />  If you haven't read The Shadow of the Wind, pick it up and give it a chance.  You will not be disappointed.  Many other people wish they could read it for the first time again.  This book is worth much more to me than the $15 I spent on it and I have my intuition to credit for that.isappointing reveal acceptable.

1455502758|5.0|This is a powerful read written by an intelligent atheist who is facing death.  After learning he has terminal cancer he responds to his diagnosis by writing his thoughts, his reactions and responding to those around him praying for him and begging for him to embrace salvation.  He writes up until the time of his death, his last writing just random thoughts.  Short book, a quick read but leaves you thinking.
B004SIP7US|4.0|Good movie. Well presented on Bluray and great acting by all. Shows how little we know about the genesis of the  Big Apple.
B0032Y0OH0|5.0|I purchased the Contour ShuttleXpress 3D in the hopes of being able to do &#34;old school&#34; jog shuttle type video playback for my son's pee wee football team.  I record the games in high definition, then head to &#34;Titans Tower&#34; (our little football field house) and plug in my laptop to the big Sharp Aquos LCD TV.<br /><br />At first, I was a little disappointed because I had hoped it would &#34;just work&#34; out of the box with Windows Media Player.  But this device isn't quite like that.  What this thing does is &#34;map&#34; certain functions (button presses, shuttle wheel movements, etc) to keyboard buttons.  Since Windows Media Player doesn't really have much in the way of flexible keyboard interaction, this wheel can't do much.<br /><br />Then I installed the Combined Community Codec Pack which came with Media Player Classic.  Now THAT is a powerful application. I was able to configure the FFDSHOW video codec to remove interlacing at runtime making the picture silky smooth and sharp (in High Def).  I was also to use the Contour Shuttle Device Management software to create myself a custom profile based on the extensive Media Player Classic key functions.  This allowed me to progress frame by frame by spinning the shuttle forward.  Super slow, fast, it didn't matter.  The faster I moved my finger around in a circle on the Contour Shuttle, the faster the video would play.<br /><br />The coaches were floored. No more messing with DVD player buttons and going to far or not far enough.  I could use one button to &#34;play&#34; in real time.  Then when I start moving the shuttle wheel forward, it immediately transitions to frame by frame mode.  If I move the wheel backwards, it skips backwards 5 seconds.  Perfect for replaying football plays.<br /><br />This thing made our film nights at least an order of magnitude more productive.  My son's coach is also the president of the 250+ player football club and he paid me a very nice compliment at the end of season banquet.  He said, &#34;We have the best film guy in the entire tri-county football league.&#34;  That was very gracious of him to say.  But for me, it was just important that my son could learn better from the film nights because we could show things like precise positioning, point of impact, and how certain holes develop during blocking schemes.  Very powerful stuff.  I'm convinced that our kids had an advantage by being able to learn much more effectively on film nights.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This device does EXACTLY what it says it does, at least in my case.  The key is that you need to take the time to properly research and configure a custom profile and for many applications, there is already a profile available for you.<br /><br />Buy this thing!

B008458O3S|5.0|Trainyard hits an excellent balance between challenge and a feeling of progress. The answers require multiple iterations and tweaking to find the perfect condition which will satisfy the needed results.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I bought this book. I did like the idea of a diary and I was not disappointed. This is one that will leave you thinking and may need to be read again. And I never do that!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very straight forward. Does exactly what it says. Both my girlfriend and I use it on our zte warps.I highly recommend it
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was not up to DeMilles usual product.  The story was too predictable.  You knew the outcome after the end of the first chapter.
B0044E9LW6|4.0|Not the best sound quality, but this package is essential for every Dio fans collection. The 1983 concert showcases a new band full of hunger and urgency, eagar to please the crowd and gain their acceptence. The 1987 concert has the band displaying a more experienced and comfortable attitude, having 4 studio albums to their name by this stage. Personally I prefer the 1987 concert, firstly because the playlist is more extensive and secondly Craig Goldy is the only Dio guitarist who comes close to nailing the Ritchie Blackmore/Rainbow songs. \m/
B009O2XY12|3.0|I don't like to have to purchase energy and gems to continue playing a game I had to buy.<br />Why not get these in exchange for points earned?
193609648X|5.0|Colorful book with a lot of unique designs and yarn to use for the projects.  The designs are not your grandmothers crocheting.
B007N8RULO|2.0|You have to keep pressing and pointing to the various selection choices - i.e. play a game or options - get frustrated and move on to something else.  Also didn't realize at the time it was not a &#34;free&#34; app.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I chose this book because I really enjoy futuristic society stories. (Plus I was ecstatic to learn that they are making it into a film). Very sci-fi, but with a great human story as well. I read it really fast and now I can't wait for the film. My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because some of the advanced science theories needed to complete the story went over my head slightly. But hey, maybe you're smarter then me! Enjoy!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I only have one qualm... it seems the progression is slow. other than that, its really fun! This is actually the first game I have played on kindle that doesn't require money to play through it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|love this movie.  hadn't ever seen it before and the whole family just loves this movie.  my daughter's new favorite line is, &#34;pinkie promise&#34;.  :-)  really cute.  glad we got it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I was very pleased how soon i received after ordering it! I love it! Its a GREAT movie. This product gets 5 stars!!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|nice movie.  not in my top 3, but certainly a fun movie for kids.  got a great deal during the holidays, so it was certainly worth the price.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Pretty accurate for the most part. I like the extra stuff like wind speed. For free, this is a great deal.
0385535147|2.0|I like Grisham novels but this one just did not make it. It was a real slow read and mostly unbelievable. Too contrived for my liking. The plot drags and then a slapped together predictable ending leaves you scratching your head. I would think that this scenario was about as realistic as my chances of winning the Powerball Lottery. Grisham is at his best when he concentrates his efforts in a courtroom.
B00004STPT|5.0|Exactly as ordered. Wonderful sounds. Radio commentator Dennis Prager's theme song included on disk for those interested. A recommended desk for any music library.
