B004MC8CA2|5.0|I believe that there is some form of a God that put us  here, as much scientific evidence there is I just feel that how could we of come from an amoeba in the ocean it just sounds crazy, you don't have to believe in anything that is your right. I am not here to convince anyone live your life to the fullest.
B00003IPFK|1.0|While I agree with all the reviews that say this is probably the best western ever made on film, I purchased the one disc version, which is labeled on the jacket and disc itself as 6 hours.  Also has Hallmark's name on it.  The problem is that the disc only contains Parts 3 and 4 of the movie!  Unfortunately, I didn't discover it until too late to return it. Just check what you receive!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love,  Love,  Love it!!! So glad I purchased it!  Exactly what I needed to clear up a lot of conclusion!!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Wouldn't recommend it. Slow pace when the action finally started the book was over. Maybe I try another book by this author
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book in this series. I have enjoyed them all. I am a real Archer fan.
B00CZF87TY|4.0|I have always said that a soundtrack will make or break a movie, and this was an awesome soundtrack along with an enjoyable movie!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|This series have tought me not to take a no for an answer. I also learned that lawyers are really really smart people and will do anything to serve a client.  Being fair is a different story.
B0018CENUC|5.0|I love this album, having all of Toby's greatest hits is awesome! I started following Toby when he was playing at the county fairs and hearing some of these songs brings back a lot of good memories. If you're a Toby Keith fan this is the album for you, I promise you won't be disappointed!
1400052181|5.0|I liked the whole book.  A tragic and informative work.  I am so glad  Ms. Skloot brought this account of Henrietta Lacks<br />life to the public's attention.  This very tragic but brilliant life story has made it possible for so many people now and<br />in the future to live long lives.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|They are very accomplished musicians and have added their own originality and personality.  Loved the Sand Hollow sketch.<br /><br />Check out You Tube
B00E10X7A0|5.0|Fun to watch and relate to the original Wizard of Oz.  I loved the way the witches were portrayed and acted out by the three actresses.  James Franco made a great younger version of the Wizard
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive. I love it. My only issue was that it required me to have facenbook and I don't really social network.. but its better now
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|More fun than Green Lantern good for a break from reality campy humor puny human likes the hulk a lot
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is awesome. Many different ways to play Hinton. Love blackout bingo. Great way to relax after a stressful day at work. Slots are fun as well but I prefer bingo.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|If you like legal shows - this will be your ticket.  The acting is great and through WII we are able to get it onour big TV
B000HC2LI0|5.0|So glad to have the complete season!  Can't wait until I retire to do a marathon session and watch them one after the other!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this the most fun once you buy things and upgrade things and use them that is the heap of the game. Compeating against your friends by who has the higher rank or who can last the longest in one game. this is jetpack joyride.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Already loved UNO but even more now. We can have a family game even when nobody is home. I highly recommended
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I saw Newsted live and was blown away at how good they were. This is an awesome album. If your a fan of old school metal get this. Newsted does not disappoint.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Why can't they make more shows like this?  If you like never ending drama, look no further.  This show does a great job in showing the audience that people will go to extremes for power, privilege, or promotion. Kevin Spacey deserves an Emmy for his performance, and there are no limits to the talents of his supporting cast.<br /><br />I can't wait for season 2.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|See my review under Ice Age.  Great series, so much fun for the whole family.  They make great gifts for the new generation that are just now watching movies.  My great Grandson loves these films and we watch them together.
B008J34466|5.0|Pick deserves every  F***** penny she earns . Her  albums are something I listen to every day. She writes what she feels and what she has gone thru .  People need to get  off their high horses..  music is just like your  tv --- dont like it  change the channel  or  turn  the  effin thing  off. She sings like we  all talk ...... get over yourselves......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is good game for kids without a pet.<br />IT is real easy to do.  I love this game and I just got it.  :  )
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great characters with very colorful personalities and interesting chemistry between them.  The plots stay quite fresh and smart, so you don't get bored with formulaic.  Good one for husband and wife to watch together, with enough drama and humor for both.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Items received before the scheduled delivery date and in excellent working condition.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|It will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes.  The defiant choice to stay positive in the face of tragedy is a timeless life lesson.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|You know the story, you know the end, but you still read on!  Why?  I don't know, that's what makes it a classic.....
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Had to buy thje rest of the series after reading thing this ,I still think this was the best read in many a year
B003R1B9MW|4.0|Knowing that it's a true story really adds to the movie, but it's a feel-good movie that stands on its own anyway.
1476712042|1.0|I ordered this book a few days ago and just finished it. I was so excited to read it because of the good reviews. but right away, like on the twentieth page, I was like... what the hell is this.<br /><br />for one, the synopsis says Abby is a good girl who doesn't drink or swear and wears cardigans. what? she wore one cardigan, drank and swear the whole book and gambled. I'm confused.<br /><br />second, I AM UTTERLY SHOCKED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE A CUTE COUPLE OR THINK TRAVIS IS HOT. he is abusive, disrespectful and downright insane. the only reason I kept reading was to see if Abby would leave him. BUT NO. what does she do instead? she marries this psycho about 5 months after meeting him. I literally could not believe what I was reading.<br /><br />this book had spelling mistakes, extreme grammar mistakes, and the characters were all the same. they were annoying, boring and all said each other's names after every sentence. it was beyond irritating to read \\"trav\\" and \\"shep\\" and \\"mare\\" after every line of dialogue. also, what is pigeon? why does he call her that? it got really old really fast.<br /><br />basically, if you have some sense, don't buy the book. it honestly is just a bad book, and probably one of the worst I've ever read. Bella and Edward were healthier than the couple in this book.
B007712XAU|5.0|Love the show and have passed these DVDs around to several friends, getting them all as addicted as I am.  One thing I really love is the historical context and the inventions of the time, for example, electricity, the phone, the car etc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the game. Ran out of floors pretty fast though. Would like to have more pictures to solve or other type of puzzles
159448385X|5.0|I love this author, and enjoyed this book even more than his famous novel, The Kite Runner.  It deals with the woman’s perspective in Afghanistan, their lack of power, the abuse they suffer, and their strength.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Thanks for getting me the movie so quickly<br /><br />Thanks for getting me the movie so quickly, will look forward to reccommending you to friends!
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Loved the book and can recommend it! This genre is not my usual read, but was willing to adventure into the dark, raw, and vengeful world of the gritty and dramatic. Can recommend, if looking for a gripping book you can't stop reading.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|This game will not play on the Microsoft 8. Thus I wasted my money. Since I need six more words I will add Darn it!
B006WPWH4E|2.0|With the layout it is hard to get a quick glance at what cards are turned up - i like the version on MS better
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie. It shows people as real and  can be frustrating and are oblivious to the actions that they do, but good almost always overcome evil.
B00936A0RU|5.0|best movie i have seen and loved so much i bought it.  will watch this one over and over.  awesome
1439148953|3.0|In addition to a story about an Irish immigrant shortly after WWII, I expected this book to make me see and feel Brooklyn of that time period.  I did not feel that way.  Eilise did not engage my sympathy or my interest.  She lived her life as others directed her.
B004IPPINW|5.0|Totally readable and quite fascinating. Hamid deals with themes of patriotism, memory, prejudice, racism, freedom, national identity, loyalty, and love. The familiar \\"going home\\" story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is perfect.  Works great with my tablet.  Makes it easy to have everything in one place.  Lightens the load.
B00555X8OA|5.0|No matter who you are, no matter what you do, no matter what you've read, on the subject or elsewhere, this is the one psychology book you don't want to live without  !
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Engaging. Lots of fun but I would prefer not to wait for energy to recharge. Addicting and attractive scenes.<br />Thanks
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Good movies, I have seen them many times.  It was good to watch the movies with the sound on and have the commentaries from the directors and actors on as subtitles.  Ridley Scott and James Cameron were great and made a good effort to let us into their world.  Honestly, the French chap from Resurrection could have made a bit more effort and been a bit less arrogant...  The last movie was always a bit weak I always thought anyway.  But all considered, a nice purchase, lived up to expectations and works well on players from anywhere in the world, not just the US.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Totally different from the movie and more like Tom Clancy's &#34;Red Storm Rising&#34; in flow than a traditional novel.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie sequel to come out!
B000HL0EEE|5.0|As a die hard original series fan, I put off watching any of the newer ones, but that was a mistake. These are interesting and true to the intent of the originals. It isn't the same, but that is a good thing. The characters develop in believable ways and the acting is solid. I am enjoying this series.
B004HKJDMU|5.0|Great insight into a brilliant mind that had no idea about the workings of capitalism. Just as Marx, Keynes developed a paradigm that is a documented failure. Even Galbraith admitted that Keynes was wrong.<br /><br />A must read for any serious schlar of economics.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I'm still waiting for the Cushman to show up at my husband's door.  If and when it does I'll be completely floored.  I have no doubt that we are connected to some energy/stream of consciousness... and this book is written like a workbook.  Fun.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Fun, interesting and unique. If you like something different with an intelligent edge -- give this a chance to grow on you . . .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun! Can't wait for more levels!! Hurry and create new ones so I can continue to play this game.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|You could tell this book was scanned. There were some errors that slowed the reading. I have not had too many difficulties however. Worth the read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is just like temple run and other race g Ames but you are dodging train cars.  Would be great if you could choose different subway systems.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We ride a Harley and we have gotten hooked on this show. We watch the original season and then order the season on DVD. We then can watch it again and again.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the Book.  The writers are in full swing using a script that is fast paced, filmed in beautiful scenery, clothing and the AIR of the time period.  This is a drama, soap opera that continues to keep me interested, but I can see that in the future that the drama could get tiresome.  For now it is intriguing allowing me to care about the characters...ONLY in fantasy.  When I shut my television screen the reality that this is only a program is CLEAR so there is no lingering need for me to have to...have to see the next episode.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I wanted to read this book and it downloaded fast. The trilogy was complete and I feel I got a good deal.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|They seemed not able to decide if this was a kid's movie or and adult's movie. It was not that it vacillated wildly between the two. On the contrary, it would be going along a seemingly adult path and then - WHAM! - a very juvenile interjection would occur. It wouldn't have made a difference to me which way they decided to take it, but they couldn't make the decision and that lowered the quality of the movie immensely.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love this app! I've had a similar one before but it was no where near as easy to use as relax melodies and now that I've typed that I remember it didn't have melodies at all! And these melodies are soft and very cool! And I'm picky about music. Great app! Thanks for making a free version!
B006BQI1V2|5.0|A wonderful story and performances. For those with an intellect and an appreciation for the media/audio-visual arts, this is a must see.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved it! I could not put it down and read half the book into the wee hours of the morning !<br /><br />Nice Epilogue !!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Will not buy anything by this author again. Wish i hadn't bought it and will discard from kindle.Advice to anyone looking to buy, waste of money. Pure porn.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|This is one of my best rock out concerts; turn it up LOUD, REALLY LOUD. If you have any other of this groups DVD/Blu Ray, and I do, I think this one is the best.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Fiddle with the options, until you get the sound/speaker to work best for your system. I thought for a Blu Ray disc that the top options would be default.<br /><br />I completely RECOMMEND this purchase.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Good product. I have one already for my Kindle, but notice the cable also worked for another device so I wanted a spare. What also attracted me to this item was the fact that the cable was longer than most.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I absolutely love this film, even more as an adult! I was only a child when I first saw it. Just an all around great film. LOVE the clothes, music, story and just so visually nice to watch.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I do love it when you go to other resturants you do not have to wait for them to sit down just click on a empty table.I do wish they had a few more dishes that you could do in a minute
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is one great documentary that touches on so many subjects.  If you grew up loving Rock and Roll, this movie is a must.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|This has been wonderful for my 90 yr. old mother. She can hardly ear at all without<br />it. Super Ear has given us back a way to verally comunicate.
B00004CZN9|1.0|Would not play on an American DVD player because I did not have it set to the correct region (whichever country's region it needed).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is better than subway surer. It is great for kids and really makes you use your brain. I will recommend this to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have already recommended this book to several friends. It is a very suspenseful and fun read - haven't been this enthralled in a book in a year or more
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I LIKED THE BOOK AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT PUTTING IT DOWN.  HOWEVER, I DID FEEL THAT THE LANGUAGE WAS A BIT OVER THE TOP.  IT CERTAINLY IS NOT A BOOK FOR FAMILY READING.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Good time killer like loved it on our trip to Canada they sure had fun. Good for car trips fun
B008HK3XKO|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD just snapped right in, no problem at all.  The case looks great.  I got the black.  Well worth the money.  One thing I like is that it gives some protection to the corners of the Kindle in case I drop it.  Other cases leave the corners of the Kindle vulnerable to corner damage.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This is informative and interesting.  I am enjoying learning how cooking has evolved - as has how families and communities come together around food.<br />Annie Heart
0062101897|5.0|I bought this for my son and it his most prized book. It's so wonderful! The phots are great too.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are brilliantly funny. The humor runs from broad to subtle, and includes many easy-to miss references to classic sci-fi movies of earlier decades.
0525478817|4.0|I'll be honest.  This review is going to be hard for me.  When a book affects me like this one, I normally add it to my mental list of favorites and vow never to write a review because I'll be too biased (by writing style or story) to be honest about the stuff I didn't like.  But it's the only Teen Top Ten nominee that I've read, and as a blogger and reviewer participating in the Teen Read Week Blog Tour, I feel kind of obligated to talk about it.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from a friend who had to write an English paper on its symbolism.  It was full of highlights and underlines and a few marginal notes which were actually fun to read, except one which was a bit of a spoiler.<br /><br />There's a reason this book was assigned for English class and then pretty much forced onto me by a student of that class.  This is a deep, thoughtful, make-you-think book full of the kind of quotes you find on decorated Pinterest images.  (The good kind, not the corny ones.)  The writing is alive and brilliant and pure genius.  The characters are so much more real than most found in even my favorite YA books of today.  The plot was perfect because it was imperfect - it was lifelike.  The lessons and symbolism and takeaway were so huge I feel like the thoughts it left me with were not even a drop in the bucket.<br /><br />There were things I didn't like, too.  There were inappropriate scenes, language, and behavior I would not approve of.  But it's one of the very (very, very!) rare instances where that sort of no-go behavior in literature is passable in my mind.  Why?  It wasn't in the book just because they're teenagers, or it sells, or it's what everyone does, etc etc.  It was all a part of the character building (cynical, dying Hazel and perfect, trying-too-hard Augustus).  It was necessary to keep from breaking out of the POV voice.  And it tied with the symbolism and philosophy amazingly.<br /><br />I am a highly opinionated person.  I'll admit that by today's definition I am very closed-minded.  I don't apologize for that.  So for an author to hold beliefs and write things into their stories that I don't feel are right, and still get my thumbs-up not just in a book-by-book basis but as a person and as a writer, that author would have to be really amazing and impressive and intelligent and a master at their craft.<br /><br />John Green is most definitely all of the above.<br /><br />I give this book 4.5 stars.am very closed-minded.  I don't apologize for that.  So for an author to hold beliefs and write things into their stories that I don't feel are right, and still get my thumbs-up not just in a book-by-book basis but as a person and as a writer, that author would have to be really amazing and impressive and intelligent and a master at their craft.<br /><br />John Green is most definitely all of the above.<br /><br />I give this book 4.5 stars.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Loved the movie the seller was great I would recommend it to any one. And can't wit for the second wine to come out on DVD
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very addictive game. My son got me to download app and I have to play it every night before I go to bed.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love the game so far.  have only played for two days.  seems interesting enough for h.o. games.  will continue to play out and probably down load another free h.o. game. love h.o. and escape games.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|A series of short stories bound together with a theme. I thought the other books were better.  I woul read again
B000IZ6URY|5.0|I would love to have been a fly on the wall when they were making that movie. They must of done a ton of retakes. When will the next Team America come out? I hope soon.
B0041LG08U|5.0|Works as expected, sharp looking and keeps good time. Loses a minute or 2 a week, but hey, it's an automatic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The show the cast, the actors, and the setting are very good.  Multiple story lines add more interest and the writers did a wonderful job.
B0000C3IDN|5.0|Well for one I has having a hard time finding this record in any local stores and you had it here and It is perfect and nice. Thank you.
B0056JJY2K|5.0|Having seen Alan Ladd in &#34;The Proud Rebel&#34; shortly before seeing &#34;Shane&#34;, I was impressed by the similarities of the story lines of each one: the underdog being taken advantaged of.<br /><br />Can't remember when I first saw &#34;Shane&#34;, but, whenever it was, it left a lasting impression on me. The take-away moral for me was that wrong does not last as long as we are willing to assert ourselves.<br /><br />To me, &#34;Shane&#34; was the closest thing to video documentary of a family living the American dream in the Frontier life.<br /><br />I think I'll make the viewing of &#34;Shane&#34; an annual tradition in my family.<br /><br />5 Stars all the way!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|From the moment  I got this game  I was addicted to everything about this  is an absolute must have for every age and every like and dislike
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Tjis is one of my favorite movies!!!! There was a lot of truth that was filmed in this story. Watch it!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|This movie displays a team's courage and determination to fight for what is right and to get justice for their fallen comrades.
B00BPXKWGS|4.0|Slotted in the R.E.M. discography between Document and Out of Time, Green continues to remain one of the band's most underrated albums. The Greensboro show included on Disc 2 ranks up there with some of R.E.M.'s best live recordings ever. I also love the 25th anniversary packaging; many people prefer digipaks which are often associated with deluxe edition sets, but I find those to wear out too easily even from light use.<br /><br />While the music on the Green album is fantastic, the 2013 remastering by Chris Bellman could have been better. Maybe I had high expectations given that Green is one of my favorite albums, but all he did was enhance the bass and chop off a bit of the high frequencies. Green was already a thin-sounding mix to begin with and compressing it more kinda defeats the whole purpose of remastering it. Buck's guitar, especially on songs like Pop Song 89 and Orange Crush for example, is a bit buried in the background now rather than being a commanding presence up front like it should be. Let's hope that they give future reissues like Out of Time and Automatic for the People a really good remastering because quite frankly, they deserve it.<br /><br />Overall, this 25th anniversary set which is totally worth it for the Greensboro show only.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|A horror movie that leaves you guessing til the end. Decent movie about the life of a writer and his family who move into the home of his latest story line.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The characters are pretty well developed and believable. Love his style of story telling. So effortless and consuming. Ending was a bit predictable but that does not take away the enjoyment.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Great tale of two people who give love a chance and fight to stay together as a family! Would watch over and over! If you like The Notebook you will love this movie!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Someone recommended that I watch this.  In some ways it is like the wire but this was made before the wire came out.  I'm continuing the watch the series and very happy someone recommended it.  The acting is very good, good character development and all around good series so far.<br />I can't say that I like it better than the wire but it is definitely up there.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I have always heard the name Pollyana and vaguely understood that she was somewhat of an optimist but this was my first opportunity to read the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think I will have to learn to play the game myself. Bored with my summer vacation, I was looking for something light to read and stumbled across Heidi beloved book from my childhood. In the process of downloading I saw Pollyanna and decided to take that one as well. I chose to read Pollyana since I had never read it before and I am so glad I did. Finally I understand why Pollyanna is associated with optimism. The only sad part for me was that when I got to the last page, I was looking for more.
B000I3UMKM|4.0|Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard give wonderful performances portraying outsiders trying to make a life and a living in Manhattan.  Great story, even if it does have a bit if a Hollywood ending.
B003YFJ5U4|5.0|The historical figures really come alive, along with their ideas.  I only found the last few chapters to be a bit complicated to follow, physics-wise.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed each book in the series and feel this ending was true to the strength of Sookie's character. Thank you!
B000WGWQG8|3.0|It ended up boring me.. still yet to finish. still.. seems to be an accurate accounting of the history of the time and the man.. just couldn't hold me.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|plays along just like the movie. themes for part one and two. better than most other avoidance games and kids will love it. updates can be long but it is worth it
B005544V6A|4.0|I like the premise of the show although I have to admit it's a bit unbelievable that someone could represent a high-powered law firm without actually being a lawyer. Even more hard to swallow is the idea of the (non)lawyer representing the firm in court. Somehow I don't think that would fly in real life, but, hey, almost anything is possible, and TV is an alternate reality where we have to suspend belief constantly. Having said that, I like the two main characters and actually most of the others. I am currently wading through Season 2, so that speaks for itself. Rick Hoffman as Louis Litt is perfectly cast. The guy gives me the creeps, and I can barely control my gag reflex at times when he's nosing around Donna (or any woman for that matter). When he's caught on tape catching a knee between the legs by a woman he was dating, I couldn't summon up much sympathy for the guy, although it wasn't made clear what he said/did to deserve it (but I'm sure he did). Donna, of course, is priceless, and one of her looks is enough to send Louis scrambling for a bunker. The interplay between those two is classic and is a really nice thread throughout the series. Overall, I haven't found this to be a time-waster like many shows, but I have only watched Season 1, and that's usually when the writers are at their best. Time will tell if this continues to &#34;suit&#34; me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app seemed childish at first, but I was convinced to try it for the price.  I now love this app and it passes the time.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Remembrances from someone who was there!  Honest, even brutal just like the situation he was in.  One of the best written accounts I've read about the horrors and brutality of war.  Any romantic notions are dispelled by this realistic depiction of war in the Pacific!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like that i can challenge my friends. gives me something to shoot for that I otherwise wouldn't. great game!
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|Great for navigating where u want to go...even better for reporting traffic issues along ur way.....haven't used our TomTom since putting the app on our phones...one less gadget in the car!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I couldnt keep up with what was happing and it transitioned from one set of people to another and I got lost and couldnt get back into it. the second viewing was no better and I had high hopes for this movie.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie was sad but beautiful. One of my best love movies. what amazed me was how he planned his wife future adventure  before he died. He really wanted her to be happy and I really loved the music it really touched me.
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I really thought this movie would be alot better than it was but it was a disappointment the same with Cloud Atlas. It is a twilight spin off, but it had some good parts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging and fun.....keeps you very busy. Needs more rooms and sometimes it lags but all in all...it is fun to play
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Queens are considered one of the tightest bands in the world, and this proves the point. About half the album consists of mellow-ish, heartfelt grooves that tickle the mind and soul. Their debut at #1 on  the Billboard charts was indeed well deserved.
B0002WS3RS|5.0|This recently remastered CD, complete with lyrics and new liner notes from Daevid Allen, is a must-have for fans of Cambridge-style prog/psych rock and jazz.  The second and best of the Radio Gnome Trilogy, Angel's Egg swings and sways with lysergic fury, and is also the first Gong album where Steve Hillage really cuts loose on guitar (although he was subtly present on the preceding LP &#34;Flying Teapot&#34;).  This is probably as good as Angel's Egg has ever sounded on CD.  A couple of bonus tracks are included, but they are of no great consequence.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|paid for HD , said I couldn't play HD on my system. I have a 60 in Vizio, a 5000 dollar  stereo, my computer is setup in HD and I can't play it on my TV.  Movie was good but should have been able to see it in 1080p. just sayin
B00A4OALL0|4.0|Easily the magnum opus of \\"Without A Net\\" , Wayne Shorter's self-penned \\"Pegasus\\" is a massive tone-poem featuring the album's line-up augmented by the New York chamber quintet Imani Winds for this live date at Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert Hall in December 2010.<br /><br />Compositionally , \\"Pegasus\\" is like much of the rest of \\"Without A Net\\" , in that Mr. Shorter's band's performance quickly dissolves into strenuous , hotly played improvisation capable of diverting itself into multitudes of different directions at any moment. \\"Pegasus\\" , however , is book-ended by the Imani Winds' more structurally organized and articulate opening and closing themes , bringing a sense of formality to \\"Pegasus\\" not found elsewhere on the album , yet the performance by the Winds here is with an energy and dynamism equal to the playing found anywhere else on \\"Without A Net\\".
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Any doubts are gone. This season confirmed the show and cast is great not just riding a popular theme. I hope next season is as well written.
B000ME5B30|1.0|What a crock of political crap. All to stuff the pockets of a loser. Don't waste your time with this garbage.
B0006VSLJ0|5.0|As a school teacher, I am impressed with this game for the following reasons: it utilizes multiple intelligences and can hold up to repeated game play (I have played it over 200 times over 3 or 4 years). You may think it is only about spatial intelligence and like Tetris or something. But there is a lot more to this game than just that. You won't go wrong with this game. After all, despite it's cost, if you enjoy playing it 10 times then you have spent hours of fun at very low money. And you will enjoy playing it 50 times easily!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Amazon's download didn't work and as you know they take no responsibility for when digital asset delivery fails. Waste of money and spent the night without a movie. I rarely watch movies so when I feel like seeing one, it is a shame that it didn't work.
B002QCAXOS|4.0|Good Movie and good audio video quality~! enjoyed watching and rewatching it~ i'm glad you put it back on prime video~!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should buy this game. It is awesome. I love this game. The best day on earth. It is sooo cool.
B007HVBW2A|5.0|One of my favourite movies that scared the crappers out of me~ I love this movie,......But Amazon~~! There's no sound to this~ i'm not used to having to make any complaints about the service or my subscription, so I didn't know where else to send this.........so, here it be.....can it be fixed soon?  Thanks in advance~~~
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I can't stop listening to this EP. I really liked it when I heard it on my computer, but when I listened with my earbuds I LOVED it!  It is very well produced. All of the songs are arranged well and Lorde has a lot of talent. And even from her young perspective, she has some really relevant things to say. Her songs portray an amazing level of self awareness, especially for one so young. I can't wait to see how her skills develop as she gets older.
B003L77G6K|5.0|The writers just keep getting better in their use of scientific terms (although, most are good pokes in the eye for some of us).
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This film is STILL incredible even by todays standard.  The photography is great, the script is fantastic, and the acting by everyone is just great.  Even the background music is so haunting and eery.  I loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today and it's even better now with the enhancement of Blu-ray for picture and sound.  You can't go wrong owning this film.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a HUGE Star War fan and although you can find problems with this film I just love it.  I love the story, the acting, the photography, and just everything about it.  I've watched this so many time and just never tire of it.  I'm glad I purchased the entire series.  I definitely recommend it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This really will show you the wrath of Mother Nature.  The filming of this movie is incredible.  The acting is incredible even from the kids in this movie.  Everything about this movie seems so real.  For those who are curious about how a tsunami can destroy everything in its path for miles this is the movie that can more than explain what happens and how people end up with the injuries that they have.  Don't miss this film.  It's just incredible.  I highly recommend this film.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|I really like this film.  I don't generally care for comedies because what's funny to one person is not funny to me but I laughed out loud watching this film.  Everyone in this movie is funny and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I've been a Susan Boyle fan ever since she first appeared on Britain's Got Talent! This little musical sampler treats the listener to a variety, and shows off the range of Susan's talents.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a hard time putting this one down. You think it is just a regular spouse murdered his wife but there are so many twists that make it a must read!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My daughter is always into a book and usually a series. Going into the 4th Grade, this book is a little above her maturity level, but she found it very easy to read. Detail was good, storyline was easy to follow. She said it would have been more stars, but some of it 'was gross when it did not necessarily have to be.\\"
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I love this game. its so fun me and my brother had a competition who could play the longest without messing up.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|I enjoyed It every time I watched it.  This is one of the best action adventure movies of all times.
B0090EKRKU|3.0|Loved the movie but when I rent the HD version on my Kindle Fire HD, the rental ends after 1 week, and that is opposite of the terms when I rent.<br /><br />Love some feedback please<br />Andrea
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I have for stars only bra aide the game didn't install right the first time, and then updated and all previous game play was lost. Other than that, I love the game and play all the time. Love those minions!
B004HWYTP4|2.0|Very slow moving and the characters were not interesting.  After deciding that Red 2 was not worth the price of admission  and popcorn at a theater, we thought the original might' be better but if that is true, Red 2 must be really bad.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Loved it. Love del Toro. Had an interesting twist. Casting was great. Worth the watch. It says I need 5 more words even though I said what I wanted in less.
B00821OX98|4.0|Just when I thought there couldn't be more twists to the plot, there are. Very compelling storyline. Much more human than similar end of times series.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|The story was good but unfortunately did not have my full attention. I felt that Khaled could have done better.<br />I prefer his first two books!
0425220931|5.0|hard to believe the story but a good read... I love the perspective on music theory... (and Victor is an awesome bass player, glad to help promote him in any way)
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I love this app! Recently youtube.com quit working on my kindle so i downloaded this (since there is no real youtube app)  to try and use it everyday! The ad free version isnt worth buying. Ads are not a hastle in this version. Very Satisfied.
1603425381|5.0|Have not had the opportunity to use more than five of these borders but I LOVE the ones I did use!  I can't wait to finish my next project and try another &#34;new&#34; border!  Lots of helpful hints.<br /><br />I don't always like the border of the pattern I am making so this a great resource to pick out one I prefer for my crochet projects.<br /><br />Knitters who crochet can use this too for border too!  Also tells you how to add a border to almost any fabric.  Love it!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app works perfectly on my kindle I love it love it love it!!!!!! God bless whoever came up with it
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is well written and holds the reader's attention. Pam has a great way of getting an inspiring and motivational message across to her audience! I love the way she brings the material to life with hands on experiments...and they work! A must have for anyone who wants to learn more about the law of attraction!
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|Control of the aircraft is impossible. That is the headline!  Repeat, the aircraftcan not be properly controlled, thank you, goodnight.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|If you like kakuro it's a really nice game.  It allows you to set the size of the puzzle, so you can breeze through a small puzzle if you don't have time to take on a giant difficult one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A little challenging and very fun to play, i would recommend this game to my friends can't wait until the update comes out
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is convenient and, best of all  easy to use. Although I don't use it a lot, it has proven to be easy and accurate when I did need it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I saw this in the theater and couldn't wait to buy it!  It has subtitles, but you don't even notice after the first few minutes!
B00000IQW5|5.0|Best movie ever !!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Useful information with a some doses of humor!  It made me rethink my diet completely!  The facts presented in this book are too strong to ignore!  If you are concerned about the food in our diets this book is for you!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is good clean fun with great graphics. It can get a little boring if you dont have friends. but they are easy to get in the game.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I generally love these types of fantasy stories.  The first three books definitely whetted my appetite for more.  But starting with the 4 book, things began ramble and get dull.<br />Touted as the last book in the series, I expected the story to be wrapped up.  This book left more hanging stories than any other first book of a series that I have ever read.<br />When I finished, I was actually happy for those who did not survive in the first four books, because at least their stories were complete.
0756407915|5.0|This is now my all time new favorite fantasy series. His story telling captures my imagination instantly and I love going back into that world.
1611761115|5.0|I'm a school teacher and I've either read or listened to Daniel Pink's other books.  I'm really glad to say this new book was not phoned in or a spin off another one of his books.  This book could stand alone on it's own research and ideas.<br /><br />I have a 30 min. commute to work every day and that is just about enough time to get a chapter or two in.  Great short little bursts of information.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|So sad and concerned... This is typically what happens when I watch documentaries like this. Although they basically tell things that we all have a clue about, the levels of corruption in food industry and regulation offices with real life images are really disturbing. So sad to admit that  our world  is governed not by so called freely elected people who think and work for the good of the commons but a bunch of corporation man that fight for making laws to increase their profit margins. Besides it is also sad that the legal system works in favor of the richer. Huge court expenses that would swallow any ordinary person is very well documented in this film. As it says in the tagline, I will never be able to look at the dinner like I did before... Although I have continuously been investigating my food purchases and try to avoid gmo or hormon applied foods as much as I can, there is always a proportion that is out of control. I still feel myself lucky that we as a family almost never dine out or eat fast food. We bake our own bread and my wife has learned to make almost everything (including sausage, pizza, sushi, chinese food, pasta etc.) at home. So that the kids can eat everything with less concern about the outcomes. However it is still very worrying. This documentary is an eye opener. Should be watched carefully by anyone who cares a better life...
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and you will too! Families can watch this together although small children may find it hard to take so beware.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Recommend to anyone wanting a challenge, exactly what you expect from Metal Gear Solid game play. Easy to learn even if you are not already a fan.
1423113462|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's writing style.  I couldn't put it down.  I have read all three Heroes of Olympus and can't wait for Book 4! I am planning on ordering other series from him I love reading about greek mythology. For anyone who loves greek mythology I recommend Rick Riordan's books they're great!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story was a little difficult to follow.  It was disjointed --jumping between several plots. I enjoyed the other two books much more.  This one is okay to skip and hope for a better one next time
B00B671VYU|4.0|Not as good as The Arockalypse or Babez for Breakfast but it's Lordi.  I love their music! I wish they would do a concert tour in the USA.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I appreciated his willingness to share his experiences during this time. His background in medicine gives his account a lot of credibility. These stories give me many reasons not to fear dying in any way; it is a part off life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great way to share the things you love with other people. your able to navigate the app easily as well as pin things quickly.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I hardly watch TV but this show is purely addicting. After being hooked on the first episode, I watched the entire first season in a day. A lot of characters and a lot of plot twists.
B005ZO6DIO|5.0|I can't add to the great and far better worded reviews here.  I can't only echo them and agree w/ them. Well conceived and well acted. (Though I'll admit I'm not much of a fan of the actress playing Terra)<br />Losing Piney was the saddest episode of all. I LOVED Piney. Next to Jax he was the greatest character. SOA just continues to keep you intrigued and engrossed. Such a well written show! Even for a prude like me. I hope it has another decade to come.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This film is not about Lincoln.  It is a story about a political intrigue - about how Lincoln (and others) pushed to get the 13th amendment passed, just before the cessation of hostilities in the Civil War.<br /><br />It is a very good film, well written, and well played.  But it is not the biopic of &#34;Lincoln&#34; that the title promises.  Yes - there are moments when we meet and understand Lincoln as a person - as a family man and as a diplomat/politician.  And yes - clearly - we all have a lot to thank Lincoln for.  But the film is really about several individuals (including Lincoln) who pushed every way they could to make slavery illegal in the United States.  In that way the film is as much an homage to Thaddeus Stevens as it is to Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />This is a film about politics in Washington in the spring of 1864.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The parts I didnt like were the short interviews. The book could have had more interviews in it. The book was not what I thought it was going to be like. I was expecting more of a story then interviews although they were well written and gave me a sence of being there while the zombies were attacking.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book would be a good one for middle and high school ages. Although as grandmother I found it relevant too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.and I'm the mom me and my daughter have a blast playing this together it gives her something to care for
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The overall plot of Despicable Me might not be the most original in the world, but the wonderful characters (including Vector the crazy villain of the movie), humorous scenes and build up to the final conclusion make this movie great. The minions are probably the best side characters someone could ask for and their constant antics really can leave a person in stitches. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves to laugh.
B00821OX98|5.0|My son told me this was a great show, but you know that can be.  He was right, I was hooked after the first episode.  Watched almost the whole first season in one day!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is  an awesome free game!<br />It has:<br />&middot;Bashing and crashing<br />&middot;Tilt controls<br />&middot;Leaderboards<br />And so much more!<br />If you are reading this,you should try this game.<br />I worked hard on this review.<br />I hope it is helpful!
B008Y73940|5.0|The movie had quite a few turns that I did not expect. the hero used the law to his advantage. the action kept moving and the movie was not dull
0060594896|5.0|Anything is possible.  First, the very first thing you do is take complete, 100% responsibility for your life.  YOU are the one who sets up the things that happen to you.  You are the one who allowed the kids to keep the dog.  You are the one who chose those friends.  You are the one who allowed someone else's opinion decide your responses.<br /><br />But Jack Canfield takes this one step further.  He writes about the Law of Attraction, saying we draw to ourselves what we most think about.  Do we think about not being able to pay our bills?  Then that's what we are drawing to ourselves.  Do we think most about our bad health?  Then that's what we are drawing to ourselves.<br /><br />For those who do not accept Jack Canfield's point of view, (1) we cannot argue his success, and he didn't start out from any better position than anyone else, and (2) if the Law of Attraction really is a Law, like gravity, then it might be wise to rethink how we are responding to our world.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I thought the movie was good enterainment and had a lot of action. It was a fun view. liked it more than some. it was also a fun movie
B00AFEY354|4.0|The reason why I bought this movie was because I read the book and honestly couldn't put it down. I am not a constant reader but the book was really good so I decided to watch the movie. Was very well made, had some of the important scenes, but missed a lot of critical detail. If you have read this book before, you'll be upset by the detail that they missed, but if you haven't its still a fun movie to watch
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great Game.  Intuitive, yet challenging.  I recommend this game to anyone.  As always, graphics were wonderfully done.  The puzzles supported the storyline well.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Just the card game I was looking for u have to spend a little money to get hy in the later stages would prefer to just buy the game for a one time price but guess that how it is now
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I love it......so easy to print from the tablet to the wireless printer. Making life easier with not having to send print items to a laptop.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This is a well conceived novel based on a Nazi spy and his exploits. It holds the reader's interest and If you like Follett's other works, you will also enjoy this one!
B009DCOU9S|2.0|The voices are irritating...if you cannot find something you are stuck on the level. It is just lame.I would tolerate it if I was not stuck on one level forever looking for some dumb symbol.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you can make an update allowing us to transfer materials from one world to another in survival mode that would be a lot more fun
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I got hooked on this game years ago. I enjoy the ease of penciling in numbers compared to the books and having to erase many times when putting in wrong numbers. There are times electronics win out over the pencil and book type. This is one
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|What an amazing, talented artist. Her vision is clear on this album, and she takes you along for the ride. You can feel the passion in her beautiful voice. The three stand out tracks are &#34;Born To Die&#34;, &#34;Blue Jeans&#34; and &#34;National Anthem&#34;. They are so unique and like nothing you've ever heard before. &#34;Carmen&#34; and &#34;Million Dollar Man&#34; are an aquired taste; both have an old timey feel to them and can sound a bit dated. However, the album as a whole is so good, you really wouldn't mind listening to them. It's definitely an experience you SHOULD experience.
1609611543|3.0|The author included lots and lots of scientific and nutritional information which will be interesting if you are a scientist or nutritionist. But I skipped entire chapters that explained in detail about glutens proteins, what they do, what they are, how they evolved....etc. For a non-scientist who is concerned about gluten's affect, this could have been condensed to half its volume.<br />Worthwhile reading if you don't mind skipping long explanations and entire chapters of science-y stuff to get to the point.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Enjoyed this version of the book! English version by an English author - very appropriate!  Tess is a modern character in a by gone era.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|I was hoping to see the second part of this movie ... Never came ... But it is a really good movie
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very enjoyable - visually satisfying - a nice addition to the Spider Solitaire world. Like having all the options regarding background and playing card colors.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It's similar to temple run but much better. I saw it on my wifes iPad and was instantly hooked.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's classic is brilliant and is incredibly true to the original show. The music is beautiful, the sets are stunning, and the acting is superb. Emmy Rossum is incredible as Christine Daae.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It doesn't go the way I wanted it to but it makes for a great show....amazing how attached you become to the characters!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a smart movie with good writing, good acting and lovely music in the soundtrack.  Even if you don't appreciate classical music and opera, there is plenty here to like.  The movie is fast paced even though the setting is in an Old Folks Home for retired musicians.  It will have you laughing and then crying.  The ending moved me to tears.  Don't miss this one!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is a must see, especially if you saw them live in concert as my wife and I had the opportunity to do this past July.
0316776963|2.0|I found the book to be funny at first, but it got tiresome later on.  I'm not sure I appreciate being the recipient of the writer's &#34;me, me, me dump&#34;.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I'm a big Gregory fan. This book, however, is not one of her best. I felt like there was a word count requirement when reading it because Elizabeth, 95% of the time, only repeats back what Henry has said to her (only changing it into a question.) Are we to believe she was such a simpleton?  On top of that I just don't feel there is anything going on in the 'story' other than name dropping. If I wanted that I'd reread my high school history books.<br />Disappointed fan here. Her other books are far superior and I will at least give her next novel a try.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is a kind of easy game but out is very fun. Ive been playing for like an hour!<br />Well have fun!!! And enjoy
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Not simply a &#34;cult classic,&#34; but a true classic in all senses and with a phenomenal cast!  ENJOY!!!  I WILL!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Seriously, and she gloms a steak like no tomorrow, cries, whines and makes you believe! She has not lost her touch!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really awesome,nice ,cool,real life graphics cool really good really fun Mike spurgeon to the bathroom with her cause of the way inside of yours is what you want to make sure you are so beautiful and the
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie kept our attention until the very end.  I would recommend that anyone watch this even if you didn't read the books!
B0051T46XM|5.0|He originally saw it on Netflix. But he likes all the extra features that come with the DVDs. So, I obviously had to purchase this.
B00000J2SP|5.0|\\"Spotlight kid\\" and \\"Vielleicht Das Nächste Mal (Maybe Next Time)\\". I doubt I will hear anything close any time soon. Although it is relatively easy to learn moves from the \\"Child in Time\\" solo and qualify for a \\"rock guitarist\\", these two songs are likely to remain unsolvable puzzles for imitators.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie animates so many childhood fantasies and anxieties in a fun but for older children way. Another good one for the Blu Ray shelf.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very good show.  Get Litt up and watch it.  Can't wait for the next season to come out, wish we could watch each episode on Prime as it airs.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Love it!! Works wonderfully, looks nice. All over great. Very happy with purchase thank you so very much!!!! Absolutely love it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I would give a 5  star, but I bought $20 worth of bingo credits and never got the credits but my card was charged. I can't find anywhere or anyone to contact about this. Other than that this game is so fun. I haven't been able to complete any collections yet, but that's ok. The slots are fun too
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Deep research and very good presentation of subject. You can relate the skills to your daily life. Yet do not expect to be a perfect negotiator getting everything you want since it does not teach you that. it helps you to understand the whole process and be clear about everybodies needs etc to make the negotiation process as efficient as possible. Flexes you to be a better negotiator.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|I purchased this game for my son.  He plays it all the time.  This is a fun game for a low price.<br />We have purchased other games like this one but he always comes back to this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I adore Nicholas Sparks Books! It is very rare that I can't get into a N. S. book. After I read Safe Haven I watched the movie. The book like normal was better. The feeling you get from reading his books is indescribable. Every twist every turn. I wanted to cry, fight, scream and laugh through out the entire book. Every time I read one of his books I somehow fall in love with my husband all over again.<br /><br />I would gladly recommend any of Nicholas Sparks books to anyone who enjoys a good book full of twist and turns!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Pinterest....I get SO much info and GREAT ideas....I can't see being w/o it!!!! If I need to KNOW ANYTHING I just get on Pinterest...Great food recipes...home decor...gardening ideas!!
B000I8G5GW|5.0|Movies do not get any better than this. A great story and great acting. Another must see for film fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game where you can Interact with friends and has a great challenge to make it fun and addictive.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|A great classic film in every respect. The film and it's message are timeless.  A must see for any movie buff.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The overall story was good, but there were too many characters.  It was hard to keep track of their story line as they aged and how they were connected.  His first book was so good.  I've been disappointed in the subsequent ones.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is the most funniest and the fun game i ever play in my life. when my friends see me playing i said you must play my little pony. it is the best game every. everyone should play it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Both myself at 51 and my nephew at 3 love this game.  It is one of the few games I play over and over.  Fun with extra challenges even without spending real money.
B00506NRBS|5.0|A pleasure to read and useful for everyone from the per-startup to the current CEO. Valuable information about policy and delegation.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Its an amazing app.. and really works. The combination of various sounds and melodies makes this app a must for everyone..
B00821OX98|5.0|Man, I do not write reviews but here goes.<br /><br />All these alien shows really should make you stop and think.<br /><br />Good cast.<br />Good effects.<br />Good storylines.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Fantastic read! I was often left nodding in agreement after every chapter as I've already encountered  similar feelings and experiences in my short-lived career. My favorite concepts included the idea of not pulling back before you need to (I do this constantly when I worry about where my career will go and I'm not even married yet!) And the idea of \\"us vs us\\" - as women we've got to support each other's decisions regardless if we are stay at home moms or work full-time in the workplace. Very eye opening to the stigmas/stereotypes that we as women sometimes put on ourselves!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great story and excellent character development, but by the second half of the book I ended up skimming through the passages detailing the numerous political dissertations. The story definitely held my attention, though.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|A more menacing, &#34;deranged&#34; and sadistic Scarpia never existed.......at least not in the multiple live performances and DVD's I've seen. The production put the new Met's production to shame and the entire cast was rock solid.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Like the game a lot, but it was hard to figure out.  Which I am still doing?  Where did the power ups, keys, and coins come from and how did I get them.  How do you get more bingos without paying?  I am starting to get it but I was totally confused and couldn't find the information.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|Bought this for my 80-year old Mum who loves watching old classic movies at home and she loves it !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|More loose ends tied, more new subplots revealed.  Robert is the penultimate Victorian nobleman being dragged, kicking and screaming into the 20th century, while the world and his family discover their own frailties and humanity.  Downton Abbey moves on with the help of its dissidents, Tom, the former chauffeur and Matthew, the son-in-law.<br /><br />I was saddened by the loss of Matthew, as I thought he held the future of Downton Abbey is his hands.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son plays it with all of his friends.  And I've played it as well and I like it too!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A little sad, with WWI and deaths of William and Lavinia, but very good quality.  All the sub-plots are absolutely gripping.  I call it &#34;Upstairs-Downstairs on steroids&#34;.
B00005JLIU|5.0|If you like musicals, then you will like this movie.  It is light comedy with three good actresses.  I showed it to my 25 year old daughter and her boyfriend, who are both music teachers, and they loved it too.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great characters, funny, witty, entertaining.  It has it all. The networks would be well served to have more shows like this one.
0061950726|5.0|Excellent book.  Highly recommend.  Great book for a book club.  Also informative as I previosly was not aware of the orphan trains existence.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you buy this game you will have so much fun taking care of your horse.what are you waiting for buy!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Lots of fun and worth the most I've been playing for hours and I'm still hooked. Almost as fun as the real game. But it needs planeswalker cards
B008XG1X18|5.0|I mostly use pinterest to find new recipes, but there are all sorts of things you can search based on your interests. You name it and pinterest has it...full of all kinds of creative ideas!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great book! Way better than the movie. Quick read. Love all of the books by this author. Wish the book were a little longer.
B007XIC1GI|2.0|Tries way too hard to be dark. I expected more from Marilyn Manson. He's quite intelligent. This book was tired & he didn't even party that hard. So he did a few lines - big deal. Buy Heroin Diaries instead.
B007W4F6M4|4.0|I like how the movie sprinkles some serious into this otherwise comical look at heroin addiction.  At first you think it's so rad to take drugs, but then you realize the s*** storm of trouble that comes with it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's a good alarm app and it does the job well waking me up in the morning. I only gave 4 stars because the app doesn't allow you to set the date, only the time.
B003FFEX8C|1.0|I don't think there's really one redeeming quality about this movie.... you'd be better off reading a book.  effects are terrible, plot is terrible, script was terrible, acting is terrible.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|if you have nothing else to do with your time then this is an OK way to waste it.  1 more word required
B002W5UVSM|4.0|Toole had the ability to put you into his imaginary world. The characters were all extremes and the setting was wonderful. His attention to detail made all the difference. The plot was almost secondary to just enjoying the scenery.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|Very boring Sudoku and lousy game play.  Not at all challenging and you have to push each block and then the number, no speed challenge since you cannot knock out all the 1's, 2's,  etc in a hurry.  Game will not allow you to make a mistake.  in that way it would help if you were trying to learn how to play the game, but if you thought Sudoku was boring because of this ap you'd be wrong.
B001I45UFC|5.0|OH MY GOD THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH!!!! I would definitely recommend this book this book to anyone who likes C.S. Lewis
B0000042MY|5.0|I LOVE this movie, for MANY reasons...<br />one of which being, the beautiful!  Powerful!  Vibrant music!<br />overlapping melodies, both enriching and joyful!<br /><br />powerful, POWERFUL melodies!!!  LOVE!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My first Doctor and the series has pulled me in. Will definitely be watching future seasons of this show. A must for all sci-fi fans.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|excellent choice for ANY home library.<br />Gripping Drama! Excellent actors<br /><br />For those musically inclined--I know many of you, like me, were ecstatic to hear that Les Miserables was FINALLY coming to the screen...<br />It is BEAUTIFULLY done, expect excellent scenes, excellent acting...a few word changes-if you have the play memorized<br /><br />AND, don't forget<br /><br />This movie was intended to convey the feeling, not the music...<br />The music is beautiful and heart-wrenching as it should be, but do not expect all of the singers to be...well....singers.  Expect actors that do a darn good job singing!
B00933JL0A|4.0|My 12 year old is really enjoying this one. He likes the strategy and leadership skills this game has to offer.
0920668364|5.0|perfect gift for a pregnant friend...<br />My FIRST purchase when I discovered I was pregnant.<br /><br />One of the greatest, sweetest, most fantastic books of all time...the pictures may not stand the test of time...but the words are riveting!<br /><br />BUY IT
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids seem to enjoy this. Especially my 8 year old. Worth the download. Fun. Free. What's not to like.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you love the tv series, these are a must read. They go more in depth in the characters. Love them.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I really liked this movie even though it is a rather slow one. Made me think about what freedom really means.
B006QF61VA|5.0|Another one of those &#34;MUST SEEs&#34; for teens and young adults. I rented this for my Grandsons (age 15) visit. He thought most scenes were hilarious. He knows little if anything about the Vietnam conflict, even though his own grandfather (my husband) served two tours as a Marine 1965 - 1968. They don't teach much about it in school?
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Great action movie from all the greats for any action movie fan. Definite buy or at very least rent for fans
B00000251N|5.0|I grew up listening to Neil Diamond, I haddd this soundtack many years ago as a * track tape, I really liked it in the 70's and still in the 2000's, .  I think this disc is the beginning of his introspect compositions.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|It gives you solutions that may or may not require purchase to finish that level.  It's all random and whether or not the game wants to give you the edge to solve or not.. once you know the basic moves it's all in the chance of how the colors drop
B00B2QA646|3.0|The ending left you with an empty feeling, wanting more of the story.  Anna's world could have been more explored.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|For every relationship whether its family, friends co-workers or that special someone in your life... these tools will make all those who cross your path a little more meaningful.  The catch??  Everyone has to read it so that the relationships we have are not always one sided....
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great movie. Had fun watching it. Action, comedy and fast pace. Will watch it again and the sequel. Rent it
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Having an automatic watch is great, there is no battery and no need to wind it as long as its being wear. The shipping was fast and drama free. I would definitely recommend this watch, the price was very reasonable as well.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|love playing games like this helps pass time and fun to play for any age its pretty easy to guess
B00008J2PG|5.0|I love this movie. I already own it in VHS and was so happy to be able to get it in DVD as VHS machine is gone and I do like to watch this movie now and then!
1609611543|3.0|It starts out about wheat and at the end includes nearly all grains. Good information about wheat and how it affects ones system.  It just seemed somewhat overboard to me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very entertaining and easy read.<br />Read it while on a 10hr flight without wanting to stop.<br />Make sure you have tissues handy while you read this.<br />Deff recommend it.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movie's.  I have seen it numerous times and it never gets old or boring.  Sure, the technology is simple compared to that of today but it doesn't matter to me- there are scene's that still give me chills.<br />if you're a fan of Hitchcock or old movies and thriller's this one is perfect.  And recently having heard about Hitchcock's obsession with the movies star, Tippi Hedron, and having seen the HBO movie about his obsession called &#34;The Girl&#34; makes it all the more creepy to watch.  He was actually a very sick man.  Having watched it again after seeing &#34;the Girl&#34;, you realize that Ms. Hedrons tears and fear were probably very easy to play because they were very real.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like despicable me really cool and fun[[ASIN:B00CE8DP62 Free mp3 media & music player for Android]] very fun and my little brother likes it and my cousins
B000WAEK0E|3.0|missing a lot of his better songs...probably only has 1/4 of his better songs ... a little disappointed .....yes a little
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I needed to upgrade my from a smaller bag that I had after I purchased multiple lens' and an external flash.  This bag fits everthing I have in it including my flash diffusers/softboxes.  It even has adjustable straps on the side to hold my tripod.  I literally dont have to carry anything in my hands.  It is awesome.  It seems to be well made and padded well enough to protect my equipment.  I highly recommend this DSLR Backpack.
B009A882D0|3.0|Dissapointed in the third CD, it turns out it was only repeats in live version, not as good a deal as I thought
B005544TRQ|5.0|I ordered season 1 on Monday. It's Ssturday morning and I will be ordering season 2. I am so addicted. Awesome show!!!
B00005NRN9|5.0|An absolute masterpiece ! Wonderful from beginning to end. A pity it is so short !.<br />The blend of storytelling, acrobatics etc.. is amazing.  The sequence with the two &#34;statues&#34; on the water lily leaf is probably the most incredible feat yet. Unforgetable !.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Personally, I loved the original and pt. 3 Dream Warriors, and liked all but 5 & 6 (atrocious), and Freddy vs. Jason was a fun ride.  Also, pt. 7 was really unique and I liked it a lot.This set is a must have, especially in Bllu-Ray.  Pt. 1 was SO clean and clear it was amazing.  It was like watching the movie all over again.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Having seen the movie on the big screen and loving every moment of it, I couldnt resist to have a copy to watch at home.<br />We are amazed on how well it looks on the small screen. It is a great story, and the Cirque Du Soleil never cease to amaze. What will they produce next ? We can hardly wait !......
B00BWJARHO|4.0|good story good acting overdone at times relying too much on special effects. Movie ending somewhat abrupt yet leaves you wanting to know more
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It makes holding me Kindle easier while reading in bed.  I am very happy with the purchase.  Will tell all my friends about it.
B00123LIPK|4.0|I am not a huge Madonna fan but I've always enjoyed her music although this is the first of her albums I've ever purchased.  If you are like me and want a terrific sampling of her \\"greatest hits\\" as well as some of her album music, this is for you
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow subway surfer is the best when ever your bored you pick up your devices and start playing.put.a smile on your face be happy subway suffers awesome the best
B001AQQR2S|5.0|My 5 yr. old daughter loves this movie. My wife and I enjoy watching too. I wish they made a sequel to the movie to see how she develops her new found powers.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|This was a quick and cute read, I was a little disappointed with the ending but overall it was easy to read and I recommend it for teens.
1401902197|5.0|THE BOOK IS AMAZING. IT GAVE ME BACK ALL MY FAITH AND STRENGTH.<br />THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR THE SELLER WAS SPECTACULAR, ONTIME AND WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PROBLEMS. I WILL KEEP USING THE SELLER AND I WILL RECOMEND LOUISE HAY'S BOOKS AND OTHER SIMILAR ITEMS AVAILABLE  TO ANY PERSON WHO ASKED ME ABOUT IT.
B00007J5VN|3.0|The songs are peppy, but not artful. The story/character are ridiculous. The dancing is very good, but isn't well integrated.  ....Dennis Altman
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Great book that leaves you with a nostalgic longing and bittersweet love for our own lost childhoods and those of the characters that we have grown to adore.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like this app! I love how easy it is to pin items and I now prefer using the app over the website. :)
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I had read the book and really loved it.  The movie is done fairly well following the book.  I am glad I purchased it.
161655164X|5.0|If you love art and you loved the game, this is a must buy. Amazing art for and outstanding game.
B004S5C91Q|3.0|Sad to think that this happens each day somewhere in the world!<br />Readers will either like, or dislike, this book - there is no middle road.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|For some reason YouTube stopped working on my kindle so I got this. It's not the best tho every time at the end of the video it goes back to home. When u pause there's ads. I suggest only getting it if u need it.
0670026557|5.0|Excellent perspective really makes you think about things that are taken for granted in the professional environment. Things are definitely not as they seem
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The best release from the Alien saga. You must have this! A lot of extras! extended and theatr. versions very good
B001O1O71C|5.0|This story, related from the point of view of the son of a Nazi Commandant, shows the reader a child's view of the horrors of Auschwitz--and the incomprehensibility of war to children, whatever their heritage. Well-written, brief yet gripping; a story I will never forget.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game for the kids but I play all the time too. Great way to pass the time on a rainy day
B00DURILJ2|4.0|matthew mcconaughey is excellent but his character doesn't quite reach the finish line, he starts out trying to do a tommy lee jones and ends up trying to do a tom cruise, for a guy living on a desert island he looked too well fed, really m/mcconaughey was excellent just could have been perfect with a minor character variation, something more scragley maybe, maybe m/mcconaughey is afraid not to b m/mcconaughey, he could prob use a few seasons stretching his organic character off-broadway, the absolute saving feature of movie is the legally blond whats-her-name says almost nothing, thats when she is at her best, when she is saying nothing, the rest of the acting is utterly superb, a must see , at least once
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It took 2 1/2 days to load... not cool bro... not at all...<br />I wish it would work better....it is lame....lol
B0090SI4OC|5.0|This is a really good movie. Follows the book quite well. Special effects are really good. Can't wait for this next one.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is so awesome I love it. My favorite part of the game is the black suit.<br />The black suit is very cool. I think I control it.
0770437400|5.0|now i see why some amazon reviews aren't that helpful. you just want to rate it certain stars and be done with it.<br /><br />i thought this was thoughtfully researched and written. it covers the zombie apocalypse from the point of view of individuals on a global scale. this book gives me some measure of hope and preparedness for when the zombie apocalypse strikes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best game in the world! i love it its very chaleging ,creative,and egdecational! oh i cant wait intil i play it tomorrow once again
B007MU85D0|5.0|Loved the album! I think that anyone who likes alternative/rock will enjoy this group, I heard one song on the radio and bought the mp3 album
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzell Washington was able to take an otherwise semi-mediocre script, and create a masterpiece.  His depiction of an extremely skilled but troubled airline pilot deserves an Academy Award.  He reminds me of Dustin Hoffman, in the original Midnight Cowboy, or Gena Rowlands, in &#34;A Woman Under the Influence&#34;.  He has the extraordinary ability to make the character entire believable, and demonstrate, as if he is the actual person, the downward spiral that this skilled pilot experienced.  The final scenes, involve his reconciliation and &#34;with god's help&#34;, the revelation to himself and to others, that he was an alcoholic.  A must see, for film noir fans and for action film buffs also.
B0045JEPXU|4.0|my wife started listening to pittbull after hearing him played all the time in her zumba class.  so since she was listening to<br />him of course i had to also. and i found out i really liked him.  we like to dance and his music is great for dancing.  and it makes feel<br />younger then our 60 years.  most adults dont know who he is but all the kids do.  they think tis great that we listen to him
B008AK8FHM|1.0|don't bother reading this one. leaves a lot to be desired, really really really and try again to get the story straight
B0059XTV4Y|1.0|This monstrosity is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever had the utter misfortune of watching.  It was historically inaccurate, atrociously edited, and excruciatingly boring.  The back and forth between two obviously unrelated stories was awful.  Burying my mother again would be better and sitting through this botched amateurish effort again.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is a game that spectators can enjoy nearly as much as the person holding the controller.  The artwork and music are both rather zen-like.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't read much sci-fi these days. I did back in the old days, 1960s and 70s. Just learned what I was missing. I would actually rate this a 4.9. I thought the last line before the epilogue (seeing her dad) was too sappy a way to end, and didn't match the tone of the whole series.
1250029465|5.0|I thought this book was an inspiring, emotionally fortifying book for the heart. The reader shares in James and Bob's ordeals and victories. You take on an affection for them. One of the poignant moments in the book: towards the end, when James thinks he has lost his cat forever, I was bordering on heart-break.  When he finds him again, it is a powerful anxiety-relief for the reader.<br /> It also helped to shed light on homelessness and recovering drug-addicts.  You get to peer closely inside their souls; their struggles; not everything charming comes wrapped in an elegant package and not everyone has the same stability in their family background and upbringing. It helps to shatter any judgmental viewpoints.<br />Glad to see that Bob and James have overcome obstacles in their lives.  I wish them much continued success.<br />I think I am going to buy this book for my daughter.  Absolutely treasured it.
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|I downloaded this app and all it did was erase the progress on the original Star girl, and sync with that. Not happy.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|i luv this show and all the charachters ,it draws you in with each episode..loved it so much i finished one season in a week ..probly less,its very realistic as well im sure i learnd some law and bargaining tactics just watching it laffOutLoud.  :))
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just started Downton Abbey last season and was hooked immediately. I wanted to see how it all started, so bought this download for my Kindle.  I can watch as many as I have time for and at my convenience. The picture and audio has been good on all episodes.  I will definitely buy this service again.
B00E5UEA4I|5.0|I bought this album the morning it released and listened to it cover-to-cover at least three times that day, and I honestly think this might be KT's best work yet. Given her incredible talent and the previous albums she's recorded, that's no small feat.<br /><br />The songwriting is inspired. It's honest and open but well thought out and clever. As with most of KT's songs, there's a lot of metaphor and she doesn't always come right out and say what she's singing about. But you can &#34;feel it all&#34; in the lyrics, in the vocals, and in the music.<br /><br />The tempo is certainly lower than Tiger Suit, but it doesn't feel like it drags. Overall, it's soulful, slowing down a bit to let you savor the emotional connection while still providing some catchy hooks. You'll definitely find your toes tapping along. Though a lot of these songs were written in the wake of personal tragedies in KT's life, the album doesn't feel mournful. It's more like taking a deep breath and looking at the big picture after being hit with something huge, acknowledging the power of the emotion but not giving it control.<br /><br />This album is incredible. I feel inspired every time I listen to it. If you like any of KT's previous work, you will love this album. If you haven't yet heard KT, this is a great place to start. While each of her albums stands on its own in terms of energy, Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon feels like a combination of the best aspects of everything up to this point. KT Tunstall has invited us to join her on a deeply personal journey, and it's a ride you definitely want to take.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is so much fun with the adorable minions, to the costumes, and all of the bananas. You can explore awesome levels and live like the true despicable minions!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|In the vast wasteland of television (Duck something, Kardasions (sp?), Boo Boo), it is nice to find a series like Downton Abbey, a show filled with fine characters and plots,  beautiful clothing, settings and manners.  Is it a soap opera, maybe, perhaps....
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Nikon again got it right with the SB-400.  I use it with my D50 and it works just the way it should--perfect lighting every shot.  The small size shouldn't fool anyone that it lacks performance.  The 2 AA batteries it uses saves the camera battery and pumps out a surprising amount of light when needed.  The low profile and light weight makes for a good feel holding the camera.  There isn't a top-heavy feel to the camera that many attached flashes bring out.  In addition, the ability to swing the flash head up to use bounce lighting makes it darn near perfect for most flash situations.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My grand children love this movie, & I have to admit that I caught myself chuckling at it a few times.<br />  The quality is great, just as described by the seller.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I haven't had that many decent headsets before but I've got to say this is the best one I've had so far, been using it for a bit more than a month, no problems. Awesome surround sound as well as an incredibly good microphone, it has yet to show any wear or tear and the battery is still lasting for 10 hours straight.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price tag on it.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|A must for any true John Wayne fan, almost a remake of Rio Bravo, with different characters. A Great buy.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|It was a little frustrating . Too much hunting for clues to escape on escalator . I would prefer a easier and uncom
B004M8S3Y6|4.0|Good information, make you think about your diet and works outs.<br />Give you good information where to get items needed
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I wish I could clean all my devices and computers this easily.  Fast, simple and effective. If it only did housework too.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Very well acted and scripted and very believable. As always hardly can wait for the next episode! season two even better
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 2 was our favorite. But the addiction continues. In drama as in life, we are the consumers and not the writers, so we take what is given and wait for the next season's balm.
B000GWE44U|5.0|this one of the best films ever made. classic classic everbody should watch this once in awhile  a must see
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some rooms can be solved almost immediately, but some really push your problem solving skills. I am looking forward to more rooms.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I saw some of newer Season 3 and needed to understand where it was all coming from.  This is great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game. it is fun /horsey games same as doing it in life.  The game is so fun I don't want to stop playing
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good game. Keep me busy and my brain at work. I love a good challenge. This is a must play game.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I down loaded this for my granddaughter who is 7 yrs old and she enjoys it immensely. It keeps her occupied for hours.
B000FC146C|5.0|I had forgotten a lot about this story & how long of a life span it ran. A book I never wanted to put down.  Lots of  Austrialan history, lots of love & inappropriate lust, but worth the read. Someone suggested they read this every summer, it might be a new trend for me too.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It works well for me to record my visits with patients.  I'm a chaplain at a hospital.  It does have a few quirks that keep me from rating it a five.  Sometimes it erases my notes and it is really sensitive about wanting to move the picture when I'm trying to write a note.  But it works and I really like it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I believe the character development - especially of Merry and Pip - brought a lot more empathy to them, as a people-group (e.g. Hobbits) than I had thought possible. Appreciable delight!
B00DB31Y3U|1.0|This Application Requires An Internet Connection To Play. It also Crashes After A Minute OF Play On My Motorola Razr Device
B000WBOV1G|5.0|Shark is one of the best action dramas I have had the pleasure of watching lately.  What a shame that the network took it off in favor of some silly reality show.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Notes not stored locally unless you pay for a subscription.  Notes with photos can take forever to load if you have a bad connection, making this a frustrating and useless app.
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|Really Unfortunate; Psychotic, plain and simple. How can you rate something when your opinion of the craft never reaches sanity?
B0023R4496|5.0|I got this cuz I lov her version of Edith Piafs \\"la vie en rose\\"...very happy with this collection of hits.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I loved all the episodes in this and look forward to seeing next season. They are all really great seasons
0143122010|1.0|My review is based far more on a lecture I heard Professor Pinker give than on the book itself. I heard him speak last fall at the Singularity Conference in San Francisco. I found his comments about the alleged decline in human violence to be a self-congratulatory foray in delusional thinking. I live in the affluent Oakland Hills, which abounds with the type of intellectuals to whom Dr. Pinker appeals.<br /><br />This is the kind of neighborhood where bumpers stickers ought to say \\"I aborted my child and then adopted a cat.\\" Here's the thing. Dr. Pinker uses empathy toward pets as \\"proof\\" of a more genteel world. Whatever your views are regarding abortion, Dr. Pinker in all intellectual honesty should have devoted a substantial amount of time to this topic. To say that this is a world that appeals to the angels of our better nature shows the hallucinogenic asylum in which Harvard intellectuals live. One may very well believe that abortion isn't just legal but is also moral, and that's fine. But if you want an honest accounting of the reality of today's world, you have to tackle this subject head on and state why you are literally not adding it to the \\"body count.\\"<br /><br />In other words, Dr. Pinker has set up a world based on his own cognitive biases and seems blithely unaware of this. A truly brilliant author acknowledges such biases and shortcomings in the material and addresses them in candor. In the U.S. alone, we as a society have claimed the lives of as many as 40 million fetuses. The CDC reports about 785,000 legally induced abortions for 2009. To make the math easy I rounded up to 1 million a year since 1974's Roe Vs. Wade decision.<br /><br />Again, the CDC estimates 227 abortions for every 1,000 live births. In practical terms, this means as Dr. Pinker asserts, you're odds of dying a violent death today are much lower than in previous periods. But the odds of having your life terminated before it ever begins are by far the highest in history. Somehow that just doesn't seem to be all that anglic.at just doesn't seem to be all that anglic.
B001QOGYFO|4.0|Okay this has some cool action and who done it ... the main reason I watched this film was was Kate Beckinsale
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I enjoyed the Movies and this collection is great on Blu-ray.  Watch them all and all the extras.  You will enjoy this set if your an &#34;Alien&#34; fan.
B009CG29RK|5.0|This is a awesome movie for the family that will make you laugh so much your side's will hurt !!! Can't wait until they come out with the third movie ( yup seen 2 already loved it ) thank you so much I need this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun little time waster game. Its cute, addictuve, and just plain fun. Glad to have it on my phone when im stuck waiting somewhere.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This was a great fast paced action movie that keeps you on edge and reminds you Don't tick off a protective father!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Add me on GameLoft! SheikMaru<br /><br />Anyways the game was is totally great. other than the tough battles it's amazing!&lt;3 haha
817224164X|3.0|I read this book, only out of curiosity.  Also, I almost stopped reading the book, simply because of Hitler's twisted mind and ideas.  It was only after a college professor friend, who happened to be a retired Episcopal Priest, urged me to finish the book.  My dearly, and late friend, was right.  If you have a grasp of history, read this book.  It is a hard read, but after reading it one can truly grasp Hitler, and the evil that was the Holocaust.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Just like most books verse movie much better in print. Not to much like the movie great read I loved it. A very interesting twist at the end you will have to read it to know it.
B00019074O|5.0|This is where the whole &#34;Police Academy&#34; movie series started.  What a way to start.  George Gaynes as Commandant Lassard really makes this movie flow, the podium scene is a classic.
B0046B3QTG|1.0|Refund requested!! The video qaulity was very poor.  I paid extra for HD.  This wasn't even standard def quality. Please repond.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|This is a really great true story of a young surfing icon coming into his own. Gerard Butler & Jonny Weston both give moving performance's in this real life saga.
B009GFEOY8|3.0|The film is not what I expected due to the fact I couldn't quite get a picture. The first three exposures came out from my polaroid blank and after that I has to play with the lighting a lot to get a visible picture.
B000069HJI|5.0|great record-delivered in a timely manner-an excellent price and a record I overlooked when it came out which was just as good as its predecessors
B009X011UQ|3.0|I think the stand is poorly built, does not stand up well.  It also is rather cheaply made, I would not buy another.
B000069KE0|5.0|great record-owned it on vinyl many years ago and am amazed the whole record is on one disc-great to hear it again and have it again as well
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|I saw Amon Amarth live and had no idea who they were. They blew my mind. They were the first band we saw at a festival and I said to my wife, \\"these guys will be the best band we see tonight\\". They are completely awesome, and this is a killer album. They build momentum more so then any other band I've ever heard, and every song is just like a roller coaster ride. It's so fun to listen to these guys. Buy this.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Bullock does a great comedy in this, only it's definately not for young teens or children because of all the nudity.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It's great fun and entertaining.  It will sharpen up your logic, short term memory and perception skills.  And at a great price!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As a career woman looking at making a transition I really enjoyed this book and felt at times like Sandberg was speaking directly to me. It was a good read I think anyone would benefit from. I did find the second half a bit redundant and drawn out but as someone without a family that portion of the book didn't really apply to me so I suppose it just didn't resonate the same way that it would if I had kids.
1574214276|5.0|This book gives me great ideas for the type of artwork I like to do.  I look forward to some upcoming projects :)
140053271X|4.0|If you only want to read, this is fine. The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color. This model is only print and only black and white.
B002IJ9YR6|5.0|A fantastic story- well written - entertaining for the entire family! The children in this film are naughty but adorable, many great lessons here!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|It's the original musical in digital form so how can you get more than that! Perfect picture and sound, excellent.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Great graphics.  Not too easy or hard,just entertaining.  Wanted the game to last a little longer.  Will play it again for fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The plot and characters are so rich. The cast is wonderful. The era is done so well...even down to each outfit. So amazing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The only downside of this show is that it is short and the next season is long in coming! Waiting for January!
B009WUBERW|4.0|I enjoyed the fast action packed movie. It was well done for the style of movie that it wanted to be.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is epic! I've gotten to the &quot;hammerhead&quot; shark if you haven't played you haven't lived  :) :) :) :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have Kindle on several of my Android devices, what to say it works. Good content, plenty of free books if you look around and varied selection otherwise.<br />Keep it up
B005544V6A|5.0|Both my wife and I love this show.  Great story, great characters, and an all round good time - Amazon Prime membership paying off big time.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I love a good horror story.  This one's not just gore.  It also has interesting characters, all tortured in their own way.  By the end, I think I both loved and hated everyone on the screen.  That's hard to do.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This entry into the series was a wonderful read. The only complaint I have is that I have to wait until October for the next book.
B003JHKORK|2.0|We tried two evenings to watch this movie as a family and it would get to the middle and just stop. What I saw was good, but would really love to see the rest. We are just not willing to lose another evening trying to restart - reboot, etc.  Terrible waste of time.  I love Amazon and love doing business with them. But no more movies for me.  They have the book thing down really, really good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me constantly guessing.  Never knew what would happen next - a lot of surprises.  Love her writing style. The characters are so well defined.  Have already ordered two more books by her.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not many books keep me as interested as The Hunger Games did and  I found it difficult to put down.  It was very well written and I am looking forward to the second book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's pretty fun. It's fast pace. My daughter says sometimes she gets frustrated that she can't pass it. It's entertaining.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I confess.  I like television shows about smart people. These two are very cleaver and their relationship is just plain fun.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I'm not a typical review writer, but what the heck. Chuck Bass was quite the character in this series. Enjoyed it, nice escape from the day to day humdrum.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Have it on both cell phones and tablet. Very addicting game. My 3 year old plays it better then I do.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My parents would love this series.  Can't wait to share it with them and other family members.  We need more material like this.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I dont know why I didnt catch this series when it first aired.  I am stuck like glue.  It's awesome.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I got this app because I love weather. It updated itself and now it has stopped working entirely. Very disappointed.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|It was not quite as sturdy as I thought from the picture and description but because of the price it will work okay.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|It's interesting, easy and amusing. One thing - the main character (Poppy) is a bit, huh, strange girl. But the story is really funny!
0545265355|5.0|This is a nice set suitable for gift giving.  It arrived promptly in good condition.  An interesting story line.  Good reading at any age.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game so do my kids but it has a little bit of blood. so I love it best part is its free
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Lots of little stories that may tie together but not sufficently enough to maintain my interest. I would not recommend this book.
159562015X|5.0|We spend a lot of time trying to improve ourselves. This book says we would do better by focusing on what we are already strong at, and getting really outstanding at those things. Be ready to be surprised... they may not be what you think, and so this can open up some new possibilities for you.<br /><br />We had our whole group t work do this together and it's created a buzz. (Online assessments only are also available.) These results are helping us know who is strong at what we're not, and we think this knowledge about each other will improve our collaboration. It seems it could also inspire coworkers to ask each other for help for a stronger team overall.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I've read and loved the author's previous books so I eagerly awaited the release of this one.  While I find Hosseini's writing to be incredible, this particular book was not as captivating as its predecessors. That being said, I still enjoyed And The Mountains Echoed and would recommend it to others.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|He loves it. This has all but one of the ZZ Top Studio Albums and he is reliving some excellent times and tunes.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Since I wanted to see Red 2, I thought I should see this one first. It had action, humor and romance.
1416987118|5.0|Great book beautiful illustrations! Repetitive and exciting perfect reading for a toddler :) I would recommend this book my daughter loves it.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|I enjoy learning about people who have made a name for themselves because it gives me a better understanding of why they act the way they do. Now, obviously, this movie put Ms. Katy Perry in the best light. But nevertheless, I did like it.
0345528581|2.0|when I first saw the advertisement for this workout, I was souped; I was like \\"ah, snap, a totally different workout\\". Well to me this tape is a bust. I always view tapes before I try them out, and I am not even interested in giving this a go. The workout just moves too slow, and I don't find it challenging for a intermediate level. To me it seem more novice.I have gotten better body weight workouts from amateur trainers on youtube. Luckily this tape is a rental, so I am not stuck with it. I am not going to workout to it.
B0058U0EEO|5.0|Amazon recommended this album to me some time ago, but the previews of the songs didn't seem all that great so I passed on purchasing it. Several months later, one of the songs from this album came up on one of my Spotify stations and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since. There isn't a single song on the album that I dislike.<br /><br />I'm sorry that I ever doubted you, Amazon music-recommending algorithm!
B00571F26Y|2.0|There was WAY TOO MUCH boring/redundant information on the studies, research, and human anatomy, and not enough practical information about how to actually use the information.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|If you like action this is just your ticket.  Mind numbing and without character development.  A waste of time.  Thankfully it was free with Prime.
B003XDVUEG|4.0|These Crocs are not very pretty but very comfortable. I have bought them for gardening and they do a good job.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I was looking for a Gmail app when I found this one. I have a similar app on my iPhone that works great, so I downloaded it. I was initially excited about the buttons to news, recepies and such but soon found that only the Gmail and Facebook button worked. After playing with it for five or six minutes, I deleted it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was really glad to get this cable.  My kindle wasn't charging, and I thought at first that the kindle was broken, but getting this USB cable solved the problem.  I would definitely encourage this purchase.
B000002URV|5.0|I PLAYED THE CD ALL THE WAY THROUGH LASTNIGHT AND IT PLAYED ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITHOUT A PROBLEM, NOT LIKE THE ONE I PURCHASED FROM EBAY WHICH DID NOT EVEN PLAY THE FIRST SONG, JUST SKIPPED AND JUMPED AND WOULD NOT EVEN PLAY THE CD, SO I PURCHAED THE SAME CD FROM AMAZON AND IT PLAYESWITHOUT EVEN ONE FLAW, GREAT JOB TO THE SELLERS OF AMAZON.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I'm a big fan of Marc music this Cd is the best yet I  play it in my car every day I loveeeeeeee it.
1451695195|5.0|Aside from the descriptions of Dr. Alexander's experiences while he was in a coma, I was glad to see that his experiences changed his previous stance of being a polite disbeliever of the afterlife.
B009AMANBA|3.0|The story itself was great; the research put in to the movie was outstanding, but it could have had a little more action.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|if you like robots action & bad guys this is great to see. a big fan of the terminator movies I would recommend it.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|The sound is stellar on all discs and it's nicely packaged so for the price, I thought it was awesome. Some people were bitching about the missing booklets but since I had all of these, I took the booklets from the original issues and inserted them in the jackets. Problem solved!
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I read the book before seeing the movie, seeing all the hype about it. I am a Jennifer Lawrence fan so I was curious on how her portrayal of the book character would go.<br /><br />The book and movie are VASTLY different. Pat just wasn't nearly as crazy as he needed to be for his idiosyncrasies to be plausible. The movie had pat explaining why he had been in \\"the bad place\\" within the first 20 minutes whereas the reader spends most of the book trying to find out why. The father-son relationship, the parents relationship and the relationship between Pat and his therapist were all wrong. The rewrites just did not make sense. The most accurate and believable character was Tiffany, who the screen writers made her look like the only crazy one. It just didn't sit well with me. I couldn't even finish the movie because I was so turned off by all of the changes.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|It's Tull and Mr. Anderson at their very finest! This is an album that needs no label. It serves as a historical landmark in the annals of Rock. Set it beside all the other classics as this one gets an A+!
B00COGY2P2|2.0|Jack Reacher is tall.  Tom Cruise is probably shorter than I am.  He needs to give up on trying to be young and a renegade.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of our all-time favorite movies!  Lost count of how many times we have watched it. George Clooney is hilarious!  Recommend getting the soundtrack, too.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|really good story line not for young children unless you want to have the birds and bees talk as soon as thy see all the corn holing and kissing.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I purchased this App when it was the App of the Day for free.<br /><br />It is quite fun to play when wating for time to play and one I can play together with my 6 year old.
B005LAIH54|5.0|Movie arrived promptly and well packaged.  I enjoyed the original &#34;Clash of the Titians&#34; and this movie seemed to continue in that same style.  It was exciting, adventerious and had a great storyline.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book.  Full of twists and turns!! Can't wait to dive into the next book! And the movie!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Haven't seen the show. Went on vacation and decided to see what all the fuss was about. Loved the first book, can wait to dive into the second!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is something you can't find anywhere else on tv. It challenges you to think and captures yor attention moving through episodes. Highly recommend! Oh and cause you're a prime member, it's free!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This very well acted and written show was awesome! I do get mad how they kill off my favorite characters, but well done!
B000OLROWC|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and loved it. I plan on watching it with my daughters to see if they will enjoy it too.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great book.  Couldn't put it down towards the end. I will highly recommend this book to any female. Finished it in couple of days.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|It was very interesting to hear of her background and the love she has for her fans. Truly her own person and stands up for what she believes she's capable of doing. I liked her a lot more after watching it
B003JH8LPW|3.0|This novel is not as developed as his later ones.  The background research is not there, however his plot line is there but weak.  I wonder what it would be like if he had a chance to rewrite it.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I loved it and so did my children. I would highly recommend this movie if your children like the Halloween thing!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This tale is well written and very funny. Compelling reading. it will be able to be re-read several times as it has a complex plot with several ongoing stories.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I returned it because it was too biig for my 8in Kindle Fire HD. wish u had something neat to fit the Kindle Fire HD.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|They need to make it change from night to day it would make it a hell of a lot better so it will seem more realistic and amazing so ok I hope you do this update
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|awesome!  really enjoyed it and honestly didn't think that I would since I am not always into historical-like shows<br /><br />give it a chance
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Best game ever it is the best game I ever played and I am not kidding about this it is even FREE and it should be 5 dollars this game not a disappointment
B002XZNHG4|5.0|Wow.  Just watched Annie Hall again (over 30 years after it was originally released.)  Impressed with how ahead of its time it was in 1977.
B00BKTFABE|3.0|Kindle did not really want this product to be used to take pictures. If so, why are they trying to turn users into contortionist. Each picture I take leaves me exhausted from trying to find and center the person, object, etc. I'm too tired to share my video experience.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I was happy to find this DVD for my friend. He had looked everywhere for it, and I found it easily on Amazon.  A great surprise for him, as he has looked everywhere for it.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I came to this series just looking for a time filler.  I found my time filler and more.  They hit the deck running and pull no punches so it does not take long to realize if you want to watch the series or not.<br /><br />We start out with an inexplicable and mysterious problem.  The public can never know but there may be some sort of diabolical cabal behind this problem. FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is recruited to help track down the culprits. She is out of her depth in the science behind the problem and needs the help of an extraordinary institutionalized scientist Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) to help decipher the problem.  Unfortunately Walter is not allowed to go out by himself so Olivia must also recruit his son Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) who also helps her and us interpret Walter's thoughts and fringe technology.<br /><br />\\"Fringe\\" uses the standard go on forever series formula.  First there is the immediate episode problem it either starts out at the front end or gets built up very shortly then we have our antagonist(s) usually temporary for this episode.  We usually find that he has a good excuse to be a bad guy and we can empathize but they have to clean up the situation and live happily ever after.  Laid over this is the extended series problem we get everything from vague hints to gratuitous gore.  The antagonists (some likably evil) for the series sections may or may not die can mysteriously be written to come back and whose purposes are never totally explained so that we must watch the rest of the series.  The advantage of having a \\"Fringe\\" sci-fi theme is that when they paint themselves into a corner the next episode just rewrites from another angle as if the corner never existed; this way we have multiple seasons without any problem of having to tie up loose ends or lose main characters.<br /><br />You can buy the season separate or in different bundles. Some people worry about the cost of doing it one way or the other.  The reality is how fast you are going to look at this.  Are you going to have a Fringe marathon till your eyes bug out or use it as an occasional night out?  Do the times, do the cost, and do the math.ow fast you are going to look at this.

B005D4YHN4|5.0|well i got one about ten years ago a 9.5m so i got that again and it seems toosmall i have exchanges for a 10 and now i am fat and happy<br /><br />also i tried this color combo and i am not gay enough to make it shine<br /><br />i think in ten years or so i will go back to basic black<br /><br />all in all great shoe
B000BU2DC2|5.0|Good audio and video quality. QOTSA fans will enjoy. Arrived on time and in good condition. Make sure and watch the bonus clips!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nothing better for weather information, and that says it all.<br /><br />I'd pay for it, but it's free. ' Nuff said.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is a huge improvement over the fitbit.  So far a little sketchy with the Withings app, but I am sure that will all be worked out.
B000001F26|5.0|What do I have to say ??? It's Eric Clapton and being a Big Fan and Eric being one of My Mentor's I don't think I need to say more !!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best android games I have ever played and its even better because it joins with Facebook
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This is one of the most expansive socio political critiques of the modern global condition, including close ups on China, Israel/Palestine, the USA and a whole bunch of other places all in the guise of zombie sci fi. Brilliant and timely work.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Playing on 1st gen Kindle Fire. No bugs or crashes, although some levels were pretty picky about where I placed items.  A little repetitive and puzzles were really easy, but graphics were beautiful. Too many unsolicited hints in the form of sparkles. Also too much stilted dialogue. Love that it's from a woman's point of view.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|NEVER thought that I'd like this show, esp after all the hype but the hype is well deserved! Watched all 3 seasons over the span of a month or so. Well written and acted. You really get to care about the characters. LOVED it and can't wait for season 4 late this year 2013.
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|I was enjoying the movie and got to the point where DG had moved the NEVE into his own space.  Then the buffering started to crap out where the movie was playing but there was stupid error message running over the screen.  After 8 attempts over about 1/2 hour, I finally gave up.
B000002ITW|5.0|Need I say more.... OK, one more time... It's CSN&Y...... The Woodstock Generation Lives and We Love it !!!!!! Peace
0345803485|1.0|This is so bad that I can't get beyond a few pages. It came highly recommended to me by a fan/friend. I told her I didn't think it was my thing. She insisted. I relented. Here is a taste of what I was treated to... (page 283-284)<br /><br />Him: Dear Miss Steele, ...Now please don't refer to yourself as \\"some woman I f*** occasionally\\" because, quite frankly, it makes me MAD, and you really wouldn't like me when I am angry.\\"<br /><br />Her: I'm not sure I like you anyway, especially at the moment.<br /><br />Him: Why don't you like me?<br /><br />Her: Because you never stay with me.<br /><br />Then she says to herself, \\"There, that's given him something to think about.\\"<br /><br />Really? Dull, dull, dull. Sounds very juvenile. There are three books of this stuff interspersed with lots of f-bombs, lip biting, and giggling. I am not sure who the audience is for that, but it's not me. I can't believe this is a best seller. It's hilariously bad. SMH
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I wanted to like this device, I was trying to convince myself that it was better than the Fitbit One, but it just can't beat 4 years and 3 revisions of experience. I own the Withings Smart Scale, which is amazing, and I wanted to keep within that ecosystem, but it isn't cutting it.<br /><br />I owned both the Pulse and the One at the same time for a few days and I had my gripes with both, but the Fitbit won in the end. I will list how the Withings is better:<br />- Easy to slip in and out of the belt clip<br />- Touchscreen and history is a great addition.<br />- Bluetooth 2.0 support, no need for a dongle for your PC. (I own an Android)<br />- The heart rate monitor is a neat feature, but it is nothing my phone can't do.<br />- Micro USB charging is convenient and you don't need a proprietary device to charge.<br />- Elevation is measured in feet, and not floors.<br />- The battery life is impressive, but isn't any better than the Fitbit One. I never went over a week without the \\"20%\\" notification popping up.<br /><br />Now I will list its drawbacks from the One:<br />- The overall build quality feels cheaper.<br />- Belt clip is not as tight and it HAS disconnected from my body a couple times.<br />- Soft touch plastic scratches way to easy.<br />- No vibrate function, which is honestly very handy with my Fitbit.<br />- No right/left handed options. So when it it clipped on your right side the display is upside down.<br />- No way to calibrate your stride.<br /><br />** 8 Aug 2013 - I don't know if the Fitbit does this, but I lost an entire day of activity because my Pulse didn't turn off of sleep mode. I think that this device would benefit from a firmware update that would automatically turn off sleep mode when it detects steps for a certain amount of time. I was running around airports all day and noticed tonight that I slept for 22 hours...**<br /><br />Sure the ability to view history and take your pulse is neat, but those functions are rendered obsolete whenyou are using the device with a smartphone. I can view history on my phone, take my pulse, track my diet, and much more. Fitness trackers are made to show you how active you are in the day and night. At the end of the day, Fitbit has a much more refined product. Sure it isn't compatible with USB 2.0, but the Fitbit can be synced using the computer. I spend hours of my day next to a computer, and syncing is no problem. Just not immediate.<br /><br />It's the small things that the Withings wins in, but that's what they are, small things. Fitbit has used their experience in the fitness market and made a great upgrade to the older devices that were already fantastic. Maybe Withings will come out with a armband that will blow things out of the water.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Totally Captivating<br /><br />This book grabbed me and kept me prisoner to it's pages from beginning to end.  I really enjoyed all three books.  It's too bad there are no more to come!<br />Duchess of Bda.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Don't be fooled by the silly title of this movie.  I reluctantly watched this movie on HBO expecting the worst and was blown-away!!  This Tim Burton produced epic is far better than any vampire film I've seen in DECADES.  So, I bought it on Amazon.  Had to have it in my collection.  Also, some of the best Special Effects I've ever seen.  BUY IT -- You won't be disappointed.
B00CATSONE|1.0|There must be lots of other biographies of this great scientist and inventor better than this one--look for them!  I was really disappointed in the quality of the writing.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The main three characters (Olivia, Peter, and Walter) make the show. It's fun and original. I love coming home from work and watching it.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I bought this months ago and this Thule backpack is still kicking.  It is my school, work and travel bag and has not ripped or shown any where up to this point.<br /><br />I will continue to only buy Thule especially at how much better it did than my oakley.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is a movie I really enjoyed despite myself.  Loved the special effects and I thought the story was good.  If you're a big kid at heart, take a look at Thor...really fun to watch.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters was better than I thought it would be. I wasn't sure one the moderen day weapons fitting in with the time period the witches are being hunted. However I found out that it didn't matter how they was being killed, its how it was done. I did not matter to me the weapons being used it was the action that keeps you watching. Its like pulling old world with new world. It worked!
0399157565|1.0|I've read every Kay Scarpetta book, and agree with my fellow one-starrers that this one is the worst entry in a series that has been steadily declining for a while now.  To spare those of you who haven't read the book the misery, let me sum up the major plot points:<br /><br />1.  Kay Scarpetta is brilliant.<br />2.  Every man she meets wants to sleep with Kay Scarptetta.<br />3.  Every woman Kay Scarpetta meets (other than her niece) is jealous of Kay Scarpetta and/or wants to sleep with her husband.<br />4.  Kay Scarpetta and her boring (but brilliant and attractive) husband have tedious conversations in which they make veiled comments about their suspicions that the other one is cheating.<br />5.  There's a cute cat.<br />6.  There's a cute dog.<br />7.  There's an endangered turtle for some reason.<br />8.  Oh yeah, there are also some murders, which are miraculously solved out of the blue in the last few pages, with little intrigue or rationale.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Good story about the life paths of two pilots who met briefly in the war skies over Europe and then again much later.  Gives an insight to the state of the Luftwaffe nearing the end of the war and some interesting facts about the ME-262.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzles..keep you engaged for hours. Want next one. Company did great job on design and effects. I would purchase another by this company.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a really great game. The realist horse games I've seen its a lot of fun.  I like that it has all sorts of different sceneries and different ways you can dress up your horse the one thing I think that would make it better is more horses to choose from.
0393317552|5.0|This is Diamond's classic work on why some societies wiped out other ones over the course of history.  His main answer is that \\"geography did it\\". He argues against racial differences being responsible.  Jared is convincing on the importance of the forces of geography - but much less convincing on the irrelevance of racial factors - where he does little more than offer anecdotes and warnings about the negative consequences of race-driven xenophobia. Indeed, Jared's crusade against racial factors being relevant seems more driven by political correctness that by science.<br /><br />It is written as popular science. The highlight of the writing is the account of the meeting of the Spaniards and the American indians near the start.  Jared can spin a good historical narrative when he wants to. However, the book has few such narratives.  In fact, it is long, repetitive and boring. Overall, it's a bit of an odd mix for a popular science book.
B00DU74U74|3.0|The movie was not all that bad. Not one I would pay to see in the movie theaters. It's something to see once and thats about it. Not a movie you want to see over and over again. Stephanie Meyers is a good writer, However she did better with the Twilight soga.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not visually friendly. Loved the format of the old version better. It was simply, straight forward and direct.  If this had been the original format I would have never downloaded it..
B00338QENI|5.0|Recommended by a coworker- we do biopsies occasionally.  Opened my eyes to tissue storage, culture, and research.  What an important thing informed consent has become.
B000B6CODO|5.0|I Love it when you actually get what you expect. Its hard to find used dvds in good condition, and not get swindled. This was a great purchase, in great condition, no sratches. Very satisfied
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I am not one for going the distance with a trilogy, but this one was well worth it! What a loss for readers that Stieg Larsson passed away after turning in these three manuscripts. The characters are so intriguing and well-drawn, that even though in number and complexity, they are reminiscent of those peopling a Russian novel, each is still distinct and immediately recognizable. I will miss Lisbeth Salander, Kalle Blomquist, and the riveting adventures that drew them together and pulled me into their story.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I watched this movie thinking and wanting to compare it to Jack and The Beanstalk! It was a little different but kept to the modern day version of Jack and The Beanstalk. Good movie....
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Yes, i loved it the colors and sound were fantastic in blue ray, previously i had tried to download it from i tunes and it played in stills and was not refunded by Apple. Wont forget it.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The computer (i7 Intel Ivy Bridge CPU) runs at room temperature  and I literally cannot hear if it is on or not.  I have to look at the  'on' light.<br /><br />I have this installed in a mini-tower, which is possible but when moving the computer I have to make sure the cooler stays on top of the momboard and doesn't 'pull' it down.  It's a big fan.
B00979JTWK|1.0|I cannot see this blu-ray. It is NOT all regions. I even bought it twice because I throught I had chosen incorrectly the first time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best app ever I'm totally addicted I love Dave and collecting bananas I will play for hours a day
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I have had so many people talk about this show, ranting and raving about how great it is.  So I decided to buy this and try it out....unreal.  It really is a good show.  It sucks you into the plot and all right away.  I had to go out and buy the second season as well.  It is great, I definitely recommend this.  The black and white pilot episode is a fantastic feature.
B000V39KDO|5.0|I'm no film expert, but I love the animation mixed with the real action. It's violent, but the animation dumbs down gore.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I loved it . I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the new companion Donna .  They made a great team .
B002K0WBXW|5.0|S. Bullock is so adorable. This is a fun film and of course Betty white adds another level of interest.
0812982622|5.0|I read this book to gain some insight into North Korean culture.  This book provides a very descriptive look at life in North Korean prison camps and urban centers.  It also provides an interesting plot that keeps you intrigued throughout the narrative.  I enjoyed this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the best on my device.  It's really fun and good for all ages. Thank you.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  I can't get enough and am watching with anticipation waiting for season 3 to go on sale.  My only wish is that the seasons where longer with more episodes.  Definitely worth the purchase and adding to your library.
B0007939NO|5.0|I had never seen this movie before untill I purchased it. I am very glad to own this film. I think many others would enjoy this DVD.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Exciting , great story line .I am a certified Doctor Who addict . I can't for the next season to start !
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Good. I use it by looking for words I do not get in percy Jackson, and for funny words. YAY:)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green's writing is fantastic. The story is touching and full of heart. You need to read this book, you won't regret it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I beloved the prices for the cars r extremely high though u can make much money on one drive the best cars r one mill. But overall the game is great.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Buying this was a tough decision as reviews are mixes. In my case worked perfectly as described. the product looks very sturyde and well built. We had a blast the first day no complains so far!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend this product.
1400069289|5.0|Very good! Simple, clear, and useful. One of the best books I ever read. I recommend it. You'll see life in a different way after this book.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I think Amy was one of favorite companions . I was glad they added  Rory . Two companions worked great !
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Bought this knife as an upgrade to my gerber prodigy. The knife itself is great, hefty,solid feeling. The sheath on the other hand is crap. The belt dangle is WAAAAAAAAAAY to big. And the sheaths retention is way to tight.
1250007208|5.0|Marissa Meyer takes the old Cinderella story in puts it in the future. She has elements of the original story while including some twists of her own. I love reading books that take the classic fairy tales and reinvent them. I would recommend this book to someone in a heartbeat.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is the best  free online game ever  I do wish it had more maps  it did not slow down my kindle
B001LV5OOY|5.0|I remembered the first time i heard this band and instantly i knew this band was gonna be huge, when i first bought the album from the first listen i could not stop listening to this album. From the first song till the last track it's simply amazing and grabs you instantly. It was my favorite album of 2009 and one of my top favorite albums of all time. It's a must have for any fan of rock music especially if listen to bands like THE KILLERS, JOY DIVISION, EDITORS, THE NATIONAL, STELLARSTARR, and THE BRAVERY just to name a few. Great hooks, big choruses and very catchy.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Gave this a 5 star, but have no idea how they're going to pull this one out of the bag in the next season. No spoilers, but I really don't see where they are going with this after killing off most of the police department.
B000002AT6|5.0|Since I learned that James Horner is responsible for the soundtracks of big hits such as Titanic, Braveheart, A Beautiful Mind and Legends of the Fall (this one) I decided to start a small collection of his works. This is music I can, literally, do anything to. It gives life a dimension a bit deeper than the &#34;every day&#34;, it gives it texture, as it does in the movies for which he has composed soundtracks. Beautiful, soaring, quiet, sorrowful, bored, thoughtful, just about every human emotion is captured by James Horner and yet is so different for each movie as to be easily recognizable from the others.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|her voice counts not a flashy &#34;Lady Gaga&#34; appearance. I like her modest unpretentious look. Definitely she is an artist.
0446310786|5.0|Terrific story for all ages that provides a great focus on strength and character.  You hate to reach the end of the story.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|love everything about this game. Been waiting for this to come to the kindle and i cant wait till frontier comes to the kindle. Hurry up with Frontier kindle version!!!
B004DMAZQK|4.0|Love the white lies they bring something different on this album then their previous album, when i first heard BIGGER THEN US i was excited to listen to the  rest of the album. I got the album when it first came out, RITUAL is not much different then TO LOOSE A LIFE but it does take the band into a different direction but not dissapointing, it has more electrical elements then their debut but it still sounds like them with their catchy choruses and big hooks. I prefer their first album just by a little but if you like their first album then you will definately like RITUAL.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was extremely easy to connect to your TV. All cables and connections you need are provided. This picture quality is great. So easy to operate. I used my Ipad2 and it is just perfect and so affordable!! You will love it.<br /><br /> You can go the You Tube right from your device like my Ipad2 and hit a button and voila you are watching it in your television. You can still search and open other screens while your Chromecast is playing.<br /><br />This is the best for only $35!!!
B005QMOZOO|3.0|I was disappointed with this book.  Too many characters, confusing at times.  I have enjoyed all the other P.D. James books that I have read.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Excellent Cast! What a great movie! I love to watch this! Highly recommend to anyone who likes superhero movies. Can't wait for the sequel.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A beautiful and poignant film.  A must have for history lovers.  Daniel Day-Lewis was amazing as was Sally Fields.  Tommy Lee Jones in a class by himself.  This is a 10 Star winner!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Missed this show when it first ran on FX.  So glad I read the review and started watching it.  Great characters, wonderful acting, top notch writing.  A great &#34;escape&#34; for 45 minutes each episode!
B001ECE6D0|5.0|STEREOPHONICS is a band that you must like if your a fan of bands like OASIS, they write some catchy catchy songs, can't believe i've never heard of this band till this year which is why i started with their BEST OF... and since then i've collected all their albums. The lead singer has an amazing voice and makes his voice fit perfectly with what the band does musically. Check out this cd and if you become a fan i recommend you collect the rest of their discography.
B0063IH60K|5.0|In my opinion this is the best of the solitaire games.  It's my favorite. I just deleted the other one I had.  This one is easier to win. I do like to win a game every now and then.
B0065CCM76|5.0|A great selection of tunes! I could listen to them for hours! You won't regret this purchase for a minute!
B004NS710C|5.0|I can watch this over and over. Very real and suspenseful. My son loves trains and since he watched this movie, he watches it almost every day.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Lots of jumping around time-wise making this a bit difficult to follow. There were 4 main actors dressed differently so it was kind of interesting to figure out what character they were playing.
0307463745|5.0|Ir is an inspirational and excellent , I reccomend its lecture flor all new entrepreneur. One of The best business book I have read<br /><br />Regards
B002W7J3SO|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock has, as usual, produced a movie to keep you interested and trying to guess what is going to happen next.  Cary Grant, as a hardworking Advertising Executive is mistaken for someone else. When he can't convince them of his real identity, conveniently, he has been the object of a pickpocket, he runs. Looking for a safer location,he runs into a building where there are people, so that he is safe for now. When he finds himself catching a man who is falling toward him, he discovers there is a knife in the man's  back. In his efforts to try to save the guy, he pulls the knife out, thereby giving the people around him, the idea..wonders of wonders, he had put it there. Now he is on the run as  murderer. Keeping all the players separated, and putting them into 'Good guys.gals' and Bad guys/gals, crosses many roads, and states, when he boards a train going 'away from here'. With no ticket, now he is eluding the conductors. Saved by a gracious lady, who shares her dinner table and then her room with him, puzzles him to ask, what she has to gain by helping him. Eventually they also share bad guys, guns, and a hazardous mountain climb.<br />A true Hitchcock movie and ending. I can recommend this to Hitchcock fans as you already know what to expect, and all others<br />who are curious and are looking for a movie not filled with explosions, incredible feats of acrobatics and too many guns.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This movie is an every other year must. Watch the movie that launched \\"The Sopranos\\" series. The cast and crew make this a must see drama in a sea of wannabe mob style efforts!
1451668945|5.0|I have read almost all of the books by Mary Higgins Clark. She just knows how to keep your interest. I would recommend all her books to anyone who enjoys reading suspense stories.
B008220AVW|5.0|SHE WAS RAISED IN A STRONG CHRISTAIN BACK GROUND. I KNOW OF NO ONE THAT IS HOT IN PURPLE HAIR.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|Christina is back!! She mixes a lot of genes into this CD with true Christina style. Although slightly more tame for Christina standards it still packs a punch. This woman has an amazing voice and is still bringing it on for her fans New and old. Love it!!!
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|A very through accounting of the acrimony between the isolationists and the interventionists in the U.S. prior to Pearl Harbor, with Charles Lindbergh and President Roosevelt representing those positions.  One gains a new understanding of the pre-war history and the recognition that the impasse between Congress and the President today is not unique to the present.  Neither Lindy nor FDR emerge as heroic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line great acting  lists of twists but a shocking and sad end to the season can't wait for season four
B005HSL626|2.0|This game is great fun for a little while then it locks up, you play one to two rounds then nothing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was on level 32 when I accidentally sent it to the cloud along with another game. The other game came back to my Kindle Fire where I left off. Imagine my surprise when I loaded Ice Age and I was back to the beginning.  I had 23 friends from all over the world.  Now it is all gone. To say I am upset is putting it mildly. So just be careful or you could lose everything.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|When I first saw the game I was excited, but when I got into it and started play and saw I had to have tokens to play that was disappointing. I would like to play as much as I want. Without relying on tokens or you can give more tokens daily.
B00942Y4IY|3.0|Certainly not a great movie. But good enough to entertain when up late  :-)  Plus it started a good TV series
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great television series... witty, smart and fun.  Have watched 2 of 3 seasons and look forward to Season 3.  Seasons 1&2 were on Prime, but 3 charges so I'm recording the series to avoid the expense.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard, it should be standard on all Android phones. It's accuracy is just awesome. The predictions are great also.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a constant challenge and never boring. l haven't made it very far but it sure is fun trying.  great game.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I was enchanted by this movie. It consisted of two stories and was just beautifully done. The acting was excellent. Madonna did an extraordinary job of directing.  I will watch this movie many more times. I absolutely loved the movie from beginning to end. Bravo Madonna!
B0025CS2GU|3.0|I laughed in most of the movie but it wasnt the best or anywhere close to my favorites on my list
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The movie has a decent story core but just can't put it all together. Tom Cruise just can't make a believable lead character. Top Gun was a good flick ... haven't seen a good TC movie since.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is one of the best-written books I've read in a long time. This author does not shy away from writing candidly about sex and violence, yet neither is inserted gratuitously. The writing is never boring. Just enough detail is provided to enable you to get to know the characters and setting to get you involved. The plot is exciting and unpredictable. I will now be reading Flynn's other books.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I have been looking for this product in the stores for a long time now and could not find it.  I was very pleased when it arrived so fast and the product was exactly as described.  I would absolutely recommend this seller due to the outstanding customer service I received.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Worth watching again a few years later.  Wish it had made it more than 2 seasons but cancelling good shows seems to be Fox's niche.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Sydney,  circuses.  Aboriginal lore.  Love.  Serial killer.  Add HH, sent to help solve the vicious murder of a Norwegian beauty. IF you've read any or all of the remaining Hole novels, you will enjoy the young detective. If you've just found Harry, be warned he's addictive.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This was such a great movie. It was so ramantic and yet so touching that i cryed! It was a beautiful love srory writen well. I loved it!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Nice and simple game with fun goals to meet. Graphics are good but not overdone. Totally worth the 99 cents
B0093QDGEO|4.0|Surprisingly funny and heartfelt, 21 Jump Street was as good as I'd heard, and way better than one would expect from a cheap remake. The script by Michael Bacall, from a story by Bacall and co-star Jonah Hill, deftly punches every passing cliche in the face. (One character's meta-monologue about the stupidity of rehashing old ideas for nostalgia's sake is particularly hilarious.) Directors Lord and Miller, of MTV's Clone High and the similarly way-better-than-you'd-expect Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, mix clear storytelling, energetic camerawork, and a sure grasp of both comedy and character beats. Hill and Tatum have great chemistry together, and Tatum in particular finally sheds the marble-mouthed stolidity of his earlier films to have some long-overdue fun. Bonus points to their costar, the awesome Brie Larson, for actually GAINING weight to look more like a real (and lovely) high schooler, instead of some plasticized Hollywood ideal. Expect to laugh long and heartily throughout, and feel glad you saw it afterward.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is one of the best horse apps you can buy.  I would recommend this app to anyone who loves horses!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is great! It keeps you interested by the way is it written from the point of view of Death, and you learn that the book isn't just about a girl who steals books. This book will leave you in tears, is beautifully written, and is something that you will read again!
0307341577|3.0|I dunno what it is about this author but I had the exact same feeling after reading this book as I did with Gone Girl. It's not that Gillian can't write...she is amazing at her ability to let words flow naturally from brain to paper. It's just that two things seem to be at work in this book and in Gone Girl:<br />1. By the time you reach the end, you get the sense that Gillian just was in a hurry to finish the book. You'll notice a heck of a lot more colorful analogies, methaphors, and witty sentences towards the first part of Dark Places. By the end of the book, it just felt like...well I suppose how a runner in first place knows they are in first place and can see the finish line from 50 yards away, so she dashes into a mad sprint towards the finish line. The grace and the cadence of her run gets lost in the desire to bring the race to fruition.<br />2. It also feels cheap. I won't ruin the ending for anyone on here (because I absolutely hate when people leave spoilers in reviews), but let me just write that, as was the case with Gone Girl, Dark Places just...ends. There is no crazy twist or page turning revelation that will leave you thinking about things well after you've put the book down. I mean, a book like this conceivably could only end so many ways, and if you were to put all these ways on a chalkboard and pick one, you would have a good chance of being right about your answer (I was when I started to read this book). But at the same time, the ending that is in Dark Places doesn't give the reader any real sense of closure. I can't go into details without ruining it, but I there was definitely a major head scratching moment when a certain character's acceptance of another character's complacent involvement in the murders is completely ignored or not really discussed. And Gillian seems to have been completely forgotten about this crucial plot point for the sake of just getting the dang book over with!<br />Not to pick on Gillian because again, the girl can write great sentences and make you feel and see things which only a real writer can, but she certainly has a long ways to go in terms of originality and how to successfully complete a book. So far, she's 0 for 2 in that department. I will read sharp objects (I'm working my way backwards) and see if it's any better than these other two, but something tells me it will probably be even worse. It's hard for me to accept the fact that in an interview Gillian did on tv, she admits that half way through writing it she had no idea who the killer was going to end up being. I am sure this kind of thing is natural in writing, the idea of not having a completed idea in mind when first starting to write, but this is one of those stories that absolutely HINGES on the fact of the author knowing who did it before even a single word is written. The fact that Gillian didn't know this and openly admitted to it...well, you'll see what I mean when you get to the last page. It's obvious she has only written half a book, much like she did with Gone Girl.rite great sentences and make you feel and see things which only a real writer can, but she certainly has a long ways to go in terms of originality and how to successfully complete a book.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I've had the wired version of this headset for a number of years and offered a review of those at the time.  Over the years the ear cups on the wired version basically disintegrated and the plastic hinge holding the cups to the band broke (more my fault than the headset although the plastic hinge is not high quality).  I was impressed with the sound of the wired version in gaming offering an immersive surround sound effect via USB rather than needing a dedicated sound card.  The wireless version is basically the same headset without the need for a wire so likely over time the same earcup disintegration will occur but hopefully I can be more careful with the hinge.<br /><br />The wireless version also uses USB but eschews the need for a wire running from the transmitter to the headphones.  The headphones have an internal rechargeable battery with perhaps a 4 hours of life if the software gauge is to be believed.  The headset is charged by a mini-usb connector extending from the transmitter (impressively long wire that wraps around the base) which is also of good design.  The software is much better than the wired version I had.  When the battery gets low you can hear a tone in the headset and you can get a notification on the taskbar (which won't be seen in game).  In a pinch the headset can also be used while plugged into the charging base which is a nice feature.<br /><br />My main issue, besides the construction which I know is likely to not hold up as well as I'd like over time, is the manner by which you turn the headset on/off.  There is small button the side which I have not found to be 100% reliable when I press it.  This is particularly annoying when I try to shut it off.  I hold it in but it doesn't always take and so I may have to try it a few times.  I'd prefer it just shut-off itself when no audio is present for a time, but I have not found this to be reliable.  It would also be good if it would turn itself on when audio is detected, but it doesn't do that at all.  The battery seems weak to me and so I find myself charging it more often than I'd prefer.  Not a big deal but frankly the wireless nature of this given the on/off and charging is not more convenient than wired.<br /><br />Overall, like the wired version, these are a very good sub-$100 headset for gaming.  I would not buy them for music listening but they are fine for this if that isn't your main intention.  In retrospect I would go back to the wired version based on the annoyances I mentioned above, but if no cord is a big deal for you, these are certainly respectable.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a very fun and additive game. I would recommend this to everyone that I know. Best part is its free! :)
B00846REIS|5.0|This is such an awesome book! I'm feeling so many different things right now. I just love both Eva and Gideon. I think this is well written and so complex. I really enjoyed reading this story and it will be on my mind and with me or quite some time.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Where do you even start with this? Django is incredible. Tarantino again proves himself a master of character, dialog, and quirky style - not to mention exhilarating action. It's certainly a worthy follow-up to Inglorious Basterds and once again Christoph Waltz is phenomenal.<br /><br />The color and clarity of every scene were breathtaking in the theater, and are captured perfectly on Blu-Ray. Image quality could scarcely be better. It's a must-have.
0375851569|5.0|We bought these books for our 2 year old to match the youtube story he loves to look at over and over of green eggs and ham. He loves the book and some of the other ones will grow on him. Green Eggs and Ham has to sleep in his bed with him ;) We sometimes hear him telling the story to his blankie at night.<br />We also own most of them in our native language of Dutch and these our great to teach him some English as well.
B004YF5F8E|1.0|I HAD TO RETURN THEM TO THE SELLER. THEY COULDN'T BE VIEWED IN THE UNITED STATES (REGION 1).  THEY WERE MADE TO BE VIEWED IN REGION 2 OF THE EARTH (ORIENTAL).  I EXPLAINED THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE REGION 1 FROM THEM AND I'VE HAD NO RESPONSE BACK FROM THEM IN OVER 2 WEEKS.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: \\"I AM SHELDON\\"!<br /><br />Having just completed its sixth season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down from its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!<br /><br />Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now theoretical physicist PhD in his 20's with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.<br />His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually frustrated and somewhat confused girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, received a far more enlarged role this fifth season. Even if her addition opened up some girls-night-out moments, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.<br /><br />Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to \\"help\\" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.<br />Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems incapable of breaking the gravitational pull of Penny. Opposites do attract, at least for a while.<br /><br />Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution before he blasted into space himself. He also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).<br />The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, until very recently still lived with his mother, insisted on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.<br />Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless before bursting into laughing. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by (his now wife) Bernadette, who is cute as a button and very likeable, but also cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the \\"poor Indian\\" defense although his father is a rich Bentley driving doctor. His character, even after he may have found his own soul-mate during the sixth season, remains underdeveloped.<br /><br />Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.<br />One of the best sixth season moments: when lovely Alex triggers her jealousy radar and has the mind to keep her man happy. And the boots should definitely stay.<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ay.<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Must read if you are a liked o a am and a we are at a the a am I
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've played MTG on my PS3 a couple of years back. This is way better and very nice. You can build your own decks. There's sealed deck play, challenges, and an awesome campaign. If you like MTG at all then you need to get this game. Very fun!
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|I didn't like the feelings this book produces however it did provide some interesting book club discussions. The movie however was absolutely horrible.
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|This looks like a fun app,  but it isn't compatible with android 4.3. The app is quite buggy and crashes a lot on 4.3.
B0074MTTEK|4.0|Nessa Carey carries off the telling of the epigenetics story with an obvious love of her subject. In so doing she invites the reader to share her awe and wonder at what we are learning and consider its implications for our health and well-being. Like all major scientific discoveries, the field of epigenetics is upsetting the applecart of what we thought we knew, in this case about genetics. Perhaps most useful for the reader are her clear explanations and analogies to help us understand both the meaning and the significance of the science she reports. There were times when the minutiae of details became tedious, but that is the nature of this level of science. Here, it demands something of the reader to slog through those parts to find the next gems that are coming. The good news is, the gems do indeed arrive. This book is not for the casually curious. For those lay (non-scientist)readers who really want to know and understand the basics and scope of epigenetics, this book is for you.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I ride the bus and it picks up the Wi-Fi s as we pass.  If your at a park or the beach, it will let you know where to set up<br />your camp.  Pretty handy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Performs as advertised.  More accurate than the default battery monitor my Kindle Fire came with.  Easy to install.  Simple process to calibrate.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid, and still love it as an adult.<br /><br />Its a great for a movie night with friends or significant other. :)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Loved the characters in this book. Very easy read. I cried a lot but others in my book club did not cry as much?
0064471837|5.0|I made the mistake of picking up this book on the way to vacationing.  Once I had dived into the original and engrossing world of Sabriel, I found it nearly impossible to extricate myself, at the expensive of sleep hours and sightseeing (it certainly did not help my jetlag).<br /><br />The story begins with a flashback that transcends the realms of standard fantasy right away - the Abhorsen, whose family is a line of good necromancers, dives into death, depicted as a river, to retrieve his child, using bells as weapons to defeat the dead.  18 years later, the child, Sabriel, is living in an English-esque boarding school on the other side of a wall that blocks magic.  The story starts proper when Sabriel sets out to find her father after receiving a mysterious message from him.  Aided in her journey by an ancient spirit manifest as a talking cat, and a boy who was frozen in a block of wood, Sabriel's journey across the lush Old Kingdom is original, emotional at times, and exciting at others, but always engaging.<br /><br />Sabriel is often sold as a YA-fantasy novel, but this book and its sequels are really a must read for all ages.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I've bought all five seasons this summer and had to watch all before August 11, one of the best drama tv shows I've ever watches. I can't wait until August 11!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|A good plot ,if you are a science fiction fan. There are familiar elements of sci-fi woven together for a good tale.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Would make a fantastic film. It is written in is unique style that makes the book quite enjoyable. I would call it a near future Apollo 13ish tale.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book is entertaining, but it has a great message: to choose yourself, before you can help others.  The author eviscerates many seemingly tried-and-true assumptions--home ownership and employment among them--in a way that makes you think about the where we are as a society and how to position yourself now to take advantage of that reality.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|When I got this game I had no clue how it was going to be. As soon as I started it I instantly fell in love with it. The courses have many secrets and paths, as well as 3 different times, past, present and future which can be explored by time traveling. Sonic also has an exclusive move, the super peel out which is faster then the spindash. The game play is also faster paced then other classic sonic games. I had no problem beating it for the first time, the only real challenge I had was metal sonic and the final boss. After you beat the game once you unlock tails, who can fly over many obstacles and reach hidden items. And there is other hidden content you can get by getting all of the timestones under so many minutes and completing all of the stages in time attack in a set amount of time. Also the game has both the English and the Japanese soundtracks available for your choosing.<br />This game is truly one of the best classic sonic games.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Excellent writing and acting, well paced, and I enjoyed watching 10 episodes back to back.  This is my first time so have no comparisons to give.l
B000SEIKIW|5.0|I read the Brief History of Time, and this one did not disappoint.  It's a great little book, easy read but gives a nice overview of modern physics.  it is good to have a prior understanding of the theory of relativity because he does not go into detail on that.  Hawking also makes no mention of the more controversial interpretations of quantum mechanics and how they relate to our fundamental understanding of reality.  i highly recommend this book
B003YYKPMM|5.0|this film is one of my favorites ever. A true depiction about friendship that is transcending cultural boundaries, that heals deep wounds and enriches everyone's lives who come into contact with the participants.<br />Beautiful and touching the heart on so many levels,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|HIs books are just such easy reading.  I could hardly put it down.  One more of his books that you just have to read!!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film, lots of action! Pretty cool seeing all these guys kicking butt together. Looking forward to expendables 3!
B0094M2ITG|4.0|good movie, good story, it takes a bit to get into but great once you sit down for it. enjoy
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My only complaint could be as easily applied to mobile browsers at large. we need better copy and paste capabilities.<br />Evernote needs better capabilities for capturing information from web pages, like addresses.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I already have this on my computer, but I like the fact that I can take eBay with me where ever I go. Especially if I am checking on my bids or taking my shipment
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Saw the movie first (I live in Pgh). Book was better - you were able  to really find out what Charlie was thinking, and it was nice to be able to go back and re-read the poem.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I just absolutely love all of his books though, again one more that I loved!  Have to read it!!  Great love story.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I originally played this on my phone. I liked it so much, I had to get it for the kindle too!  It's highly addicting!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|One of the all time great movies.Finally in the sound and picture quality i have been waiting to have and meld into.Sound track in the top ten.And Peter O'Toole is so great you think he'll have a break down any minute.Almost too much to see.And repeated viewing it grows deeper.Wow.
148951418X|4.0|Shows a number of ways you can mount and use the Go Pro but falls a little short on operation and techniques for using it.  Gave some creative ideas though which werer great.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is fun. sixteen, fifteen fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten nine eight seven six five four three two one. can I post now?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and entertaining.  Especially when you find yourself having to kill some time for a few minutes. Definately worth the download.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I loved this when it first came out and I had to see it again before going to see RED 2.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie! Never thought I'd like it since it starts out slow, but gosh the rest of it is just awesome!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Grabs you.Good restoration.Wonderful soundtrack.Great writing and direction.A story most people will get into.And wonderful acting.My favorite: Godfather 2.Make that Popcorn first.
B001TODCII|5.0|Full of suspense. Liam is very good at acting this role. If you have a spoiled daughter and a wife that has remarried, this is a Must See flick.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Alot of action.!!!!! The Rock  was pretty good in this movie,although I loved him best as the scorpion king !!!! But,to.me the storyline was a little thin.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Great movie for anyone that likes baseball. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and many others star in a great movie comedy about baseball.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Definitely wish more games were like this one. Not impossible and not too simple. This was the best game I've played in a long time.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I'd give it 6 stars if I could. It was hard to know which shook me more profoundly: Lincoln's single-handed, unrelenting dedication to passage of the 13th Amendment, or Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln. It's hard to speak of admiration when such words fall so far short in describing either.  Thank you, Mr. Lincoln.  Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|Beautifully scripted and excellent performances by the actors. The quality of this movie was not what I expect to see when it says HD but still was very good considering the age of the film. Lots of puzzling twist & turns. Everything you want from a suspense movie!
0880796863|3.0|The book that comes in the set is hard to read because it is so small also descriptions are not as detailed as I have read from other decks, so it makes it harder to read. The cards themselves are not bad.
0060899220|3.0|What a jerk! But what an entertaining jerk.<br /><br />I came to this book knowing very little about Anthony Bourdain. I knew he was a chef, a TV personality and a writer, but not much else. My wife, formerly a big Food Network fan, raved about Bourdain and how he put down a lot of so-called TV chefs. She raved about this book in particular for its insights into restaurants and the business of cooking.<br /><br />The guy can tell a story, for sure. But he has contempt for just about everyone he comes across. Customers, owners, fellow chefs.<br /><br />American cooks \\"are a lazy, undisciplined and, worst of all, high-maintenance lot, annoyingly opinionated, possessed of egos requiring constant stroking and tune-ups.\\" Vegetarians are morons and \\"a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn.\\" Most restaurant owners are \\"knuckleheads.\\" Cooks who consider themselves artists: \\"Shut the f--- up.\\"<br /><br />And then there's his description of the dinner-rush crowd, with its orders filling up the kitchen - \\"boiling up the line like a Drano enema.\\"<br /><br />Oh yeah, Bourdain can write. For a guy who went to chef's school, he can write up a storm. But I stopped reading two-thirds through. I get it. The restaurant biz is full of dim-wits and foul-mouthed drug addicts, including, apparently, Bourdain himself.<br /><br />For 150 pages, it was eye-opening entertainment. For another 50 pages, it was repetitious. And the last 100 pages? I can't say. I lost the energy to finish.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I have really loved this show. I like how all the classic fairy tales are entwined with each other. Can't wait until season 3 comes out!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the challenges the game gives you and the little characters you can be.I love the part where you can defeat vector or meena.A thing that is bad is sometimes the game doesn't respond correctly but oh well.I hope you enjoy it too.<br /><br />from<br />cuddlefree.
0385349831|4.0|Hard to imagine anything topping The Alchemist as a tale of how the external world tailors itself to self-actualization. Nonetheless, Manuscript was spell-binding, and Paulo's dedication to his spiritual craft is wonderful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's just like temple run and sub way surfers but better because of the little yellow guys it's basically like a up grade
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Simple to use.  And like my mom said &#34;use it or lose it&#34;. I don't want to lose my brain so I'm using it
B00CF34B2I|1.0|the game is awesome I know but u cant download it no matter what u delete I have kindle fire and it doesn't download on it
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|The sounds r great but u never want to put it down.. keeps me busy while he watches the games during preseason.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|With the exception of the words stupid and idiot used in this film, I like the entertainment it provides for my 2 & 4 year old boys.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I expected a Victorian type of story but this was very modern touching on many of today's challenges.  The meaning of each type of flower were interwoven through the novel to tall each character's story.  Well written.
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|plays WMV videos, in the past I haven't been able to play them on my Kindle Fire - I am so glad that now I can, thanks!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|For those of us that like Tetris this game is perfect.<br />Enjoyed this game very very much.<br />I recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Replaced my old charger that had stopped working. Works fine. No complaints. Let' hope it doesn't stop working too. Thanks
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Had this app for 7 months and loved it. Then they upgraded and you have to scroll over to get to your hourly forecast and that's after you have to close out the giant box covering your current weather that says &quot;achievement unlocked&quot;. Um I just want the weather so why do I want all these banners and game ads popping up? I don't. Already deleted it off my phone. Oh yeah, and the radar is messed up 90% of the time - either won't load or shows no rain when it's pouring outside.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The insight into a lifestyle so unlike our  own was hard to comprehend. It gave me some understanding as to how difficult it must be for other cultures to embrace our life style when they have no experience with it. Their lives are so harsh and meager--and it is all they have ever know.  They have nothing to compare it with. I hope that a lot of the cruelty was &#34;literary license&#34; and not harsh reality.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Plot was different than the usual mystery/suspense book with great flow.  Lots of character development & you are never quite sure whether you like or loathe some key characters  I THINK I might be disappointed in the ending but not sure yet.  It was one of the better books I've read this year.
B006TLFIAQ|4.0|Killer Elite is a great action packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good action movie.
B00881PTRC|2.0|This game gets a very big thumbs down.  It was difficult to play<br />and not a very rewarding gaming experience.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Another great album from 5FDP; Although I do believe that there is more \\"yelling\\" than singing in this album - But personally I'm ok with that.<br /><br />This album really reminds me a lot of some Pantera songs/albums; Some people may disagree with that statement - Just a personal opinion.<br /><br />If there is one thing I could recommend to any fan reading this review it would be - MAKE SURE YOU SEE THESE GUYS LIVE !!!; 5FDP puts on an incredible live show - I look very much forward to the upcoming tour supporting this album.<br /><br />For less than $10 on the digital download; This album is well worth the price.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|YOU get to choose the beautiful music sound by sound. Want the ocean? How about zen music? With this app you can choose both relaxing sounds to play at the same time !!  Or choose from a multitude of tones and melodies A uniqe app. I am SO pleased I downloaded it !!!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book was easy to read and comprehend, and offered highly useful tips on how to be  more social and become more comfortable with being around new people or being in an unfamiliar situation.
B000009HF2|5.0|I am a huge Peter Frampton  fan and of course this is his classic album. How could I not love it??
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I was enjoying this game until it crashed and will no longer even open on my kindle. it is such a shame Bc it was delightful until that point. I only got a few hrs of play out of it before it quit working. great graphics and fun concept....bad crash problems.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show with a lot of drama that guys can dig. Wish I could be on this show. Hand it to the writers and cast for a very under appreciated series!
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great calculator. Very easy to use. You can do any math equation on here that you could do on a regular calculator. Nice to have one at your finger tips at all times!! Can't buy any other calculator at this price!! lol
B003G4W49C|4.0|I am probably the last person alive to have read Ender's Game but I enjoyed it. At times, it was hard to put down.  Some of the gaming parts of it became a little tedious for me, but I thought the book was imaginative and quite different. I did like the detailed way the author wrapped it up at the end. However, I'd skip the author's forward.  He's quite the blowhard and goes on an on, defending himself against every little criticism he's ever received!
B008UWEFU6|5.0|I just loved it! The story, the characters, everything! This is a fantastic love story and I read it at least 5 times. So if you just want to fell good about love or if you are wondering if it is out there for you, just read this trilogy. It took me back to that special time when I fell in love this deep and forever.
B00406O7YK|5.0|Loved the music, costumes, singing, dancing, etc. All of the actors were tremendous in their roles. Barbra Streisand was superb as Dolly Levi ( I cannot imagine Carol Channing in that role). It was fun to see a young Michael Crawford, too. A movie that will keep you singing for days afterwards.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app BUT the only thing is that it &quot;cant play the video because its in youtube&quot; err something like that but its really help full because it gets me all my musicand videos and things like that&hellip;I think its worth 4 stars &asymp;-&gt;
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Found myself wanting his journey to end. Caused this reader anxiety on the deprivation of all who came in the path of Harold Fry. Sometimes scary, sometimes touched, but always kept reading.
1401324649|5.0|From the first sentences, it hooked me.  Then as the plot unfolding it was even better. There were some funny things that happened that made me laugh, one of then was about an elephant !  Will not give away the ending, but it was very &#34;interesting&#34;. :)
034552554X|5.0|This was a bookclub book and I enjoyed it so much I purchased the book for my daughter-in-law who works with flowers.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel.  The original is very entertaining.  I want the arsenal that 'Big Daddy' has to work with.
0307271080|3.0|This book is overly long, tries to deal with too many topics and failing to do any of them justice.<br />The author seems to generalize racism, portraying maybe some experiences she may herself have had in America and overlaying them across everyone in a nation of over 300 million people and this just demonstrates her arrogance.<br />Her blogs are angry and really turned me off particularly as the protagonist chose to come to the USA and then decided to work in breach of her visa illegally. Didn't she do rather well because of the people she met? seems to me the guys who she came across were the ones being used. I am not American and understand that you end up being an observer in another country and culture but to be so angry was weird to me personally.<br /><br />Finally to break up the Nigerian family to achieve her own ends is a \\"love story\\" and gives you a lot to think about but really it was all a bit mythical.<br />On the upside, I hadn't appreciated how few ethnicities are represented in magazines here and this was shocking. Her writing created some interesting discussion at the book club but not one of us liked the book and none of us would recommend it to anyone. We are a multiracial group. That is the only reason I gave it 3 stars otherwise it would be 1 star!<br />Finally, if you read a recent interview she gave:<br />Q  Do you see any differences in how your work is reviewed in the U.S. compared to in Nigeria?<br /><br />A.<br />I'm very pleased that more Americans than I thought are reading it in a way I hoped it would be read. Still, it seems it is mostly American readers who most miss the fact that \\"Americanah\\" is supposed to be funny. I laughed a lot when writing it (although it is a bit worrying to be so amused by one's own humor). But I suppose race when bluntly dealt with does not blend well with that wonderful, famed American earnestness.<br /><br />Take out from it what you want but I just found this arrogant, condescending and honestly if sheexpected us to be sitting laughing our socks off at illegal immigration, predjudice and a family being broken apart by having an affair -then I am sorry but I ain't laughing

B004HD61KE|5.0|Great book, u could not put it down. I look forward to reading the next book. Thank you for the read
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app works pretty well. I still haven't figured out how to adjust the text size on the screen. Easy to use and navigate.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Good app for kindle that helps me be able to do a quick search on a subject or person. Good to have.

0767812166|5.0|I bought this because I remembered it as such an enjoyable movie.  It can be viewed by the whole family.  I still love it!
B004X2M9VY|4.0|The silence were a welcome addition as an enemy with very creative characteristics, possibly rivaling the weeping angels in awesomeness. I have to admit though, that they might have trouble reappearing in the future while still posing a major threat. However, I've the utmost confidence in the DW team to make it work if possible.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|If you like political dramas, you will love House of Cards!  All the actors perform wonderfully.  Kevin Spacey nails it again.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a game that doesn't take data to play.  It is very challenging and makes you concentrate.  I like it.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I've always been on the fence with this band, but this album puts me solidly on their side. Lot's of good hooks on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|excelent... it's so funny and amazing app<br />I recommended for anyone<br />enjoy<br />I love the monkish and Gary is so cute
B005D4YHP2|3.0|Got sick of cheaper sandals having the uppers separate from the soles so I ponied up for pricier and more dependable product.  It is well worth the extra cost.
B007SGM084|5.0|I heard all sorts of things about this book from reviews and friends. I finally decided to read it myself and was pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't put it down.  It was a beautiful, though very different love story.  I hope she writes a sequel!
B002R88G5E|5.0|A touching tale, spanning a large canvas. Gives an insight into the lives of women in Afghanistan, especially under the Taliban regime. Though a work of fiction, it is just so well written that one tends to believe that perhaps this was the way things were during those days. Its certainly a &#34;must read&#34;! Loved the way the story ends!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like You Tube.  I really like the old classic country music videos and music.  I also like the old commercials from the 50s and 60s.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 12 and 13 year olds really wanted this movie. I wasn't sure I was going to like it but we all sat down to watch it together. I'm so glad I did! This movie is charming. Watch it...you'll love it.
0071762345|5.0|The author practices what he preaches.  He is accessible on Twitter and encourages you to tweet him after reading his book.<br /><br />I read this before interviewing for a job in social media with a Fortune 100 company.  It was helpful.<br />I recommend this to small business owners who are trying to figure out how to market through the different platforms and for those in traditional marketing who are becoming more involved in social.
B008JFLWLE|3.0|I found this little app interesting.  I was surprised. At what it could do with mathematical calculations. The problem stems from the ease - or rather, difficulty - of entering the data. Timing is essential. If entered too slowly it automatically calculates before the entire equation is entered. It would be preferable if there were a &#34;calculate now&#34; button instead. It is also prone to misinterpreting or misreading stylus entries. But when it works, it works fine.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|This story was fun and full of magic. Young Peter fights against evil in this wonderful fantasy that kept me and my son thoroughly entertained. Will likely be read again the future.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Item received almost overnight, making it easy to use my Kindle Fire without unseemly delay.  A little disappointed when original part died, but oh, well...
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app makes it easy to get on Facebook and keep up with my facebook friends.  It is a good app for the kindle.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved this book can't wait to read the next one<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is now one of my new favourite authors!!
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Disappointing.  This book seemed very disjointed and confusing to read.  There was much that turned out to be immaterial to the story and only added to the feeling of confusion.
B004ZNA5JO|4.0|Good Floyd style with a couple of hits as well.  Gilmour's guitar style is mesmormizing, one of the group's best.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian has a leg amputated right at the start of the book. It's hard to imagine losing a limb and to do so at such a young age is harsh, but Sebastian has no time to lick his wounds; the war drags his father away and leaves him with his fragile family and a store to run.<br />Sebastian's family is an odd bunch of characters that you can't help liking. The setting in Vienna at that time is very interesting and the characters that come into the family's life illustrate a multicultural society and the growing tensions really well. Fischer does a great job at exploring Sebastian's ideas of what his place in society should be. Sebastian starts dating one of the assistants who comes with her own baggage, while the war is only happening in the distance.<br />I liked the subplots; in particular one was very entertaining in which several rich women spend their time psycho-analysing and going to séances, as was the fashion then I think this was the start of new ageism?). Another subplot takes the story to Galicia, which was one of the main areas of the fighting and shows a different side to war times, in contrast to wealthy Vienna.<br />Sebastian is well written, unpredictable and an interesting historical novel, and is also a coming of age story about a young disabled man and his journey to self-acceptance. The book ends on a positive, inspirational note, and also with a wonderful twist.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I don't consider this a bad thing:This is one of those films that makes you wish you had read the book first, but I had not, so I am reading it now. I will probably watch the movie again after I finish the book.<br /><br />As someone who is interested in string theory, I was captivated by the film's intermingling of time and space. Wouldn't it be delicious if there was a place in time and space where we could actually &#34;get it right&#34; -- especially at those crossroads where we feel we have erred so auspiciously on this plane?
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|This  is a really good show. Kevin Spacey is amazing, but the entire cast is great. When will season two be available?
B00C7L8DM2|2.0|My wife and I have totally different tastes in movies but we both like Aaron Eckhart (for different reasons) so we decided to give \\"Erased\\" a try. We gave up after about an hour. It's not that it's terrible. It's just that it feels like 100 movies you've seen before, none of which were very interesting in the first place. Formulaic and forgettable. Sorry, Aaaron.
B000XAR2EE|4.0|Great chemistry between Sean Connery & Harrison Ford. Over all, probably the most humorous of the Indiana Jones pictures. Also has a lot of heart, especially the relationship between Indy & his dad.
B00A6J9SM6|4.0|Step by step instruction of key concepts and underlying understanding of power pivot engine.  We'll worth your time and money.
B006PKV2QU|5.0|Great story book and perfect illustrations to go with it. My son enjoyed the book immensely which was the perfect end to a great day.
B008JFUN50|5.0|\\"e·ly·si·um\\"<br />/iˈliZHēəm/<br />1. The place at the ends of the earth to which certain favored heroes were conveyed by the gods after death.<br />2. A place or state of perfect happiness.<br /><br />If you enjoy the following you will probably LOVE Elysium:<br />Sci-fi, District 9, Mad Max, action, anarchy, conspiracies, futuristic weapons and robots.<br /><br />At first my main attraction to Elysium was that it was from the makers of District 9. I wanted it to be just as good. And oh, it was! Visually Elysium is similar, but the story is unique and fresh. All the characters were well played. Matt Damon rocked it, and if you need help convincing your girlfriend to watch this movie tell her Matt looks smoking hot. But seriously, the story line is excellent. It gets you thinking, and sticks with you.<br /><br />Despite the worthwhile message, I won't be letting my son watch this one until he is MUCH older. I would not advise this movie for those sensitive to violence. Be prepared to see some bodies literally blown to pieces.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a pretty good game. It's harder than Cut the Rope but if you enjoyed that game, you'll like this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I kept wanting to learn more and more about the Hunger Games players, their families and, more importantly, the evil that persisted no matter who was in charge.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. I love Pam's sense of humor and writing style. The way she has tailored these 9 experiments is perfect for the message that she is attempting to get across. These experiments are easy to do and you don't need any special equipment. I have to say that not all of them worked for me in the time allowed, but I am an amateur at this and because I followed her advice to the letter, I did not give up, just figured that there was something that I wasn't seeing. Sure enough, they all did eventually work. What a fun way to change your way of thinking. Brilliant idea and a great read!<br /><br />Kathi Casey, author of [[ASIN:B00AB3QWWQ Beautiful Sexy Skin For Women Over 40 - What The Cosmetic Companies Don't Want You To Know About Skin Care...]]
B006S08RLU|4.0|Really wild ride from the first minute. Not a movie with predictable plot. Very creative and Tatou is absolutely wonderful.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is a fast paced crime novel that'll keep you reading until the end. The relationship between the two detectives added an extra dimension to the story and it worked well. As for the killer, well, you'll have to read it to believe it. Highly recommended.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk has been one of my favorite bands for years.  Got this quickly after it came out.  Was not disappointed.
0812993845|3.0|This book wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful to read. It was deinfitely not up to the Kinsella standards though. This should've been published under the Madeleine Wickham name instead.<br /><br />It's a cute, okay, easy to read story. Good for an flight or beach but not anything to go rush out and buy.<br /><br />It revolves around two sisters, Lottie (the typecast flighty sister) and Fliss (the inevitable serious sister). Fliss is going through a divorce and Lottie is hoping to get engaged. Lottie gets upset her boyfriend not proposing and instead hastily agrees to a marriage to an old, slightly off his rocker, boyfriend from a summer fling. Fliss does incredible stunts to prevent the wedding from happening.<br /><br />That's it. The entire story. It's a Sophie Kinsella book, I'm sure you can figure out the ending.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Hi I'm mrs Islander. I've been a Shakira fan for some time, I'm part Spanish, and I understand some Spanish. She makes me move. Her singing and dancing are incredible. This CD is in English and I love it. I also have Shakira CD in Spanish. She is just so talented. Me and hubby listen to Shakira all the time. I can't wait for more Shakira CDs.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|interesting movie to watch. to see them sailing off into the sunset at the end was too cool. I never liked her before for breaking up someones  marriage but I do like her as an actress
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love sci-fi,and having this alien invasion - survival show, it is amazing, great story, amazing characters, aliens, great mix
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Bodies: Staged Fright goes at about a million miles a second.  It's a thriller, a family drama, a comedy, a terrorism story, with a little Royal Tennenbaums thrown in for good measure.  There's so much in the story you sometimes don't know what to make of it, but the narrator -- the youngest of then Callahan clan, Neil -- keeps a steady hand on the storytelling and keeps you glued to your seat.  If you want a quick, fun summer read with a little more depth than your average thriller, check out Bodies:  Staged Fright today!
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headphones are very nice (I like the freedom to walk around the house and still be able to hear my music), but sometimes - when you have the software for the device running (which you get off the website) - it will output sound blips.  These drive me nuts.  I just turn off the software when that happens - but it's still annoying.
0312323867|3.0|This story follows the timeline after Something Borrowed but in Darcy Rhone's point of view. You find out how she experienced the final admission scene from Something Borrowed and then it carries with the events that happened.<br /><br />Slowly, she falls from  grace. She continues to take everything she has for granted, treats her remaining friends as servants to her life, and assumes she'll always get her way.<br /><br />The story kind of falls to pieces when she calls Ethan and heads to England. The entire storyline revolving around Rachel and Darcy was believable until this. I found Darcy internationally moving to be sort of jumping the shark- and it happens early on.<br /><br />Then it becomes very cookie cutter and general chick lit. She continues to fall from grace,blah blah blah, dates the wrong guy, realizes who the right is all along, and redeems her entire life. The epilogue was even worse. How do you spend 30+ years the way Darcy was and then suddenly you're entire personality is changed? \\"Oh, love did it.\\" No it didn't. Yes, I understand it's just a story, but this sequel wasn't up to the standards that began with Something Borrowed.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Enjoyable,addicting. Love the challenge. Can be played by any one.  Plays well on the kindle fire H D.  Will continue to play until I can not beat my score
B000VDDWE2|5.0|liked this movie, watch it all the time, and know this could happen to us in the future if we don't do something about how we are destroying our earth with what we do today.
B00DW36G32|4.0|I was more interested in seeing how they could make Robert De Niro and John Travolta work out in a movie such as this. I didn't expect much, but was actually impressed with the flip-flop of predator/prey that took place. I didn't even recognize John Travolta at first. He plays a great crazy Bosnian. Some of the graphics are a bit intense so be ready to squirm if you don't like the sight of blood or torture.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Started and finished this book in less than 24 hours. Second chances come in all shapes and ways.  Cannot wait to hear more about Bob!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Another of King's books where reader fear isn't the main point, but expression of an idea, or exploration of a setting is.  Loved the narrator, the eventual ending, and the set up.  It's no Buick 8 or Dead Zone, but it's worth the time to read it.
1781162646|5.0|Yet another book by SK that I thoroughly enjoyed. King has an ability to draw readers in with a lot of his books and this is definitely one of them. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover. I will say it will be in my top five with Under The Dome and Duma Key at the top. The Kennedy one was just as phenomenal. King has definitely redeemed himself after a few years of books I didn't much care for. Must ready for the SK fan that has been waiting for good material.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|The story continues with all the intrigue and family affairs. Read the other two first! Will this be the last?
B0002V7OI8|5.0|there are some of these types of movies where the world might end in the last few years. It's almost like these kind of things will happen with what's going on in the world.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read two other books by this same author and loved the past two, but this is clearly his best. It reads so real; the author puts the reader in the moments, makes the reader feel the personality of the characters.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A good book that talks about life's ups & downs and ways of dealing with them.<br />Making money and living better, staying positive.<br /><br />[...]
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this a lot to pass time. Easy &amp; fun with enough hard hands to keep you on your toes.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this movie, best music, great actors, costumes, sets, has been added to my top 10 list of movies!!!!!!!!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|You'll have a clear understanding of how what you eat affects your hormone levels which affect your body fat/lean mass.<br />Read this book. Know how to eat right things for fat loss. Be satisfied and be lean. [...]
B005HIEFC4|5.0|this is a really fun movie to watch and both of the actors worked well together. I'm not sure I can tell the difference between the regular DVD and the Blu-ray format
B000QCS8TW|5.0|There are no words sufficient to describe GMMR's writing style. It doesn't unnecessarily complicate itself, though many may mistake that for too simple. He paints a colourful world full with a variety of complex characters, each not lacking depth or dynamic. It's a must-read.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game!  OK, so it's kind of a slow mover, but you get to build a DINOSAUR PARK!!!  How cool is that?!  I play for five minutes or so once or twice per day...some days I forget, but whatever.  I like the missions.  I like finding new DNA to research.  I like seeing my dinosaurs grow/evolve and rearranging the layout of my park.  I hated the farm games.  I love this one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found the start of the this book boring, but if you, like me, find it boring at the beginning, don't let that put the book down. The most intriguing and original book I have read in a very long time! What an imagination both on the part of the writer, Gillian Flynn, and her characters, Amy in particular. You first hate Nick, and think he weird, a cold bastard. Then all that change.  Then, you first like Amy, feel sorry for her and sympathize with her, even if she comes across as shallow, but then all that change... This book is amazingly brilliant!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Fun fantasy sci fi action packed. Lots of fun to watch for any age. If you like Iron man and other Marvel comic characters you will love it.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Not bad, but you really should do something about those VEVO - related music videos. I have to go back to the Dolphin app to get a better performance.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I loved this movie but I am into this type of movie where the only thing you don't see is all the blood shed and violence the movie makers feel they have to shove down our throats
B008OOYALE|5.0|Wish i could link it to the one on my phone but to cute not to love anyway. Turely a great kids game or child spirited adolts who just like cute dragons.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I love this movie.  My kids love this movie.  It's funny, sweet, and a little bit twisted!  I was so happy to find it available on Amazon.  I let my son watch it while we grocery shop.  He's not whining while I buy wine.  Win-win.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Works great! Just wish it was free to play more games rather than waiting for tokens sit show up or having to buy them just to play.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|We love Kurt Russell. He is really great in this movie.  So glad it was made available on Blu-ray. Thanks/
B004DES92U|4.0|A great return to mid-century last, a psychological twist and perhaps even a spoof on the classic film noir, French as only the French can do . . . highly recommended.
B007MDB71O|5.0|what a great movie and the concept of being able to be telegraphed to Mars and see all the wild things that John saw and be able to jump all over the planet and then end up with the beautiful princess.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|This movie barely kept my attention. the writing and direction were terrible. If you like constant gun fights for the sake of gun fights, maybe you'll appreciate this movie. But, if you want to feel some kind of connection or understanding of the folks involved in the shoot outs.....forget it. Don' t waste your money on this flick.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son absolutely HAD to have this for his birthday.  I told him it was a waste of money because he was going to put it together, leave it where my three-year-old could reach it and tear it apart, then the pieces would end up all over the floor and I would step on them, scream bloody murder and then throw them away.  I was right.  'Nuff said.  In all fairness, he did love it...and he still has MOST of the pieces...the landfill has the rest.
0385341008|4.0|The book was in great condition.  The story was humorous as well as informational.  I am traveling to Guernsey Island on a cruise, so it was particularly appropriate.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|clunky, awkward, unusable. deleted it immediately. It just was not what I was looking for in a calculator. hated it
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Even with all the modern scientific technology and futuristic concept the story managed to stay interesting with surprising turns. And of course Morgan Freeman always brings a heightened quality of charisma and believability to any of his characters and movies. Tom Cruise seems to get better with age as he brings an intensity few actors match.
B00DP94Z2W|5.0|Metal album of the year. Jason Newsted is back with a vengeance. Great band and no filler tracks here. Great from beginning to end.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Nice book.  Not quite as good as I expected, but a light, easy read when you don't want something really heavy.
B001NKI60W|5.0|GREAT MOVIE...LOTS OF GREAT ACTING AND MUSIC AND SINGING. THEY JUST DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MOVIES LIKE THAT ANYMORE...TOO MUCH, KILLING, SHOOTING, SEX, VIOLENCE!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Brilliant app, very accurate. Been looking at weather all over the planet, no place that this app cannot find. Definitely recommend it!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I don't care for this game, my family likes it.  It is difficult to play on Kindle, they like other games better.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Had me guessing and in suspense. But the ending was a huge disappointment.  I would have had Boney and Nick get together.
B00CPTUNBK|1.0|To most people, it's no big deal if there are no subtitles, even if the product description states that there are.  But my daughter has autism, and that's the first thing we check for.  She won't even watch the movie, since it doesn't have the subtitles.  We only have the option of receiving an exact replacement, which makes no sense, not a refund and I'm very disappointed.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I could hear Tina Fey's voice throughout the book.  Being a big fan of hers, it got me through it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an excellent book about a true hero. I will warn you parts of this book will make you tear up. I know I did. I can't wait for the movie!!!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Rick Springfield...who knew?! Dave Grohl gets to do all the cool stuff. If you love rock music then watch this doc.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Got this by accident, don't like it at all, it comes up in a different format than the regular facebook link, and when you use it, it is hard to find the regular link.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|AWESOME. LOADS OF FUN. GREAT TO PLAY WITH FOLKS YOU DON'T KNOW, CAUSE THEY DO NOT TAKE IT EASY ON YOU.
B008MM9630|4.0|Love this game! Cute premise for a farm game :) Only thing that keeps game from being five stars is inability to play same farm across multiple devices...
B00A7KKPDK|1.0|I've never read me, my, I, mine so many times in ANY book. My horse farm, my house boy, RECYCLE AS THE WORLD IS DYING, my beautiful blue eyes, my koi pond, WRITE THANK YOU NOTES, my Portia, my kitchen, my driver, BRING A GIFT TO A HOUSE PARTY, my postal worker, my household help, HOLD THE DOOR FOR SOMEONE, my production company, my house, I skip along, BELIEVE YOU ARE GOOD, my show, my show, my show, my agent, I meditate, my production company... Get the point? Also, I listened to the audio book as I do regularly. I've never been asked to buy the book which happens at least three times in this book. A great disappointment; ask for a refund.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I was disappointed by this novel. It was a nice enough read, just not Neil Gaiman standard. Agree with the other reviewers who said it was too short.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The hourly report is out of sync with the web site.  Web is accurate (as far any weather report can be).  The App shows different wind &amp; rain forecasts, probably for some other location.  Probably easily fixed.  I notified them a couple of times to no avail.  Removed the App from my device.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album.  It is a refreshing merger of electronic and traditional instruments.  The songwriting, vocals and production are amazing!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is the best of we ever played in my life, in fact I'd play it until the end of the  existence of the history of the history of the existence of the universe literally.
B003U53GK8|5.0|It kept my attention through all 6 seasons. Wish there were more seasons to watch. Why did it have to end so soon.
B00CFA222M|5.0|The story was intringing for my not too young grandchildren. I wasn't too scary, yet it was fun to watch.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|Season One had stunning picture and audio and I was disappointed to learn that a different studio remastered this season. They didn't do nearly as good of a job as the previous season. Picture can be grainy at times and the new CGI graphics are neutral. But it's eons better than the DVD release, so if you're a big Trek fan then definitely pick this up cause this is as good as it'll get, but sadly not as good as seasons 1, 3 and 4 in terms of Blu-ray quality.
0785153322|5.0|This is the best collection of art books I bought, really excellent! definitely a collection that is a must in the library of a fan of comics and movies.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|That it all made sense in the end was brilliant. Loved the different disguises of the main actors. Loved the idea of repeated connections in many lifetimes.
B006JCC1GO|1.0|It only shows a couple of keys and you can't move it. Doesn't teach you any song. Don't bother downloading
B005S9EJ14|5.0|wonderful movie I really enjoyed it . Would definitely watch it again and again . My family loved it to it made a difference
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I listened to this book with Audible.  What a pleasant surprise!  The story flashes back and forth between three generations of women, so I had to pay close attention in order to follow.  It was an exciting book that kept my complete attention.  I couldn't wait to listen to more of the story.  But as the end of the story approached, I found myself not wanting to listen to it.  It was because I didn't want it to end.  Now that's what I call a good book!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|i was so excited to find my fav fb game available for my kindle. but every  single time i open this app it freezes my entire kindle
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|The worst movie I have ever seen Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman appear in since ever!  I have no idea what the story line was supposed to be; nothing was clear.  It looked like it was going to be a great movie; look at the actors.  However, it never got off the ground and made no impact at any time or place.  I am very disappointed.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Like Beasts of the Southern Wild, the bayou life is all but extinct so a glimpse into this was interesting. The kids were great as was Matthew McConaughey.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great quality, and nice collection.<br />The advertisement for this showed that other folks also ordered The Mystery Movie Collections 1989-1990 and 1991 to 1993 so I ordered them too.  Turns out that they were in the collection and I didn't need them.  I also ordered the 1991-2003 and 1991 to 2003 which witch had episodes that were not in the collection.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great series and I highly recommend it. I can't wait to watch the rest of the seiries.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A fun movie to watch. Great line-up of popular, talented actors. I can't wait to watch Red 2! Solid movie overall.
B00622BMOS|5.0|The characters become your friends. As soon as I finish them I want to start all over again. Great show.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The bands of my time. I will always love Black Sabbath, I have seen them many times in concert, They rock!
B00BQQM262|5.0|Love this movie...has something for everyone.  Ertha Kitt is purrrrfect!  David Spade and John Goodman have fantastic chemistry.  Great fun!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy the colorful graphics, music while having hours of fun. Can sync progress with Facebook. Has bingo and slot games for variety.
B0031R5K72|5.0|Absolutely absorbing and skilfully written to bring out the worst and the best of the holocaust. A must read for anyone above 13. It may be a little difficult to comprehend for younger children. Though I had read it before this second reading on my kindle was great!
0770437400|5.0|Better.  This is a much more realistic and believable story.  The zombies are more like Romero's &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; than the Rage Virus killers in &#34;28 days later.&#34;  It's an anthology of different experiences that interconnect at the most fundamental level.  Brooks is a chip off the 'ol block.
B00BUL0XYG|1.0|First off, I've been a 100% fan since 2001.  The band means a lot to me.  I listen to Is This It? and it takes me away to my senior year in college.  Unfortunately, this album is an example of a band taking a different direction and driving off a cliff.  Can't get behind it at all.  I've tried, but it's a struggle.  Very disappointed.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I didn't watch this movie in theaters because I am such a fan of the original and I HATE poorly done rehashes.  But they did a GREAT job with this one creating a very original story line while perfectly portraying the &#34;world&#34; and character of the original.  We will buy this for our collection!
B002R68U7K|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this collection of songs!! It offers tracks NEVER released in the US. My favorites are Heart, Walk On By, Mona Lisa, Everybody, and Intimidated. A MUST BUY FOR ANY DIEHARD BRITNEY FAN!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can hardly wait for Season 4. I do believe it is unfair that the UK gets to see Season 4 before the US.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|It was easy to put on, I would prefer something more durable than a piece of elastic to hold it closed; however, it works well now. I really like the ability to place it on a flat service and have it support itself; and that the face is well protected when in the closed position. A pocket on the inside cover would be a nice perk. Overall, though, I like it.
B002R88G4U|5.0|A wonderful read. A perfect balance between the shocking reality of war and the simple idealism of island life. Could have read another 100 pages of this book.
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|His are words which red or blue of box odd and problem brain make sure. Or race to change what.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have seen this movie more times than I can remember. It is an all time favorite of mine. A must see for sure.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love story, mystery and real life all wrapped up in one great read! It starts out almost like three separate stories that all become very interestingly intertwined and eventually come full circle.....reminded me a little of the movie Crash. By chapter 4 I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it straight thru. Extremely well done!!!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I love this game great way to pass your time. Sharpens the brain by making you think I have played similar games and this ranks up there with one of the better ones.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|The Affair was my 9th JR novel. I decided not to read them in any particular order.The Affair ,however , takes you back to when Jack was still in the military and you get an idea how he became who he is.I am beginning to see a formula or pattern to Child's story lines, I think.It seems Jack has a habit of finding a lot of corruption and bad guys in these small towns he end up in.But it's ok with me.I intend to read the whole series,saving Killing Floor for last because it was the first.The Affair is a good JR novel,and if your a fan, it's a must read.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I've always been a fan of horror films but this tops the cake with drama very suspenseful!!  Haven't seen season 2 yet but love it!!
B00B4804KS|1.0|this must be a converted over from 2D to 3D  movie my TV does a better job on regular broadcasts than what was done with this movie it is a big waste of money trust me
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game lots of fun and very entertaining as well. Plus it's free and you can always afford free. And it's super addictive.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved Season 3 and so look forward to Season 4. I will probably watch it over and over again!
B002361MLA|4.0|Everybody needs to hear this message.  There are others talk about this but I like eckharts calm slow way of speaking.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Takes a little too long for energy to fill up.  Other than that good hidden object game.  It could be a little more generous with the diamonds since you need them for EVERYTHING.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. Great choice for Amazon Prime! It was action packed without a dull moment. Fun!
B00006EXDM|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and he loved it.  He had given me what music he required and I matched up with this . So I relied heavily on the description.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Could not put this down once I got past the corny characters and puzzles. Lots of fun glad I downloaded it.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|\\"I drink your milkshake, I sip it up!\\" --Daniel Day Lewis is a monster actor of insane proportions. Anderson will leave you with images that will linger in your mind for ages.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|For you Alien fans, this is the set for you!  Watching it on BRay is a totally different viewing experience!  You can see all stuff you couldn't see before..Alien shadows lurking where before it only appeared as darkness.  If you love the Alien movies, you must purchase this set.  You will not be disappointed!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I've been enjoying this game for a week or so. I like the relaxed pace. This game doesn't create tension by making me race to find hidden objects or solve puzzles. Since I play the game to unwind, that's perfect for me. One caveat, you do need to finish a chapter to be sure it will save your place.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and he was thrilled with it.  I was glad that it was just as described.
1400052181|4.0|The progression of science using one woman's cancer cells is amazing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is eager to learn.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Duhigg takes us through the wide ranging impact of habits on ourselves, our communities, and our companies/businesses. His work unavoidably leads to self examination: what habits do i have, want to have, or want to change? And, what explains the success or failure of attempts to change my habits? The same self examination extends to our businesses and communities.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The charting capability which tracks charge level over time is helpful as you have a record of power usage depending upon what you are doing.<br /><br />I'm still looking for an app which will explain which programs are drawing power over the day, especially when I believe the device is idle and asleep.<br /><br />I use it on my Kindle Fire gen 2. Power usage is still somewhat random or at least inexplicable to me.
1423113462|5.0|This latest series by Rick Riordan takes us back to Camp Half Blood but with a new set of characters.  Jason Grace, son of Jupiter and sister of Thalia Grace, appears just as Percy Jackson has gone missing.  While Jason is a demigod he has ties to the Roman gods instead of the Greek, this difference gives the story an additional complexity and adds to the new series.<br /><br />Jason appears with two new recruits, they accept the terms of a new quest imposed by Juno, Jupiter's wife.  This takes them cross country and to the land beyond the reach of the Gods.
B001WCN23W|5.0|My husband had told me what songs he wanted and I matched up with this -- and he loved it.
0525478817|5.0|John Green's \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" could possibly be the greatest book I have ever read on the face of the planet.  It's coming pretty close to Harry Potter, and that's seriously saying something!!  But I bought the book, and I'm currently re-reading it--over and over--like a mad woman.  And although it is gloriously written with intricate details and is incredible to all measure, it does turn you into an emotional wreck.  So I suggest, that if you do decide to read this brilliant piece of art, please be careful.  When you've finished it and refuse to see the light of day, and cry continuously on a never ending loop, clutching the book to your chest wondering if you'll ever stop hurting, know that you've been warned... But read it.  Please do.  You won't regret it.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|It only played once.  After that, it would not get past the previews and I tried three (3) more times.  I really enjoy the movie, this rating is for the copy mailed to me.
B008OOYALE|5.0|So fun I am level 27 I can't get the full version but so very fun great game so fun!!!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game, takes a few times reading the instructions and playing it formall the details to sink in, but great time for many ages
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Tackling a classical novel by turning it into a blockbuster is always going to be tough. Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is stunning and sensational, but can't live up to Fitzgerald's original prose. In my opinion, though, it comes about as close as it can get.<br /><br />The tale of Nick Carroway's induction both into decadent society and into the irrepressible, insane hopes of Jay Gatsy is told through a narrative framing device unique to this 2013 version of the story: Nick is a recovering alcoholic in the future, and tells the entire story to his psychiatrist, who urges him to write it down as a novel that just happens to sound exactly like the celebrated source material. This is clearly a way for the film to get away with a ton of narration. The film even explicitly shows the typed words on screen occasionally.<br /><br />This whole thing is a bit questionable, as a film that adapts a book is supposed to stand by itself as a film, with as little narration as possible, and certainly without the actual words showing up on screen. However, the film is also admitting that the book is better at sounding good, so I can't really blame it for admitting the truth.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Carey Mulligan all tend to love this type of film: cool, slick, and cultured. They all act well, and fit their characters aptly. The film stands out in a couple ways. First, the CGI is thick and strong, giving the film a more surreal quality, and one that keeps it interesting. Chris Godfrey, the VFX supervisor, has posted a clip on Vimeo that points out just how much the CGI influenced the final product: [...]<br /><br />It definitely establishes the excess and cheer of the 20s, though maybe not as subtly as the original text. The second stand-out element is the soundtrack. It uses modern artists -- Lana del Rey and Jay-Z, for instance -- to evoke the mood of the film, rather than using time-period-suitable musical choices. It's definitely a polarizing choice, as I've heard from people who loved it and hated it, but no one who didn't notice and form an opinion on it.<br /><br />I like it: the soundtrack carries the same themes of hedonism and unrequited longing that are essential to the story, but uses them through fresh musical eyes, removing the feel of age and vintage that an older soundtrack would force on the audience. It's not the same as Fitzgerald imagined it, but that's because we could attain that mood after the decade has passed. I suppose the most accurate path to that mood would be to read the book, though. So if you enjoy this film, go check it out from your local library.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Fantastic movie. Very graphic and lots of swearing. Some language and scenes really raise ones eyebrows. The n word is used from beginning to end. True Terrantino, excellent movie can't wait till his next one. Bravo.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We started at Season 1 and can't stop watching it! Extremely good mix of story lines characters very defined and keeps you glued the whole time! Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I play about 20 seconds an then it crash... there is no message about why it crashed, run on LG Optimus 7, Lenovo Ideapad
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hot minion action.  Very challenging and fun. I am addicted. There are in app purchases you can make and they are worth it for the fun they bring.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|There wasn't a moment that I had solved the mystery before the secret was revealed, I'm sure that other readers will experience that as well. A great read!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Really enjoyed this! Wish I had seen it on the big screen, the effect would have been better. However, it still looked good, and I liked the characters - they propelled the story more than the CGI.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|This show has a really good cast and story line. HOWEVER, very disappointed with the cussing and especially with the use of God's name in vain. The horrible language adds nothing to the show and limits the audience base.
B00DB31Y3U|4.0|This little app will keep you on the edge of your seat for hours. The game play is fun and challenging. Graphics are very good. There are many exciting levels to keep you challenged for a long time. Besides, it's just plain fun to fly this little copter all over the house, and other places. I gave it a 4 because I don't give 5's. Happy Flying, everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun and addicting game I love it as does my 12 yr old brother its like a keeper version of temple run
B004N7B8DY|5.0|The HD version is perfectly presented for this 40 year old action movie. I saw it when I was 12 and then just enjoyed it with my 12 year old boy.
B001BANK32|5.0|Steven King is a great writer and very few of books make great movies. His depth and detail of characters makes it hard for them to be translated on the big screen. The shining is an exception to this rule and was a good movie but the book showed so much more to the characters. You can never fully get the stories of King without reading the books and that is why  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves King or the move the Shining.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is such an upper to say the least. I had countless \\"oh...that\\"s what that means\\" moments. My quest down this awakening rabbit hole started about a year ago, this book made puzzle pieces come together, clarified & shed light on concepts for me. I'm anxious to start one of the experiments. I enjoyed the \\" AH HAH\\"  moments so much, I am going to read it again while deciding which experiment that I want to do first. This book is heart, mind and spiritual candy.
B00CFA222M|4.0|The DVD was delivered very speedily and as described. Great film and worth watching if you're in to the adventure genre.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|This master mystery-writer gives Det. Adam Dagliesh another confounding murder with a complex cast of characters and an abundance of motive and opportunity.  Always a literary and mysterious delight!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a fun movie, light, with lots of action.  Now I'm ready to see red 2. 3 more words
B0054LJGWS|5.0|And marveling and loving. It needs to be read again to catch everything and to enjoy it even more!  I love both authors.
0525952926|5.0|We have enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy and can hardly wait for the third.  Follett really puts life into his history.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book was so relevant to my life, and it even made me cry! Really a great book! I would recommend it to all teenagers, definitely
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|I understand this is the second book in a trilogy and was happy that I could step right into this book with no problems. I became quickly invested in the characters.<br />You have to love the main character! Sebastian as like any normal kid, tries hard to hide his infected leg and because of this it needs to be amputated...Twice. With war looming in Vienna He manages, with the help of his loving grandfather Oscar, who tutors him and pushes him to become a man and to eventually see his self worth.<br /><br />There are a colorful cast of characters in this book, from his mother and father clear down to the mean doctor and wonderful nurse in his life, and many others that come and go that work for the family in their home and in the store.<br /><br />Life is very hard for this Jewish boy with his father going off to war. His whole family is dysfunctional in one way or another (but who's isn't). He learns to run the grocery store, he learns of love and losing it and finding it again. All of this and trying to deal with being an amputee would be hard on any teenager growing up.<br />I actually laughed out loud during all of this war and hardship. The first s&eacute;ance scene with Sebastian's mother Vera, and her women's group, was a first experience for her as a women who is coming into her own at a time when women had no voice yet.<br /><br />There are plenty of lies and betrayals behind this strong family and a few characters that needed to be strangled but you will have to read the book to fine out who they are. There is a rich history interwoven with Sebastian's family and some travel.<br /><br />Christoph Fisher has a way of drawing the reader into the story and keeping your attention throughout making this novel a wonderful read. Thank-you for sharing your words with this reader. Sebastian was a pleasure to read!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I am disappointed. The advertising of this product is very misleading. It creates the impression that you can broadcast from your comp to the TV almost anything, but in reality it is ONLY with CHROME browser and only Youtube and Netflix. So, basically, they created yet another device to keep you in their commercial and tracking domain.<br /> I installed it easy, no problem, then install Google Chrome browser ( reluctantly) and then , after seemingly everything is set, it says, \\" One more step\\"  - You have to instal an Extension ???? What ??? And the window warns you that they can access ( and they will) ALL your data and web browsing experience , bla-bla-bla. Now it is clear..this is just another tracking device to collect user's behavior in the net and so on.. Bad, bad , bad, Google !!! What happened to  \\"Do not create evil !\\"  Slogan, Google ???<br />Let me tell you this, Google: I am uninstalling Chrome, and this little device will not be used, unless you make it to work with all the browsers. Thank you!<br />Otherwise, the quality of the video transmitted to the  TV is good, no problem.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I love it- funny,great casting, visually satisfying (good color palette), great voice acting- I don't buy a movie unless it's good enough to watch over and over while still enjoying and this one meets that criteria, for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It starts out great and just gets better. Again, acting, directing, writing, and producing are all brilliant. You know it is good when you are down right annoyed when you have watched every episode.
B008W8X5N6|5.0|i thought i had never seen this movie- but as i watched it i realized i must have seen it as a kid.  i also thought i would hate it- since generally i don't like old movies- but i really did.  i thought this original kong was the most terrifying.
B00COHGOP2|5.0|This movie needs to be seen by everyone. The transformation of the characters from the start to the end is impressive. Judd Nelson is the man
B009AJD5E0|5.0|If you have ever watched the show Ancient Aliens on the History channel, you will love this movie. It's mind blowing, creative and absolutely frightening!
B006VKKAWQ|4.0|I probably should have listened to more of Toscanini's work before buying this.  He is obviously great but I do have some recordings of the same pieces from other conductors that I strongly prefer.  Oh well.  It is still beautiful music and there is a lot of it.<br /><br />Additional note: I had a hard time getting the songs ripped onto my computer.  The naming of the files was really inconsistent.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Good read.  I watched the Netflix show first which is very different.  The book paints a picture of prison life that one doesn't normally imagine.  Definitely points out flaws in the system.
B00459EZLW|3.0|2nd season moves along a little better than 1st. So wish they could have wrapped up the series, left floating in space was pretty unsatisfying. However, I have discovered Robert Carlyle (Rush) just recently and I would watch him in anything.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love uno and this is a really fun interactive game. Unfortunately you can play once or twice for free then have to wait to get more free play- by that time my interest has past.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The Rosie Project gets into the head of the narrator who is a borderline Asberger case.  It opens when he is a Professor and has decided that it is time he was married.  He devises a questionnaire that he posts on the web and contacts women who seem to meet his criteria.  It is witty and funny with a laugh every few minutes.
0920668372|5.0|I received this book as a baby shower gift over 20 years ago and I love giving it to new mother's as well.  It makes me cry every time, it is so touching.
1419705849|5.0|Not a big surprise that my son loves it, since he loves all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|had. to rate for levelup...not a bad idea I guess! interesting down time game w good fx<br />. short term game levelwise
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing game. I've never even played Minecraft before, but I'm definitely considering it on the PC now. Most of my time is spent expanding my already extensive underground tunnels/living quarters, but i'm starting to work on an actual house on a mountain. I highly recommend to anyone who is creative or just likes to make things.
B004QXJZXA|3.0|No story line.  It just starts and ends.  Yes, it is about the race, but if so, why not some history of the race?  Not much McQueen acting.  Great racing scenes!
B002NN5F7A|2.0|I liked the acting, but I could not get into the storyline. I guess I was expecting more from a film with such talented cast members.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I like the ad free version.  a quick look up for just about anything.  i use it often, and think it is a good resource
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It has really good tones that actually wake you up. I love that you can set up any number of alarms and what day it's needed for.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It took a few chapters to figure out, but then really liked this author's writing style.  Very good subject matter historically to put the reader right into the horribleness of this country's use of slavery.
B00005Y46O|5.0|One of the best bands around just love there music, put it on and get lost in the music, I just loved it
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fast pace. Great to play keeps Me thinking. If you like thinking fast and seeing if you can beat the high score, then this a game you will really like. I can't seem to put it down.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great game but very addictive. Such an easy way to pass time without realizing. Easy to make friends on as well as you gain neighbours who are just as addicted so help you to pass the goals it gives you. Great fun.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Wonderful fun, expertly written. Terry and Neil never disappoint!... And I also loved the part after the end where they talked about each other.
0824835921|4.0|The general idea of creating stories for kanji i had used on my own several times with 夏 and other kanji on my own but Heisig created a system of remembering the kanji. Unfortunately he has a really weak imagination and his stories are based in old references a lot of people who study Japanese in the 21st century wont get, biblical references and so on. If someone could use this method but based on modern cinema or something like this I could see how all the kanji could be learned in a couple of days.
B00AIUSFSQ|5.0|I bought this cd for my husband and he loves it.  He has always wanted Green Onions, it's his favorite Booker T song.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I love, love this. It sounds big, really big, just like the movie. Everyone who has been in my car gets blasted with the Pacific Rim soundtrack. It is great to exercise to also. Best $8.99 I have ever spent.
B008XJ8WE6|3.0|First this version is only available from Universal UK and depending on player, TV, and sound system you will want the remotes close by. Start of movie can't be heard on one TV but just fine on another.  Picture playback is so fine you can see the Apache Dancer has a run in her stockings and other things not as clear as DVD. If Universal US ever releases the movie ob BluRay I would buy again.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Radar images don't load in Amazon version. Tech support is no help. Buy this on Google Play Store if you want full functionality. Galaxy S3
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awsome then other games and other o we to camp butt but hope they more charters hill will be awsome you house more games
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|A fantastic new series.  Tatiana Maslany is one of the best actresses of this generation and was was robbed of an emmy nomination. Add in the Sci Fi mystery and orphan black is really original and not a clone or knockoff.
0307476073|5.0|Great writing.  I kept thinking about relatives and friends who have hiked the Appalachian Trail - the experience became more real with Strayed's writing.  The physical and emotional challenges are universal.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Hey the blues man BG is on top of his game !!!______he has put out some really great albums being in his 70's  got love Buddy !!!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|It's classic Bruce!!  You have to love it!!  DC comics are the greatest at this type of adventure.  Watch and enjoy.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I loved it ! Great movie , a little different story line , but still awesome . I can't wait to see 6 , not the racing I like , but tons of action !!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game, played with my daughter and her friends. Need to play yourself! I play this game when it first came out. So easy to play. Great for everyone.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|In my opinion this app is a little lacking. I do not like the commercials or the fact that you need tokens now to play. I had this app on my old kindle and when I got the HD it wouldn't download. Now I'm stuck with this version and I actually may just delete it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who had the free original version before.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|As an Introvert this explains so much, and validates how I am in the wold, not selfish or aloof but different and just as valid. My purchase was fueled by plans to rearrange my workspace, from open plan to hot desk, eeeekkkkk. In reading I also discovered why brainstorming never feels right, why presentations seem shallow much of the time and why I love to work and research to find solutions rather than leap to a casually suggested what if.<br />Thank you Susan Cain.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am really looking forward to the next book. Brandon Sanderson creates a unique world with characters you can care about..
B0085OEIOC|5.0|I loved Val Kilmer in his younger years. The humor isn't what most people find funny today, but I loved it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is by far, my favorite app on my kindle fire.  Although all of my apps are free, I do have over 70 apps, if that gives you an idea.  Has absolutely no advertisements, and although is sometimes slow to load, is well worth a half a minute of loading.  One of the key aspects of the game is managing your gold.  Gold costs actual money to buy, so it's never worth it to spend it speeding something up, when you can wait the 20 hours or whatnot.  However there are other ways to get gold through the game, but they're much more difficult.  This game is best if you pair it with other Story games such as Farm Story.  The concept is simple, but addicting.  There are several different basic species (and colors) of dragons which you have to raise up and eventually breed together to create hundreds of new species, all the while expanding your territory and building habitats.  Great game!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|She ordered  them and hasn't stopped watching since she got them....  good thing we have multiple tv's in the house:)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I have only used it for the basic things, percentages, multiplication, etc. Works like a charm, no complaints. Good app.
B000HZGNDG|4.0|The cast pulls off classic melodrama of the original style of the Star Trek show.  If you liked the classic interactions, plot twists, and characters attempts at humor or overcoming unsurmountable odds, you'll find this entertaining and enjoyable.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|The doll is very cute and as usual very delicate.  My daughter just loved it for her birthday.  Thank you
1451695195|4.0|I thought it was a great book and believable. The Esquire article.however made me rethink it, I came away a little doubtful about it.  Pete
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Though this story attempts some noble exploration of loving others and finding meaning late in life, the \\"quartet\\" too often end up shallow and contrived.  We never get to know enough about the \\"diva\\", \\"naughty boy\\", \\"dingbat\\", and the \\"wounded bird\\" but keep getting hammered with their same cartoonish extremes again and again.  Only the touching final minute redeems some of it's excesses.
B0036O0ELM|5.0|I really enjoyed learning and listening to this opera after I watched the movie Quartet.  Slowly starting to enjoy opera..
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This a very addictive game to play. Once you start, you feel like you have the need to get every type of shark and explore the rest of the game because every shark has its limits. Unless you have the top ranked shark.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Great product when you can't find the binky...my son loves it but pulls it out because he rather play with the monkey -_-
B000002KOO|5.0|What a classic, as presented & timely delivery, more of the early Fleetwood Mac, pre-Stevie Nicks years, still a welcome addition to anybody's audio collection.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Hours of mind numbing fun. I used to play this all the time on my PC , but now I can take it with me.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the large numbers and the simplicity of use.  My grandkids can use this app for school homework assignments.
B003SI9WMS|4.0|Not to give away the plot, but there were different threads going on as to how the movie ended that had me really thinking about it, after it was over. I enjoyed this flick and recommend it to others.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I am an original Beatlemaniac from 1964 when they landed in America. This is by far the best ever because it is by the Beatles themselves and their crew. It doesn't get any better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so great. If I could I'd buy all the horses I would. This is a good idea for a game .
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Didn't realize I had played this one before. Much better the first time around. Glad it was a free game.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|i have watched this a few times and will watch it more times. the colors are beautiful and brilliant. good 3d and good for the family
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had this set previously in standard DVD format but the Blu-ray added a lot of little things I didn't notice to some of the movies.  The extras are wonderful.<br />They come in a book and it has great pictures in it from the movies.
0061906220|5.0|I will only say BUY IT!  You won't regret it!<br />I teach 4 and 5 year olds and they just LOVE this book!  All the Pete the cat books are a MUST have!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wonderful game..must have..please make a full version you can buy with unlimited play. This ap is great for horse lovers and is definitely entertaining with wonderful graphics. very realisitic. I'm  an adult and i love it. this ap is great for all ages and easy controls.
B000SEI618|4.0|Slow paced and gentle, but very well written, likable story; good character development. Looking forward to the upcoming movie version.
B006H5120E|1.0|if i had known this had so much nudity in it i would not have bought it. i would not play this movie and do not consider it to be a good one for my collection. would be ok if not for that fact.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Fun filled action packed. LOVED IT! I'm glad I signed up for Amazon Prime because it was not on Netflix.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series! I have seen many  series before and most of them I cannot watch with my younger children because the content is too strong or graphic. This is not the case! I can watch it with my teenager daughter and its not only an educational program with beautiful setting, costumes and excellent acting but also you cannot stop watching! it is addictive!  loved it and will watch it again and again!  I only regret not buying the season 3!
B0001RVP88|5.0|I have no idea what the mivie is about, but my friend said Lady Jane was what she wanted, so here it is.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|i did enjoy this movie. i would recommend this for a good family movie. 3d effects werre good. this movie held my interest.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Certainly learned much about flowers! Too much inability to cope  & sadness for me - I had difficulty getting to knoe the characters.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Great CD - Bruno Mars has a wonderful voice - could do without the 'explicit' content, but really good just the same.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I was pleased to get this album that I have been wanting for a while for a reduced price on Amazon. It got to my home in less time than I expected and in good condition.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I really bought this disk for two reasons. One, I liked the movie and two, the picture quality is just as good as &#34;The Dark Knight.&#34; I'll probably buy &#34;The Dark Knight rises&#34; just to have the whole Christian Bale trilogy.  If you liked the earlier Batman movies, you'll probably like this one even more.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't wait for season 3! Another great show along with Dr Who from the BBC. Cumberpatch's role as Sherlock just has wife and I glued to the TV
B0064X7FVE|1.0|doesn't even open most of the time. Uninstalled it, and it worked for a day. It needs to be fixed. Why did you do away with the narrative forecast?  most people can read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you are a Downton Abbey fan, then you know how good the series are. This review is only for the instant video version on Amazon. If you have the BD, then you know the production was either 1080i or more likely 720p, and Amazon's is 720p and looks very sharp on my 75&#34; HDTV. Never grainy, runs smoothly. I find myself quite often watching this version instead of my discs.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have been very frustrated because I have tried for two weeks to resolve the problem I am having with Kindle and my new tablet made by Xelio.  Have reinstalled many times and asked for technical help - nothing works yet!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Every time you complete a goal, it just makes you want to accomplish more. The minions should be cheaper, but this game is extremely fun!
B003ZLV8T8|5.0|Enjoyed the movie very much, so much I purchased my own copy to watch at anytime.<br />Movie goes great with wine, martini's and if you are a Madonna fan you'll like it even more.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Loved the characters. Plot was interesting but hard to understand at times.  One of my favorite shows of all time!
B005LMEB8E|5.0|I love demi lovato, she is my role model , i look up to her. She went through some problems just like me.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I absolutely love this game, but I'm really mad that there's no update. I'm especially mad because they just updated the non wifi only version and I made the mistake of buying this one
B002PJN59M|5.0|From the great soundtrack to the fantastic cinematography this is my Go To for the Arthurian legend.  The cast is great, the acting fun and engaging.  This is a great version.  Buy it and watch it back to back with Monty Python's Holy Grail.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|It is nice having ALL the Little Women series at a touch.  What else is there to say.  Haven't finished them all yet.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|There was a lot of build up and twists and turns, but felt that the ending was disappointing<br />Felt let down by the ending as there was no resolution to the problem
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's Angry Birds and Star Wars to boot!!! Use your lightsaber, use the force..all fun and entertaining. Highly suggest it.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|Kids were all spending the night out so I thought I would pick a nice romantic comedy/drama for my wife and I. I was drawn by the award nominations and overwhelming reviews. Twenty minutes in I thought I must have selected the wrong movie. It is a slow, disjointed story that ultimately follows a predictable Hollywood formula. Lawrence and Cooper are good portraying mentally troubled individuals who find something in each other. I like Lawrence but her character is raw and troubled but also poorly formed. It was hard to determine what role her mental illness played in being so unlikable or unsympathetic...vs just being mean and manipulative. Cooper's character was understandable...but frankly seemed over the top. Perhaps that is the brilliance in the story and the acting...the uniqueness and nuances of mental illness in each individual. But it didn't feel genuine to me in this story and portrayals. But what do I know...?
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game but I don't like to buy more things so I get stuck alot. I recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's like temple run so if you like temple run its a good game for you, it has fun little mini games and minions. Soooooooo fun and free.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|How can you NOT love an Angry Bird of any kind! Always fun, always exciting. Play it all the time.
B0097GTUCC|5.0|I loved this album on first play, and love it more the more I listen.  Great musicianship, a grown-up dirty-blues sense of story-telling, songs that make you want to crank up the volume.  Duff McKagan, Pete Angell and the guys are such experienced, masterful musicians that each song has some new nuance every time you hear it. 'Capital T' is rock n roll exactly as it should be. And Mike McCready's contributions on other cuts are stellar. It reminds me of some of the best singer-songwriter stuff from 20 years ago, but it also has a fresh, unexpected sound.  Buy this album and have fun.
B00D2HTRVQ|3.0|my lil one loves it but i wish there was more scenes for them to do instead of repeating the same ones over and over again.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|To those who might wish to avoid a film by the maker of Tron: Legacy, it should be stressed that Oblivion is a more interesting work by a good distance, an imaginative speculative piece set some six decades hence that always engages serious attention, even if it doesn't convincingly jell. In mood, a certain delicacy and the sense of isolation both on a depopulated Earth and somewhere above it, the recent film that this most strongly recalls is WALL-E, except with violence and without the humor and charm of the Pixar classic.
141659521X|5.0|Like all in the Mitch Rapp series this one is better than the last. Sorry to lose such a talented thriller writer. RIP Vince.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran writes with such a strong unique voice that it's like listening to a whip smart, wickedly funny friend telling you her stories on a great (very late) night out.  She has no vanity or guile, and cuts right to the heart of her experiences. Yes, it's about feminism but not a didactic or lecturing tone at all--it's about being human, being a parent and a friend, AND a woman. And it's hysterically funny.
B005GVF95O|4.0|my lil ones loves this game she plays over and over again and doesn't get bored i they come out with one that is a lil more challenging.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|... I enjoyed this film. Almost didn't rent it because of some of the other negative reviews. I found it to be well paced, interesting & enjoyable to watch. Not an Oscar award winner but pure entertainment for me. It's all in the eye of the beholder. I'd watch it again as well. There you have it!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I don't know why I was drawn to read this book as it isn't my usual genre but it was a riveting account of federal prison life.  I was especially struck by the fact that after a long amount of time the Feds came calling.  I thought there would have been an expired statute of limitations.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004SDEP38|5.0|very handy little app to have around it does what it says and is so simple to use. vey pleased
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Tom Cruise knocked out of the park with this film. It's a guy movie but also some females might enjoy it; specially where he's shirtless, but lots of good action.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Skyfall was entertaining but how many 007 movies have been based on rogue agents that are seeking revenge?  Seems like 1/2 the franchise is based on that premise.<br /><br />I also have to complain about Unbox, why is this not have HD?
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and I've read just about everything he's written.  I would rate this about the middle of the pack of his fiction, which is still well above a lot of the other authors I read.  That may be the problem with this book: I set the bar too high.  As usual, the book is built on a premise that is not uniquely Stephen King, but the way he executes it is absolutely unique.  The story is a classic exercise in answering the question, 'if you could go back in time to change something, would you do it?', but in Stephen King's hands, is less a theoretical question and more of a personal one.  As usual, his development of characters is so well done that you feel everything they do as if it is happening to you and fully engage in the emotional moral dilemmas that they face.  I wasn't fully satisfied with how it ended, but that may just be due to it not going the way I expected.<br /><br />Stephen King fans should read it, and I'm sure most already have.  Anyone new to his work won't be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|lots of fun. cant put the game down! having trouble getting some of the medals but having fun anyway. minions are do cute
B005BGBPBG|3.0|this movie had a few good points but overall it was average.  it was funny at times, but it left the characters appearing like they couldn't figure out what to do.
B00BF11UM0|4.0|This was a fantastic movie.  No melodrama.  No artificial build up.  Just a great story.<br /><br />My only gripe is that I downloaded the movie and watched on my laptop with Amazon Unbox.  For some reason Unbox is not in HD.
B00A757EFW|2.0|well I do like it but when I use the power pack you can't use it again. besides the ghost are to fast. Ps. this game is really boring.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|If you love clutch buy it.  It rules.  These guys continue to put out awesome music.  Clutch is the definition of a hard working rock band.
B00CITOS4A|5.0|This book is an intermediate beginners' book. Scott expects you to know all the basics on controlling exposure, which is nice for people like me who need more explanation on what to do after you understand aperture, ISO, shutter speed. I liked the quick and dirty on how to shoot panoramic photos, macro, sports, etc. He also gives a quick but thorough explanation on portraits and weddings. He gives you details on which gear you need to achieve certain images, but he doesn't ignore the fact that photography is expensive (which many pros seem to do).<br /><br />I love Scott Kelby for what he does to help photographers get better in camera and in post processing. This book is no exception.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|The previous Sergio Leone 'Spaghetti Westerns' are known as such, because the odd circumstances of details- movies set in the American West, Directed by an Italian, and shot in Spain- and because the resulting movies were so different in stylistics elements than the standard western fare made in American. In any case, after his success with the Clint Eastwood starring &#34;Dollars&#34; trilogy, Once Upon a Time in the West (although in big part made to appease producers and such, before they would support him making Once Upon a Time in American) became his first western to actually be shot in the American west. And it was worth it. It is brilliant, beautiful, sprawling and so much fun. And it looks wonderful in it's HD transfer.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|You can't really write any new formulas or work the math on excel. Or if you can the method is well-hidden. There's no help option to be found. Very frustrating.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Loved this book. something many of us would like to do. give it all up and do something we really enjoy and believe in. To give up the rat race. Refreshing to see a person give up the phoney, corporate life and still make it while keeping to his principals. The characters were real. the story touching.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This never grabbed me.  I did finish it for book club but never really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I was glad to get onto something else.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|We liked the packaging, instructions and ease for an adult to snap it together. We performed the test first (put it together w/o phone in case and submerge then check for leaks if none, proceed) then installed the phone and ensured that it snapped together properly, headphone screw was in firmly and clasp was locked in place. My daughter has been taking pictures and video in the pool.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Great CD with plenty of old time Frankie on it. We bought this after seeing the Jersey Boys and itis a fun way to remember a good time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent writing and acting.  As soon as I finished all 3 seasons, I started over again.  So many characters to love and hate.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I read this book years and years ago but got a lot more out of it this time.  A lot of things have changed in the last two hundred yers in England, but some things still are the same.  There is still a class system, tho' the Brits would like to deny it.<br /><br />Not too many people now can sit around and only read Debrett any more.<br /><br />And Brits are still great walkers.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Joss Whedon's modern-dress version of \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\"--filmed in black and white, in twelve days, in his own Los Angeles house--actually manages to exceed Kenneth Branagh's version of twenty years ago. Branagh's version, to be sure, may have Roger Lanser's glorious color cinematography of a sumptuous Tuscan villa, as well as magnificent performances by Emma Thompson and Branagh as Beatrice and Benedick. But Whedon's version, though slightly claustrophobic, feels more unified than Branagh's, and Whedon's ensemble cast is more consistently excellent than Branagh's.<br /><br />Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof may not be as golden-throated in speaking the Bard's verse as Thompson and Branagh, but they are just as adept in portraying Beatrice and Benedick's emotions, and they are the superior physical comedians. In fact, Whedon's cast is wonderful straight down the line: Reed Diamond as Don Pedro, Clark Gregg ss Leonato, and especially Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. Fillion's masterful underplaying, taking full advantage of every malaprop, is better than Michael Keaton's heavily Beetlejuiced portrayal in Branagh's film. Also, Sean Maher is incomparably better as the treacherous Don John than Keanu Reeves, who looked perfect but sounded like he was coming out of anesthesia.<br /><br />The B&W photography in Whedon's film creates its own cool, jazz-tinged magic, an enormous contrast to the occasionally forced hilarity in Branagh's version. Whedon's \\"Much Ado\\" is a perfect post-Watergate Shakespearian romp.
B00CATSONE|5.0|What keeps going through my mind is the fact that he could create earthquakes. I wonder where all of his research papers went?  I found this to be intriging reading.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old app was fine,  Don't know why you changed it.  I want the old format back!  Ya it had some problems but it was still better then the crap you have you have now.

0767919408|4.0|Bill Bryson's \\"One Summer: America, 1927\\" is a thrillingly compulsive read. With dazzling speed and skill, Bryson presents in rapid succession the most important stories and people of 1927. The focal point of the book--just as he was of that summer--is Charles Lindbergh, whose solo flight across the Atlantic in the tiny, primitive \\"Spirit of St. Louis\\" remains one of the most awe-inspiring feats in aviation history. However, Bryson also finds room to discuss plenty of other celebrities of the time--Herbert Hoover, Calvin Coolidge, Henry Ford, Sacco and Vanzetti, Al Capone, Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth. He also presents many now-forgotten but still fascinating people: Wayne B. Wheeler, the chief architect of Prohibition; Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray, the murderous adulterers whose case inspired James M. Cain to write both \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" and \\"Double Indemnity\\"; Benjamin Strong and Montagu Norman, governors of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, whose misguided economic policies were a direct cause of the Great Depression; Charles Levine, flamboyant entrepreneur and con man, who tried to transform the nation's aviation craze into his personal cash cow; and the hapless Carrie Buck, the first victim of enforced-sterilization policies, sacrificed on the altar of eugenics.<br /><br />All of these stories are fascinating, and as Bryson presents them they are the literary equivalent of salted peanuts: we have to keep reading one more chapter, then one more, then one more. But although Bryson succeeds grandly in making the book fun, he slips in creating a deeper subtext for it. There is a strong theme of government-sponsored cruelty in the book (Prohibition, eugenics), and also one of gods with feet of clay (Hoover, Ford, and in the end Lindbergh come off particularly badly). Yet Bryson doesn't really delve into the significance of these stories, other than that they all happened in America. \\"It could reasonably be said that the summer of 1927 marked the moment when America discovered its own importance,\\" Bryson tells us at the end. Well, maybe. But the same could be said of 1865, or 1776, as other historians have reminded us. Bryson glides over his summation of why the events of 1927 are important to us today. But he does give us, as he also says at the end, \\"one hell of a ride.\\"ment when America discovered its own importance,\\" Bryson tells us at the end. Well, maybe.

B001N9ESQ4|5.0|We celebrated our 41st anniversary by watching this trilogy for the first time. We watched each film on a separate evening and witnessed the couple advance their relationship over nearly 20 years. The last film we saw in a local arts theatre and it was wonderful.

B00A757EFW|1.0|you have to move him around with a joystick or swipe him in the right time period to get him to move that way otherwise he just goes until he hits a wall. this app is toatally rubbish and sometimes it makes ya pay 99&cent; for it.  People who rate this app 5 stars are probably just family of Nanci bandai probably Asain it doesn't save if ya don't complete a level and takes up a bunch of storage
B00B7Y0206|2.0|When I First Got This App It Worked Very Good. I Could Play Videos And That's All I Needed. But Then It Started To Kinda Backfire. I Would Only be Able Too Watch One Video Then It Would Go Back Too The Homepage, And I Would Have To Research It. But I Learned Too Just Deal With It Hoping That the Issue Would Stop. Then I Used Amazon Coins To Buy The Feature, Download Videos. And I Could Download Videos And Watch Them Without Internet Connection. But Just This Morning I Was Watching A Video And I Clicked, Download video. And This Ad Came Up And Asked If I Would Like Too Buy Download Videos For 199 Coins or 1.99. I Was Confused As To Why It Was Asking Me Too Buy It When I Already Had. I Checked My Downloads Videos And I Still Had Them All. I Am Deleting This App Possibly And It Basically Ate My Money. Don't Buy This Unless Your Not Buying A Feature.

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|It's a very good movie. It's a bit of a tongue in cheek play on a horror movie. It's a movie you'll enjoy but it might not stick with you. I watched it about 2 weeks ago and had to watch the trailer to jar my memory about it for this review. Of course it might just be that I'm getting old and my memory isn't as good as it used to be :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything is perfect: from the decor, costumes, the actors, the dialogue. I can't find something that I do not like about Dowton Abbey. I just loooooooooooove it! Very well made.

B005LAII44|5.0|I just picked this movie up and watched sight unseen. I really enjoyed the first movie, 2009's G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra, so I was really looking forward to the sequel. I really did enjoy it despite having some difficulty with it.<br /><br />Pros: This movie has a ton of action, twists and turns and great character moments. The plot is very good and I like that they focus mainly on the fact that Zartan is impersonating the President. Dwayne Johnson is a favorite of mine as is Bruce Willis so it is really good to see them in this movie. This movie has great CGI special effects and they blend into the story, help tell the story, without overpowering the story. This movie could have easily turned into a CGI laden video game but it does not. I think the presence of Dwayne Johnson really carried this movie and the central theme of this movie is all about redemption. Although we see Cobra Commander and his gang of evil doers retaliate for the defeat they experienced in the first movie. In truth this movie is about the redemption of the Joes, The President and Storm Shadow. I found a great deal of heart in this movie.<br /><br />Cons: Although I really did like this movie it felt detached from the first movie in some ways. Maybe that has to do with the fact that so few of the actors from the first movie returned for this movie. This film introduces us to many new faces. Plus, this movie seemed smaller in scale than the previous film. Those two elements make the movie feel very different from the first movie. Although I really like this movie I could never shake that sense of this film feeling so different from the other film.<br /><br />I recently published a blog post that mentions how the tone of comic-book movie should be. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a great example of a comic book style movie that strikes the right tone or verisimilitude. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It is not campy but yet the humor, the macho bravado within the film does let us know that this is going to be a fun movie...and it is. This movie is about redemption, friends and standing by those friends who need our help. The movie is also over-the-top in places with its action scenes but they are fun to watch. It is almost like watching an action oriented well choreographed dance unfold before your eyes.<br /><br />G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a fun popcorn munching escapism type movie filled with a lot of heart, fun, and interesting characters wrapped up in exciting science-fiction and action and adventure tale.going to be a fun movie...and it is.

B001DF68MA|5.0|My 16 month old loves this!  I originally bought it for my bike, but there wasn't enough space for me to stand in between the seat and the rider.  My husband had to put it on his bike. I was a little disappointed about that, but I don't have a standard bike; it is a comfort bike made by Del Sol.  I'm thinking that makes a difference because other reviewers never commented on the space issue. I'm standard size as well; 5'6&#34;. I/we still love it and HIGHLY recommend.  We also bought the WeeRide co-rider for our 4 year old, we also have a 9 year old; finally our entire family can take long rides together!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This music to enjoy no matter your mood. Who would've thought that cello and piano could make music so arresting and uplifting as this music does.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I think it's pretty good. It has given me some pointers for the game. I like that there are videos to see how to complete certain levels. Not bad at all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such a great series. Wonderful acting. The costumes are just beautiful.  December seems such a long way off. I am sure that it will be worth the wait.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is the typical running while avoiding obstacles game as you gather bananas. The graphics are great and hey, minions are the bomb. It's fun and works on my kindle fire 8.9 okay. When they added the machos lair update,  it took FOREVER to get it running again. I had to force close about 4 times before it actually reloaded.  In addition to that, I've run over 3000m and have yet to see Machos battle. My friend has an iPad and hits it quite often. I don't know if this is a glitch or if you have to run a certain pattern to get there.  At times it runs jerky and you have to exit before getting smooth game play.<br /><br />You can purchase in app items with coins or bananas, but as usual, all the good stuff costs a boatload of coins. Some in excess of $10 in real money.  You will also have to pay coins to continue after a crash or burn. I don't know how it works but it can be 5 coins one time and 20 the rest. If you crash twice it'll go up to 40 which is a waste. You can earn gold coins throughout the game at dribs and drabs, but the motivation is obviously to get you to spend real $$$.<br /><br /> If you're into temple run, this would be up your alley (if you can get past the update).
1401207529|4.0|Its in really good condition! other than a few stickers its great and the stickers can be handled.<br />so i'm pleased!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We LOVE this series!! Just wish we had watched this years ago :) the story lines are so interesting that we are on the edge of our seats and it is over before we even realize it! I guess time flies when you are having fun!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|as good as the second and had some laughs.  love squelch in each of the movies and like that they keep him in a cameo
B00B7FXZQS|4.0|All the Paranormal Activity movies are enjoyable.  This one continues the story in an interesting way.  Found it to be very good.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The first person narrative, the obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles, and the very interesting portrayal of Tiffany made for an interesting, if not comical, read.
0151008116|5.0|I watch the movie before reading the book unfortunately, but as any other movie the book is much better because there are things that the movie just does mention.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|gets boring and the plot is obvious-only thing worse is major network reruns.  not worth the price of renting wwhh
000728487X|5.0|When I started reading this book it answered my questions as to why as a patient I was treated the way I was treated. I was treated as inhumanely as ever by Doctors in Texas. Like most Texans we are dismayed for our lack of Healthcare in the Lone Star State.<br />Many of our Doctors are from Asia and I have always wondered how they even passed a linguistic Medical exam. This is the true story as why it got this way. How are own beliefs systems in todays Health Industry has been bought and paid for. Your lab tests many not even be your own since there is no true regulation of the regulators. This is a &#34;Must Read&#34; book for everyone walking on this planet in every language available. Ben Goldacre wrote a book that needed to be written for all of us as Human Beings.<br />Our Physicans are not what we where taught to believe, they are monsters who can murder us legally and even the Medical Examiner would never know it. A great book for all. Read it and remember each time you go to the Doctor.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I love the dvd. Great Music. Highly reccomend the dvd to others. I will listen to the dvd as much as I can. Love it!!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Very fun and addictive but it takes some time to upgrade your shark. You can speed up the process by buying upgrades but I hate when developers try to scam you out of your money this way.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app works well for what I need. I haven't had any problems with it at all. Loads every time. Never stops abruptly like some other apps do. Would definitely recommend it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never saw Season 1 of the The Good Wife--so, I'm catching up.  I love this series and all the characters--this is a great series and a great escape at the end of the day.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|You cannot go wrong with Uno, it is the simplest card game yet. The game is great and just like the real card game. My problem is that while it is free to download, you have to purchase in-game coins just to play a match of Uno. You are given a few coins to begin with, but once you run out, you are out for the day. So while mobile games are to be enjoyed by anyone, and this game is enjoyable just like it's real counterpart; the in-app purchases are killing it for me. Just let me play it for as long as I want, how many matches I want, and I'd rate it all stars.<br />Seriously, I can play The Sims and not purchase a thing to be fine, but the way Gameloft set this game up you have to purchase coins to actually play it! This is why so many people seem to have problems with microtransactions in any game. Even more so in a game that says it is &quot;free-to-play.&quot;
B0017SWPXY|1.0|This book was highly recommend to me and I was excited to get it and read it....Sadly, I only read one chapter and then refused to read anymore...the language in it was very offensive to me and it was not necessary.  I deleted the book from my Kindle and will never know if the story is good or not because I refuse to read any books with foul language.
1623420148|4.0|Tangled is a very refreshing read, as it is from a male POV. A narration from a funny, arrogant, cocky male. Yup it's a narration. But instead of boring narration like diary, it's actually written like Drew is talking to you personally. Some of my favourite quotes from Tangled: -<br /><br />\\"For God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break!\\"<br /><br />\\"It makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I've never been into S&M. But I'm beginning to see its benefits.\\"<br /><br />Tangled is fun and light-hearted. I was laughing at how Drew and Katherine fight like a child. And some of the the things that Drew commented about men simply made me grin. And I definitely enjoy reading the part where Drew go all out trying his very best to win Katherin's heart over. At some point, I was actually thinking what did Katherine think about Drew. :)<br /><br />I enjoy reading this book very much. I consider it's well written as a debut. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love movies where the heroes win and the bad guys are conquered! And you are happy after watching the movie~
0823013626|4.0|A very nice book, although I didn't have good results in following the instructions for printer transfer to clay. My friend, who also bought the book, had no better luck. This technique is what we bought the book to learn, so we were disappointed by that, but the pictures are inspirational.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Due to the controversy about the upcoming movie of this book, I had to read it.  Serious, compassionate, I no longer care that the author is a Mormon and an homophobe.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a very enjoyable show with a great cast of characters. Always well written you never know what is coming next.
0061780308|5.0|This book surprised me and 100% blew me away. First things first...if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely MUST get the audiobook version. That's an order! I cannot imagine having read this book any other way. It was perfect.<br /><br />I actually had no idea what The Art of Racing in the Rain was about before starting it. All I knew was that a lot of people have been talking about it for a long time, and that many consider it to be a great book. And that it probably had a dog in it?<br /><br />The biggest thing that I didn't like about this book was that...I wish that I'd grown up with a dog. While I was able to completely connect with the story and with the main character (a dog), Enzo, I just know that it would've hit me on such a deeper level if I'd have had the experience of growing up with a doggie best friend. I wish that somebody could've told me to wait until we do get a dog (we plan to get one pretty soon), because I would've been able to appreciate it more, in a way that somebody who hasn't owned a dog just can't appreciate this book.<br /><br />But I was still able to love this book. I fell hard for this book. But I can admit it's flaws (slightly too philosophical and a few inconsistencies having to do with Enzo's education level). Although I'm not ashamed to say that I'm also astounded by its incredible genius.<br /><br />The way that Stein was able to create characters that were so lovable, and so very relatable. Actually, I think that the way that he was portrayed the people in Enzo's life as being either all black or all white might be seen by some as a flaw, But, to me, that was part of its charm. Because...that's actually how an animal really sees people. He either loves you to the ends of this world because you're his owner, or your his owner's enemy that he must protect him against. It was adorable and made perfect sense to me.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about this book. And I think that everybody who has ever had a dog absolutely needs to read this book.ly needs to read this book.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Having gone through a divorce myself and jumping all too soon into a relationship that ended in tears and anger; to read someone else's story that also told my story was comforting in a time when I couldn't comfort myself. Thank you for being my net beneath my tight rope.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I knew nothing about Senna before getting this movie. It is really a good documentary, much better than I expected.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|it blows compared to his other Cd's....very disappointed ....waste of my money...don't waste your money......ok it really sucks big time
0316077046|4.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS was a pretty good follow-up to BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, although there were some things that I personally didn't like about it.<br /><br />There was a high prevalence of paranormal stuff in this novel...actually, quite a lot of it. Most of the story is spent in the tunnels below Gatlin that we learned about in the previous book. And I think that that is part of the reason why I could only rate it 4 stars instead of 5. While I sometimes like paranormal books, they're not my absolute favorite. So I had a hard time enjoying BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS as much as I wanted to, because of the overwhelming magic elements.<br /><br />This book also kind of reminded me of a Harry Potter novel, in that Ethan and his \\"rag-tag\\" group of friends were forced to go on this hardcore paranormal journey in order to save people and make everything right by fighting the monsters. That aspect of it was just kind of weird; it definitely wasn't my favorite plot.<br /><br />What I loved from the first book was the connection between Ethan and Lena, Marian the librarian, and Lena's family. And those are basically all of the things that are missing from this second book. But I'm hopeful that the next book will be a little different than this one was, based on its ending.
B00821OW8K|3.0|I would really probably rate this show a 3.5 star show if I could.  I like it, but there are so many times it is predictable and other times it is just down right unbeleivable.  For  example, how do they manage to run convoys in broad  daylight without getting hammered, yet other times  get nailed while holed up in some backwater.  I like Sci-fi.  This is middle of the pack sci-fi at best.
076115678X|5.0|This book is so informational.  It tells me stuff that I hadn't realized about curly hair.  It gives wonderful ideas on how to take care of your hair type along with step by step instructions ... The key words are NO POO ... I co wash and use no poo ... My hair is healthier and more manageable, and I've only been using this system for a few weeks now. Totally amazing!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book in high school, but didn't really appreciated as much as I did this second time around. Wanted to give it another go before laying eyes on the feature film...and I must say I almost don't want to watch the film now lol. This book will forever be a read to remember. But none-the-less, I'm sure Ang Lee's visual adaptation is a much deserved watch as well (judging from the praises it has received upon its initial release and awards). Anyone who hasn't read this book...please please please...do yourself a favor and swim through the words. If possible, read this before even thinking about watching the film. It was that good...at least for me.<br /><br />...Great work Mr. Yann!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Good movie but wasn't nearly as good as the first one... Probably won't watch again but enjoyed it... Sylvester Stallone is always fun to watch but poor acting in this one from many made me lose focus on getting into the movie. I would say it was more of a family reunion of bad boys, with a hint of war and a hint of humor.
0061692034|2.0|Did not care for story line or style of writing. Would not recommend as a book club read at all.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Khaled Hosseini brings the realities of Afghanistan right to you in such a way that you want to learn more.  This is a brilliantly written story based on the viewpoint of women there and how their status changes with whatever government is in power.
B009K86D86|5.0|This movie was eye-opening and well put together, thus the '5 star' rating. More people need to watch this in order to get on the road to changing how we patronize companies and consume products.... I was disgusted by the end, the movie did its job....
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoyable to play. Like the way you know that you have moves or have used all of them.  It is nice to have hints when stuck.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was my first David Baldacci book! Loved it! Then I read &#34;The Hit&#34; and now I am going to purchase a couple more of his books. This one was comparable to the Lee Child books with Jack Reacher, but I liked these ones even better!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Quick paced, fun and witty movie.  It's a fun take off on the Jack Nickleson film of a similar storyline but with an animated and character shift.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|What saved it for me is that I like stories that play off fairy tales and myth. It was a little more explicit than I'm comfortable with, and I had read an inaccurate synopsis that read this book was about movie stars and athletes being gods. Once it became more obvious who the characters were, it became more and more intriguing. The sleight of hand references woven through the tale were clever. Misdirection is the key.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Somewhere between a short story and a novell, this is a wonderful and mind opening read. The only problem is that it ends to soon.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This science  fiction series deals with a small group of people with different backgrounds, trying to solve threats that are increasingly becoming very real. I was fascinated to &#34;see&#34; how parallel universes are used in the series, especially after I learned from a Nova segment how physicists discuss this topic.  There is some character's development that enable to introduce some romance, an ingridient  which makes it more pleasurable to watch.<br />The life stories of the main characters and their past esperiences are intertwine in the Present and Future in a way that makes the final episode meaningful and fullfilling.  I highly recommend!
B000TEMSHA|5.0|One of the greatest albums by the Chili Peppers. I've been listening to it over and over.  It has all the early hits and underground songs.  Two versions of Sex Rap. It's good!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even in my 20s I still enjoy reading YA books. This one was no exception. I laughed, cried and felt a connection to the characters. The book is sad but uplifting at the same time. A must read!
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|This book is short which is good for my 8 month old. She likes it and so do I, good for bed time.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|Not sure if it is the film or the camera... 1 photo came out awesome, the rest were over, under or streaky....Expensive
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the story line. Although I did get frustrated at times with the way scenes were playing out I'm amazed that a story could pull that many emotions out of me. All and all the story as a whole connects every scene and chapter. You're going to get frustrated, happy, mad and excited all at once throughout this story with these two characters. I LOVED it.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Can't tell you much about this game as my Grand-daughter down loaded it one day to play.  She didn't ask if she could keep it on my kindle so I'm not sure how to rate it.
0385737955|4.0|Thomas is a blank slate. He remembers nothing but his name. Awakening in a pitch black room to the background noise of machinery and the smell of oil, he soon finds himself the newest in a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" like community of boys who live in what they call the \\"Glade\\" at the center of a giant maze.<br /><br />Each day, when giant doors to the maze open, runners go out into the maze to explore, looking for a way back to a world that none of them remember. At night, monsters stalk the maze, hunting the boys who do not return in time.<br /><br />With Thomas' arrival in the Glade, things begin to change, and when a girl arrives the next day-the first girl-things begin to look scary in earnest.<br />The fight to survive the maze, and to escape, is on.<br /><br />I listened to The Maze Runner with my Better-Half on a road trip, and we are of two minds about what we thought of the book. I don't know if it's because I'm a guy and she's...not, but we both walked away from the car, and the story, with different perspectives.  I really enjoyed it, and she, well, almost really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I was hooked by James Dashner`s opening. It's rarely a good idea to start a book off with no context, but that's exactly what Dashner does, and for his story it works very well. Usually a reader wants to know within just a few paragraphs where and when they are, what's going on. Instead, all Dashner tells us on the opening pages is a name \\"Thomas\\" and an elevator (and a pitch black one at that).  That's it. Even when Thomas arrives at the Glade, no one seems willing, or even able, to provide information. The questions seem to multiply even faster than the answers, and it pushes the story along from one cliffhanger to the next.  I felt lucky that we were trapped in the car for a long, ten hour stretch, because I didn't want to stop listening.<br />If there is one critique that I might agree with my Better-Half about, it's that Dashner tends to over-describe what's going on in his characters minds. While this could be chalked up to him catering to his audience-teen boys, I think-I wonder if readers could do just as well gleaning from the contextual clues what's going on between the characters.  I mean, when one guy is described as yelling with an angry look on his face, we get that he's angry. It's a small critique, though; I only noticed it because my Better-Half pointed it out.<br /><br />In any respect, I enjoyed the book and the surprise ending both satisfied and whet my appetite for more. It's one of those books where I give it three and a half stars (out of five) overall, but a full five stars for plot intensity. I mean, look: I went out and bought the next book in the series at a bookstore along the route we were driving just because I knew I was going to want to read it.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a fast, intense and exciting mystery. I can't wait to find out what Dashner does with Thomas and the others from the Glade in happens next in the sequel,  The Scorch Trials. Also to look forward to, The Maze Runner is slated to hit theaters as a major motion picture next March.  It'll be fun to see how well the book translates on the screen.s going on in his characters minds.

B008Y7ED5O|1.0|Very disappointed  It could have been so much better  She was a great lady and they made her out to be bad
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love this CD. The extra tracks add to the experience. I recommend it Celtic music lovers and Hobbit fans.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book, read better but its just a book, and a book is a book by any definition of the word.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Wonderful first installment by Brian De Palma of the Mission: Impossible franchise!<br />Definitely will be adding this to my video library and collection. :)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Engaging characters in engaging and often accessibly intricate schemes, ploys, vendettas, plots, and subplots--legal and interpersonal.  Even the high fashion sported by the most affluent characters - especially that of the series' supremely well-appointed women - constitutes a very attractive complement to the fine acting on offer.  This is a melodramatic wish-fulfillment fantasy with gorgeous interiors, a beautifully shot NYC, and a well-calibrated sense of humor which nicely balances the outrageous with the plausible.  Love it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is an easy, entertaining and relaxing game and challenging to try and meet or beat others scores because there are some impressive ones.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game, love the minions as always, although running games are always out, this is so far the best one yet
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I must have loved it, I read it in a day! You root for each character to overcome their emotional hurdles, ache at the random cruelty of fate, yet glory in the beauty and capacity for love inherent in human nature.
6305428387|4.0|I finally broke down and bought the DVD because we have watched our VHS so often that we've worn it out.  Love the movie!!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Very well written picture of the new York food scene from behind the scenes. Bourdain is a true talent in and out of the kitchen.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|It's different. It's funny. It's hot. Drew is a HOT mess, I liked him, he had me laughing out loud. I've never read a whole romantic novel from a man's POV..... great story!
B001I9B9I4|5.0|very cute and entertaining, good movie to watch with the grand-daughters.  very enjoyable, fairytale like but you can dream of being princess-like
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app does what it claims to do. It cleans up &amp; frees up much needed space. I have a 8 GB Kindle Fire and could not add any more books or apps. I tried to delete all of my apps &amp; I kept getting messages that my internal storage was full. Found this app on the Amazon forum. So glad I found it. Thanks!
B0043KK4N6|4.0|the vocals were really good; we really wanted some stripping music in addition - instrumental but that was absent on the CD.
B00632HWOG|3.0|The app works for the most part, but I consistently have issues deleting emails.  It won't let me select multiple emails at a time (via the check boxes) and delete them.  I often have to delete emails one at a time once I open them.  Annoying
