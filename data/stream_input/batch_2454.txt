B00CDT41RY|4.0|Decent movie. Christopher waltz was an Oscar worthy role. DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson were good as well. Worth the rental.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I had seen this movie in the theater before I bought the DVD.<br />I bought the 3D Blu-ray version and I recommend that because it has some good 3D effects.<br />The story line is also pretty radical - but I like it.
B001HC8516|5.0|For me this book was confirmation of what I had always suspected. My &#34;woman's intuition&#34; had always told me things weren't quite right but I wanted to believe what he was saying. After reading this book it knocked the legs out from under my ex's excuses and my belief in them. It wasn't easy to read, but I'm glad I did.
B004047XXO|1.0|I don't hate the movie - I just hate that it was placed in with Amazon's 3D Blu-ray movies and I stupidly did not check closely enough to see that it was one of those red-green glasses type.<br />I saw this movie in 3D at the theater and it was the 'real' 3d there.<br />So, just be careful what you buy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is so fun and it helpes  pas the time andy should rate it and if u don't like it it uor opinion
B004UA8D1O|4.0|I purchased this movie because it is a James Cameron film.<br />It is a pretty good adventure film - but hardly &#34;the next Avatar.&#34;<br />The cave shots were spectacular and the 3D is good as well.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After loosing track of things or eventually making it more complicated than needed, the saga is over... Still what happened to mat? He is the best!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I like this game better than the older one.  I like the power bird that looks like a super hero
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I enjoyed Bones are Forever. It is an exciting, riveting read.  Good buy also.  I recommend it to mystery lovers.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|decent enough movie but just not the same without big Arnold's over the top hero.  Love Colin but for me this version just didn't have the appeal of the first.
0345803493|5.0|She enjoyed the book.  I enjoyed everything else afterwards.  Well worth the read.  She said it was a good story.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Amazon prime streaming has Stargate Atlantis and sg1. watch them every night. this season really picks up from season 2. has great shows in this season, if you like it as much as I do, please buy or rent or just stream them, you cant go wrong with these great shows. Netflix just about lost my business because they took both off line, so its a great relief that my amazon prime allows me to still see them and purchase.
0345803485|5.0|She enjoyed the book.  I enjoyed everything else afterwards.  Well worth the read.  She said it was a good story.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|this was and still is one of the best big screen events many years ago, middle 50's I think, but all the special effects, roby the robot made his third appearance on this movie, the big winner was the sound effects they had i8n the movie, won a few awards that year. I own this movie a still watch it from time to time, its a hard movie not to. great writer's, great music score's and a great cast make this one of the best all around big screen sci fi movies of all times.
0345803507|5.0|She enjoyed the book.  I enjoyed everything else afterwards.  Well worth the read.  She said it was a good story.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|this season really sets up some new adventures, but heading to the finally in season 7, but the ending was not what I expected. they were making some of the new star trek episodes, but this show starts where star trek evolved from, enterprise. I loved all the character's, but 'Q,' only a couple epis were good with him causing more trouble for the captain. if any of you are not sure about sci fi stories, this is a good season to start with, but if you want the whole story, then start with season 1 and keep going. to me, these programs will last forever on cable or at least I hope so.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just love this love story. It is more than just sex and bondage. I love Christian dominant nature and how Ana makes him feel so weak at times... laters baby!!!!!
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|this is a great movie and really gets you involved with the story, that's why I bought all 5 seasons. the jeti and his padiwan keep the peace in the universe or at least try....there is always the back guys trying to stop them, the count being there main enemy. after you watch this movie, you will most defiantly purchase the whole seasons, I did and just love cgi stories, movies and tv shows.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This movie is just an average action thriller. It is really just a big ego boost for Tom Cruise who also produced it. There is a very awkward scene where he takes his shirt off to just show off his body. He continues to act very macho towards the defense attorney in numerous scenes and backs her into corners. The movie is about 15 minutes too long and has long segments that are very quiet with just 2 people talking. Mr. Cruise seemed to have been very tired towards the end of the filming of the movie. Towards the beginning he quickly put down 5 guys during a bar fight. Towards the end he was almost done in by just one guy, who was much sexier then Mr. Cruise by the way! We did watch the entire movie which is over 2 hours and enjoyed most of it. Mr. Cruise must of intentionally picked unknowns for the cast and then felt guilty and cast Robert Duvall for an excellent supporting role. This is an OK watch just don't expect a Mission Impossible movie.
B009FXIICK|3.0|But I think you need to be a crack addict / meth freak to be as fast as some of the people who consistently win.  The game is obviously heavily Asian influenced and designed.  You basically just match a few different animals in a row, kind of like Tetris but much faster and it's just about getting 3 or 4 in a row.  It's strangely addictive at first but then when you're playing online versus other people that somehow completely dominate you 19 times out of 20, it starts to get old very fast.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|Well written, enjoyable to read and easy to follow. Made the best bread I have ever eaten!! Making the bread is a process and takes a bit of time to get used to and to fit around your other life commitments but it is totally worth it. I now make a levain loaf fresh whenever we are having company. It always goes down well. I mainly cook the 75% whole wheat. With that much whole wheat every other recipe makes bricks! This one is light, tasty and almost similar to white European loafs I have tasted.
B003719G40|2.0|I enjoyed the suggestions as to how one might get their relationship back on track.  However, one can't believe that doing everything that their partner might &#34;need&#34; and &#34;want&#34; will make everything okay.  Read &#34;Five Love Languages&#34; for some interesting thoughts.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|Red State is a relentlessly unpleasant experience, with one jaded cynical take on humanity piled on top of another. Tarantino liked it, apparently.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I have had this game for quite a while and there are glitches that happen on it for instance right now .<br /><br />I don't have my own island , it is someone elses island.  two days ago I got on and I now have someone else's island<br />It is under my island name thought, a friend's island is now showing Scrats island instead of her own They need to find glitches and it doesn't always update eith
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book took no time at all to catch my attention and keep it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written celebrity biographies.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love to listen to Lindsey, my granddaughter introduced her music to me, it is nice to enjoy the same music as a teenager.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Such a great movie of its time. Interesting to see Grace Kelly in the movie shot in Monaco, when she met her Prince! Cary Grant is of course, Cary Grant.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best place to go for project ideas, recipes, and anything you want to know about any subject.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After watching Season 1 in it's entirety on my Kindle Fire HD I eagerly watched Season 2. I had to discipline myself to only watch one episode per day so I could get other things accomplished! The storyline is easy to follow, the house is so gorgeous, the costumes are beautiful and delicate. It is very easy to understand the British accents of the actors and you definitely start to develop your favorite characters. This is a wonderful series! Take the time to treat yourself to some excellent entertainment.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love this app. Simple to use and has a radar. Very good app I have already recommended it to all my friends.
193700788X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the conclusion to the Sookie Stackhouse series just as I enjoyed reading the 12 books that preceded it.  Charlaine Harris writes with wit and humor that I particularly enjoy.  I have also enjoyed Ms. Harris's previous series of books and look forward to her future projects.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS CASE, SO CONVENIENT. THE WAY IT REVOLVES IS SO HANDY.  A GOOD FRIEND WANTS ONE JUST LIKE IT.
B001TM14VC|5.0|This movie has a young Tom Cruise enchanting his instructor, consistently getting into just enough trouble to be interesting, and in the end saving the day with his edgy genius. It's a movie I've watched a few times and it is always enjoyable - just enough excitement and action, not so unbelievably over the top as some more recent movies. Although, maybe that's just my ignorance of jet piloting speaking.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this movie!
B00A757EFW|1.0|This game shucks unless you get the full version. I got to level 2 and it said that if I wanted to keep playing I would have to buy the full version.
1451696191|4.0|Well written debut.  One year in the life of a High School freshman who is very smart but doesn't seem to fit in with the crowd.  He meets up with a Cool \\"Uncool\\" group of Seniors who become his closest friends.  The book tackles sexual abuse, physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and homosexuality as well as first dates, first loves and much more in just 200 plus pages.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Very entertaining.  A picture of life during the time and place depicted.  More like a soap opera in that it continues from one show to the next.  Watch it from the beginning.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a great movie and the story is fantastic. Leaves you guessing in the end. A story of survival that is scary and funny too. Not recommended for small children since there are scenes of hurt and dying animals.
B009R659L8|5.0|I loved this book! Typical plot style of Mary Higgins Clark with the usual twists - but well done.  Any fan of her books should enjoy this one
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is sick! I loved it. Classic Tarentino master piece. Lots of emotion and blood. Great for kids if they've already seen kill bill.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|While it is an account of an incrediblly courageous effort, it id sn excellent look into a disgraceful attempt at govrerning.
B00413QB5A|4.0|Ken Follet is one of my favorite authors and this book is up to his great story telling.  Hard to put the book down.
B0091WMSNU|4.0|The characters are awesome as is the dialog. Couldn't be a better group of actors for this.  This is a movie you need to attention to, or maybe watch twice, but kits worth it and I enjoy watching it.
B0095P31L6|5.0|It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie as much as this one.<br /><br />4 more words required
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Jeffrey Archer has been a favorite since Cain and Abel. My only complaint is the cliff hanger endings in order to make you wait for the next book.  I'm an older reader and want my stories to be complete...just in case!
B00BZODDYU|3.0|The movie was creepy, eerie , and just how i imagined it would be from the trailers.....it satisfied me on that level almost all the way through, but the final 10 minutes made the &#34;Mama&#34; creature...ghost...apparition...whatever you want to call her, so lame on how they eventually represented her that it made the end a disappointment....scary for the first 3/4's....ending? wimpy and lame....Jessica Chastain as always was excellent & so was the entire cast...even Mama !!!!
B0022CY8WK|5.0|Saw the movie again recently and realized I had forgotten some of the songs and dance productions. I enjoyed it so much I ordered the album so I could listen while traveling. It's clear, crisp quality makes you feel you are in the movie theater again as you picture each scene while listening to it.
B009X01C64|4.0|This case would have had five stars except for the falling issue.  I knew it could fall because of the reviews so I was trying to be very careful but the very day I bought the Kindle, I was trying to charge it and the Kindle fell onto my granite counter top.  Fortunately, it didn't break.  I immediately added velcro and it has been fine ever since.  The elastic strap on the case itself can be looped around the Kindle to hold it in place as well.  Other than that problem, the case is sturdy and feels like real leather which I believe it is.  I experienced no problem fitting the Kindle into the case, it snapped right in and is held securely in place.  The Kindle cannot be charged with the case closed unless it is rotated which is cumbersome.  Having the case open during charging is only a minor inconvience and should not deter any one from purchasing this case.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|If you're into gory stuff, you don't want to miss this thing.  There's blood and guts flying all over the place.  If you're into stupid movies, you, for sure, don't want to miss this thing.  The theme is the most improbable you'll ever encounter -- some young black dude shooting up everybody on a pre-Civil War southern plantation.  Another old black dude that appears to be the real master on the same pre-Civil War southern plantation.  I mean, really, can you even imagine a more inane scenario?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a page turner! My mother found this series and recommended it for us to read. She started first, but I caught up and flew past her, staying up late to find out what would happen next in this incredible journey.<br />I will be reading more of this series. You should too!
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Good entertainment, if you have nothing better to do.  That's about it, in a nutshell.  Better than DJango, that's for sure!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|And this seems to be a link back to their prog-rock past. It is well produced and recorded. Their supporting concert brought these songs to life and in the process made it an experience rather than just another concert.
B008MWBY6W|1.0|The plastic clip on one end of the shoulder strap broke at the swivel joint less a minute after I carried the case on my shoulder.  The case fell on the hardwood floor with my Canon 6D w/ a 24-10mm zoom lens in it.  Fortunately the case was zipped up otherwise it would totally ruin my day.  I owned many backpacks, messenger bags, tote bags... but never had one failed like that.  I hate to return things besides I would like to use the case for my trip this weekend.  Thus, I replaced the broken strap with one from on of my old camera bags so that I can use it for the weekend.  Then I found out this case is awkward to carry.  First of all, the plastic loops on the case are too wide so the clips on the strap constantly shifting back and fore as I walked.  Secondly, the placement of loops on the case is perfect for an empty case.  However, after I put my DSLR camera in it the cg of the loaded case shifted closer to the back of the case. The loaded cased then tilted with the nose of the case constantly rubbing against my hip and the top of the case tilt away from my body.  With the shifting of the clips, it makes the case feel larger then it is and awkward to carry.<br /><br />After looking closely at the product my assessment is that  the case itself is well made but the plastic pieces are a different story.  I examined the failed surface of the plastic clip. Almost half of the fractured surface was covered with pores (air pockets or dirts). With today's plastic injection molding technique so common and well developed, those plastic parts must come from a factory with very poor quality control of the material handling and molding processes.  Although I replaced the strap with one that I can trust, what about the plastic loops on the case.  Next time I might not be so lucky if one of them fails on me.  My $2,000 camera equipment could be ended up in the bottom of an ocean or a canyon.  So I decided to return it for a refund.  I brought hundred of items from Amazon over the years and I have never returned one because I didn't like it until now.  The irony is that this case is made by Amazon itself so I am disappointed.<br /><br />No.  I would not recommend this product to anyone unless Amazon improve the quality of the plastic parts and reposition and redesign the loops on the case.
0142403873|5.0|I saw the television version of this story before having read the book and I knew I had to go out and buy it. It's such a fantastic story and my two year old asks for it every night now. I will definitely have to check out more books by this clever author.
B000Y90VO2|5.0|Is delicious! A classic slapstick adventure starring Val Kilmer as Nick Rivers, an American Rock and Roller, trapped in East Germany.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Its nice to see a Cruise movie in which his trademark glasses and smile are left out.<br />In this flick, you get to see the street cred/ghetto low tech Cruise,- lean, dirty, in jeans, and ready for trouble.<br />And in T-Cruise films, they are always careful to have Tom as the prettiest face in the movie, and in this flick its no different.<br />Chosen as his co-star is Rosamund Pike, who was excellent a few years ago as the sweet eldest sister in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".. And this time she's on board to fulfill the movie's subtext as his girl whom he never kisses tho she wishes he would.<br />They have good chemistry onscreen as she portrays the educated upper class in the movie which plays in balance perfectly against Cruise's finest choreographed  ass kicking role since \\"The Last Samurai\\".<br />This 3.5+ star movie and recent 4 star \\"Oblivion\\" are proof that Cruise should remain at the top of the pack.<br />Worth a look.

IT DOES NOW!!!!<br />Four letters for the Behringer RV600: OMFG!<br />And the bang for the buck...are you bleeping kidding me!<br />So many combo's of different types of verb.This is a toy I will not soon tire of.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I like the whale and the fact it is not just oa game but a pizzle that you have to think ahead for your next move. Good it help kids think of consequences of their actions.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Very well acted movie.  Have watched it many times over the years and will select this when nothing is on the numerous cable channels!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this app is that it makes me feel bad when I can't get the birds out of the cages. But otherwise it's awesome.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I hope nobody paid for this game.  It must be meant for children because it held my interest for about 30 minutes before it got deleted.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|I love this movie was fun and I can watch it again and again especially that Michael Jordan guy lol.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book couldn't have been any better. I have been waiting to watch the movie because I wanted to finish the book... Definitely worth the wait. I've watched movies but never read any of the books but this one was a must. LOVED IT!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book set a high bar for scifi reading for adolescents. It'll be interesting how it translates onto the big screen with its unique narratives, characters, and scenery.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I have an old nano... who knows what generation.  A negative message popped up when I plug it in.  I am an old guy and not good at this tech stuff... but  I ignored it and continued trying to set it up with my blue tooth headphone.  It works and I spent an hour dancing around the house wireless!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a fantastic, easy to use calculator... especially since it is free. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|Sometimes you just need to be entertained! Everyone that reaches midlife can identify with parts of this movie. My wife and I both liked it.
1936608898|5.0|It Starts with Food has all of the information and tools you need to get started on a better, healthier life!
0783231202|5.0|Based on a true story in American history this movie came out and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1997 along with &#34;Britannica&#34; which eventually swept the awards away leaving &#34;Amistad&#34; empty handed which I think was a travesty.<br /><br />The story line could have been assembled more succinctly I think, but the acting (especially by Anthony Hopkins) is superb! I mention Hopkins because the opportunity to shine came to him in the part presented to play (and he rose to the occasion), but the acting of Djimon Hounsou, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew McConaughey is above excellent.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|Enjoyed this movie and it's light-hearted way of pointing out the pitfalls of growing older and marriage pitfalls.  Provided entertainment as well as a few laughs!
B00BHMF578|5.0|I liked this movie very much.  I remember when this happened, but of course did not know the details. Bravo to those who pulled this feat off and lived to another day. Movie well done.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Awakenings are to be found in the the earth`s natural spaces.  Cheryl Strayed showed that to herself and her readers
B00000J2PH|4.0|For baby boomers or older, it is a must have. I don't do vinyl anymore and this was a good substitute. There is a reason it was a monster hit. So many great songs.
0385349831|5.0|Paulo Coelho is a genius, I love his writing, they have, literally, changed my life. Through these readings, we are reminded again and again, of what is important, of what really matters, of our human condition, of our weakness, of our strengths. Of how to live life to the fullest in an honest, genuine way. It is a beautiful book that I keep at my bedside.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|Darcy was pathetic and downright annoying at times. It took the author the whole book to make Darcy a better person. I wanted to know more about Rachel and Dex. In real life Ethan and Darcy would NEVER be a couple let alone marry.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Was very similar to the movie. Was a easy fast read. I recommend it if you need a filler book.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great story, great actors, great performances.  This is a movie you do not want to miss!  This was an Oscar worthy movie.
B00BVVA138|4.0|With the exception of a couple tracks this is a great album.  Those couple tracks are why I didn't rate this as great.  &#34;In Due Time&#34;, &#34;No End In Sight&#34;, &#34;Time Will Not Remain&#34;, and &#34;Slave To The Machine&#34; are the highlights for me.<br /><br />Overall &#34;Disarm the Descent&#34; is a must own for any Killswitch Engage or metal fan!
B007SGM084|2.0|I had to see. Brother-this is a downright terrible series. Not well written and certainly not sexy. To be fair, I generally read text books or business books/pubs. Most of my pleasure reading consists of periodicals. But I have to say, not only was this awful, but it was really quite boring. I was expecting much better.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|We love this app, my daughter can each play one hand, little difficult to buy new songs. Out of  5 bought<br />only 3 in song list.
193700788X|1.0|Everyone has pretty much summed up why this book was just underwhelming. I was really disappointed. I waited so long for the last book and it didn't live up to the rest of the series :(
1592332803|5.0|Several years ago someone made me the Cinnamon Coffee Cake from this book: this changed everything!  That was my first introduction to delectable vegan desserts!  Recipes to help you cook without eggs, milk, butter - recipes that will come out tasting better than all of those things you baked before!!!
B004SKLFJS|5.0|It was thrilling to see Michael in Lord of the Dance again.  I saw the original long ago and even saw the traveling troupe in person but no one beats Michael with his passion and love of dance.  Loved it!!!!
B0094M2ITG|1.0|Bloated self indulgent tripe from the hands of grotesquely overrated director Tim Burton. This is not a film for watching. This is  film for laying down and avoiding.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|A true story which restores your faith in human nature. Two opposing enemies, taught to hate each other, meet in a situation that resolves into an act of inexplicable human kindness and charity. The follow up of the event brings a feeling of bonhomie, and a tear to the eye. Everyone should read this book. It makes you feel good, (and lucky),  to be alive.
B006QF5CU6|5.0|Eraser is a wonderful rollercoaster of a ride with many twist and turns.  It is non-sop action with humor mixed in.  I love the line 'You've just been erased'.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am a huge Tolkien fan. For the most part, this movie sticks to the book storyline well. The characters are interesting, & funny, as the book had portrayed. Would recommend to all Tolkien fans.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This was an incredible adventure and a wonderful work of art.  Photography is not always considered an art form by some.  This epic of a picture had everything in it for anyone to love and even shed a tear.  It is filled with lots of adventure and hidden meanings to life in general.  I watched it in 3D and was mesmerized by the photography/graphic work done on this film.  The acting was also fantastic.  It is a MUST SEE Film!<br /><br />Ken Morris, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA
B0012HEB32|5.0|This is my favorite tv show, love the a terminator series, great effects and just an awesome addition to the series
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|As always, the cast, the photography, the visual effects and the writing of Merlin were fantastic!<br /><br />However, I was sad to see the adventures end after its 4 or 5 year run.  It is sort of like becoming good friends with someone and they die or move away, never to see them again.  I shall miss all of them, but esp. I shall miss the wonderful rapore between Merlin and Arthur...they were perfect for the roles.  The ending is not too be missed...very moving last episode!!!<br /><br />Thank you all for a wonderful adventure and a walk back in &#34;Time!&#34;<br /><br />Ken Morris, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|This movie makes you feel like you have lived the life of the characters in the story. So true and right on..
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great production and as always great work from the assembled actors and great direction work and filming!<br />Thanks for the look at an historic event in the history of our country.  Hopefully, a few folks will read more about this period and the consequences of Lincoln's death and the horrible Republican Reconstruction process of the American South.  Not to mention the inadequate structuring of educating and absorbing the Black Americans into the mainstream of American society & culture!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ken Morris, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Like BTB Nicholas Sparks always is a good light read with a little mystery in it. Well developed characters also
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great new adventure.  I look forward to seeing the next story in this epic adventure.  Great acting and beautiful scenes from that beautiful country down under (New Zealand).  Acting and photography work were intensive and wonderful.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ken Morris, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!  After reading this I know why I have always been a Lincoln fan. The cast of characters is perfectly defined and each of their roles in our history is played out.  I learned so many more details of the plots against him, his family and his political choices of both his cabinet and how he handled the war.  I saw the movie after reading this and it is just a minute in time compared to the impact of the book.
089898890X|4.0|Never studied bop drumming all that much. Great introduction. Lots to learn from John Riley, a great instructor and drummer.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I was impressed with the first few episodes...<br /><br />Then they let the cat out of the bag and the ending is just drug out and boring...
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|You know who you are. You've read everything she's written since you first discovered her. Is this any different, just because it focuses on a different scion of the bloody, brilliant Vor aristocracy? No, it's not - it's fantastic.. Buy it now.

B004S5C91Q|4.0|Different parts of this book keep coming back to me. It was written in a unique way that made me see the story through the eyes of a young child. I feel effected by this book.
193700788X|1.0|The quality of the writing has gone downhill significantly over the last few books. This series was like a 13 course meal, and the final dishes have been bland, under-cooked, and have ruined the meal as a whole. In fact, they seem to have been prepared by a different chef entirely.<br />It doesn't matter how good the appetizers are when the dessert gives you diarrhea.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is an interesting modern day adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.  They have created an interesting dynamic between Holmes and Watson.  Additional the play between Holmes and his brother being “Big Brother” adds a nice twist!  Definitely an enjoyable watch.
B0000DKBKW|3.0|I'm a fan of Pink - including the 'B sides'. I bought this CD to complete my collection of her studio albums. I am disappointed in the tone of the album, and the rough quality of the songs. She has written much better songs before and after this. So collectors like me will want it, but it is the mutt of the bunch.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is an interesting modern day adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.  They have created an interesting dynamic between Holmes and Watson.  Additional the play between Holmes and his brother being “Big Brother” adds a nice twist!  Definitely an enjoyable watch.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a must read for every professional woman (or one who is aspiring).  Sheryl opens her soul and let's you know she has felt what you are feeling and has found some practical ways to work within a male dominated system.  This would also be great for the employer who has female associates and would like to truly understand the challenges that working women face.  I've reread passages several times and will hang on to this one.....
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the characters and can empathize with them. I really love the story line and am so ready to see Season 3!
B004EF8AJA|5.0|I love pretty much every part of this series, and have watched it frequently. The differences between the characters are interesting, and watching Richard Armitage brood will *never* get old....
B0091XT22O|5.0|Director Stanley Kubrick took Stephen King's novel and adapted it to the big screen. It is classy and scary but not a common slasher movie that we see more and more as time goes on. This movie has great writing, directing, cinematography and acting (Jack Nicolson).  This is definitely one to add to your collection.
B005HEH9XA|4.0|Of all the series in the Star Trek franchise, Enterprise this one was one of the best from start to finish.  Not every episode was perfect, but most of them were as good as, if not better than, certainly Voyager, and certainly the first season of TNG.  A series that deserved better than it got from Paramount, I was sad to see it go, but delighted to be able to catch up with it on Amazon.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|I love Michael Buble's music!  Great listening and singing music.  It is the go to song when nothing else works.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci in this thriller is in my opinion is an amazing writer. The suspense and drama expressed in this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. I could put it down until I finished it. If your into mystery and intrigue then this book is for you. I only hope this country has government service agents such as this in our service.
B0043RGXJS|5.0|It is not crazy to love this song.  It is natural.  Michael Buble knows how to do it!  Love song's are his thing,....I'm there.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved this book, first time I had read any of Jojo Moyes books and wasnt disappointed, thoroughly recommend it. I found it a thought provoking book re ones choice od euthenasia.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I found it so ill conceived... not funny at all ...actually silly... this mixture of drama and musical comedy did not cristalize with me... however, i have to add that i only watch 15 minutes of it i hated it so....
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love, love, love it! There are sooo many levels and all are fun to play. The new power ups make it better and even more fun.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|the movie is very close to the book... the acting was as fine as the BBC can bring us...i was very untertaining..
B004SBX112|5.0|As all other games in the Angry Birds Series, it's super fun and very addictive, the new power ups added make it even better!
B005LAIGNC|4.0|great action very good rendition of a true story. actors played each character to a tee see it to believe it
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It's very addictive and fun, the goals make it better. Play it enough and you get nice rewards such as new backgrounds and swords.
B007REV4YI|5.0|We have enjoyed watching Skyfall and it was a great bargin. Although it was used, the disc was in good condition.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's very fun and addictive, there are many levels and it's challenging but worth it! The little candy eating monster is sooo cute!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I thought the book was pretty good but kind of rushed and at times confusing because Charlaine Harris was trying to tie up any possible loose end.  I probably should have read the last two books again because there were times where a couple of the characters were together but I couldn't remember when or how they had connected and what the connection was to Sookie.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's an alright app but laggy and awkward controls. Fun if you like flying the same areas over and over.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|A definite must have for any one that loves or enjoys Star Wars. You will want to watch these episodes over and over again.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Jewel Legends: Tree of Life is a fun addictive game. When you reach the stone at the end of each level you just can't wait to see the structure develop. The graphics are awesome.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|This is a fascinating topic, but too much unnecessary detail, names, and places,etc. are included..  Often reads like a term paper.  I felt it would spend more time regarding Lindbergh , but it didn't..
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was totally awesome dude. It was better than I thought it would be. It was funny, cool, and extremely weird.
B004LROUNG|5.0|If you like Grisham's book, you will live &#34;the Litigators&#34; .  The plot twists and the realism keep you involved throughout the book.
B00650SSDU|3.0|Justin as usual is amazing! He simply carries the movie on his shoulder. It's a very good light hearted comedy
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved this movie, will definitely buy it on dvd to watch over and over. It was a love story and comedy rolled into one, and both Cooper and Lawrences characters were amazing. I loved seeing Jennifer in a different role, only other thing I've seen her in is The Hunger Games, however she nailed this and was outstanding. Bobby D was also a great addition as Coopers father.  A very happy ending for all!
B000OSDSKM|5.0|Seven Days in May, starring Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner and Kirk Douglas, explores what happens when a democracy tries to move from defense to treaty, and how challenging that might be for a society.  Well acted, well shot, exciting to the end....
B009S33I68|4.0|This is the real deal....this is where some screen writer Hollywood'd the real deal. Classic lines from the movie were taken right out of this book. It's a pity the movie didn't live up to the book. Which is usually the case. Seen the movie then get the real inside scoop..this is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the 60's and what American soldiers went through. You may come out the otherside feeling a little overought...
B0089LOG02|5.0|Filled with historical facts, of course, this book engages the reader from start to finish and connects today with earlier times which were harsh.  Things today are far from perfect, but there are some improvements in many areas.
B0097AX6EQ|5.0|This book is ageless. It's so informative that I was once hauled out of a B model Huey cause I got it started on the ground. The pilot just shook his head in disbelief. I told him I had read Chickenhawk.  Robert Mason gives a non nonsence account of Army life in the 60's. From behind the controls of a Helicopter.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|Eagles are great road trip music choice.  Saw this CD being featured on TV and, as a fan of the Eagles, wanted to get their latest collection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twist and turns, keeps you wondering if and how the husband could have killed his wife and not be in jail.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is really fun, but the words you type sometimes gives you something totally different.  For example, I entered Indian; it gave me a choice of other words, one of which was idiot....
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Legal shows are not usually my thing, but this show capitalizes on the all too real problems of Politicians being caught with their pants down. I like that it tells us the story of the fall-out of the families... the wife....the kids...the mistress, etc. The corrupt husband goes to prison and the wife must go back to work after many years to provide for her kids. The show starts strong and then you get interested in the cases she has, and people around her, It starts out about the wife but soon you are interested in all the little sub-plots and story lines of the people she works with. There is a lot going on here to love! After I finished Season 1, I kept on going.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The opening scenes were riveting.  However, the following story was unbalanced in the way it treated the saving of so many lives as somewhat trivial when compared with the pilot's too human failings.  Once it became obvious there would be hell to pay for the pilot's alcoholism and addictions, the relentless pressure to confess quickly became a path too clear to be interesting.  The one exception to the inevitable storyline leading to the dramatic revelation at the trial was John Goodman's &#34;rescue&#34; scene.  While painful to watch, the skill in acting the part of the drug and alcohol EMT to Washington's ailing tragic role was a joy to see.  In my opinion, the film would have been improved by leaving about twenty minutes of failed attempts by the pilot to avoid embracing his disease (alcoholism) on the cutting room floor.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|Time can be defined by sunsets, birthdays, heartbeats and love. Rod Stewart shares  some of his most personal thoughts and moments with this cd. He opens the door to his heart and soul.. it is honest, it is human, and it is a great gift for his fans. If you are not a Rod Stewart fan...now is the Time!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved the story, it was hunorous as well as sad and at times very touching. I definietly would recommened this story.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Have always been a Moody Blues and Justin Hayward fan. Just wish we'd get a few more new songs with each new album. Too many repeats.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|GRRRR!!!!  I hate apps like this that replace the basic functions of other, perfectly good functions on my kindle fire.  Now when I try to just download something, ES file plays it instead, and the thing I was trying to download doesn't get saved.  I just wanted something to access files on public networks.  I may have to remove this from my kindle fire.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have now watched all three season three times; I can't wait for Season 4;  This is a fine example of good television, clean, too when the entertainment industry has their heads on straight, they really can put on worthwhile programs.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have watched it almost every day. The cast is great! Alfie Boe is the best JVJ imo (and I've always loved Colm).
0385349947|2.0|What can I say, not a fan. This reads like a data dump. Seems like Sheryl employed a bunch of researchers to build her arguments and then just dumped all the data into a \\"book\\".
B007MU85D0|4.0|this is a good album. I like<br />all the songs except track 8 (love, love , love)<br />and track 12 (yellow light).<br /><br />track 8 I found to be too repetitive and not catchy enough.<br /><br />track 12 started out good, but too little singing, and feels<br />like an incomplete song.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|Obviously this is a classic/masterpiece. I don't contend to dispute that. Probably would have gotten a ton more by reading with a teacher.  However, without a teacher, it read as a simplistic, overly fantastic tale.
B005PK56TA|2.0|I tried to watch this a couple times on TV, but could never really follow it.  I tried watching them hear and still just could not get the story line. I'm sure some people will like the stranageness of it.  It wasn't for me.
B00000I41J|5.0|A great album from anyone that likes Jazz. In other words, I listen to some pretty disonnent/hardcore jazz, but my family is more into easy going jazz. This album has all the richness you'd ever want, but is still easy enough to listen to. Get some.
1616550414|5.0|Get this book!  It has EVERYTHING you ever wanted to know and more about the Zelda franchise/universe.  GET THIS BOOK! You WON'T be disappointed! :)
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I bought this because my husband wanted one for his Birthday.  Works great and he is very pleased with it.
193700788X|1.0|For years I was a huge Sookie fan. I loved the books...until the last 3. They've just gotten worse with each one. This one was the worst yet and I'm glad the series is over and I won't feel compelled to read more gibberish out of loyalty.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is an excellent product-worked without skipping.  We saw it in theaters and loved it so much we wanted a copy of our own!
B000001G5H|5.0|If you want to listen to Chopin's Etudes, this is a good album. Sometimes you just want to hear some Chopin.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Even though this movie is a little bit older, my kids LOVED it! It has a timeless quality to it that is fun and perfect for a tween/teen audience. I still love this movie as much as when I saw it for the first time when I was a tween!
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Love the piano music, the pianist and Beethoven. Kempff is one of the great pianists and we are lucky that someone made recordings.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|well! without hestating! it is a really good movie (its not a movie though)! i love it so much and it is awesome!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the hobbit and I can't wait for the next one. Peter Jackson did not disappoint.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie somehow escaped my Harry Potter collection in between moves. So glad to finally have it back home where it belongs!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It's hard for me to get hooked on a show, but I absolutely loved Homeland Season 1, and have since watched it twice more with other friends. If you're looking for a show that you can get hooked on right away - this is a must!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I can't believe I'm saying this but the only complaint I have was too many sex scenes. I found myself skimming them. But the plot thickens and there is a nice twist at the end.
B00338QENI|5.0|I love it. I really appreciated the author putting the personal touch of getting to know about Henrietta Lacks and her family besides the interesting history of her cells have done for us.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|Superb film-- over a half-century since it was released and it still fascinates and resonates with possibilities. The cast cannot be topped!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|This was a rental that my girlfriend wanted to see and one that I ended up watching as well.  Although it probably was not a movie a movie I would have picked on my own, I did like it like and would tell others to check it out as well.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I can not believe that these four people survived this awful tragedy especially the little children. How frightening this whole ordeal was and happy that they found each other alive. So sad for all the other people and the devastation to the country.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I am a fan of the original as well and I like how they kept basic story... yet changed a few things in a unique way.  Watch it.
B008XFJEE2|3.0|Had heard many things about this show over the years..I guess for the year it came out it was pretty erotic but compared to movies today..nothing. Mickey Rourke was so handsome and why he went into boxing and then had all those awful face lifts. Kim Basinger is okay but just a silly dumb blonde.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|We had a great time watching the movie.  The plot was well done and the movie was well directed.  Watch it.
193700788X|4.0|Dead Ever After has been out for, what, three days and the fans are in an uproar.  When I saw the number of one star reviews I was shocked. I read the first 20 and thought, wait, are these reviewers actually reviewing the book or ranting about the choices Mrs. Harris has made?<br /><br />It's fairly clear that there is virtually no real \\"literary criticism\\" in most of the negative reviews. I'm not even sure I should use the term \\"literary criticism\\" when talking about the SVM books, but the point is a review should, at some point, actually discuss the books qualities as a book.<br /><br />There will be spoilers...<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />I loved Sookie in this book. I loved how she worried about having enough pancake batter for all her guests. I loved that she was the target of multiple enemies and yet still wanted to work on her tan. I loved that she was worried about what one character thought about her \\"assets.\\" These are the things that make Sookie a real living character to me and kept me reading for all these years. Mrs. Harris has an ability to weave these mundane everyday things into a book about death and supernaturals and make it work. A lot of writers try this and fail.<br /><br />I liked the mystery and how Mrs. Harris was able to bring in 10-15 characters and give them each a part in the mystery and some type of closure to their story. I have read and continue to read many series with enough dropped plot lines to sink a ship. Mrs. Harris gave her characters an ending and wrapped up a lot of loose ends. That cannot be an easy thing to do and makes this a much better book than many have stated.<br /><br />I liked how the main characters all got the ending they earned.  Eric fans be warned. Eric was a self serving vampire living and enjoying the world of vampire politics. He got that life in spades  in the end of this book. Mrs Harris was totally consistent in the treatment of this character in my opinion. Sookie also got the ending she deserved. She will have a family and children. This is what she always wanted. Again, consistent.<br /><br />What I did not like:<br /><br />Too many enemies in one book. Mrs. Harris could have picked one of the three main enemies and focused on that as the mystery.  I really liked the beginning with the devil and would have liked to see that issue focused on and brought to bear in the end.<br /><br />All in all, Mrs. Harris should be applauded for a fantastic series and creating a world that we all could get lost in for a little while. I look forward to her next series. Bravo
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie just seems &#34;real&#34;.  I was surprised how much I liked it and it is one of those movies I could watch again and still be entertained.  I understand why it received such high reviews and rewards.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Once read, cannot imagine anything to be disappointed with in the storytelling of the last events of the Wheel of Time. Just great way to end years of dreams, memories, imagination.<br /><br />The only problem: What to read now?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There are not the traditional action scenes in this movie that boost the ratings of other movies, but I was entertained the whole time.  Very good movie and very well directed.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Its a wonderful story - great to reinforce children's imagination.  Too much TV can make them forget how to dream and they get into reality too soon in their short period of being a \\"child\\", but this story is great for them.  These are my thoughts!
B000FC11A6|5.0|very funny, genuinely masterful use of language, plot has twists and turns. Those who liken the author to a readable Pynchon are spot on
B0094LZY2A|4.0|I remembered watching this highly imaginative and hilarious movie when I was a kid. A new generation loves it too!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you like X Files or CSI, you will love this. It has a little of the Mentalist in there too!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I'm only a third of the way through the book.  It's extremely interesting to see the evolution of the Apple products, the growth of Jobs as a person and seeing his quirky side ias well.  I love the book, it's very well done.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|Its an awesome game just wish I didn't have to buy cash to restore energy or buy certain things, but if you wait you can do the same things without money. Love this game!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very fun game.  No issues at all.  Works 100% of the time.  Fast to load, fast to play!  Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book, what a story. A great read for a summer vacation because you won't want to put it down!
6304698798|5.0|Received as expected. On Time, and product was in new condition. No problems with this purchase. I would recommend this product. Can't get much better in a western than Clint Eastwood.
B007U8U1V8|4.0|Enjoyed most of the songs on the album.  I like the way Jack White stays true to his sound but still sounds different than most out there
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Se n'est peut-être pas le film que j'ai préféré le plus en 3D,mais c'est quand même un bon film.j'ai hâte de voir un vrai bon film 3D dont l'image sort réellement de l'écran.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|These guys are kind of like the Queen of today,  just make songs people catch themselves singing along with.  True vocals which seem to be a rare find in music
B00447G29S|4.0|En 3D se qui se fait le mieux en 3D se sont les dessins  animés et le top du top des dessins qui sortent le plus de l'écran est à mon avis  Le voyage extraordinaire de Samy 1 et 2.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|you were out of this movie and I was back ordered and I canceled and tried a month later. I am happy I was patient as this is a movie I have introduced many friends too and it has never failed to be a great pick.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Sorry but comparisons to Arnold's version are unavoidable. This guy has no charisma and the tale is extremely dark for my taste. Would watch the original many times over this one any day.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This is an epic film.  I could and will watch it over and over again.  Covers to whole expansion to time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book. Humorous and heart warming.  The protagonist Jamie deserved love and a family as we all do. Good red
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I would probably give this book four stars, if it weren't for the bad taste the tone left in my mouth when the author bashed organized, Christian religion in the beginning.  The tone almost made me put the book down and the bashing didn't even contribute to the story.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't, though.<br /><br />The story was fun and consumed my imagination for a few days - Willy Wonka in a techy world with a heavy coating of the 80's.<br /><br />I'd recommend the book to all my late thirty and forty year old geek friends, with a warning about the beginning.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|My husband and I LOVE this show.  We missed the last three episodes, so we downloaded them via Amazon.com and it was worth ever penny!! The best part... no commercials.
B005N09L5C|4.0|Great acting and production.  Sadly, becoming too relevant to present day.  Consideration should be made to make this a mandatory film (and book read) for school grades Junior High to College.
B0094LNMGU|5.0|I love this movie. If your a fan of vampires, You should watch this. There is a lot of action in it. :)
B005VMSATA|5.0|Nice good clean movie without too much violence.  Appropriate for kids and adults of all ages.  We need more movies like this.
B00338QENI|5.0|I had no idea any of this existed.  And I live in Baltimore and I am a polio survivor.  And her children and grandchildren and great grandchildren live in our small town.  And I go to Hopkins regularly for a medical problem.  I think the author did an incredible job of sticking with this family and getting a perspective other then just the actual medical information.  At first I thought it would be a &#34;text&#34; book but it turned out to be an insight into a typical family in the 1950's to the present.  Thank you for this book.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|The preview didn't get me too excited...but when I saw it was from the creator of Pan's Labyrinth I thought I'd give it a go. It was TERRIFYING and incredibly well done. I would recommend it to anyone...and also would recommend to not watch it alone.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This movie is a hidden treasure about a woman's struggle to regain her life. And... they made it realistic without making the movie so graphic you had to have a stomach made of iron to watch it. Loved it!
B007R0WHMK|5.0|I was unsure about the movie from the title and description but was pleasantly surprised. The movie is beautifully shot, captivating and thrilling. Definitely recommend it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I got this app for my kindle fire hd. Because my &#34;flash&#34; player had expired. I also have an I-pad and my youtube app there is very simple to use. I find search for specific videos not convinenant at all
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I've always quite enjoyed reading the classics, especially the Bronte sisters ones, and anything by Jane Austen. I enjoyed this book as well, though not quite as much as I loved Wuthering Heights. The characters are well developed, though they take some time to really get in to. Once Mr. Darcy comes onto the scene, things heat up a little, but most of the book seems to be about anticipation. This can be quite enjoyable for someone that loves to analyze and anticipate things, however I can not see people who only love action and adventure being able to get past the first chapter.<br />Still, I would read it a second time for the same reason I read Jane Eyre again, it's enjoyable to get to the heart of a character and feel with them, wait with them, and try with them!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I love how easy it is to navigate and use, i hate it when something so simple has to be overly complicated. This app makes it very easy to see whats going on with out having to waste a lot time
B0057R5G6E|5.0|This set has all three Jurassic park Movies With tons of extra material that have been Upgraded With blu ray Picture and sound. there is also a cool statue of a t-rex breaking through the Jurassic park doors.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love game just wish if u had to change devices u didn't have to start over. I was lvl 30 and my kindle stopped working and had to get a new one. I eagerly redownloaded it to play and had to start over :(
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|diamond dash is collect as many of the same color of diamonds as you can.  This is very similar to other games but thought it was entertaining and fun!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Action packed. It was a good look at the Navy Seals in general and the mission that got Osama Ben Laden in particular. I would recommend this book for anyone.<br /><br />Albert Tully
0802798225|5.0|I read this book a couple years ago and fell in love with it. I also gave the book to a couple friends and cousins and each one loved it as well. You will not regret reading this book.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|More of a vampire story than Steampunk though the element does form the world they live in.  Full of action and sex and romance and blood sucking.  It was very entertaining in kind of the same vein (pardon the pun) as the current vampire novels and television series.  I would have liked a little more Steampunk presence; it was there but it seemed more incidental to the vampirism.  Definitely exciting characters and fast paced plot.
B003AKXCV6|5.0|Even those who don't love classic films have seen the famous shot of Rita Hayworth's first moment on camera in this movie - when she flips her head up and bounces that amazing head of hair all around her shoulders and smiles. It's the moment in &#34;Shawshank Redemption&#34; when the crowd of convicts watching their weekly movie hoot and holler. That moment isn't misleading, either. Rita Hayworth is glamorous, gorgeous, captivating and tragic as one-half of a star-crossed lovers debacle (the other half being Glenn Ford) that sinks them both into misery as they misunderstand, emotionally torture and basically screw up each others' lives. She also sings - in three different variations throughout the film - the catchy &#34;Put the Blame on Mame&#34; (well, lip-synchs), but she owns it and you won't ever forget it. I saw this film last week at the Turner Classic Movies Classic Film Festival on the big screen and it blew me away.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really liked this game. My only problem was to be asked multiple times in the game to give a review.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I love it.  He is making music for his pure enjoyment. Wonderful Dylan with such a great band of musicians. It always amazes me how my approach to life and living seems to parallel his along this strange aging process. I have grown with his music my whole life.
067144901X|5.0|I bought this book for my 16-month old son. He's a book-lover so I figured he would enjoy it, but sometimes it takes him a while to warm up to new books. He fell in love with this instantly, and I would say it's his favorite Sandra Boynton book so far. We probably read it 6 times in the first 10 minutes of giving it to him. If he's getting a little fussy in the car we start reciting this book to him and he recognizes it right away and calms down pretty easily!
0316066524|1.0|I have tried and tried to &#34;get&#34; this book.  While I certainly appreciate the immensity of this writing, it is not grabbing me at all.  I trie d to think of Catcher in the Rye,  but no comparison.  I have read where it has been labeled one of the best books ever written. I guess it is perhaps way over my head.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Cheryl Strayed is an excellent writer, but I cringed to think of how her writing might encourage other ill-prepared people to embark on such a vision quest.  The reactions of our book group ranged from disgust to admiration.  Some took from it the message of redemption and gratitude.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best that I have watched!! I love it!!! Good story and easy to follow. I intend to watch the next season.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Plot is interesting, but the story is dragging way too much and has too many going back in time stories making it difficult to follow the plot.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|The new method of searching for a suitable business model instead of writing a static business plan is gone over in detail with a very graphical and easy going feel. Following the business model canvas allows for new and existing companies to iterate on their business models and discover the maximum beneficial approach to their industries markets.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fascinating! Never having played a game of this type, I have really enjoyed the format and challenges in solving the puzzle.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|where was I when the show started<br />I have the advantage of seeing each one of the episode(s) without commercial and watch more than one episode
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Because its God's Holy Word written to man to show us where we came from and where we are going.. It teaches us the depravity of man and how we can have our sins forgiven and spend eternity in Heaven with a Righteous and Holy God
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock app is excellent!  It is easy to set and control with it's many options.  I really like the ability to upload music.  And I did, a beautiful instrumental of Wichita Lineman by Johnny G.  For those of you who remember this Glen Campbell song, this instrumental version should be heard.  So, my advice is to you is to download this app.  You will not be disappointed.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This is a very interesting book, I agree with some of it& if we all changed the way we look at things with a positive attitude we would all be happier and live in a better place.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Amazing movie about the choices we make regarding food and how it is affecting our health, economy, and the earth.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game very addictive. This is a game where you ride a jetpack through a laboratory full of scientists. So far I have unlocked 3 jetpack, my favorite is the machine gun one.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft pocket edition is just as great as the PC and Xbox 360 versions. The only problem is you can`t go to the nether and end world's like in other editions. This game is so fun, you can mine, farm, hunt, build the house of your dreams, and fight monsters. Watch out for the green monsters that have no arms, those are creepers, they will explode.
B008602KQI|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a long time.  Don't usually like this kind of movie but I didn't want to miss any of it!
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Alicia tries to remain cool, calm and collected while all madness breaks lose all around her.  Home life:  Will or Peter?  Clients:  Psycho-killer or misunderstood misogynist?  Colleagues: Backstabbers or allies?  Will: Boss or Boyfriend?  As someone who watched later episodes, its interesting to see the characters begin the dance that will become increasingly complex in future episodes.  The cases are topical with a twist, and watching Alicia find her footing as a lawyer amid the sharks is good entertainment also.  I usually prefer BBC productions, or some older detective shows (Hill Street Blues) or psychological suspense, so I can't say this is the best of the best, but its good - better than many.  Not nearly as good as Damages, though.
B000FC11A6|5.0|I love long books that have lots of information presented in a story format.  Kept me excited to turn the pages and so pleased that it was not written to a grammar school reading level.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|I have written to Amazon about the really poor quality of this download. They are looking into it. Luckily it was free (Prime) or I would have asked for my money back. Keep that in mind if you are paying.<br />The movie/story is excellent. The book is about 180 pages and an American classic.This is a really well cast movie. We read the book first and felt the movie was 95% true to it and that Redford, Waterson, Farrow, and Dern were perfectly cast. The new movie is not going to come close. It will be more showy and sexy, but not as true to the book and the times. Hollywood can't help themselves nowadays and have to do everything in extremes. Watch this one first.
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|Kids loved it. Nough said. Oh, I guess I need at least 15 words. Done to 3 now. Brings back good memories of being a kid.
B00BF123WG|3.0|a bit long and fragmented<br />feels like it needs tighter editing<br />water boarding scenes are disturbing to say the least
B00AJAFNIA|2.0|Requires perfect timing and is quite monotonous. The price was good, it being a free app of the day and all...
B00081U7HC|4.0|I just had to purchase this... as every time it is shown on TV.. my husband insists on watching it.  Now we can watch Pretty Woman without all the commercials.. and in much less time!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|A predictable plot and not the actor's bet efforts.  I would recommend it to anyone as a purely middle grade entertainment.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An outstanding ending to a terrific series.  Sanderson filled Robert Jordan's shoes with gusto and really managed to impress me.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Performances by Wahls and Foxx are very good!  Others way overplay their parts.  I found the violence to be so extreme that it soured me on the entire film.
B0064MGU98|5.0|If you are not totally enthralled with The Good Wife from the pilot episode, stick with it. It gets better and better. I would recommend this series for anyone who has ever wondered what their reaction would be to a spouse or partner who wandered off the path in a very public way. The Good Wife deals with these issues with honesty and realism. The secondary story lines, the law firm and its cases and the quest to resolve the trial and imprisonment of the wayward husband, are also very engaging. Lots of twists and turns to keep you watching. The acting is excellent. Five Stars is my vote!
B001E9641K|5.0|Just great.  We love all versions of Ticket to Ride and this one has some interesting nuances! Only meant for 3 players however.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I am a huge Judy Dench fan, and this video showed off her talents to the letter!  The exotic location was beautiful, and the plot is life-changing. It is a hilarious movie. Catherine Weiser, Anniston, AL
B009NY43NY|2.0|First off, I really have enjoyed this series.  That is until the last three books.  It feels like Harris got a great advance to make three more books, but she did not have enough material to make three quality books.<br /><br />This latest installment disappoints.  As someone else mentioned, it feels like Harris drags all the ancillary characters back in to make a cameo appearance so we all know what happens to everyone.  And once again, there are too many subplots in this book, so none feel really well written.  And now Harris has another book coming out to tie up all the loose ends or to tell us how it all works out for everyone?  Give me a break, just Harris looking for more money.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book.  I wasted my money and my time because Harris's other series have ended really well. But not this one.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of just one is because it is finally over.
B009S33I68|4.0|I actually purchase this book before I read &#34;We Were Solders&#34;. I stopped purchase &#34;We Were Soldiers&#34; This is an excellent book to help the reader complete the understanding the cost of Vietnam. I only give it 4 stars because I don't appreciate the author injecting his beliefs about the current conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. EXSPECIALLY his departing remarks at West Point upon his retirement.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife is an excellent TV series.  The characters and story lines are varied and well developed.  The shows use the court cases and personal drama to further the story lines without becoming formulaic. This has become one of my favorite shows, thank you Amazon Prime.  Can't wait for season 4!
B000J159N8|5.0|I thought the movie was good but the book is even better. The movie showed the batter at LZ X-Ray. The book continues and shows an even greater conflict at LZ Albany. You must read the book to get the fuller picture of the La Drang conflict.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|THE BOOK WAS VERY EASY TO FOLLOW.  I FOUND MYSELF ENTERING INTO THE LIVES OF BOTH MAIN CHARACTERS WHEN EVER I PICKED UP MY KINDLE.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|The more I read, the more I realized I was too old for this book... Or maybe it was just exactly like the first one. Either way, it didn't hold my attention and I finished it only because I had nothing else to read on my flight home.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Loved the addition of Patty Duke and Meredith Baxter, both of whom had major tv careers when I was younger. I remember being surprised when Ms. Baxter \\"came out\\", as she was known for her marriage with David Birney. Brava Glee!<br />Cheers and tears for Brittney's adieu.<br />Looking  forward to Finn's return.
B00138D320|5.0|This album is fabulous, obviously. Herbie Hancock is classic listening. It was on repeat twice and didn't become imposing .
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Bon Jovi does it again. Great music. Proud to be a Jersey Girl. I listen to it everyday. Hats off to the band !!!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read every one of these books--and sometimes I have mocked myself for doing so! But: Ms. Harris gives us consistently witty dialogue and pretty entertaining characters, so all in all I would say I have liked the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I am somewhat surprised that so many readers are hating this book.  This is meant to wrap up a series, and although it is somewhat perfunctory in some respects (I would like to have seen Bill get some emotional connection somewhere!) and almost weirdly comprehensive (did we care about Copley Carmichael?) in others, it overall gets the job done.  I will say, along with some other reviewers, that it was utterly predictable that Eric and Sookie would split, and I don't think this aspect of the book is rushed--it's been coming down the road for at least the last 3 books.  (That maybe is why I gave it 3 stars, I didn't suffer any big disappointments.) It's no accident that she refers to Sam as heat and light and that Sookie had been sunbathing; it is clearly meant to be Sookie's choice to live a human life in the sunshine.  (The only alternative would have been for Sookie to turn Eric back into a human in the last book, but too late now.)<br />And for folks complaining about Ms. Harris missing or glossing over some details, I will say she has made a habit of that over the years and that is a fault you can lay at the feet of her editors.  At least in this book she doesn't get the eye color of the hero completely wrong (Last Scene Alive, Aurora Teagarden series) or go completely  over the top in sex and violence and improbable plots (Ice Cold Grave and Grave Secret).  By comparison, Dead Ever After is just fine.  And so, 3 stars.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I love the extra sound bits in the soundtrack, it really adds another dimension to the music. I can't wait to see the movie and see the songs in action!
B009NY43NY|4.0|These books have a pretty consistent structure: Something deadly or mysterious happens in the beginning and we spend the rest of the book figuring it out. Except for the Fae war and the hotel bombing, that's the pattern. I think this book fits into that mold well and I think the writing is tighter than the last few. I enjoyed seeing so many of Sookie's friends rally to her side. It was nice to see them again. I think the ground work for the ending was laid in the first book. It shouldn't have been a surprise. This series is about Sookie, not Bill and Sookie or Eric and Sookie.<br /><br />She ended this two year period of her life with many more friends, a regular income, a house and land, is a business partner, and has the potential of a solid relationship. That's pretty good for a 28 year old waitress.<br /><br />I've enjoyed my journey with Sookie. I hope she lives happily ever after!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really have enjoyed getting started with this show.  The first season was great getting to know the characters and the various relationships  between them.  ...on to season 2!
B00BF11STU|4.0|This was one of those films that seemed to go on forever. Not being an expert in military intelligence, I found some of it hard to follow. But the last act of the movie was fantastic, and when I read the plot summarized on Wikipedia after I finished the film, my enjoyment was enhanced retroactively. It made for some really great conversation afterward. Recommend.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I was charged 6.99 and it wouldn't even download on to my android tablet... would not recommend... and I also never got any replies to my email about a refund either... I will never buy a game again...
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Amy Adams was the standout in this film for me. Any time she was on-screen, I was instantly more captivated by the film. However, I was pretty engrossed throughout the whole thing, much like I was with the director's There Will Be Blood. The next day though, I found myself unable to remember much about why I liked it outside of Amy Adams.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm so happy for Sookie. If you're a fan you have to read this book. It nay or may not be your favorite in the series but it is the happy ending sookie deserves.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence's ass gave the best performance of the year. It was very funny but also dark. I was very impressed with how well it walked on that thin line. I liked Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, Les Miz, Django, et al., but this was the top of the heap for me.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The premise of the book is to prove to yourself that your thoughts influence your physical reality. I now know beyond doubt that they do, and i haven't completed all the experiments yet. The one thing that we all need to do to really experience these miracles is suspend disbelief, to not question but accept that it could just be true, and the results are amazing. Totally  recommend this book
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great book. Hard to get through in the middle. Hard to keep track of all the characters. Ending was good though!
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Gotta love these flicks.  Lots of action and fun.  Great for a home movie night with friends or family.  Love them!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|These is one of the best animated movies to come out in a while. It was a treat for the whole family.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Gotta love these flicks.  Lots of action and fun.  Great for a home movie night with friends or family.  Love them!
B008Y79HE6|3.0|Easy viewing as content was exciting and entertaining. It was a good flick for a quite Friday evening.<br />As a Prime movie offering the price was right.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A movie for all ages...It's a movie in its own category. It demands you're attention...You'll definitely enjoy it. Two thumbs up!!
B009R659L8|5.0|this book kept me interested the whole time I was reading it.  I reccomend the book to people that like mysteries.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I had feared this would be a long sketch comedy book - or worse one of those books by comedians where they write out their standup routine, which on paper (and without benefit of timing, delivery, nuance) comes across as dry as a stock report. BUT - she manages to give enough history, autobiography and soul to make it a good read while keeping her humor honed and ready. It is both a book where we learn about her and her family without it diverging into crazy &#34;tell all&#34;.<br /><br />In short - a good funny read with a touch of a soul.
1451695187|5.0|Great book. I loved it. This is not a substitute for proofs found in God's word and His communication to us in daily life, but it was a good read.I found Dr.Alexander's account credible, especially since he says that he was a former skeptic, regarding consciousness outside of brain function as not real or scientific.He seems to have experienced just the opposite. It reminded me of the Apostle Paul's dramatic turnaround when encountering God on the road to Damascus.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My daughter is crazy about the entire temple run series.  She constantly checks to see if there are new games.  This is one of our two favorites.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book on habits is fascinating. I'm really enjoying the stories of other people he pulls in. Lots of information that I didn't know. It's a great book and I'm really enjoying it. If you are looking to create change, this will help you to understand the &#34;how&#34;.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing and I have no idea why it is even being considered to be taken off air. The writing, dialogue, and look of the show is gorgeous. The only downside is that on occasion characters seem to mumble. If you can look past that though you're in for a real treat.
159562015X|5.0|Learning about my strengths, and how to reframe what I thought of as &#34;weakness&#34;. Lots to learn. If you are interested in self-development. Then this is one the books that could be very meaningful for you. Enjoy.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|I liked it alot.  Lots of action and very fast past.  Mark Wahlberg did a great  job in his role.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great<br />love the interaction. kids love it. why a set number of words for a review? that's the reason I don't normally leave reviews
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie hit close to home for me because I have both a father and brother with bi-polar but the film director did it very tastefully and I hope it brings understanding to others about the type of disease that bi-polar is and how it doesn't just affect the person going though it but it also affects and scars the family members.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I really do love this app. I will always know what phase the moon is in which is important to me.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Missed the very beginning - great way to catch up and put the last few seasons in perspective!  Great watching uninterrupted as well.
B0067DBHBU|5.0|Chris and company continue to deliver stand up rock and roll that's easy to listen to and well crafted. It's refreshing to listen to songs about real life, not just rock-and-roll life. Although I haven't seen them live, I get the impression that they all must smile alot when they play music. This enjoyment of the craft comes through when I listen!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great perspectives, couldn't put this book down...lots unexpected twists.<br />....would enjoy to see how they turned out. Ending left it open for a sequel.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I've read it twice now and still love it! I've been with the series since the first book was released, and this was a wonderful ending that gave Sookie a future full of life.
B002Q7JYPC|2.0|Everything I wanted from this album is found in The Very Best of the Eagles two-CD pack.  Either this one or the On the Border CD -- cannot remember which -- came opened so I returned them.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book was very boring and I am so mad about the ending!!!! Wanted her to be with my favorite, didn't happen!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Everything about this book was perfect! It kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time! Fantastic work indeed!
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I am finding this to be a thoughtful reflection of an interesting life as seen from the artist's perspective.  This is more than a rock star's memoir - the author spends a fair amount of time considering how his personal experiences from childhood on have influenced every element of his life.  It was interesting to learn how much of his professional life has been spent in areas other than the music industry and how his view of himself as an artist (and not only a musician and sound engineer) is so integral to his actions and decisions.  The interesting tidbits on rock star royalty throughout the book also keep it juicy.  The book should be of interest to fans of Pete's music but even someone who never heard of The Who might find this an interesting dissection of how growing up in post-WWII England shaped an entire generation and how money & fame does not guarantee happiness.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I found this Angry Birds game to be very boring compared to the others....wasn't very pleased with it. Was too basic...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found &#34;No Easy Day&#34; to be an interesting account of an operation, but more so an insight into the life and motivations of a Navy Seal.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|The Uno game didn't play like regular Uno...Was confusing to me. I don't know what I expected but guess I thought it would be more like regular Uno
193700788X|1.0|I was hopeful that after the slow and painful destruction of the intricate and exciting super/Sookie world that was created in the first half of the series, this last book would finally, FINALLY bring at least some satisfactory closure. I didn't even really care who Sookie wound up with, I just wanted it to make SENSE based on this character that Mrs. Harris herself created.<br /><br />Sadly, I was disappointed on all fronts, and I have to say that now I can never wholeheartedly recommend this series to anyone. It has officially fell from the #1 spot on my list. Because good series usually give you this kind of ending:<br /><br />1)The last book is full of good-byes, funny (and sometimes tear-inducing) moments from most of the characters you've come to know throughout the series.<br /><br />2) There is a grand battle/finale/climax moment that brings together the characters in an epic moment that results in a \\"bang\\" of a good book.<br /><br />3)Good series are difficult to end because there is really no ending that will satisfy anyone...BUT, even if you are disappointed, you do come away wanting more.<br /><br />4) And sometimes, after further reflection, sometimes you figure out it really was the best ending for that character's personality or experiences. You think back to how the main character has grown over the course of the series and you realize they have finally \\"grown up.\\"<br /><br />5) You would gladly pick up the series and read it over and over again.<br /><br />This book? Does NONE of the above.<br /><br />1) Yes, we saw a nice revolving door of characters, but no real development for any of them. It's like passing a cardboard cutout across stage, letting the fans cheer on, having someone speak 1-2 lines behind the cut out, and then it's gone forever. Pam, Quinn, Alcide, Bill, Eric...all minor peeps in this book. She could've left them out completely and simply made their current fates a telephone call or email. It would've left more room for an decent plot. Main characters are reduced to small sideshows in this book. A NEW character got more book time than many of the main characters. This should NEVER happen in the last book.<br /><br />2) Oy, the plot. I do like Mr. C and the New Orleans contingent being a part of this last book. I do like Barry Bellboy coming back. But you still don't see much of them except on trips to barbeque places or Wal-mart. I got aggravated that important revelations kept being delayed for pages and pages of this drivel. Readers of fantasy/mystery novels do not want to hear about meals being cooked or trips to Wal-mart. If I wanted that kind of reality, I'd watch the Food Network or Teen Mom. I read these books because these characters are supposed to be extra-ordinary!<br /><br />Claude being the big villian was just ridiculous. I was grateful the fae portion of this series finally ended in the last book and now this? Isn't this series called the Southern VAMPRIRE mysteries? I enjoy learning about the other supes, but by the end, there was almost nothing in this series that involved vampires other than Twilight-ish angst on Sookie's part about Eric.<br /><br />No grand battle or climax. Just Sookie. Getting kidnapped. As usual. With some crazy human hillbillies to the rescue instead of vampires. Just to further hit home the idea that vampires are no longer welcome on Sookie's new reality TV show.<br /><br />3) I honestly wish this had ended with Sookie finally becoming her own woman and just telling all the men currently in her life to shove it. Sam is that guy...you know, the guy next door who says he's your best friend and hangs around for years just hoping you'll get through sowing your oats and instead settle down with him? Now, there's nothing wrong with that. But for the tough, snarky, take life by the balls Sookie we have come to know and love? Nope. It doesn't make SENSE. It's a choice that should never have been made in such a series, especially with no real build-up to it other than Sookie is a shell of herself in the last few books of this series who doesn't want adventures or mystery anymore. She just wants babies and her life at the bar. Which is why I don't want any more of Sookie. I'm as done with Sookie as Mrs. Harris is.<br /><br />4) On the contrary, I got angrier the more I thought about the ending. Did Sookie even do ANY real telepathy in this last book? Did she do anything that was in character? Did Eric or Bill? Even Sam was a zombie for most of the book, which seemed like an awful easy way to keep him in the story without any real character development or relationship building. Sookie's character didn't grow. She hid from what made her unique, bottled her feelings, and settled for what she \\"thought\\" was right for her based on everyone else's expectations.<br /><br />5) I will read this series through at least the first 7 or 8 books. Then I will pretend Sookie died in some spectacular fashion along with my other favorite characters and that's why I never found out what happened to her. Like her, I'm going to bury my head in the sand and refuse to accept reality.<br /><br />This reaction from the fans of this series is no one's fault but Mrs. Harris. She created the characters and developed them and the books from the get-go. Just because she ended up hating the characters doesn't mean she had to make us do so as well.
B001MSMULG|4.0|These books are well written, with excitement and a little sense of humor.  The characters are smart but not always right.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|One of my favorite Disney films this is definitely a DVD for any collector. Great quality and wonderful special features. &#60;3
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game starts out slow and seems to not want to load sometimes. But a very fun and addictive game.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|There was so much possibility going into the end of this series, but I felt completely let down and disappointed with this conclusion. &#34;Mockingjay&#34; felt rushed and thrown together compared to the first two books in the series. Some of the details and events Ms. Collins came up with were very creative, but others were just bizarre. I liked the series, and I would recommend it to others, but not without some heavy caveats regarding &#34;Mockingjay&#34;.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I had already watched the series on MTV so I knew what to expect, but I loved the series and I love the movie.  I think its sad that people can play with others emotions like these people do.  As if the world isn't rough enough, people have to lie about who they are and what they look like do get others to fall in love with them.  I cant wait till season 2 starts on MTV (if there is one).
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I loved it, it was dark and scary my kids were jumping out of there pjs. I was extremely satisfied
B0000C9JCM|5.0|Canon in D is my favorite song!  This CD is my favorite because is plays different  ways Musicians play the song.<br />I can listen to this song for hours.  I wanted one that only plays this song.<br />My husband and I were lucky when we got married in 2007 this song was the popular Wedding Song!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this season and can't wait until the new season starts in January on PBS. Great Historical Piece.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It combines a good story with info about the area and its history. Looking forward to the next book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great series. I have visited Newport Rhode Island Mansions of the Vanderbuilts and it reminded me of that. Very Cool!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|As a kid this movie was a heart felt movie  it teaches us about life  more shows should be this.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This was a great movie!I am a psychiatric nurse and the portrayal of bipolar disease was exceptional. The one thing that I enjoyed about the movie was how the writer brought out the vision that mental illness is all around us. No one is exempt from it, it is not contained in hospitals, clinics or group homes. Like any other illness it can be a livable condition. As you watch the movie please pay attention to the details, that they are human beings first and illness is just something they have.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love, love, love this series. Amazingly epic. Every episode is so well done. The grandeur is equal to a large scale academy award winning movie. The acting, scenes, and writing are phenomenal!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I had been looking for a lapel mic to use for YouTube videos and this little thing has been working great. Simple, easy to use, and sounds good to my ears.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />There's a video made using the mic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing. I love the daily challenges. There unique from other running apps. Also the graphics are great. I totally recommend this app to anybody it's simple so anybody could play it. Another thing that makes it to fantastic to pass up is that it's FREE.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Read it on the Kindle. Would love a fourth to tell us what the world remains after the third.
B0041KVX1K|5.0|The item arrived quick like media mail.  It was shrink wrapped and brand new.  It's the 2009 remaster, but made in 2012.  The sound quality was great, nothing much can be said since it was brand new; for such a low price it was a clear buy.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|although the writing style has changed it was a good completion to the series.  It also gave me a new author to read ( Brandon Sanderson)
6301973461|5.0|Item arrived quick. The VHS sleeve looks great, it's in pristine condition.  The Hi-Fi VHS played great on my fairly low-grade VCR.  A great buy, low price also.
0385360169|5.0|I wanted to read (listen to since i bought CD version) to see what everyone is talking about in reference to Fifty Shades trilogy.  I really enjoyed this book, can't wait to start books two and three.
B0026EWZMY|5.0|The album is in great shape, it looks and sounds excellent. Absolutely no ringing on the cover. The inner sleeve is in good condition. There's a large tear on the lp sleeve, but that's inevitable. Overall a great buy, low price just makes it even better.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I gave this four stars because I found the book gripping from the beginning. The secret was a shock, and the outcome was also a shock! The author managed to soften the shocks with her easy patter.
B000IZQ9CK|5.0|Came with plastic paper covering the album.  There's some ringing going on throughout the cover, but the LP plays beautifully. Only a few pops on one track, the gatefold looks great, picture of the band in black and white.  Inner sleeve is in nice condition as well.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I love this app! It allows you to control the important functions to control your smartphone usage. It let's you release your cache, ram and control all your installed apps. A must have!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very enjoyable, great graphics.  The game played well on my Kindle Fire.  I liked the combination of hidden objects and the solving aspects ... I never was bored.
0061950726|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. I am an avid reader of historical fiction and this book was everything I hope for in such a book. The weaving together of the lives of Molly and Vivian, and the symmetry of their lives is striking, and makes me ashamed that we haven't come much further than the orphan trains in caring for our abandoned youth.I applaud Kline in her revelations of this time period and past years and how her writing made me truly feel and become part of the character lives- Jessica Tornese-author of Linked Through Time
B009CF6IDM|5.0|Lots of fun to watch never gets boring some thing cool always happening awesome guns and weapons used in movie
B000T46O52|5.0|Great movie could watch it again &again<br />. Highly recommend.  Both Denzel Washington & Tom Hanks were superb<br />Everything about this movie was fantastic!
B009CG9LIU|5.0|So much better than previous hulk movie better story line and sets up the avengers movie story line. Fun to watch
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Easy download and operation seems to work great! It is great to be able to download my music to my phone as well.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Awesome scenes great story line would recommend to anyone that loves action movies must see before u watch any of the other iron man movies
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Fast pace and imaginative. Introducing a thought provoking issue that faces the people of the world and is unafraid to look at both sides of the issue.
B009R659L8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  She has a knack of drawing her characters togeher so that the story line merges.  I have read all of her books and enjoyed most of them.  This one kept my interest right to the end and I stayed with it until I reached the end.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Not necessarily the most original film, but tons of original ideas within. Well executed and superbly funny. Probably better if you can appreciate a bit of crude humor.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I always enjoy Kathy Reich's books.  You do have to be patient while she explains some of the technical details of bones, etc but I find it extremely fascinating.  I love the way she weaves the story line through the lab stuff.  I find I do best with her books if I just go slow and easy.  Still ti was only two days to get to the end.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Started a bit slow but, brought me back into the story very well. It had been a year since I had finished the previouse book. It was very hard to put down once everything converged.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|My understanding of the debates concerning America's entry into WWII could be summarized as &#34;a majority of Americans did not want to enter the war prior to Pearl Harbor.&#34; The author goes way beyond that simple statement we learned in school and explains  clearly the positions of the isolationists and interventionists . FDR, Lindbergh, and Wilkie are featured prominently along with a cast of lesser characters. I was surprised to learn of the British government's massive efforts to influence US policy. Germany too, injected herself into the debate. All in all an eye-opening read.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Had to see this movies that god such good reviews  It was good but not as good as expected Still worth watching.
B0086449YA|5.0|He's popular in his home country, Canada. Very upbeat for listening or background. He has somewhat of a troubadour-folksinger  style. I was using it as background when friends came over - they started listening. A good indication when opera-types immediately enjoy a different music. Very upbeat music. Fun lyrics.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The funniest and best animated film ever.  Flawless plot, well directed and edited.  MUST be seen with Blu Ray.  The detail is astonishing.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I like this book. It has been fun to read from the dogs point of view. You will have to give it a try.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It was ok entertainment. It was worth the money I spent on it. I am sure the book will do well
B00005N6KG|5.0|I must have a weird left ear as I am unable to keep any earbuds in!  I keep pushing them in until my ear hurts!  I had been wearing headphones but they make me too hot in the warm weather.  These are the perfect solution!  They are lightweight, comfortable and stay in my ears with no problem.  The sound is great.  I recommend them.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I really enjoyed this hidden object game. Not too hard or too easy. I would definitely recommend it. Give it a try!
193700788X|5.0|An excellent book finishing up an excellent series.  I have enjoyed all of the previous Sookie Stackhouse books, and this one is no exception.  The town and people are so real and seem so alive, that it's like actually taking a mini-vacation into their world.  I am really sorry to see this series end. It's hard to say good bye to all the old friends I've found within the pages of the Southern Vampire books, but like the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.  Charlaine Harris managed to bow out gracefully (on this series) at just the right time: leaving all her fans wanting more but before she had to start reusing the same plots from previous books,  The murder got solved, some of Sookie's major enemies were disposed of finally and Sookie has a new leash on life.  Happily ever after?  Well, maybe.  One can only hope :)
B00571F26Y|3.0|Davis provides a compelling argument about the current state of wheat and its dangers. However,at one point in the book, this premise seems to simply provide another way into the usual low/no carb approach originally espoused by Atkins.  Good if you are new to the low carb dietary genre.
B008D563IC|3.0|Even if you buy the Unrated version, it is not what you will think.  I was expecting a bit more of the T&A, like the past series held.  This was an Okay movie for a reunion type, but not up to the standards of the original.<br /><br />Not really worth the $9.99.  I would suggest saving the dollars and waiting for the price to drop or seeing in a friend can loan it to you.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|If the words hadn't come out of a teddy bear, it would have been even more stupid. Mark Wahlberg was boring.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Did not like this book at all! The story was very convoluted and the ending was not satisfactory at all. I hated the way the Eric/Sookie situation was resolved. This book kind of reminded me of those tv specials where they bring the reality show contestants back for an hour of arguing and nothing is nicely resolved.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Very good story and very well directed, but unneccessary bloodshed and graphic violence. Jamie Foxx and the German actor were awesome!
B00932A4XE|3.0|My wife thoroughly enjoyed this cure little movie.  It was more than a man could take...did some projects around the house.
B00BS4RGFE|4.0|Like the album, but downloads weren't smooth so there are gaps in a lot of the songs. Waste of money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never gave much thought to PBS but after the Emmys this year I thought I'd check out Downton Abbey. Watched season one on Hulu and was hooked. After that it was a Downton Abbey marathon until I caught up and now can't wait until season four!
B00BGZ8TVA|2.0|I'd heard good things about Pi and wanted to like it. However I found its philosophy to be puerile at best. I am not religious, however my understanding is that each religion believes in One True God... therefore the cherry-picking approach espoused by adult Pi would really offend believers of all faiths.<br /><br />The awkward flashback structure (wherein adult Pi explains his childhood obsession with religion to his house guest) fails to drive the story forward. It just meanders until the ship sinking.<br /><br />Finally the plot gets Pi in the boat with the animals, which leads to some gorgeous but empty CGI sequences at sea. There is nothing here in the &#34;man vs. nature&#34; portion that Melville, Hemingway, Heyerdahl or even the Noah legend already said better. Frankly, I turned Pi off after the god storm sequence and read a book. This crunchy New Age magical mystery tour was putting me to sleep.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|dungeon hunter 4 is a good game but it could be better they at least need to have it where you do the campaign together with friends and family.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Nolan's take on Batman is about 90% close enough to what I imagine it should be. The first two in the trilogy are so carefully scripted (with realistic motivations -- for genre pieces, that is -- foreshadowing & payoff, etc.) that my expectations were elevated for a capper that would rock my world. Unfortunately DKR is ridden with ridiculous plot holes.<br /><br />ex. The ENTIRE Gotham city police force trapped underground??? REALLY??? And months later they're released (looking well-fed & freshly showered) just to engage in a clubs vs. machine gun showdown with the bad guys? In which the result is NOT an instantaneous, bloody massacre? Or that Bane breaks Batman's spine, ships him halfway across the world to a prison pit (WHY???) where he's given enough time to &#34;recover&#34; (as if THAT could ever happen) and then break out of the escape-proof pit, just to return to Gotham (How'd he get back, BTW?) and fly an atomic bomb into the harbor -- where he'd most certainly be vaporized -- and the seaboard would be flooded with deadly fallout for decades? But he survives this and ends up on a European vacation where Alfred spots Wayne at the very same cafe he's been frequenting all these years?<br /><br />The only reason I thought the film was &#34;OK&#34; instead of &#34;insultingly terrible&#34; is that the action sequences and cinematography are technically superb. If I ever watch the film again it will be for those, and the fetching but vastly underused Catwoman.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was an awe inspiring book. No one ever knows what another person has been through in their life and this story co uld be a true account of two very lonely but lucky people.  This a a book I would read again. Thank you for the insight and the history you have included<br />  Sincerely. A Partical Irish Reader
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I would recommend this to any one who likes these kind of games.<br />thanks for have the apps for my kindle
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have been playing this game for months and continue to enjoy this version.  Great customization as you want it.  Don't pass this one up if you love solitare.
B00CJ32S74|2.0|i expected a lot from this STAR-STUBBED album and when the lead single released i thought the album is going to be a masterpiece. but this album is awful.<br />the only good songs in this album are from Lana Del Rey, Florence + the Machine, Sia, Gotye and The xx. and the cover of Back to Black; it was super super awful. Beyonce and Andre 3000 just ruined that awesome song!!!
B0097K21YW|1.0|BUYER BEWARE: I checked this app with &quot;Ad Detector,&quot; and it was found to contain at least one plug-in that leaks identity information.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a little amused to read the reviews of those who thought this would end any other way. This is fantasy true but frankly living as a vampire didn't seem appealing. And Sam was always a possibility and the most likely in the end. Afterall, who wants to marry a dead guy, really?<br /><br />Remember these are light reading for fun. However Ms Harris wished to end these books if fine with me because I enjoyed them very much. And I thank her for writing them.
0385349831|5.0|This book is not a book to be read.  It is to be reflected upon, absorbed and digested as food for the soul.<br /> I find myself reading the same chapter more than once, speaking of it and recommending it to my family and friends.<br />How wonderful if Manuscript Found in Accra were required reading in school, especially to a class of maturing teen-agers, in the hope that it would influence their future actions.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Engrossing series that examines both survival and human morality.  Interesting character development.  I need to read the graphic novels now!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|lots of fun to tune into when you have an hour to relax and enjoy yourself.  Easy to pick up where you left off.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I am giving this 4 stars because I laughed a lot throughout and Kinsella delivered with her endearing female characters and brooding love interests. Nevertheless, it was my least favorite Kinsella novel and I was disappointed because she's my chick lit author crush. For one thing, I thought the book was way too long. Certain parts just seemed to drag on forever. Additionally, the plot fell flat for me. Despite the chuckles I released, there was too much emphasis on keeping two people from having sex, in my opinion. I rolled my eyes each time I read how Lottie was \\"gagging\\" for it. I get it, she was horny. Ben was horny. Fliss was horny. Got it. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the Fliss and Lorcan storyline. I thought there was a lot of character development for those two. Noah was adorable.<br /><br />In sum, a very funny read but a little lacking in depth even relative to Kinsella's other very light reads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever im hooked on it i play it at least six to ten times a day .......
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds rarely disappoints. I was worried about this season because I knew I would really miss Emily! Although Blake hasn't yet established herself as a deep character that I know and enjoy, her presence has not put me off like I expected of Emily's replacement. I have enjoyed the focus on Spencer and seeing the wounded, personal side of him. I recommend season 8 to anyone who enjoys this genre!!!
B000NY12LO|4.0|Excellent story telling but really a little too close to things which have happened right now.  It almost read like a newspaper report and although I read it with respect for the many victims of school massacres, I thought the subject matter would upset many many of the victims and families of recent school killings.  If I had been the parent of one of the unfortunate people killed in these massacres I would just hate a 'NOVEL' about it.  I think Jodi Picoult should have a little more sensitivity to these families.<br /><br />I would say that the book was well written, heartbreaking, and a very thought provoking but I think it is a little soon for novels about these subjects.  However, keep writing Jodie as all in all I really like your work.
0670021652|4.0|love her writing and I found this book to offer perspectives that helped me understand how infidelity can worm its way in unsuspectingly.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|The book was entertaining (if that is the right word) but a little unbelievable. The characters were dull, boring and you wondered why anyone thought the boy was innocent and why anyone could even empathize with the girl.  It is pretty unbelievable.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I downloaded this book because I wanted to know more about Tesla, but in the end I found myself inspired to create. As a crafty type, I find what was said about  imagination to be spot on. Like Tesla, you should always aspire for that next \\"a ha!\\" moment or idea. The seeds of those ideas are planted in books like these so read it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoy the storyline and I am hooked.  Great acting and I love the accents and costumes.  Worth the cost of buying the season.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|serious film with humor.  you're routing for the characters all the way.  Bradley cooper does an excellent portrayal of someone trying to deal with bipolar disease and working through his life.  Robert deniro was also excellent, very touching in his portrayal of the father with problems of his own.  Lawrence is good in all that she has done so far.  the writing was excellent.  a movie you will remember and see again
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The ebay app is easy to use. It helped me list my items quickly and keeps track of the progress. Thank you android. this is going to be a simple task with the ebay app.
0345529057|5.0|Hey,<br />Just got the package at the mail :)<br />I was suprised by the great case the books came in.<br />I oredered it to israel on the 4.5 and got it yesterday in mail office (10.5).<br /><br />Hope I'm going to enjoy it :)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Gal.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I don't mind the reminder pop up but they purposely switched the button layout to make you accidentally click the &#34;Read&#34; button instead of &#34;Not now&#34;
B005HSL626|4.0|my son wanted this app, but I was cautious. Wanted me Kindle for books more than games. Well now I'm addicted to this one too... lol
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  Considering &#34;zombies&#34; and the &#34;living dead&#34; are such a huge genre right now, this author gave really good insight on life after zombie invasions, without making it seem like every other zombie related story/show currently out there.  What made the book even most interesting is that the author explores the government/public reaction to such, which could apply to any type of devastation against humanity and how people react to it.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Lots of information about your Wi-Fi connection, and all the interference around you. The first thing I did was switch channels on the router to a higher rated one. The difference was instantly noticeable. That alone makes the app worthwhile. I use it every time things seem to slow down, it's that easy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|grandson loves game had to download the first one also for him  the  pitcures clear on the kindle hd a
B009AMANBA|5.0|Mix of history and drama works for me. But I need to brush up on Lincoln's cabinet and congressional members of that era.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a good show and I hope there will be many season's. It is stupid that I have to have a minimum number of words for a review. I would like to only have to use the stars.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Use the smaller puzzles as training for the harder puzzles. Sometimes the voyage to connect the dots just pop into your brain and sometimes it is just trial after trial until it falls into place.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A real movie about real families living with mental illness.  It is crazy and sweet.  It proves my premise that their is a lid for every pot.
B0041WVTBM|4.0|All I could remember about this film was the funeral and the music. (Spoiler...Not! &#60;you're welcome&#62;). I remember that it made me think at the time, and want to see it again somewhere down the line. So my take is that it is well worth running regardless what age or generation you are, although it probably speaks loudest to Boomers. Just a great little indie.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I have seen better Denzel movies. The story line was interested but not what I found particularly entertaining. It was ok.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Wish this wasn't the end. I'll 're-read the series, but it's not like reading a new Sookie story. Thank you, Charlaine, for a wonderful time!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a very entertaining story and worth the time to watch. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy a story.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|If you are looking for a mobile Facebook that looks like you expect Facebook to look...this is it.  It works pretty good but if you want to message get a messenger app because this app doesn't update messages as they come in like the pc version.  Works great on my kindle too.
B001NHNG64|4.0|First time I read this author and it really kept your attention. It was good enough that I downloaded his 2nd book which was great also.
B001XV09UG|3.0|I first saw this when it first launched many years ago. I went to see it because of the director. However, I walked out of the theater thinking how bad the movie was and how much money I wasted going to see it. After viewing it again (on a whim) my impression has slightly improved (I would have given it 1 star originally), its an ok movie but not really very engaging or interesting.
B0036UMM84|5.0|One of Barbaras best films , great music and great songs by both her and kris kristofferson. Gives u that real 70s feel and sound.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Every IT person should own one!! I read this book twice already, and also recommended it to several people at my company. I had already read &#34;The Goal&#34;, so many of the concepts being discussed in here made sense to me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved Les Miserables as a novel.  It was the only opera I have ever paid to see.  I recently watched the movie 5 times in theaters.  And I've watched the DVD 8 times in the 2 weeks that I've had it.  The bishop is all that bishops, priests and lay people should be and the bishop's compassion healed and inspired Jean Val Jean to heal and serve others.  Watching the DVD makes me wish I could be as holy as the bishop and Jean Val Jean.  Most telling is Jean Val Jean's compassion for Inspector Javert who cannot see past the letter to the spirit of the law.  I am uncomfortable with the raw sexuality and corruption of the innkeeper, his wife and guests depicted but this is part of the reality of evil we must all contend with.  Though inspirational, I find Jean Val Jean's priest-like celibacy somewhat unrealistic and unlikely.  Overall, I consider Les Miserables the perfect story and opera.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Still going strong after 8 seasons- not sure I like &#34;wimpy&#34; Sam but overall the storyline is still engaging and Castiel and Crowley still keep turning up.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|This is a must read for any doctor who wants to better understand how likely it is to be manipulated by studies sponsored by pharma companies
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I recommend this book to any woman and any man of any age.  It would make a great Mother's Day gift as well!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|It's a beautifully done rendition of a truly classic story.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were brilliant in their roles.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Great songs favorite are say goodbye and happy pills.<br />Norah jones at her best<br />Loved the album you can definitely hear the dead mouse influence.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|A compelling read that combines history with the well known story of Charles Lindberg. The book does a good job of placing the reader during the pre-world war II period. Well done.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Noah Wyle has got his groove back along with some very good actors (old and new) that do a pretty good job of holding their own and not over acting (which tends to happen with these &#34;other cable&#34; series.  You can see the writing coming together with the acting at the right time (thanks to a guy named Steven Spielberg, I'll bet!).  Each episode gives you insight into a character (or two) and leaves just enough suspense to sell the action to make me a return buyer.  Excellent series!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't get it but the kids seem to love this game and play all the time.  Involves constructing a reality within the game and I like that it engages their minds a little bit.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Meh. Liked the other Bourne movies much better. Did I mention it seemed really long? In short, not worth the time.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was an enjoyable read, the main character was well developed and likeable.  It was light and fun, and the mystery was enough to keep you intrigued throughout.  Definitely going back for the second one.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I have already missed his portrayal in season two.<br /><br />I was bitten by the awfulness that was Torchwood (2006-2011) and the even worse Children of Earth (2009).<br /><br />However, a friend suggested I watch the new Doctor (2005+) and am glad I did. Sure, there is a certain element of awkward props and some of the acting is suspect. Some of the stories don't start out solidly, but by the end the genius is revealed. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It usually takes me a while to read a book ... What can I say I'm a slow reader.  I read this book in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  I started it at work one day and I only stopped reading it because I had to.  The next day I started it when I got home from work and I didn't stop reading it until I was done.  I couldn't stop ... I had to know what was going to happen next.  I don't usually rate books but this one ... I had to. I reccommend this book.  It was the first time I read one of Colleen Hoover books and I am looking for the next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great story line, but maybe a little too much sex.  There really isn't much substance, but if you enjoy reading about sex, this might be the book for you.
B004GGQMTW|5.0|Sorry I had to return blu-ray due to a mistake made during the order. I indicated I wanted blu-ray; however, I do not have blu-ray capability on my computer. Amazon was great in returning it and I was able to order the correct film Thank you Amazon!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is one of my favorit games and I spend a lot of time on this one.  I love games that challenge.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|Great film for those who can't wait to hear the band play at parades, sporting games, or concerts. Nick Cannon is fabulous.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I am just getting into this game.  I haven't explored it that much but what I have played I like.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Clever scripts. Wonderful take on the old Sherlock. Miller does a superb job. Fresh.  Modern. I love watching it.  I like the interplay between Holmes and Watson.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's OK and fun.  I think the numbers are called a little fast, but that's just me.  Over all I like it
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Although I haven't yet listen to this particular cd I did listen to the preview of the songs prior to making the purchase. I have other Buble cd's  and I love them all. I especially enjoy listening to his cd's while driving in the car and on long road trips. His voice has a rich pleasant quality that makes you want to sing along.
B009R659L8|5.0|MHC does it again. Book grabs and holds you from page one to the very end. PS: love picking up the Kindle in the middle of the night and not having to turn on the light to read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Very informative about what is happening in N Korea right now.  Would recommend this book to all concerned about events going on in the world today.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is a little hard to read at times because of the Irish dialect. But an overall good read....you will want to read this to the end.
193700788X|1.0|Listen. This series has tons of fans who are furious - at least one of those fans has to be able to write a better ending to this series. So..... will someone please re-write the ending? Heck, you can even change names and just borrow the plot starting when the pointless fairies came into the series and then let people know its real purpose in some underground rumor type of way. There has got to be a better way to end this! Use Smashwords even, just would someone please fix this?!?!?
B007QDNKQA|4.0|The movie was fun to watch.  The premise is a bit far-fetched (I hope) but still a fun movie.  Thumbs up in general.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great read - As always MHC stories have you wanting to get to the next chapter and almost sad when it ends
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Great just wish it would save progress from one device to another.
B00985E3UG|5.0|You will be better informed and angry when your done, but hopefully able to make better food choices as a result.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|i found this book a bit weak on the story line even though it has a follow on from previous books in the series.it tends to jump around from chapter to chapter to chapter.i enjoyed his earlier books much more as they had a much crisper storyline
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I liked it, was short and to the point. Easy read, some good tips and tricks. Downloaded it on my smartphone so i always have it on hand.
B001V7YJMG|4.0|This was pretty good . The setting and vampire characters were very good at setting up the ending . The actors were very good  at protraying  the young searching for idenity  and dealing with social pressures .
B005PK57IK|5.0|Can't realistically spend money on fourth season so it's kinda killing me but I will wait till it goes prime I am sure it'll be worth the wait. I love all characters Can't decide who I want Alicia with Will or Peter.
B009NY43NY|5.0|SPOILERS!!<br /><br />First of all, I hope all the \\"fans\\" whining about the end of Charlaines book took time to read the inscription in the beginning of the book as well as the acknowledgements.  If you did not, you should.  If you did, and you still rip this woman to shreads then you should be ashamed of yourselves.<br />The fact that people are crying, whining, and insulting Ms. Harris's ability as a writer because they didn't like the ending is just absurd.  This is HER story, get over yourselves.<br />Several series that I read have ended recently, and I found this to be the most satisfying of them all.  She spins a thorough tale involving people from throughout the series, some that we may have forgotten about even.  I love that she took the time to see everyone happy (or dead :-) ) but keeps her secrets until the very end as only she can.  This lady can write a mystery, and the Prologue gave me chills.<br />Don't judge her too harshly based on which team you are just keep an open mind and remember, it's not your story to write.  Honestly, if you had half a brain after reading the last book you could have seen this ending coming.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and we don't buy movies but this one has been watched even when it comes on tv.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|When I noticed the price on this watch, I decided to get it to use as a \\"beater,\\" particularly to save my better watch from the rigors of the golf swing. As it turns out, I like this watch so much, that at least until some of the \\"new\\" wears off, I will take care of it as if it were a much fancier item. On to the watch: even with free shipping, it arrived promptly, and was packaged in a nice box with what I guess is called a watch pillow. I was very pleased when I began to examine the watch, and found that all details, such as all number/letters painted flawlessly, no detritus under the crystal, etc., were in good order. Seiko attention to detail is truly amazing, with one small example being the perfect craftsmanship on the two applied items, the name and the \\"5\\" medallion. The lume is bright, and the hands are of an elegant design. The strap and buckle are what you might call modest, but still quite nice, and the leather (like?) protective strip around the holes is a typical little bonus attention to detail. I like the red tip on the second hand. As with the frequent red dot in an otherwise brown and green Corot landscape, it really stands out in an appealing way. The case is a gray metal that, as with so many other details on this watch, begins to grow on you with time. Turning the watch over, you find a display back revealing the Malaysia-made 7S26C movement. It could not be called a fancy movement, but it is clean and pleasing to watch. You set the watch with an intuitive and solid two step process. My informal observation is that the watch is running within about three seconds a day accuracy. Not bad! Now obviously, this is not a fancy watch, and you may think I have over-praised it. And obviously, I cannot evaluate long-term reliability at this point, except by the general good reputation of this movement.But I will state without reservation that you could not make a better per-dollar purchase of a watch. If you are a watch collector, and would like to encourage a child or grandchild to take an interest in mechanical watches, get them one of these and see what happens.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Don't really use it but have it just incase I need to do many things at one time. Good to take grocery shopping.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Feels a lot less like a straight kid's movie than the first one. I was actually engaged and enjoyed watching it with my son.
1932735410|5.0|This book prepared me for the new PMP exam even though it was based on the PMBOK 4th Edition. I suggest this book to anyone that is planning on taking the PMP.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The game is challenging yet good for most players and skill levels. Not too many ads and decent graphics for a free game.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I liked the setting and the action and acting were pretty decent.<br />I will see the others when they come out on Red Box.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I started playing this game and can't seem to stop. I'm addicted to it and love if so<br /> My favorite part is probably the variety of marine life
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Although not a horror movie like I thought it was, it proved to keep my interest and did not drag. Some good special effects and good acting..One of those movies where you would watch once but not again. Wait till its for rent
B0064MGU98|5.0|In many ways, The Good Wife reminds me of ABC's hit show The Practice but with a family story arc .
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book started out slow, but was well worth that wait. I am not a person who tries to figure out how something will end, but I found myself torn between what way the book was going. The ending was great and not something I was expecting. Definitely worth the read!
B009R659L8|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED MARY HIGGINS CLARK'S BOOKS.  I HAD NOT READ ANYTHING BY HER IN A LONG TIME AND NOW I WILL START AGAIN.  SHE WRITES BOOKS THAT I CAN NEVER FIGURE OUT UNTIL THE ONE CLUE IN SOME PART OF THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK THAT I FINALLY BEGIN TO SEE AS THE &#34;BIG&#34; REVEAL.<br /><br />THE SISTERS WERE MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS.  I'M NOT GOING TO SAY MORE SO THAT I DON'T SPOIL THE BOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
B003QTWR08|5.0|Visually interesting for the kids and humorous for the parents.  Good way to spend a family evening in and the ability of this film to carry off almost no dialogue for half the movie is truly impressive.
1446301583|5.0|I love Tilda's projects and the books are pretty. I am working on one project and it also gives me Decoration ideas.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|However, the last episode disappointed me. The last scene threw the series into a smaltzy, soap opera category. If they don't somehow bring you-know-who back in show one of season four, I'm done. I don't want to give anything away to someone who hasn't seen the show yet, but I am livid!
B003VVAE4W|5.0|This show is fantastic and I had to watch it all again!  Love every character and every storyline.  On to season 3!
B001F6TXME|5.0|Very useful and easy to use. Fits perfectly in my D7000, easy control of over 30 seconds shutter speeds; recommend it. For the price, don't use other manufacturers ones.
B009G78EE2|4.0|I like the different sound of this band, I bought the whole CD instead of just the one song i liked and i wasn't dissapointed by the rest of the CD. Well worth the extra dollars for the whole album.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Excellent transfer to blueray (sound and music). A great story with many spectacular dances and acting by Gene Kelly and friends. Highly recommended.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|My family loves this movie.  I had to buy it my little one watches it over and over again.  The picture and sound quality are just like watching it on the DVD player.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This Blu-ray transfer is like watching the movie for the 1st time, it is excellent. Many scenes look different, very clear and with awesome color. Highly recommend it!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I've read and seen all the adaptations and the Doyle original works multiple times, its my stress literature. This series is just fun and if you could pull a modern day Holmes into the world, it has succeeded in doing so.  Happy watching my friends.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook is a great movie, with excellent acting by such a brilliant cast!  Wow!  Very real and uplifting.
0316223239|4.0|What a crazy book.  It was difficult to read in the beginning because it is written in the voice of a 5 year old, but if you can get past that, it is a good read.  It is such a good story with a truly happy ending.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is a great historical novel continuing following the families introduced in the first book of the series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun to play! But watch out- it's highly addictive! My husband and I play side by side on the iPad and Kindle Fire and compete for levels. I highly recommend!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I love how Vonnegut messes with time, reality, fantasy, history, and the like.  Not a book to read if you want a plot where things happen in a chronological way, but deep and easy to read.
B007NZQU72|4.0|I liked the book overall. Very interesting topic and some good advice, but in my opinion the book focused too much on childhood issues and how to correct these, rather than talking about pragmatic ways and techniques to work around challenges.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is a must read for people into Western Lit even a little bit.  Lots of allusions to the Bible and overall a good story that influenced the genre in a big way.  Traces of it can be seen in A Song of Ice and Fire (aka Game of Thrones) and other now famous fantasy books.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Got this for my wife who fell in love with Lindsey after seeing her on Dancing with Stars. Her music videos on You Tube are pure magic. This cd is great but I must admit, watching her perform the songs is what makes Lindsey unique.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book don't think it could be better, but it was sad when finnick died and I can't wait to see how they do the movie!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I am very happy this app, enjoy listening to many many radio stations. Download this app, you will not be disappointed.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book is great for women who are kind of nerdy like me. Tina has a lot of super normal, relatable experiences and is able to pull some nuggets of usefulness out of them. Even her experiences getting onto prime time television come across as relatable, translatae, and helpful. I found this book empowering, laugh out loud funny, and a quick but enjoyable read.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Keep bringing more episodes. I have to say that Penny and Leonard are my favorites characters. I also love how they brought back characters from roseanne
B0094LY88G|5.0|Excellent movie especially of you like baseball. Worthwhile to watch and very entertaining. Highly recommended. It's a good inside look to how baseball operates from a financial standpoint.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I can't play due to a glitch that won't allow my Facebook to link to the app. I'm bummed.....and angry, you know, like the birds! Ugh.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I didn't think my husband and I would be able to semi-fast twice a week but it's easier than we both expected. The weight loss seems secondary to the all the health benefits you gain from fasting. 500 calories a day isn't too bad especially since they aren't consecutively. It feels like a real treat when I have the freedom to eat what I want for 2 then 3 days in a row. Meaning, I fast on Sundays (because the work week begins this day), and then on Wednesdays. It allows me the weekend to eat freely. Funny, although I can indulge on my \\"feed\\" days, I don't feel the need or the want to do so anymore. It doesn't take away from the fact that I look forward to the next day, following a fast with great anticipation. Drinking lots of calorie free beverages helps more than I expected plus hydration is great for me. I hydrate more on my \\"fast\\" days so it's become a habit to do it all the time. Give it a shot. Reading this book gave me a whole new perspective on food and how we use it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is my go to thermal paste, always works like a charm and I always have some left over.  I mean you never really need much, and this stuff lasts forever.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love the great folksy sound on this c.d.  I highly recommend it.  Great for dancing and putting you in a good mood.
B003V1WTMM|2.0|I stopped reading the book almost half through.  I thought it  repetitive, slow moving; characters of little substance.  Disappointed with the author on this one.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Being a history student the era of the American Civil War has always interested.  If I should have ever had the opportunity to met Lincoln, I think that i did in this movie.
B00CHILW64|3.0|documentary style that repeated many scenes - thus boring.<br />attempted to show human feelings but the disaster theme overwhelmed the emotions.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Would be better if it had a 1 button clean up option. Other wise, it has all clean up tools in one place.
0316017930|5.0|My husband and I both loved this book!  It's full of fascinating information and what it takes to be truly successful at anything.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It was very nice to see a variety of characters from the previous books.  Not what I expected at all, but it is the conclusion of Sookie's story, not mine!
0891903313|5.0|I have had a very interesting time purchasing this book, but everything came together in the end--allow me to explain:<br /><br />- I was determined to purchase a hardcover copy of the Katherine Woods translation of The Little Prince.<br />- As I was giving the book as a gift, I thought this particular copy (ISBN-10 0891903313) would be an attractive choice.<br />- Prior to purchasing, I wanted to confirm who did the translation into English--Woods, Howard, or someone else altogether?<br />- I don't know if you have noticed, but this information IS NOT on the Amazon product detail page.<br />- I scoured the reviews; however, as far as I could tell, there are no reviews specific to this product on the product page that tell who the translator is--all refer to other copies of the book rather than ISBN-10 0891903313.<br />- I scoured the internet via every Google search I could think of to try to find out who did the translation for this copy--no luck there.<br />- My next course of action was to contact the seller--Amazon. After 30 minutes on chat with a Amazon associate, said associate determined the information was not available and advised me to contact the publisher. I replied that perhaps Amazon should contact the publisher to provide this information, since Amazon is selling the product. The associate agreed and said I would receive a follow-up email with this information within 48 hours. That was on April 30. It is now May 10 and I have not been contacted.<br />- I did call the publisher and spoke with someone at Amereon--however, they did not know the translator off hand and have not returned my call. My subsequent calls went unanswered.<br />- After 48 hours had passed since my chat with the Amazon associate, I decided to call Amazon to follow-up. Another associate did his best to find the information via Google--however, he had no more luck than I did. After 30 minutes, he advised me to contact one of the other sellers of the book to find this information. Ipushed back because I planned to purchase to the book from Amazon--if you are telling me to ask a seller of the book for this information, aren't you confirming that you should know, since you are the seller of the book that I plan to purchase from? Finally, the conversation ended with him sending me an email and promising follow-up within 48 hours. That was on May 2 and it is now May 10. I have not heard back.<br />- Finally, my curiosity got the better of me and I just ordered the book. I received it yesterday and I am happy to confirm that this is the Katherine Woods translation! The pictures are black and white which I really like. It is really a beautiful book and exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Let the record show that this is a Katherine Woods translation. Amazon, I hope you will update the product detail page...and maybe get back to your customers when you say you will! But no hard feelings :).
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My husband and I rented this one night. We love Rebel Wilson so we gave it a shot. It was predictable but very enjoyable.
B00AMH3RBA|5.0|Loved the movie.  Have my collection completed now.  I may prefer 2 more but this completes it, IT!!  Recommend to others..
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am addicted to this series now. It  has very interesting story lines and characters. I am looking forward to watching season 3 now.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Look, you either love this band, hate it, or have absolutely no emotion regarding it whatsoever.  If you're in the group of people who loves it, this is a fantastic album, go for it.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|I really needed this to remind me of what my strengths are. The advice on making a plan of action and pairing yourself up with the right person to complete a project was priceless.
B007F8BPOU|2.0|Don't know if this is the fault of bordeebook but this book is quite dissappointing. The edge of all the pages are so uneven that it's difficult to flip through to look at it, very frustrating.  If I'd seen it at a store, I would not even consider purchasing it. Also, the minimal photos that it has are not necessarily placed with the recipe. Though some of the recipes sound good, I would not recommend purchasing this book.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|What an amazing book! It's packed full of practical information and a fast read. I'm inspired to be my own experiment.
B0016OLC5Q|2.0|Although this is based on a true story, it's extremely depressing. I am not sure that I would recommend this to anyone!
B005G48Y58|5.0|It is a great movie and every family should watch it. You will enjoy it and so will the rest of the family.
B000SW4DJO|5.0|I love this movie. It is my favorite animated movie!! I love the music and the voice talent is perfect for the characters!
B00457X7IQ|2.0|Interesting set-up for a fantasy novel, but fundamentals (such as the nature of the conflict between dark and light) are not elaborated at all. It boils down to a mediocre teenage love story.
B008D30K7E|3.0|It was very funny but too long. I have recommended it to some of my friends. The characters were very real.
B0089LOG02|5.0|So well written, a story that warms the heart.  Having heard and know that orphan trains existed back in the day, this story is so very well done.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show , very x files-esque.sci-fi, and paranormal all in one..always leaves u wanting more.this is one of my fave new shows!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Love this show! I had to break up with The Following because it just wasn't plausible (all the procedural gaffes aside...how can anyone's necktie be askew ALL THE TIME?!). Hannibal is elegant, refined, well-dressed, and damn sexy. Mads Mikkelson will have you saying &#34;Anthony Hopkins who?&#34; (it's no easy feat to make the viewer able to visualize someone else as the infamous and well-fed Dr. Lechter). Yes, you will have to work at understanding his accent--but constantly leaning in on the edge of your seat every time Hannibal is on-screen is part of the character's appeal. He has your attention. All of it. The story line is enthralling (overall it is ongoing, but there are shorter arcs), and the show is beautifully shot. Every frame is like a work of art. If you're a fan of the genre--you need to be watching this show.
B003XDUCIG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  It has all the complexities about the science behind cooking, but put in simple terms for the non-chef to understand.  I learned so much from reading this, and I plan to follow along some of the blogs mentioned in the book to keep my understanding up to date.  If you've ever wondered WHY the meat turns brown, or WHY the bread rises - this is the book you need to read.  Even something as simple as the correct way to scramble eggs gets explained so that lightbulb goes on inside your head (over low heat, no milk, constantly stirred with something like chopsticks in a non-stick pan - you get the creamiest eggs with this method and the book explains why)<br /><br />If you love to cook and want to go beyond the recipes to create your own culinary masterpieces - read this book.  Not only does it contain great info, it's fun to read as well.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|The game would be great if you didn't have to have a facebook account. I am not on social media and therefore can't play beyond the tutorial at the beginning of the game.
B00493E1GI|5.0|I absoltuley love this movie! Makes me think of my own life. I live in the Moment and believe that you can have many loves in your life. I love how in the movie the Character Liz  just trying to find herself and keeps and open mind and heart.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This is an entertaining script with sensational performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.  The story doesn't fit together perfectly and is probably worth a four star rating without these performances, but wow, are they great, especially Jennifer Lawrence.  She is one of the great talents in film today.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|unexpectedly different.  being a bones fan I expected the terperance from the show.  not the same person.  the book is a good read but it's hard not to compare.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson set out to make a film that really could not be made and a story that could not really be told. He pulled it off by making it very alligorical. Its not really a good film so much as a series of isolated scenes of tremendous quality. Its problem is that the alligorical approach means it doesn't really work in terms of telling a compelling overall story. Its an interesting and very challenging work.<br /><br />In my opinion, what this film is really about is the strange friendship between Errol Flynn toward the end of his life and L. Ron Hubbard. Its the story of two self-destructive men who are each walling themselves out of the world in different ways. Each man is the last \\"ordinary\\" person that the other will interact with. Errol Flynn, in the 1950s, had all the self-destructive attributes of the Joaquin Phoenix character. While the character is not a match for Flynn's personal charm, he is an incredibly close match in terms of Hubbard's personal history. If he isn't meant to be Flynn, the origins of the character concept seem to have been in Flynn. The ending in England also seems to parallel events as well.<br /><br />The friendship ends because neither man can function in the real world anymore and neither man can go back. The system around Hoffman both isolates and enables him. The anti-social behavior of Joaquin Phoenix will isolate him as well.<br /><br />The film is at its best when Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix are playing off each other. The scenes were Phoenix is the silent observer in the shadows of the world Hoffman is building around himself are interesting. The worst bits are those where they repetitively establish the self-destructive personality of the Joaquin Phoenix character.<br /><br />I dont know how much of a broad appeal this has though. I could appreciate it because I was familiar with all the history involved. But its less clear what anyone who came into this fresh would get out of it other than the greatacting in the Hoffman/Phoenix scenes. On the other hand, a certain group will find it difficult to really hate because they will not be able to understand it.<br /><br />Anderson was able to make a film that practically speaking could not be made. But its in a form that few will seemingly be able to understand. Its almost Oliver Stone's \\"Wild Palms\\" all over again. I suppose I could call it a good (or great) art film, but I dont know that it be a complement. But Anderson and everyone else involved deserves credit for attempting something very unconventional.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|great story of everlasting love, I want a &#34;notebook&#34; kind of love story of my own.  All in all, its a beautiful love story.
B0034G4OYA|2.0|Hotel Transylvania could well have been a humorous but thought provoking exercise in prejudice and fear but the message is diluted with obnoxiously-stupid male protagonist and the frequent bouts with bathroom humor.<br /><br />The idea itself is original.  Count Dracula has built a hotel in Transylvania to house monsters that would not be allowed to survive in a human world.  Yes, the monsters are just as scared of the humans as the humans are of the monsters.  Which brings forth two different plots: Dracula's coming of age daughter wants to leave home and explore the world, but through a ploy by a fearful and overprotective father is scared into staying home; and the hotel is visited by a young collegiate who is traveling alone, with whom Dracula's daughter falls in love, to the dismay of the father,<br /><br />This is indeed a solid plot except that while Dracula's daughter seems energetic and articulate, the young male collegiate traveler talks like an imbecile and seems to have an IQ lower than your average head of cabbage.  This, I found irritating.  I wondered not only how a smart woman such as Dracula's daughter could fall for such an idiot, but also why modern comedy is forced to rely on stupid men, flatulence, and a male groin kick, particularly in a movie targeted toward children, suggesting that perhaps poking fun at anything else would be deemed politically incorrect and therefore offensive.<br /><br />This is particularly sad considering the potential this movie had to not only entertain but to convey a wholesome message as well.  Unfortunately, the message was lost in a myriad of obnoxious distractions.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Used this movie as a follow-up to reading the book in Senior English(high school).  Students were able to find many correlations and differences.
0451239377|4.0|The Day of the Jackal is not for those raised on Schwarzenegger movies.  There are no destructive car chases, elaborate explosions, or extended hand-to-hand fights.  The hero is not a belligerent risk taker who thrives on violence as he delivers pithy one-liners.  It is not football.  There is thought, preparation, deceptiveness, detective work, and tension throughout the story.  The hero is a modest, underrated detective who can defeat a mastermind assassin, not through brute force but through cunning, persistence, and detective work.  It is chess.<br /><br />The top leaders of a French revolutionary group, who has made repeated attempts to assassinate Charles de Gaul, upon realizing that their group was so heavily infiltrated, chose to hire an outside party to perform the job: one only know as \\"The Jackal.\\"  The Jackal is professional, in that he is smart, methodical, and thorough.  He has planned everything in advance, from the identities he steals, to his travel arrangements, to his contingencies, to his means of escape.  That he has left nothing to chance is clear as every facet of his plot is meticulously described.<br /><br />Upon learning of this plot, the French government has appointed Claude Lebel, an underrated police detective to foil any plot against de Gaul, assuming one exists.  Who is the Jackal?  Is he a real person?  How could he kill de Gaul?  In addition to trying to discover the plot, Lebel is also reporting to a committee of top government officials, political appointments actually, many of whom don't think very highly of him and would rather see him fail.  But Lebel is not a politician. He is not a counter intelligence expert.  He is not flamboyant.  He is a police detective, a profession, who merely does what is told of him, but does it really well.<br /><br />The joy in reading such a book is not so much the mystery.  It is how a police detective can work to unravel an almost perfect plot despite overwhelming micromanagement and in some cases hostility from his superiors.  The aura is deep but intense.  But even more haunting is the possibility that it may actually have been real.es hostility from his superiors.  The aura is deep but intense.  But even more haunting is the possibility that it may actually have been real.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Straight to the point approach to scriptwriting.  Expands on the basics to inform the aspiring screenwriter how to approach and look at material/ideas from an studio executive point of view.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|A good story that had the reader asking questions about themselves.  Sometimes difficult to read regarding the poverty in India but would recommend the book.
B00C4QPYJU|5.0|Very good movie & the truck is awesome. The love between the father & son is overwhelming. I would watch this over & over. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie. Anyone who likes Sylvester Stallone would like this movie.
014241722X|4.0|A charming story by the master story teller and legal expert.  Grisham accurately captures the mind and behavior of<br />a 13 year old boy.  A book to be enjoyed by all ages.
193700788X|1.0|It's like this book was written by a completely different person. Ms. Harris (if she even wrote this book) took the lazy way out. She didn't even bother to try to make anything fit with the other books. Don't waste your money or if you really must, set it on fire. You'll get more enjoyment out of that than this book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book! It was so interesting! I loved the setting & all the people. I would like to read more of the author's books.
B009R659L8|5.0|I think that this is one of Mary Huggins Clarks better books.  It kept you guessing until the very last chapter.  I love her novels
1423101502|5.0|Rick Riordan is an amazing writer! I like the characters, the story and the mythology! The Last Olympian, in my opinion, is the best book in the series. All the battles were incredible and I loved the end. I liked the return of Thalia, and Prometheus was one of my favorite characters in the book! Percy was awesome! He battle a lot of monsters through the series, but this time he saved the WORLD! He is the best! If you haven`t read the series yet, read it! It`s amazing!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|i wouldn't recommend this app to anyone because it took forever to load and when it did load, it was just a black screen...nothin was there... maybe if was just mine, but it doesn't work very well
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Book kept my interest that I hated to put it down.  I love it when he keeps me wondering 'who dunnit' until the end.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was an interesting tale about a man and his search for identity.  While not the most thrilling plot, the character grew more interesting throughout the story and it was easy to find yourself hoping he would survive.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down, no matter how many times I said &quot;just one more puzzle.&quot; I would agree with others who said it was too short, but can't wait for the next one.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is to boring people and this  was lame people make interesting books ans by the way your weird
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Thank you for the movie and the case.  It was very satisfactory and we will enjoy it for years to come in both DVD and our ipods  and IPads.
0553807919|4.0|I think this book is an excellent parenting resource for helping understand difficult or \\"crazy\\" seeming behavior of children.  As I read through it I kept thinking this sounds so familiar and I know I've employed these methods - they just haven't been related to brain function and connection in quite this way.  Then it came to me, that it is very similar to the Love & Logic parenting book, which I would also recommend. I really felt like the over-arching theme of this book is respecting your child as a unique (albeit underdeveloped) and valuable person and responding to them in ways that are not patronizing and demeaning but respectful of their feelings.  It was a good refresher for me and I've already employed some of the methods with surprising success with my 6 year old son - particularly Name it to Tame it.  My only reservation is that I think there is a danger of assuming there is simply a scientific explanation for bad behavior or bad moral choices.  I would tread cautiously in assuming that a bad choice is simply the product of an undeveloped brain.
B009YMOENE|5.0|They enjoy the whole Diary of a Wimpy Kids series.  Highly recommend these movies.  Good movie for family movie night.
B008Y6RYDS|1.0|Good photography of a beautiful country. As a motorcyclist, I enjoyed it. However, the character of the two protagonists (as well as a lot of the cast) is repugnant. 'Bunch of self centered children, in adult bodies.<br /><br />Spare yourself.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Great read; very in-sightful stuff from the subjects of the book on the subprime crisis. Michael Lewis is great. A
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If Tarantino directs, writes, and even plays a small role in a movie it's got to be well worth watching. Django Unchained is an enjoyable ride that really makes you think. I do believe Jamie Foxx steals the entire movie because he is so good at what he does, and that's act!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|One of the silliest Star Trek movies but very enjoyable with Leonard Nimoy directing.  Also staring San Francisco and whales!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Really fun to watch and find we get caught up in all the sub-plots easily.<br />Really Enjoy the historical aspect.
0988262592|5.0|This is an interesting book, and one,I suspect, that any IT professional would find even more fascinating than I did, not to mention their ability to understand certain descriptions and situations better. The characters are fairly well developed and the dialogue is realistic. But what this book is truly about is maximizing IT in business. This book highlights how critical IT development, testing and operations are to any business, regardless of the underlying industry. While learning from the eccentric Erik, the IT department and its CIO at the fictional Parts Unlimited learn how to better work the IT pipeline and how to increase effectiveness and efficiency. The thought process, including the theory of constraints, is one worthwhile for any manager to understand and consider how the same principles apply to his or her business. Overall, a thought-provoking and engaging story.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I loved the season, of course, but more than that, I loved being able to watch it on my big TV or on my computer.  This streamed perfectly on my Xbox 360, my Roku, and on my laptop.<br /><br />No issues, no concerns.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It's an entertaining flick with some good character development.  Any male in his 20s will be able to relate very quickly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very fun game. it would be nice if it had more upgrades. other than that it is a great game
1607066017|5.0|It's in a different style and a cool universe. Don't like the &#34;tvheads&#34; but the rest is amazing. Great story and greate photo.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Even the OUT OF SHAPE can easily perform this routine. I am still on level one, but can go deeper into the moves. I highly encourage this if you want to melt the fat away.  My husband and children are seeing the difference in me and have started doing the workout as well.  The only problem I had was the actual DVD only played a few times before suddenly being unreadable. I didnt want to wait so I purchased workout 1 through amazon instant and can access it where ever I am.  Good luck and now go get your sweat on....
B008EKMB82|4.0|A multilayered drama, moving between the experiences of a teenage girl in Japan (originally from US), and a Canadian woman living on a western island and how they connected via the tsunami. Pervasive themes of Zen Buddhism, family bonds,bullying and suicide. Feel-good ending surprised.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|It may be on the long side but its still worth the watch. So you might have to watch it in two sittings.
B005ZMTAXQ|4.0|My son loves it he watches it on the kindle. I recommend this movie it's fun and Entertaining so if you have kids get it
014242613X|5.0|I enjoyed the book, it just didn't last long enough.....had to get another hehe.......I would like something a bit more grown up but this was still a good read.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I thought it would be dry and boring.  On the contrary, it is anything but either of these descriptions.  It grabs you and before you know it, you want to get out and run!
B000007ODM|5.0|I love Lesiem, Magna Canta, State of Grace and Mysteria...so this is another variation on that genre.  Fits with smooth jazz, which I also like.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game...it is so much fun to play...I hats to stop playing.  The levels are great ...cant wait to play them all
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie to all of my friends.  It is a fantastic movie that keeps your interest all the way through.
B00479SVBU|2.0|The sound is just awful. I was expecting something better based on the reviews. I guess transmitting sound over FM just isn't very good. It's really tough to find a station that works well on a long road trip as well, which is where I would use this the most.<br /><br />The device itself is good, it's just built on a bad basis.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|recommend this to everyone.  zeppelin is better than ever.  so glad jason bonham could follow in his fathers footsteps and be on drums.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I like games that play a little faster. Its very unique  and the images are beautiful. Interesting concept for a game
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|My friends and I rented this movie from Amazon thinking that the combination of Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviews were saying. Well, we should have heeded others' advice. Yes, it really is that bad.<br /><br />Admittedly, the first 30 minutes was hilarious and very, very relateable for anybody who is or has been in a long term relationship (married or otherwise). There were some awkward moments, hilarious, and then downright stupid & contrived ones. In the end though, the movie had ZERO storyline other than endless bickering and Paul Rudd having an obsessive compulsion to eat cupcakes. I was just a little baffled why they always seemed to have this gorgeously decorated cupcakes laying around the house. The fact that I was that focused on how little sense that made really should be a testament to how little I could pay attention to what was actually going on. It just sounded like a bunch of screeching after awhile anyway.<br /><br />So, after the first 30 minutes the bickering, arguing, yelling, sniping, and screaming kids continues. There's no point to it and when this monstrosity finally ended, it was lackluster at best. Not that I expected more.  I'd write more in this review but I really don't recall anything else going on in the movie other than a bunch of yelling and fighting. A major let down. I will give it 2 stars because the first 30 minutes was funny and I did laugh but the overall premise of the movie sucked.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Graphics are nice kind of a cute game . I think boys would like this so they can pretend to be a fireman
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|Almost all of these tunes were presented in albums like &#34;First Rays of the New Rising Sun&#34; and,&#34;Rainbow Bridge&#34;. Those were two of the best Hendrix ever did. .This new album takes these great tunes and offers what sound like practice or bad remixes that He would never have released. I was lucky enough to see Hendrix twice in concert, and I would not want anyone to listen to this and think they know His music. Any true fan will agree, his family should not release any more of this stuff
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Superior app. With an ever changing eyeglass prescription, I truly appreciate having a huge display to take advantage of. This is the only calculator that I use.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I want to start off that with saying that these are the first headphones I've gotten that are actually audiophile headphones, and not a headset or something cheap. For the first time ever I feel like I hear details in music I never noticed before. The clarity is amazing, the bass levels are perfect and never overrides the mids or highs. This is also the first time I can legitimately hear a soundstage and it's really amazing. Music sounds around the the ear then directly in the ear. I've never heard music like this before in my life and I hope these things last me years upon years.<br /><br />Also gamers, yes these pair of headphones work just fine. I play blacklight retribution, bad company 2, and WoW mostly and with use of the asus xonar u3 (yes that has enough juice to run it at full driver power) you do get a legitimate surround sound feeling and you will be able to tell where things are just fine. However if you have your mind set on the ATH-AD700 then go for that but I want to make this clear again. I could hear footsteps quite fine and got the jump on plenty of people in my tests. These work just fine for games. If you can't hear someone coming up to you, then it's the sound engine or an audio setting you have not setup properly and not the headphone's fault.<br /><br />Update July 2013: I have came across a good vintage stereo amp at an estate sale, a fisher ca-229 to be exact. Upon hooking it up with my computer and that U3 and using that I noticed that these headphones opened up even more (width as well as a very solid sensation of what's in front and behind me, as the artist intended) and sounds less confined compared to just using the xonar U3 to power the headphones. I see why people say now this headphone really needs an amp. It's truly a pleasant experience to hear these cans now and I do not think I will ever regret this purchase, they are just amazing at this price range.
0988262592|5.0|I've been selling deployment automation solutions for over three years and am a novelist so imagine my delight to find this - a novel about DevOps written by some of the most highly respected names in the industry. As a novel it's excellently executed - tight, fast paced action with an intricate plot and a fine cast of characters spouting believable, true to type dialogue. As an industry manual I highlighted reams of passages that succinctly explain the messages we've been trying to get to the market - at the heart of it all, embracing deployment automation and a DevOps approach makes lives better. I was particularly fond of Erik. I'd like to have an Erik in my life.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I thought this was a great movie.  Was not disappointed even after all the hype and great reviews.  Just gave it 4 stars because I think it did lose something on the small screen (my laptop)
0061733199|5.0|I bought it just for the information. If your camping, hiking or just have kids and would like to get them outdoors this is a great tool to do that with. It has much more infor. than just survival stuff.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I'm rating this book as a whole book and not just rating the ending!  I think this book is deserving of 4.5 stars.  I thought it was really good, definitely some twists, turns and some real surprises.  I very much enjoyed this book.  Did it end the way I wished?  No, but that doesn't mean the book is bad.  The ending was a surprise.... one I would have never considered.  But not as bad as I was thinking from all the terrible reviews.  But looking back, I can see that it wasn't that far-fetched of an ending.<br /><br />I think the author did a great job with this book and I'm happy to hear \\"After Dead\\" is coming out in October 2013 so we can see what happens to everyone in the future.... I'm so curious to know how everyone fared.
B00499NHLC|5.0|this is one of the better shows I have seen in a long time I highly recommend it to everyone
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Kids and adults will enjoy this tale since it combines some of the most beloved characters we've all grown up with. It's like a magical &#34;A-team&#34;.  The plot line is fairly obvious to adults, but the journey of the characters is what will keep everyone engaged.  In addition, the movie sets out to solve some very old questions (Why does the tooth fairy keep your teeth? and where did Jack Frost come from?) and the answers are cute and touching.  Not a bad family movie night...
B004R13U6Y|5.0|i rarely pay for apps and i got this one. i have a lot of pdf books and most of the readers just didnt handle them well. this one is smart and essentially makes the text as big as possible while still fitting the page so you dont have to scroll around. good purchase if you read pdfs a lot
B0084I9QFU|5.0|I don't think I have to explain to you why Bad is one of the greatest albums ever, but I will do it anyway!! I can't think of many albums that I could listen to from beginning to end (unless it was another MJ album) , but Bad is one of them!!<br /><br />The tracks included on Bad 25 (disc 1) are the same as the original: Bad, the way you make me feel, speed demon, liberian girl, just good friends, another part of me, man in the mirror, I just can't stop loving you, dirty diana, smooth criminal and leave me alone. Every single track is incredible in its own way, songs like Bad and leave me alone are powerful, I just can't stop loving you and liberian girl are romantic and touching, speed demon and another part of me are just fun and catchy, and then you have man in the mirror which is in a league of its own. As soon as you pop Bad into your cd player, you will have a hard time taking it out!!<br /><br />The tracks on disc 2 of Bad 25 are unreleased tracks and demos, and are definitely worth a listen. I especially like the international versions of I just can't stop living you ( Je ne veux pas la fin de nous), and the spanish version of I just can't stop loving you ( Todo mi amor eres tu).<br /><br />If you are a Michael Jackson fan this is a must have, hearing Bad in a remastered format is incredible, and it just reinforces why Bad is one of the best albums of all time!!
B004JHYRAE|5.0|It's a well balance, well written book, no pretentious, and brings a lot of useful information, makes you think analyze relationships, what you do in different situation,  how we handle it.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|What can I say about Thriller, this is the first song I ever heard from Michael Jackson, and it still sounds as incredible today as it did back then (although I am only 20, so I was not around when it was actually released). Thriller has sold an estimated 100 million albums, and when you listen to this cd from beginning to end you'll understand why!<br /><br />The tracks included on Thriller 25 (disc 1) are: Wanna be startin' somethin', baby be mine, the girl is mine, thriller, beat it, billie jean, human nature, P.Y.T. , the lady in my life and the Vincent Price excerpt. This album has every type of song on it: Up tempo songs like Wanna be startin' somethin' and Beat it, romantic and slow songs like The girl is mine and Human nature, and classics like Billie jean and Thriller which will never get old!!<br /><br />The tracks included on disc 2 are unreleased tracks, and they are actually quite good. There is a remix of the girl is mine done with will.i.am that is very catchy, and the billie jean remix with Kanye West is slowed down and very good.<br /><br />Lastly you have the dvd that comes with Thriller 25, and it is awesome! On this dvd you get the full length music videos of Billie Jean, Beat it and Thriller which are incredible, but more importantly you get MJ's Billie Jean performance from the Motown 25 concert, in which Michael does the moonwalk for the very first time!!<br /><br />Thriller 25 is a must own for fans, hearing the classic songs from this album remastered to their original glory is incredible, and it makes the greatest album of all time sound even better!
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|It's a fun game but it doesn't involve any skill or thinking.  Haven't tried it against others yet that may make it more enjoyable.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Downloads and uploads are quick and easy.It helps me stay posted with friends and family, I believe I will keep it a awhile longer
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best fiction books I have read in years. The story line was great and I couldn't wait to start Book Two
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It was a good story and very real.  The reader suffers with the characters.  I also liked the historical accuracy it presented.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Simply put you can't beat Ferris Bueller's Day Off for a GREAT family feel good movie.  Even his sister (Jennifer Gray) comes around.  If you have been living under a rock on some distant planet and have missed this true gem of filmmaking, WELCOME TO EARTH.  Now, see this.  You'll be better off for having done so.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Brilliantly done! Graphic in every sense of the word and done with a touch of Spagetti Western. Definitely a must see.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game  kept me thinking wish it was longer I finished in about 3 hours hope there is another coming soon
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so good that my daughter has got me hooked on it when she goes to school I gotta check on her pony and take care of it for her
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I feel like this movie is just amazing...great love story that has been over shadow with so much negativity. I will warn you this movie is not your average roots movie. This film focus more on the tortures of African Americans in the 1900 S. My hat is off to the director for bringing this story to the light. I don't recommend this film for younger viewers because of the blood and graphic nature in this. But anybody who ia 17 years of age or older especially young African American its a must see. I challenge anybody to see this film and see why we should never use the n word again!!
0060730552|5.0|This book will have you gripping the arms of your chair!  I avoid suspense; there were times that I just had to put down this book and think about other activities for awhile!  I had to pick it up, though, and finish it.  There are tender moments of insight into friendship that is rarely expressed this profoundly by men.  The determination and eventual victory of this mangled mountaineer will truly leave you gasping.  An intense, absorbing book - not for the faint of heart!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I just had to write a review because this had been a series I've read for years- and I have mixed feelings about the final chapter in Sookie's life.<br /><br />For me, it wasn't as bad as the last couple or so in the series, however, it did feel like a \\"filler\\" book, not the exciting conclusion to a story we were all enveloped in.<br /><br />It seemed like Charlaine had a recipe for Sookie and thought just by using that she could end the series:<br />-a helping of a murder or 2<br />-sprinkle mundane activities like laying in the sun, shop at walmart<br />-a pinch of \\"southern charm,\\" Sookie making sure to thank ppl in her life, and ask if they want lemonade<br />-pepper in a small sex scene, or the desire to<br />-2 cups complaints about being a mindreader<br /><br />blah blah... It kind of had the vibe of the first few books but it felt more so faked, not carefully thought out.<br /><br />And as far as her love life goes (let us all admit we have our faves)- it wasn't as genuine, passionate, or full of love as the other books were. I kind of didn't see who she ended up with as lasting, it was very mediocre for Sookie.<br />I also don't see how Eric can go from Hero to Zero that fast, either.<br />There were a few things that didn't quite line up about the villains in this story, things that kind of damaged the linear picture you might have of all of the characters overall.<br />I didn't hate it, but I felt very unresolved. Like it wasn't an actual conclusion, and that things will continue to happen we just won't know because there will be no more stories shared.<br />I say give it a try- we've come all this way!<br />I can't see anyone actually truly enjoying it, but it's good to try and come as full circle as we can.<br />It's too bad this wonderful series didn't go out with a bang- rather than a whimper.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|A nice book to get lost in! Loved it! Good plot and plenty of twists to keep you wondering how the story will unfold.
B009NY43NY|1.0|*spoilers* I was prepared for the ending I knew that CH would end with Sookie and Sam together and I'm fine with that. I just HATED what she did to Eric. This was not the same character that she created through the entire series. I just felt like she kept trying to make the readers not as angry as some seem they are that she didn't end up with Eric. But there was different ways to do it. He was so weak and just did what people told him and we were led to believe he never really cared about Sookie and that Sookie was OK with the breakup and not upset. She seemed relieved. She even said she had a harder time getting over Bill. I hated seeing what CH did to Eric. He was my favorite strong alpha male character in the series and she wrapped it up with him being told what to do and being fine with it and never putting up a fight. She could have ended it with Sam and Sookie but why ruin Eric for us?
B003SNKBXW|1.0|I really liked the movie.  So I got the book to try to make sense of the movie.  Although it was written well, the story was so boring, and all the talk about the 3 musketeers was just ridiculous.  skip this one
B004GYY714|5.0|Can listen to out of town radio stations that my friends recommended and don't have to refresh the button while listening for more than one hour.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and now seeing it with my son makes it even better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my guilty pleasure and I love it...a real no brainer to pass the time of day when I'm alone.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Man turn this album on and some off the songs will definitely have your mate raising and eyebrows. Justin did a wonderful job with this album ...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good game to pass the time for the kids on the block. They all wanna play it. All the small activities that can be done while also being able to take pictures and share them. The kids love it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I liked it. I don't understand all the bad reviews. I thought it was a great ending to a wonderful series.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|The BIOS demands that you use a mouse for some tasks, but the cursor is displayed at like 2FPS. It constantly forgets the information you put in requiring you to enter it multiple times. Clock ratios are often not applied even though they show up in the BIOS. It often doesn't boot for no reason. It doesn't display the voltage of the processor- you basically get +.15v or -.2v but you have no idea what the base value is so it is completely useless. The graphics look like they came from 1999. Panels and contextual menus are often completely redundant, displaying information that was already on the previous screen. On the off chance that this mono makes it to the operating system after changing BIOS values from their original settings, it will decide to lock the CPU clock ratio to 5 and not let you change it beyond there. Basically, the BIOS looks and reads like it was designed by a blind chinese person. I assume the people who have rated this mobo positively haven't ventured past its boot order.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I watched the movie before I read the first book in this series, and since I picked them up I've found it hard to put them down. I was wary of these books at first as they're directed more towards teens, but as a whole I think any fan of scifi/fantasy of this type could get into this trilogy.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Wow! I learned so much from this book. So many things I agreed with.  Wonderful tips for myself and for raising my children.  I will definitely recommend this book to my other mommy friends.  It's ok to be an introvert!  What a different perspective.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|This is a fun book to read if you are a Craig Ferguson Fan. He is an entertaining writer and lets you in on alot of his background.
B003IDMUSG|5.0|the story is different and intriguing. I kept me guessing until the end.  A very good read. A good writer.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|This was a wonderful series. I really love Brittish period drama. I wish the series had been longer! I love the HD.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|When I saw this classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald was being adapted and filmed again, I quickly re-read the book, so it would be fresh in my mind. Directed by the audacious Australian Baz Luhrmann (\\"Moulin Rouge!\\" and \\"Strictly Ballroom\\"), the early scenes are a bit too \\"Baz\\" (gaudy and frenetic with RAPPING!) but after the story settles in, this is a terrific PG-13 movie. Don't worry about seeing it in 3D because the story is the main thing; both DiCaprio and Mulligan fit their roles to a \\"T.\\"<br /><br />In fact, all of this cast is great:<br />  * Leonardo DiCaprio (\\"J Edgar\\" and \\"Shutter Island\\") is perfect as Jay Gatsby, the mysterious, phenomenally wealthy resident of West Egg, a location on Long Island. He is a free-wheeling host who throws lavish parties that everyone who is anyone must attend.<br />  * Carrie Mulligan (\\"Never Let Me Go\\" and \\"Drive\\") is the tragic Daisy Buchanan, the enchanting mirage from Gatsby's past.<br />  * Joel Edgerton (\\"Warrior\\" and \\"Kinky Boots\\") is Tom Buchanan, Daisy's possessive husband: promiscuous, wealthy, and vengeful.<br />  * Tobey Maguire (\\"The Details\\" and \\"Labor Day\\") is our alter ego, Nick Carraway, who narrates the story and represents our point of view. His cottage is next door to Gatsby's mansion, so they become friends. By the way, Daisy is his cousin.<br />  * Isla Fisher (\\"Wedding Crashers\\" and \\"Rango\\") is Myrtle, Tom Buchanan's lover. She lives over a service station on the road to New York City.<br />  * Jason Clarke (\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" and \\"Lawless\\") is George Wilson, the guy we come to pity. It's his wife Myrtle who is the catalyst for the story.<br /><br />It's nice to see Luhrmann use his fellow Aussies in this one. Edgerton, Fisher and Clarke all hail from Down Under, as do many other supporting cast members. In addition, this splendid film was shot entirely in Oz. Good on ya, mate!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I give this book five stares because the author put everything he had in this story. I hope this book is read by many people.
B002RXS1OK|5.0|Dracula 1979, is a classic movie which is a rare find today in this age of beyond horror films. Lord Lawrence Olivier, Frank Langella, Kate Nelligan, and Donald Pleasence performances are well done, their characters give this motion picture the &#34;pop&#34; that it takes to the five star rating that I gave it.  The setting, the theme, the plot are well projected as well as the language  and content. The only thing that is missing from this movie is the vivid color, the color is somewhat drained and it is very dark in some scenes.  Other then that, its an enjoyable old fashioned movie that can be recommended for family viewing.
B0098WWDY2|4.0|Lee was at his best with Fourplay but these are some good tunes and it contains a few that linger in my memory.  He saved my sanity when I was in Saudi.  I listened to booted legged cassettes until I knew each of the songs and this acoustic rendition of some of those brought back bitter sweet memories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It would be awesome if you updated minecraft so you can carry water or vines in creative also what ever is in survival put on creative please!!!!!!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|but once you get into this series, it's non-stop watching.  I can't believe I'd never heard of it before a couple months ago.  For anyone who liked the X-Files or anything from the suspense or horror side of things, this is a fabulous show.  Great character development - characters that you understand, like and feel for.  Strong plots and subplots to always keep you interested.  Season eight was especially strong - still waiting to see the last episode next week.  I can't wait to see what loose-ends get tied up and which are ripped open to make way for a fantastic ninth season.<br /><br />Paranormal is a great unheralded show!  Start watching all 175 (or so) episodes today!<br /><br />Be sure to have a bag of rocksalt at the ready when watching.  Pour some out in a circle.  Stay in that circle and you'll be fine...
B004UIOUHC|5.0|My other browser would lock up - with Opera have have not any lock ups.  I like the menu, very easy to find items.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like this app. I tried other apps to download videos and they are not as simple. This just works and works with no problem. Definitely recommend.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|The music is iconic, and the CD is fabulous. I bought it to leave in my car for when I am driving. Love this!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Entertaining game to relax and fill some time.  A nice break from Spider Solitaire as well.  Can be addictive too.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Sookie has everyone out to kill her in this one. She must deal with losing Eric because of her action of using the Cluvial Dor. She must deal with being set up for a murder she didn't commit, and she must deal with a new person who was angry that they couldn't get the Cluviel Dor.<br /><br />It is sad to see it End, but the friends she has made along the<br />way help her with the enemies she has closing in on her.  Another good story by Charlain Harris.<br /><br />A
B00263HWM8|2.0|I really enjoy this franchise, but MI2 is the worst of the bunch. I really don't like the style that John Woo brought to this film. Everything was just so heavy handed, it was hard to watch.
B0096HL33G|3.0|I had hoped for a really good love story but it became very depressing and nothing to get excited about and a really crummy ending.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story line, very interesting characters; gives interesting insight into the operation of a wealthy British household and relationships of family members and staff in the early 1900s, prior and during WW1. The home and surrounding grounds are amazing and the photography does it justice.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great conclusion to an awesome story! Wraps everything up very well! Loved the way it ended while keeping true to the characters.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is why we love Rod Stewart. No one writes a song like Rod. No one sings a songs a song like Rod. he makes us happy.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I love this classic version of Persuasion.  It's a traditional, well-done british period drama with an excellent cast.  I've watched it several times!
B0007OCG56|5.0|I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I absolutely love this movie and Im glad that I actually purchased this. I got this dvd a few days after I ordered it and there was nothing wrong with it when I opened the box. Adam sandler in this movie is just great. And I dont even want to mention Penelope Cruz. This woman is absolutely beautiful. Im not letting anyone borrow this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Every night my husband and I have to watch one more episode of Downton Abbey.  I don't know what we are going to do when we reach the last one.  We will impatiently be waiting for the next season.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Love the show, interesting episodes, never boring or stale. Recommend the show to everyone who likes drama shows. Love it.
1449320104|5.0|It is very clear written. It covers almost every topic I was interestd in.<br />I especially like chapters about Threading and Parallel Programming.<br />Highly recommended for people with some C# background.<br />May be too hard for absolute beginners.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|For some slightly off-center upbeat 80's creativity, The Talking Heads are hard to beat. For the casual fan, as I am, this collection would probably be all that you would need to enjoy this very unique band. I had heard only 7 of these songs before I made this purchase. The first time I played it, ranking each one as Very Good, Good, or Not-So-Good, I ended up with only 5 in the last category, and that is not bad for material that I was mostly unfamiliar with. And the sound is excellent. The CD is remastered, but believe me, every \\"remastered\\" CD does not sound this crisp and clear. And talk about variety! Like Beck, The Talking Heads borrow from just about every conceivable genre of music. Unfortunately the lyrics are not included with the disc, but you can catch some of them while you rock to the energetic music.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is a great movie! I have not watched any previous Legacy movies, and only watched this one because Jeremy Renner is my favorite actor. But it did not disappoint! Would definitely recommend!
B001AQT0RC|4.0|Not having read the book, which the naysayers seem to have, I liked Contact very much. Especially touching to me was the way the loss of a loved one was presented. That having been said, if you're a Christian be prepared to be portrayed as a slavering fanatic. I happen to know that Sagan had little respect for people of faith (Christians are by far the safest to criticize because we're not likely to cut someone's head off for doing so!) and I don't know if the book was more respectful than the movie but my skin is thick and other than that I thought it a pretty good movie. I found the Haddon character very intriguing. Too bad his part was so small. The circus that followed  the discovery of the message from the aliens was exactly what one would expect, and the posturing of the politicos is as laughable in the movie as it is in everyday life.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is another book that none of us could put down.  I love reading the same books as my sisters, so we can discuss our favorite characters.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Good movie.  Funny.  Easy to watch on Kindle.  Never skipped or had to buffer, etc.  Would recommend for a light comedy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Have a great day now about the book it was a great wimpy kid book I love to read the books
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Truly epic. This season has a masterful underlying story structure, and the character development is superb. I couldn't stop watching.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|How the way the book is written, made me have the best time reading it! After reading one chapter, I wanted to read another one!
B0097K21YW|4.0|Ooh, I LIKE this!--  If you're a Godzilla fan or have ever had a fondness and admiration for the Cloverfield monster, you'll enjoy &quot;Burn the City!&quot;  Lob fireballs at the pathetic human dwellings and watch them burn and topple; some even spark as they do so!  If you're lucky, you can see your misdirected fireballs bounce and skitter along the ground.  This is a must-have for all pyrokinetics and fans of city-busting monsters.  Docked one star due to imprecise targeting and physics, but a great FAOTD.--Fun, RAWR!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This is a story about addiction and the price it extracts in human suffering and failure.  Washington does an outstanding job in the role of the airline Captain that has allowed drugs and alcohol to impair his professional life and to continue down a path to personal disaster.  He ingests copious quantities of booze until he is virtually lifeless.  He is excessive in every way and he seemingly is on a long road to hell with no ability to stop.  The airline crash is the ultimate failure in a life that has grown from great promise to a massive failure.<br /><br />You could probably write this story many different ways but the outcome is always the same.  Addiction is slowly ripping away the moral fiber of our country.  \\"Flight\\" is just another chapter in the decline.
B000SVZIDA|4.0|This movie was interesting not a normal scene at all.  But with all the drama it makes for a good broadway show.  SOmeone would want to watch a colorful, different but understandable movie.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The extraordinary mixture of mysticism and martial conflict make this a very interesting tale. The reader HAS to be patient. A lot of things take a while to understand but you get there in time. The characters are rich.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|love the series great aerial shots of all nature's actions and it was really good price for what you got
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Normally do not watch drama/soaps, but I would not put it in a category.  This is just great entertainment.  Acting, chemistry, multiple plots, historical context, costume design, social commentary -- all excellent, all well done.  This will stand the test of time.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Hi,<br />The film is great. But I was disappointed from the &#34;Bonus!&#34; inside the package. The redemption code did not work. I ask about it on the ultraviolet support page and they told me that my code (KM2G3C9QXB7K) is for US, but I live in Sweden. And I didn't get the bonus copy of the film.<br />Regards,<br />Georgi
B0043JDUNS|3.0|I just didn't feel like Iron Man 2 had quite the punch of the first or third.  Of course the effects are great, and Downey and Paltrow are fantastic, and Cheadle is an upgrade for his character in my opinion.  But this movie for me lacked the human element that was so well done in the other two, and so the thrills, while still there, just don't quite have the same effect.  But still a fun and exciting movie, so I give it a 3 out of 5.
B0052REQLK|2.0|How many times the same. Notion was repeated - it appeared the author was trying to add mower pages to the book.  I did not care for the style of writing.  at times the writer appeared to be preaching .  I felt like I could skip many pages and not miss a thing,
B00BHWG5C2|4.0|I love this album. My vinyl is in pretty good shape, but I wanted to replace it. The extra Stones tracks were understandably left off the original album, but the extra disc with BB King and Ike and Tina Turner is spectacular. The tightness of their bands puts the extra Stones tracks to shame.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really like the diverse characters, and the main character, Alicia. I've found my summer show! Already in Season 3, so I'll be sad when I'm caught up.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Very enjoyable - not a fan of Sean Penn but that didn't interfere with my enjoyment. Definitely worth the time and $.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show. This is so suspenseful. You might as well buy the whole season. The download was also easy.
0811879542|5.0|Everyone loves this book.  Big or small, it's fun and clever.  The kids think it is magical.  I recommend it highly.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|When I started watching this movie for the first time I thought that it would be strange and cheaply presented.  I loved it!  Loved Lola, Charlie and the whole bunch.  How could you not!  Had to get my own copy and so happy I did.  So glad I  was receptive to its unique story and hope others watch it and enjoy it too.
0811874192|5.0|The bouquets are amazing and beautiful.  Something for every season.  They would look spectacular on a coffee or side table.
B007X16GFC|4.0|This was a sleeper movie for me; I'd not heard of it; Wahlberg was excellent, in fact I've watched 3 of his movies lately, all are excellent..
B008XFJEE2|2.0|Boring, no substance to it at all.There are better uses of your time than this movie. Two stars is generous.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|I could conceivably given this more stars but could not get it to download on my Kindle, unfortunately. Since it was free, I guess you get what you pay for.
B004LQI0HE|5.0|I loved the book this film is based on, by Kazuo Ishiguro. Having adored his earlier masterpiece The Remains of the Day as both a book and film, I was ready to love this book and film and did. The setting of the book seemed to be timeless - literally, at least in the beginning, I didn't realize it was supposed to take place in the last century until far into the book. It doesn't really make sense in terms of history and science, but the director has described the story as &#34;a love story with fictional science context mixed in.&#34; It's not really sci-fi-ish, but does seem other-worldly. At times I wanted the characters to just make a run for it, but that would have been a very different story. I thought all three main characters were excellent. As the story resolves at the end, the explanations in the film differed slightly from the book's, at least in some characters' motivations, but otherwise the film seemed faithful to the book, and I really enjoyed adding some visual clothing to the excellent bones of the book. I think maybe the reason it didn't do big box office was because of the lack of a Hollywood ending, but those who don't require that may enjoy this film even more because of that. I found it a smart, thoughtful, visually beautiful film.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Having read the books, I had the movie on my watchlist. When it showed up as a featured Prime offering on my smart tv, I took and advantage and watched. I enjoyed the movie, and it was interesting to see how the filmmakers brought the books to life.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I’ve always liked these series and am really glad that I can get them on line and watch them whenever I want on any of the computer’s and/or kindle, android devises that I have.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Great visuals and excellently done but I was disappointed it wasn't the whole saga -  only the first half of the book.
B000KZFMZI|5.0|I’ve always liked these series and am really glad that I can get them on line and watch them whenever I want on any of the computer’s and/or kindle, android devises that I have.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Excellent snapshot into a period of Alfred Hitchcock's life with snippets of background on an extremely scary movie from my youth.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I was really glad that I can get them on line and watch them whenever I want on any of the computer’s and/or kindle, android devises that I have.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I'd like to see this as a must read in our High Schools.  I had no ideal of this part of American history.  It's that good.
B004SBX112|5.0|Among my many others that I have purchased just to have something to do while waiting during any scheduled appointments. Something to keep me pre-occupied.
B008P9M614|4.0|I'm in my 70's, so, as seniors know, medical issues get to be really real. So the long, broad line of medical problems this series depicts are really of interest. And the 'tough love' approach of Dr. House is a nice slap of reality for those of us hoping for immediate good news. Morale: True news is best, and cures don't come easy.<br /><br />The only downside is that, aside from different topics, the formats are too the same, the process' differ, but the presentation is consistent, predictible. At least as far as I have viewed - it's a long set, all interesting - I'm not going to rush through them (maybe Amazon could wait a bit before asking for a review...?)<br /><br />The graphics and depictions of very realistic treatments may fascinate or make potential patients queasy. Whatever, they're true (I think) and a needed slap of reality. The CGI graphics for the internal processes are stunning and motivated me to really think what doctors have to face; we humanoids are real complex critters.<br /><br />I think this fine unique dramatic series somewhat on a par with the vivid/ educational/exciting natural visions offered by the BBC. [[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series]] (There is a very long list of nature topics in a variety of individual DVDs; all wonderful.)<br /><br />Steve Martin famously said 'Everything you need to know you can learn from the movies'; these two above sure prove his point...
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I’ve always liked these series and am really glad that I can get them on line and watch them whenever I want on any of the computer’s and/or kindle, android devises that I have.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It was a very nice story except I didn't really need to read over and over again the horrors of the Irish Orphanage system.  I know they were true experiences suffered by many, but really brought down the enjoyment of the story.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I am really glad that I can get a movie or show on line and watch them whenever I want on any of the computer’s and/or kindle, android devises that I have.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watched the first two seasons on netfilx and was so addicted I bought Season 3 on amazon. Good price, good streaming, and great start to a digital library on amazon.

B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is just plain funnnnnni love it . I play forever love all the levels .the graffics are amazing . It's worth downloading its great fun
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written, excellent acting, Delightful time to be spend while enjoying its delicious twist and turns. Unquestionable romance flavor that doesn't overwhelm the magic and subtle details of the story around the family and servants.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works great!  excellent way to waste time while tv commercials are on.<br /><br />the trick is to burn ammo unless you are on the third star level.  If you peak too soon, you can never get better.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|In setting her story against a little known but horrific chain of events in Paris 1942,  de Rosnay brings us the story of two families, linked by an awful incident. This is a page turner that brings to life the plight of those Jewish families in Paris who were collected or turned in by their neighbours to be sent into a terrifying circumstance. At the same time we meet a contemporary French American woman, seemingly fitting into life as a Parisian, but dealing with her own modern day issues as she raises a bi-cultural family. Cleverly the worlds of these two distant families are connected. Read this!
B002EDH0FE|2.0|True comic book fans might find this disjointed story more satisfying as they will already be intimately familiar with the back story. For these casual fans, the story felt like it was written by a 75 yr old bitter man who was trying to be cutting edge and cool. For us, it missed the mark. It felt like half the movie was left on the editing room floor with too much detail missing. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the movie wasn't any longer, but it was hard to get invested in the players as we didn't feel like we even got to know them. The Cold War theme felt stagnant as well. It just didn't feel current or relevant.  My husband wanted to turn it off, but I made him hang in there. He is not thanking me for that.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Everything is wonderful with this app. I just wish that you could turn off the notifications that pop up always on your phone.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I'm a big fan of the LOTR movies and enjoyed this earlier book movie adaptation.  Same great directing, effects, principal charactors and another disc with all sorts of extras. Be aware that this is an uncompleted series and finishes with many unanswered questions and tasks.  Remember,more to come.  Disc shipped fast and in great condition.  Good value,  Joe in San Francisco
B0013LL2Z2|2.0|second time for this problem. When it happenes with one copy it seems to happen with all copies of same item, something to look into. I didn't want to be bothered with returning item, so I just counted price paid as my loss.
B008476HBM|4.0|I have read this several times over the years as a&#34;go-to&#34; when I need something amusing that will take me into another world. This other world is very shallow but complex social world Victorian??? England. It only covers one caste, though-I would guess middle or upper-middle wannabes. Anyway, its a fast read, and never fails to amuse me, especially as I see some of this behavior still being played out here in my own very provincial village.....Always, Hope
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this app, it's different enough that it's like a new game every time you play. The downside is you need Facebook to benefit from most rewards. If you're patient you can play totally free, if not you can buy diamonds for energy. I like this game mostly  :)
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I love it because well... ITS awesome try it out for yourself it buy it and you will be glad you bought it and it was worth the 99&cent;.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|It was not readily apparent when downloading on my Kindle that this was a Facebook version of Angry Birds. Installed, only to find you are REQUIRED to log in via FB in order to play. While I do love Angry Birds and use FB, I have ZERO interest of 'challenging' FB friends to play AB, nor do I care to have my scores or activity blabbed to FB every time I play this game (assuming that's what it would do). DELETED app-- bummed.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|JT's new album is a great mix of ballads, dance tunes & pop with an insouciant dash of 'devil-may-care'...this artis has fianlly come into his own and he is loving it.  'Mirrors', ostensibly written for Jessica Biel, is an eclectic blend of post-modern kitsch and nostalgia.  Don't miss your opportunity to add a great album to your collection.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|This book left me wanting more. I was lucky  I had  Book 3 already downloaded on my Kindle so I could keep reading. Now I can't wait for the 4th book in the series. I have always loved Jeffrey Archer's books and  this one is no exception.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It had a good storyline and good twists.<br />I have already recommended to lots of friends.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I can't wait  for  the  4th book in the series. I love the growth of the families and the intertwining of characters over  the period of  the World Wars.
B001W2I9Y4|4.0|Its pretty good. Never really listened to them too much. I would recommend checking it out for sure. How many more words do I have to type?
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|3-d was good quality. Movie was entertaining and fun. I like the voices and the characters. Good family movie that brings back memories of video games when I was a kid. I would recommend it for anyone.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Great movie, acting and loved the scenery!! We watched this after coming home from Kauai and it made us want to go back.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I was not sure which book was the first in this series, but I decided to start here.  I was in love with this book after the first couple pages.  I can't wait to read the others!  I am a fan from now on!  Excellent!
B0040I09RM|5.0|had to keep watching, even through lack of sleep, glad I'm retired. I can sleep in. awesome characters, sure wouldn't want to confront this group
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so good that I couldn't stop reading until the end of the school day, only until I finished reading it I could stop.
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|Your have to buy the premium to have it convert your writing to text.  When you buy that it works.
B0054SMID0|5.0|When a manipulating lawyer gets hired by a manipulating client what can happen?  Watch the Lincoln Lawyer and you'll find out.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is probably for a younger audience - I am 61, but the graphics are excellent, and it has lots of levels of play. The music is good also. I recommend this for ages 6 and older. It might also help younger people to get interested in the history of the Mediterranean Sea. Travelling around the area to solve hidden object puzzles and match jewels is fun!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book to read! Once I started I couldn't put it down.i would have liked a little more fighting in the quarter quell
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds. I think it is the best game in the world. everyone should play angry birds. I &lt;3 (&deg;^&deg;)
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Definitely a Bourne thriller.  Movie was full of excitement and the bike chase towards the end of the movie was outstanding.  Jeremy Renner did an excellent job in his portrayal of Aaron Cross.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|It's a great app! The kids love it!! Definitely worth the price I paid to upgrade! Just like playing the sonic hedgehog game from back in the day!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Best RDP app out there, and the price couldn't be better!  The user experience is smooth and intuitive.  I'm very satisfied!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I just started playing the game, it is addictive but I hate that I must wait for lives, Im not understanding it quite yet, but will it more time.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game is terrible it deleted my park every update and I can't have facebook I am so mad I had a emerald dragon and it disappeared its gone 6 months of work gone motley dragon gone RAINBOW DRAGON GONE the game sucks now I hate the developers the made me addicted then they deleted my account I am furious
B001AW156U|3.0|Pros:<br />- I received 2 joystick grips with this order as well as the triggers. They're great so the rest of this review pertains to the triggers.<br />- It does what it's supposed to. Makes the triggers feel more like triggers.<br /><br />Cons<br />- I had some trouble putting the triggers on my Dualshock 3. Mainly the R2 because of a little piece of extra plastic left over from the mold they used. I trimmed it off carefully and then it was easier, but not much.<br />- They're a little uncomfortable because of the hard plastic, but bearable.
193700788X|5.0|Spoilers included. First let me say that I think it is ridiculous to review a book or rate a book you haven't read.  By all means pan the book if you hate it, but at least read the whole book first. Secondly yes, the ending did make sense.<br /><br /> Charlaine Harris has been very clear in interviews and at book signings, that Sookie would NEVER be a vampire. She has also said more than once that Sookie's dash of  fairy blood would not extend her lifespan past that of an ordinary human. That being the case, a HEA with Eric or any other vampire for that matter, was not going to happen. The breakup conversation between Sookie and Eric was heartbreaking but realistic. They are very different people with different expectations. The end of the romance was inevitable. Does this make me sad? Yes, of course but Sookie wanted a normal life, marriage, kids. And she absolutely did not want to be a vampire and had said so to Eric in the past. I would like to think that they can be friends in the future, much like she and Bill are.<br /><br /> Since Sookie can't be with the regular human, I knew her HEA would have to be with a supernatural creature. She has said that she usually only gets moods or intentions from Weres so I figured that was the endgame.  For a while, I thought it might be Alcide. I never liked the romance with Quinn.  Several books ago, I decided to re read the entire series in succession.  I have actually done this more than once. When I did, things became clear to me that surprised me. When Sookie thought she was going to die, had a great burden, She wished she could see Sam. He was very Important to her. They turn to each other in times of trouble. There were also periodic reminders that they were very attracted to each other. Will their relationship last? Sookie didn't know. But she did say that she would survive either way. I hope she gets her happy ever after but I also love that she is strong enough to stand on her own.<br /><br /> I have loved this series. And I love Charlaine Harris. She is a kind southern lady who was never going to please everyone no matter what she did. With this my favorite book in the series? No, but it did work and I enjoyed my journey with Sookie. As an aside, if becoming a vampire meant that I got to be with Eric forever, sign me up, LOL.
B007XAYKX8|4.0|very good view into the life of sportbike racers, and all that they go through to be the one on top of the podium.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|yes, I too couldnt believe everything that happened here. Its a great background to Game of thrones Season 3 but watch out -theres spoilers...
0671027344|5.0|A book hasn't made me smile so much or cry so often in years. This book is pure and honest and you're almost guaranteed to fall in love with the main character. Absolute must buy for teenagers.
B002716GU8|4.0|This movie made me both sad and angry. The way in which women were treated at that time in history is unbelievable. This is a movie is directed well, the acting is A-1, and experiencing what Christine Collins had to endure while trying to find her son is frustrating and sad. It is a movie that is well worth the rental fee.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Haven't seen the movie yet but heard rave reviews about it so decided that I better read the book first. It was different than any other book I read but not exactly a page turner that I couldn't put down. I recommend reading it.
1401307450|5.0|Tells it like it was...no holds barred...everything is there...it's an experience!!!  If you love the rock and roll scene...a must read!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Arrived on kindle quickly. I was very happy with the delivery speed.I will purchase more electronic books going forward from here on!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I love most of the movie, but I felt some scenes like the puking scene were overdone.  It took away from some of the great comedy in the rest of the movie.  I really enjoyed the dry humor of the commentators.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Arrived on kindle quickly. I was very happy with the delivery speed.I will purchase more electronic books going forward from here on!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I haven't even had a chance to check it out yet. That's how much my 7 year old loves it. :-) He says he loves the power ups and the challenge not to use them if he's doing well. All the different types of birds really gets his imagination going. He also likes to collect the plush birds, so I'm sure these new ones will be next on his list. :-)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|it is so cool I love these things . and that the fact it is supporting the military.  bravo I reaily think that it is awesome and I would want to write more but I cant discribe how awesome of words to say
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  It was a beautiful and haunting love story with a touch of thriller.  Great flick!
125000098X|5.0|I love Jeffrey Archer books, this one should be the last one of The Clifton Chronicles, but I am hoping there will be more. Very good and I can not put the book down.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Great special effects. No character development. Meant for kids who like lots of explosions and fireworks. Probably made with foreign audiences in mind.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I love Dr. Who! The series is great for everyone in my family . No need to worry about bad behavior, and it's very interesting stuff. Anyone new tot he program need not worry, they catch you up pretty fast.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was  a wonderful book. I really enjoyed it. Definitely pulls at the heart strings. The arthur has a way of putting you in the shoes of the characters.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|New to his music. I wish more rap artist were as creative. Songs don't rely on the usual rap cliché. Can't Hold Us is a typical radio hit, but songs like Thrift Shop pokes fun at the fashion police world. Same Love makes the case for a civil rights issue. Jimmy lovine talks about what I knew for a long time, the record industry is BULLSH**
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Only liked 2 songs, no, would not recommend to anyone else, unless you are a JT crazy fan.  Bringing Sexy Back, was the best.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This was a good book. But it was a little aggravating and confused me just a bit with the way it jumps around. Overall a good story.  I'm glad Sookie ended up with who she did its who I thought she should be with all along.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|Surprisingly boring. I was expecting a story line too...the dancing was fun but not worth the price of purchase. Boo !
B008602KQI|2.0|Too much violence.<br />The hi tech sci-fi world versus still slavery of districts are two contrast combinations<br />Just a replica of old roman time movies with gladiator etl being redone with science fiction<br /><br />Fundamentally the Idea of killing for survival in PG13 does not sound appropraite...<br />If it is something like fighting and killing aliens or other fictional characters to protect humans some what goes ok, but idea of humans killing humans makes it uncomfortable to watch<br /><br />--Deepak
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I bought this when the facebook app I had been using stopped working, but this app worked great and I like using it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|really intense season... really digging this show. The change in cast is refreshing and surprises at every turn. I would recommend this season... to anyone looking to watch it all...
B000J1AGQI|5.0|I love war movies, and this has always been one of my favorites. I love Mel Gilbson in this movie, plus I love Sgt Major Plummly, he is awesome, and brings so levity to a very serious movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|As a N64 Goldeneye Fan I can appreciate a good BOND movie. However this was the movie I was waiting on. It tied all of the loose ends to the previous movies and was awesome to watch
B006SV2LWA|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, although I have to say it's scary to think about what can happen when a contagion gets out, but it was well acted and I enjoyed the movie.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This was a good movie that had a slightly creepy ending. I enjoyed it. Never really heard much about this movie until I watched it and I am glad that I did
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My favorite series by far...and being able to watch with no commercials is so awesome.  Am watching Season 2 now.
1455502758|5.0|Very interesting read. Christopher Hitchens lived his life on his own terms through to the end. He gave it his best shot combating his illness and continued writing honestly without pity through it all. I hadn't read much Hitchens until I picked up Hitch-22. I always considered him a little too arrogant. But that was just him, probably a result of going off to boarding school at the age of 8. Some compensating defenses naturally arise. Now, I much admire his intellect and dedication (and hard work) to what he considered the truth.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Terrible instructions. Hard to use. Just don't like it. Attempted to obtain free eboom and this program was required.  Sorry
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Violins make everything better. and dubstep is already good, but adding a talented, sexy violinist is just amazing. buy the album, then buy all of her videos. she's that amazing.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I expected to not like it and while it wasn't the same movie the did a good job, I really enjoyed it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was the perfect ending to the hunger games.  Kept my interesst and one of those books you just can't put down!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Another great installment in the series! The eventful story of two lovers filled with action. I have recommended this book to many people.
B00C32REYI|4.0|It's not as good as his previous album but I'm sure I will quickly warm up to it. I'd recommend it.
086547897X|5.0|I am an animation student at a community college, so you can take this with a grain of salt. There are a lot of guides and texts, things for dummies and whatnot, and there's always new and exciting engines online; however, this tool is masterfully organized by the best of the best and is really meant to teach the basics in a reasonable way. It has all the basics and even advanced techniques. Probably not a straight read, as are most texts, but if you're looking for a good foundation, I can't recommend anything more important than this book.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|A great movie sure can use some great music like this. Dawn is one of my favorite compositions in the world.
B005GUQIDC|5.0|I don't often go out and buy CD's, but for Kimbra's I really wanted a hard copy. Her song \\"Cameo Lover\\" was the one that really pulled me in, but after listening to the whole album, it was really a fantastic buy. Completely worth. Also I just really like that cover...body art is amazing to me.
0470932139|5.0|Taking pictures and setting up a \\"scene\\" comes more naturally to some than others. This book is quite helpful for both camps. My husband taught me that using a camera is all about the light. Helen does an excellent job in describing how to manipulate light. I used to shoot food pics with artificial light at night when the household was asleep, but am a total convert to using natural light now, even in the midst of children running around. Helen's photos within the book are on-point for her explanations, and pretty too. The book is excellent for a beginner and a good review for the experienced food photographer, especially as there are not many photography books devoted to just food. In the end, you've just got to get the camera out and take pics.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I downloaded this app to my kindle but haven't use it yet , but I'm sure that I'm going to love it !
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The story continues at a great pace with the characters so realistic and powerful so hard to put this book down!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Most of Woody Allen's recent movies have been lots of fun.  This one has a very strange twist to it and Owen Wilson does a great job.
B005DWBO0K|4.0|I am not often captivated by silent films, especially when I know part of the story.  Nosferatu's music and acting did it for me
0385349947|5.0|Lean In certainly lived up to the hype. As a female executive who juggles work, four children and a good marriage I found it encouraging. It relieved a number of the \\"imposter syndrome\\" concerns I have as a successful woman and has given me an extra does of courage to protect my personal life while leaning in for more in my professional life.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Very clever strategy game. Just started playing this afternoon and it's now 2 hours past bedtime, and I haven't stopped to eat yet !!! Previous reviews made me a little skeptical, but whatever the problems were, they must be fixed. Tutorial is simple, but game gets progressively more interesting and thought provoking. Hope you enjoy it like I am !!!
B000MV9026|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a Senior Seminar in Biblical and Theological Studies class and it was AWESOME! I watched the movie three (3X) already and each time I watch I get more insight.
B00CHILW64|5.0|My whole family was on the edge of our seats for this one. To think that this story was based on true accounts was very unbelievable. Shows the human spirit and how people can rise up when faced with massive adversity
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Before I finally bought this treasure a few weeks ago, whatever I would be doing, whenever \\"The World at War\\" came on television and I was in earshot, I'd stop, and watch, and listen.  I have hesitated to review it up to now, because I did not think myself possessed of sufficiently exalted speech to praise this remarkably powerful, epic storytelling of World War II; however, I simply have to say something:  When this gem from the '70s was produced, there should have been a new word created for \\"documentary\\" -- perhaps even for \\"masterpiece.\\"  Every lover of history should acquire this landmark opus.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Had the kids watch it for the first time, and they loved it too.  They asked if all the stuff was real (mostly the Bubba Gump shrimp of course!).
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Seen the movie at the theatre when it came out.  It was the best movie I had seen last year.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on video.  Great movie, awesome cast!!  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were incredible in this movie along with an  ensemble of other great actors.  Highly recommended!!
B004BRQYJ4|3.0|I really wanted to like this album more. I think Christina is a very talented singer and always enjoy her renditions; however, with that being said ... the songs just don't grab me enough. I think I like 2 out of the whole album.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting and compelling; if you are a believer, it'll help you understand what<br />heaven and hell may really be like, (never heard it explained this way before).  If you<br />are searching for the meaning of life or what life is supposed to be about, you should<br />read this book, it's a good place to start. If you are an intellectual and not a believer,<br />you'll still find it interesting and it may change your life. Very easy, fast read.
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|I have no insight into how well this album will age, but I can't stop listening to it.  Especially &#34;Terror In The Canyon&#34;.  Also, I love the cover.  Very on the road, rock and roll imagery.  Love it.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Better than Game of Thrones, more fighting less standing around pontificating. Also the story line seems to actually be based of true historical events.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Classic  Quentin! Runs a little longer than I'd like but was pure entertainment through and through. Most definitely would recommend.
B00701QTOI|5.0|Stunning guitar work as usual! Joe just keeps his amazing ability to create what I call, &#34;Speeding Ticket Music&#34;. 5 stars.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I found the episode that I watched to  be very entertaining, well written, and laid a good foundation for the upcoming episodes.  I  looking forward to seeing more.
0920236251|2.0|Why on earth was the LACK of SIZE not mentioned for this&#34;new paperback&#34; item!?? I imagine a standard picture book size when I order &#34;paperback.&#34; This book measures 2.5 inches square. Really????
B007N6EUHI|4.0|This  app has helped me in my anatomy class greatly since I purchased it. I highly recommend it to people that have an Anatomy lab they are studying for. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it falls short in some  small areas like what specific structures of the bones and organs are. I still highly recommend this for people with an Anatomy lab.
0307595579|4.0|This is my opinion on the book set itself not the text.<br />The highly successful novels have been reviewed times beyond count.<br />I am giving this &#34;deluxe&#34; boxed set 4 stars, and only because its the only option out there. Just out of gratitude that there is a better-than-trade option available at all.<br />That being said this edition is not really that much better than the trade edition of the books. The spine and paper are the same. The only notable difference is the cloth binding, and not very notable at that.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I've heard so much about the series and finally had the opportunity to see it. Great series, a lot twists and turns and bad guys.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is a wonderfully game . Works great on my kindle fire HD . I love it! My daughter and I play it everyday
B000NMW6M0|5.0|Suspenseful and captivating, with a splash of love story! I Highly recommend this movie to everyone! its a must see!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Women are responsible for leaning in.<br />We need to be leaders in our world and set the table at the top for equality.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I'm eagerly waiting for the Season 4 on DVD.  All actors give a great performance as always.  If you don't have cable like me, I'd recommend this episode for any fan of NCIS: Los Angeles.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great ending to the series.  I'm selfish, I didn't want it to end. The book is full of surprises and twists and turns that end up neatly wrapped. While many are dismayed at the ending I say those readers are selfish in wanting their guy to win.  The only one who matters is Sookie and in my estimation she's finally won.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Exciting flick : imaginative plot. Make sure you are not too hypertensive. Wonder if these type of operatives are reality- based?
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|For having two great actors Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crow, this movie was very slow and boring. Even the dialog was predictable. This is one that I would safe your money and wait for it to be on cable. I'm sure it won't be a long wait.
B000MDFTIS|5.0|hello<br /> the movie is fantastic!! right from the start, top notch action,nonstop. all the excitement you expect and more from a james bond film!! very well written, great plot, great finish, very emotional, if you don't feel it you don't have any!! but this is a step above the standard James Bond. Daniel Craig, wonderful job!!!!!!!!!  thanks  Tim
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I fell in love.  It was unexpectedly great!  Super funny and the songs are catchy. Great cast and it's easy to understand how this little movie did so well.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Good story line-interesting characters-totally believable-funny in parts-really enjoyed it.Would recommend it to others mainly female. Not really a  man&#34;s book
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|It's my favorite comedy (after Friends) and I have watched multiple times.  This show makes me happy.  If I am feeling down, I can watch an episode and feel better in 24 minutes.  Well, usually, in 5.  The cast has great chemistry and while I knew who Zooey was prior to this, the rest of the cast was unknown. Well, except for Max Greenfield.  I remembered him from Veronica Mars. Consistently hilarious.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for those who believe in something greater than themselves.<br />I loved this movie, it restored my faith in the other life!<br />Cheyenne Starhawk
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The story telling aspect draws you in.  For me what kept me there was to see the story come full circle back to the &#34;60 years later&#34; where it started.  That did not happen.  I am sure more of the story is in the works, just not sure I want to indulge in the constant crisis after crisis to see the outcome......or not.
B005NWUSOI|5.0|This is when ADTR was a bit heavier, their musical style is also a bit simpler as well but all in all it is a great album.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I knew President Lincoln was our first Republican President and I knew he fought fiercely to free the slaves.  What I did not know was how hard the Democratic Party fought to stop him and their arguments against freeing them.  This was a defining moment in American History.  The movie is excellently done and well worth the watching for all.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I like the revolving feature and the 'sleep' feature is great. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I'm glad I shopped around.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved all the books in this series.  Now he has to write the next book so I'll know what happens to everyone.  The books are so much better than the TV show.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I cant believe the writer ended it the way she did. Could have deleted half the books and saved time. Very unhappy
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It was getting bad reviews but my wife and I loved it! Best movie I've seen all year! Watch and enjoy!
B005XBKXV2|5.0|For being such an old movie I love this. Every time I watch the lion king I cry. This is a movie for both young and old
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Definitely the best season yet. Loved it. Really enjoyed. If you're a TWD fan it's worth the buy on Amazon Instant Video.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a series that my kids love and this is a great book for your kid.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was a huge fan of this series. Even through the last two books, which weren't great. This book was not only boring and frustrating, it ended the series in a really weird way. The love story that was built up for ten books was thrown away and replaced with something different, with almost no build up. I'm totally disappointed and will never read another Charlaine Harris book.
1616550414|4.0|ok the product was 95%, but it like awesome very nice stuff highly recomended for those who are true fans !!!
B004JRVQX0|4.0|iLok is required for authorizing lots of music software. It's a bit expensive, especially with the &#34;no downtime&#34; insurance, but as someone who has been on the road and needed to replace in an emergency, it's worth it.  Also good for using your plugins or software at another studio that may not have the same set.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It's a fun game and I think fairly well implemented. Sometimes the games seem to go rather quickly, but that's probably just my preference. Maybe I need to choose a more difficult level! All in all, I would install it again and I play it rather often so far.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not a big reader of science fiction, but this novel not only captures one's imagination of science and the future but of human dreams, frailties, limitations and comprehension. Whether you are ten years old or dizzy, this book will fascinate you.
B0097K21YW|3.0|The graphics in this game are eye-catching and the ballistics fun to experiment with, but after a while the game just became target practice.<br /><br />As the player you control a plump, green Godzilla like monster that spits out fireball projectiles.  Using your finger to swipe, you change the arc and flight path of the projectiles so they land on buildings, nuclear reactors, and other such targets.  The level is complete when all the targets are destroyed.<br /><br />The game was fun for a while, but after a few levels it just became repetitive.  The layout of the buildings change, but the ballistics stay the same.  The game has no sense of urgency, Godzilla just sits there lobbing bomb after bomb at the defensless buildings.  The game needs some kind of counter attack from the cities to add some excitement to the play.<br /><br />So a good game, but needs more action to make it great.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|My only problem with this movie is that it is too long.  It is a five star movie that needed 30 minutes cut off of it.  I also have to admit that my favorite &#34;contact&#34; movie is The Arrival, a lower budget one with Charlie Sheen.  But this is still a good movie.  The use of the sitting president and staff members was over the top.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|fun to hear about life inside tech world and book store.  Lots of action and unexpected endings.  Character<br /> development was so so.
B001ERN1HC|5.0|An excellent example of every dive I've ever played bass in. Not only has the piano been drinking, so has everyone else in the joint. And the pay could be better.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Still not my absolute favorite, but still a great read as Pendergast gives in ( if only shortly) to a grave depression, only to come back for a few more sick and twisted adventures.
030758836X|5.0|Loved it; it hooks you from the get-go. Witty and so clever. One of the reasons a book can be so wonderful....the great escape!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Already hooked on Smiley, I was surprised to pick up this novel to discover that old George plays only a peripheral role in the plot. Yet somehow this device works brilliantly. It is as if Le Carre is taking us on a tour of Smiley's world through the eyes, trials, and actions of the people in his orbit. In the process, the story unfolds into a minor epic that encapsulates both the opportunistic triumphs and heartbreaking failures that seem much more real than Flemming's best-written Bond stories.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The series is very bloody.  That being said, the storyline and acting is first rate.  This show is not for everyone because of the violence.  I found myself turning away from the many violent scenes.  I'm almost finished with season 3 and can't wait to season 4
B004BCT2HU|5.0|David's music is appealing to all ages with his modern approach to classical music.  He inspires a younger audience to enjoy the classics such as Bethoven's 5th.
193700788X|5.0|A truly delightful series.  I adored all of the characters and will miss reading about them.  I want to thank Ms. Harris for creating this series and for the long joyful ride.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|A gifted performer who takes a classical piece of music and makes his own.  His style and arrangements are his trade mark.  High recommend.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is such a good book. It also needs to be made into a movie. Dan Brown is a fascinating storyteller and I can't wait to start reading Inferno.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Breathtaking and eye opening! Can change the way you look at the world. One to cherish. We will watch this periodically just to reinforce how previous life is!
193700788X|5.0|After reading the other reviews I was totally prepared to hate this book, but after reading it myself I was very pleased with the way Ms. Harris wove everything together to bring an end to the series. I was hoping that Sookie and Eric would end up together but it was so well written that I find myself pleased with the ending she chose. I'm sorry that it has finally ended but have great hopes that Ms. Harris will come up with another series that we will like just as much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the characters, love the story lines. Totally want that gas lamp that is in the opening credits. Beautiful set. Can't wait until season 4 comes to the states!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My kids love this movie. Very entertaining. Very funny. Saw it in 3D at the theater. Awesome. Highly recommend for the family collection.
B009EE4630|5.0|Watched this movie after seeing the stage adaptation. It was very good. Mellow slice of life. Great performances. Not as tragic as the stage play.
B00899F0G8|5.0|PLL Season 3 is AMAZING! So suspenseful...can't stop watching!  Plus, I love being able to watch these on my Smart TV! Amazon Instant Video is great! It stores all the episodes for me, and I can watch them anywhere, anytime!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I have enjoyed the twists in the Dexter series and this season is even better. I hope the series never ends.
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|I have always loved this band and their work. 20 songs in one album? A must buy! Really a staple of any metalheads collection.
B009B1EOZ6|4.0|I choose this rating becuase the envelop inside cover comes broke, anyway I love this record, and i have to get it !!!!!! It's Alive in my country....!!!!!
034580404X|4.0|Great erotic romance. If your just getting into BDSM then this book is for you it's light enough not to scare you ( like the Anne rice beauty series) but light enough for you to search out more:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb I am sooooooo addicted to it if I could play it all the time I would definitley get it
B006LSZECO|3.0|If your in the mood for a good whodunit and a light read, this is the book for you.  It reminds me of a good Lifetime movie.  It has a nice complex plot; however, I found both the main characters very unlikeable.  An easy, fun read!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Had some nice twists and turns, a couple of good snickers.  Should have brushed up on some of the previous books, as a lot of former characters made an appearance.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I worry that women will get stuck carrying the whole load. . .Parenting is a super primary job! Effective results produces people who will give back to humankind and to our community. I fear some women are being seduced into believing that careers outside the home are so much more important  than effective parenting and home management. (They are now even able to freeze their eggs so they can still do it all. . .)
B008F9T76Q|5.0|He really  liked these series of books.  He read all of these for his sophmore reading requirements for cp english course.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down!  I liked the way each chapter reflected the main character's thoughts and perspectives.  The characters held my interest throughout the book which was filled with many unexpected twists.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It took awhile to get used to the accent that was spoken, and it was hard to understand at first.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I was very happy with the DVD collection, but the music box doesn't function properly. I'm sure I will enjoy watching the DVD and reading the literature that came with it. The book is full of pictures and information about the real Trapp family. It is also filled with pictures and information about the movie and play. Really enjoyable.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|It is great to be able to watch my favorite characters anytime, anywhere! I watch it all the time both at home and on my Kindle.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Loved the first book so much I couldn't put it down. I am attached to the characters but didn't think there was enough information to move the story along.  Still can't wait for the third.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums I have ever listened to.  I can't believe it took me so long to finally order it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|A great app for those who want to read books on tablets, easy to understand. Works very well on my tablet.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This dvd is one of the best dvd's to own. Has all the important songs and sound and video are excellent and this is the one to own.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A good review of an intelligent and far-sighted man who all had knowledge of. Many interesting and exciting innovations that can help us in everyday life.
0156012197|5.0|I sent it as a gift to a friend because i think its an amazing little book :) he loved it too..
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The reviews speak for themselves and there is not much more I can add. This mini-series is my ultimate favorite and let me say that it is not only for the ladies but men would like it as well. The men in my life really liked it and actually said that they would watch it again. They all said that they would love to have Mr. Thorntons accent. It would help them in drawing in dates. I love costume dramas and my collection is vast...THIS IS MY NUMBER 1! Yes, even befor P&P and Jane Eyre.<br />Watch it and you WILL agree.<br /><br />UPDATE: Like most, I did not want this storyline of this mini series to end and I just got done reading one of the many continuations of the story that has been written. There was so many to choose from and can say I made the right pick. I am in the process of writing a review for this continuation and will post it soon but it takes off from where the mini series left off--on the train with John and Margaret. IT IS SO GOOD! You can see the actors clearly continuing their story. The continuation is called John & Margaret: Coming Home With Me by M. J. Schrauben. I went to Smashwords and downloaded from that site in pdf(cheaper) but I loved it so much, I came back to see how much it would cost me to order in print (I will wait until it comes down in price). Don't listen to the review which says it is disgusting and has explicit scenes. UNTRUE and a obviously a troll! I am going to read some of the onther continuations but this one is going to be hard to top.<br /><br />I recommend you watch this mini series and right after, pick up this book. Their story continues in Ms. Schrauben's book and it is just beautifully done. She loves these characters just as much as hundreds of others and stays true to the actors who played these roles. Yes ladies, you clearly hear Richard A. voice and see his actions in this continuation.  Make a day of it, buy this DVD, watch it straight thru and read the rest of the story in this book. You will do what I did, smile and sigh contently.le and sigh contently.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it. Sorry I took so long to finally at it to my video collection!
B004GYY714|5.0|it's great and easy to use. it should have the major sport team radio broadcasts for those following the games.
B00005NKK8|5.0|I had forgotten what great music Forrest Gump had - Even if you don't like all the songs on the CD, it great to have them in your music library.  I highly recommend.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Incredible music, thoughtful and produced with love. The song 'Same Love' brought tears to my eyes; its a powerful song.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|You can't help but find a soft spot in your heart for the main character. The ending will make you go &#34;Aaahhh&#34;.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is awesome.The negative reviews are lying.You NEED to get this thing.This is the most fun you will ever have
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed how the first half of the book started but then events got to be a little unbelievable.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|My husband and I found it entertaining.  It was worth the cost and a couple hours of entertainment. Sean Penn was fantastic and I am fond of Ryan Gosling!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great characters and stories. Bought season one on a whim, the rest I bought soon after. The quality of the videos are great just from watching through the ps3.
0143036424|4.0|The character development is very good and the interaction between several of the characters is very amusing. Overall a nice escape from reality for one evening.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|It combines a good premise (Serial Killer with a &#34;code&#34; of conduct), humor, suspense, drama, action, good plots (so far) and good acting (no weird first season glitches in character).
B00ABO573A|2.0|Two guys in a relationship; one and independent movie director, the other an attorney addicted to crack cocaine.  It was very depressing to see the director keep trying to save a dead relationship, the addict just would not stop.  The movie kept circling around the trying and failing until the movie was over.  I thought it was boring and I sure wouldn't have put up with lovers addition for over 16 years.  Both were addicted to sex hookups,like Manhunt.  Just a worthless movie and representation of the gay community.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|I love this film. Leslie Mann is terrific as always. Reminded me of myself! See it and you will laugh a lot!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The first book of The Maze Runner Trilogy is absolutely riveting.  Although it is advertised as a young adult novel, it is certainly appealing to anyone who loves adventure and excitement.  It is very well written and holds your interest from beginning to end.  Have already started the next book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting and well-written book! I enjoy to discover how elite soldiers are working and dealing with war, death and life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What's to say, just an awesome show with great characters and zombies.<br />It seems to be diverting from the comic somewhat with the death of Andrea.<br />Will be interesting to see where they go from here.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Fun read. The novel is written as a series of interviews with the survivors of the future 'Zombie Wars' during which those who were 'turned' by the mysterious illness are fought off by the humans.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful, relaxing and fun....my five year old loves this Disney world- big sis would enjoy it too if she could get the Kindle from us.  Don't get me wrong it's a game that is trying to make money- not easy to get pearls etc.  However, if you love the ocean, are intrigued by sea life and dream/or of scuba diving this is a hard to put down, smile inducing, peaceful escape.

B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|great game! pretty sure most people will like this game! I played it on my friends ipod and it rocks! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This shows rocks! It has all the action, horror, thrills, emotions, that a show can have!  I hope there will be many more seasons to come!!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|The movie was fun to watch, had some great action scenes, and funny parts.  The product placement is pretty hard to egregious, but the rest of the movie was good enough I could put up with it.
193700788X|4.0|So I want to start that I DID like this book, throughout most of it, I was actually enjoying myself immensely. It was a bit different, & I liked how she handled the mixed feelings that Eric was causing. She also had that little insightful chat with Eric about their future that they REALLY should have discussed a while ago. I also love Sam, and knew Eric was rather self-serving. I've always liked Sam; he's really laid back most of the time, & he's been a great friend to Sookie. I think that was my problem though. Friend.<br /><br />****SPOILERS**** (not that many don't know)<br /><br />My biggest issue I think was that there was not great \\"Ah-HA\\" moment with Sookie. She seemed to always be in \\"friend mode\\" with Sam, and although she would briefly note how good he looked, that was about it. When Sam came out with his feelings, it was rather anti-climatic. And even afterwards, there was a serious lack of OOMPH. It was kinda like she was just going through the motions. Even the \\"heated\\" sex scene was very blah. Which made me kinda sad, b/c I do love Sam, and was rooting for him for a while.<br /><br />The other issue I had was the wrap up of everyone trying to kill her. And not even that they were trying to kill her, but that it happened to all happen at the same time. And Claude. Really? Claude? And the reason his \\"friends\\" who were SO SCARED of him, turned on him? *Sigh* Oh well.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the book, & am glad that Sookie has grown comfortable with herself, and is finally able to not worry about money or vampires considering everything she's gone through in the past years.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved the book when I first read it, and the movie certainly does it justice.  Great acting all around, and the scenes really capture the feeling of being an awkward teen not willing to give up on having a social life.  Watching this movie brought back all kinds of memories, good and bad, from my life, as well as memories of reading the book at better times.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Once you start watching it becomes impossible to not want to watch just or more tonight.  Next thing you know it is 3am
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The investigation Started ok then for a few did not make any sense, Overall it was a great picture. Cruise always brings the A game with him.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|This Movie Was Very Good. It definitely had you engaged in the movie wanted to know what would happen next
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|This game reminds me of the classic &#34;RC indoor helicopter adventure&#34;. Very fun and easy enough for anyone to play.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|At first, I wasn't quite sure about this book - I was having trouble sinking into the feel of it. However, as it went on, I really began to enjoy the twists and turns and jumps back and forth through time. Very pleasurable read!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Best place to buy music and stream your collection to other devices. I feel the easiest service for downloading all my purchases to all my devices including roku.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|This was not a very good book.  It was very weird in parts and predictable.  The movie was much better.
B00BZOD63S|4.0|You probably already know how mixed the reviews have been for the oddly named \\"Mama\\". However, like most movie addicts although I love reading reviews they never dictate to me whether to see or not see a film that's caught my interest.<br /><br />As a marketing ploy, instead of a tag line or knock out review - the movie poster itself as well as all advertising for \\"Mama\\" features the huge message \\" From The Creator Of Pans Labyrinth\\"<br /><br />Key word \\"Creator\\" not director. So of course it would be a mistake going in to expect the sheer brilliance of the modern day classic Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro. That said as he served as executive producer, Director Andre' Muschietti paints his own style with excellent production values and a definitive \\"creepiness\\" that makes \\"Mama\\" stand out visually as an American Gothic style ghost story.<br /><br />You won't find a \\"Horror\\" movie here, not in the sense of scaring your socks off. The script albeit fractured via hard to connect time frames - still delivers both excellent performances and genuine chills.<br /><br />Is the film flawed? definitely but then few aren't.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" has a unique look, superb production values and authentic and at times deeply disturbing images. Jessica Chastain is stellar as the lead character \\"Annabel\\" and the children, those two little girls are quite exceptional for ones so young.<br /><br />Frightening in the beginning, they steal your heart an we root for them, the effects be they automations or CGI are used sparingly and well - these moments, glimmer with an eerie and chilling suspense and the few true scares Mama delivers are impressive.<br /><br />Violence and bloodshed are less than minimal - hence the PG-13 rating, but make no mistake this is a film for adults. And not to give anything away, but the ending, that final scene does indeed make up for when the film drags or is fractured along the way to it's final destination - and that's good movie making.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.hly Recommended.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This show has everything; drama, action, comedy and horror. It's so entertaining and thrilling! Full of popular actors and award winning costume!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Everything is great the only problem is it takes WAY to much money to get the suits but its fine otherwise
0525953590|5.0|An easy reading book on a complex subject, technically informative, yet interesting.<br /><br />Highlighting the history, evolution and success of the search for new sub atomic particles, this is your gateway to the incredible world of the Higgs Boson discoveries at the LHC.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Took me a second to figure it out.. but very easy and I have had no problems. I will recommend this app if you use Ebay you need this App
0764141201|5.0|I've been involved in recommending the purchase of this book for several of my tutoring students, and they have all been pleased with its content and the lessons and reviews.  With its fifty lessons it is difficult to get through, but I have one student who has had enough hours with me so that we are approaching the end of the book.<br /><br />For anyone interested in working with phrasal verbs I heartily suggest you use this book.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|This movie looked great, had a nice story, but then at the end went really weird. I don't appreciate \\"family\\" movies that have a weird twisted finish to them. My opinion.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have bought many apps for alarm clocks and none have had the customizable options and the pure simpleness of this one.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is amazing in itself. I think it was really well done and can hardly wait to see the new one coming out here soon.
B00000JG41|1.0|all popular/secular music is of the devil. repent now for the kingdom of God is at hand. praise the LORD
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|When I first saw the preview for this movie I was a little skeptical about it and didn't think it would be any good. I could have never been so wrong! The moment my family and I first started watching it we fell in love. For anyone who has ever played the classic video games or loves video games ingeneral will surely love this movie. My family has watched this movie a thousand times and are still watching it. You will not regret buying this.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I really enjoy this album. It is not my favorite, I had to listen to the album a couple of times before I fell in love with it, but I do love it now. I am very glad that I bought it. Great purchase.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love the Kindle App for my Samsung Skyrocket phone and Samsung Tablet!  Easy sync between devices and convenient to always have my reading material handy.
B001THZAAI|5.0|This was a gift and enjoyed by all who watched. The story is indeed funny.  The relationship of the wife, husband and family life is unifying and amazingly solid in a humorous way.  The humor is about France culture:  the north versus the south and, of course, about family and friends.<br /><br />The one aspect I did not expect was that in the North the French accent is quite different.  For one that is just learning French, this accent, exaggerated, makes it more difficult to pick up.  The objective in buying this movie was to practice listening to French.  The movie was so funny that we did not even care if the listening aspect was a bit difficult.
B00471JSR4|3.0|If you like special effects and action movie this is the one. It is good definitely would recomend this.i am looking forward to the 2nd one out soon on dvd
B00908DDZM|5.0|Not usually my kind of music but I really enjoyed this cd. It is definitely not your typical so gas about drugs sex and women.
B003XURDAY|5.0|This is a great movie. I would recomend reading the book first ( do electric sheep dream ) I think this is the book title.i read it a long time ago.Out standing cast.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!! There are no glitches and the horses are soooo sweet. The horseis the best horse ever. When is there going to be another game related to this?
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Had to do an assignment for class and had to rent this movie to watch. overall good movie and would watch more of Kenneth Branagh's films!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The current day events were believable and the historical events were moving.  Loved this book. I have recommended it to everyone I know who enjoys a good story.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|The acting was mediocre at best, which was disappointing because I think that Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling are all relatively good actors. Granted the script didn't give them much to work with but I nevertheless expected more from all three. The story line was extremely predictable and ultimately kind of boring. Judged even as just a &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; action movie it was still really unimpressive and not all that entertaining. I would skip this one.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I LOVE THIS! Back to Black and  Young and Beautiful are my two favs - Baz does it again!<br /><br />Too bad Jay-Z's $100 Bill sucks...but that is expected.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Loved this movie. Absolutely amazing story that captures your attention and keeps you emotionally attached to the characters (yes there was more than one) all the way through the movie. The film is a bit abstract at times so don't expect to take everything literally. I have a few friends who didn't like this film but I personally loved it and would have voted it best picture over Argo.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Game is pretty good. Would like to play a few more levels before you have to actually purchase the game.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Great acting and a great story. We all knew how it was going to turn out but that didn't prevent it from being an excited ride. I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|The film was certainly disturbing and should be used in the classroom as an example of the devistation that comes from abusing drugs!  I was initially attracted to the film because of Ellen Burstyn and the fact that I grew up in Manhattan Beach and was familiar with Coney Island and Brighton Beach.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Can't stay out of Facebook, it's always something to do. You can play games, communicate with family and friend, advertise, join support groups, meet new friends and so much more.

B000PC6A3E|3.0|Yep, late to the party but I just got this Blu Ray at Best Buy for a $5.00 trade in as it wasn't my favorite film to begin with.  Everyone else has already discussed the storyline, its relevance to the comic book and comments on acting.  I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />The video transfer is very clean as there are no artifacts, distracting grain or stair stepping as one might see in the wide angle shots of Gotham itself.  The color grading is rather cool with a slight bluish tinge.  That said, I do not think there was any remastering done before the video was transcoded from Standard Def to Blu Ray.  The Mbps rate is surprisingly low, averaging in the low teens.  The colors, beyond the grading, are softly presented as is the whole film.  The colors on the cover of the disc pop more than they do in the movie.<br /><br />The audio transfer is Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless and the audio does make a great amount of action for your surround speakers front, back and sides.  There is plenty of discreet channeling throughout the film which I look for and love to hear.  That said, the audio track is the first lossless audio I have heard that sounded somewhat muted to me.  Not really sure why.  The dialogue is easy to discern and all the volume levels are spot on so you won't have to roller coaster your remote's volume control,  so I have no complaints in that area.  Never the less, the audio still sounded veiled to me and I have very transparent sounding, hi end speakers with excellent transient response.  Your LFE channel will certainly get a workout throughout the film so be sure to have your sub properly set.<br /><br />Some decent extras as well, including an MTV parody with Jimmy Fallon and a Making Of documentary divided into many parts covering story boards, stunts, costume design etc.  More and more companies are doing this now for DVDs and Blu Rays, making one 'making of' documentary and dividing them up in parts with different titles so you think you are getting more than you really are.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.itles so you think you are getting more than you really are.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Very quirky and gently funny. It reminded me a bit of Spike Milligan whom I love. Thoroughly enjoyed it! would totally recommend
B00BF11STU|4.0|It was quite intriguing to see the 'underbelly' of the CIA... and that, of course, brings up the debate about what is acceptable when it comes to keeping us safe? I the 'enhanced interrogation' methods depicted in the film were clearly 'lite' versions of what was really done at the time - - but there is just no arguing that these methods produced results. So, there again comes the debate.<br /><br />I also found Jessica Chastain portrayal of the gutsy, yet abrasive female CIA agent to be empty and very doe-eyed, almost timid at times, instead of the powerful and confident analyst whose decade of hard work and persistence eventually convinced a stodgy, slow-moving agency to engage in an unheard-of and extremely risky undertaking based almost solely on the strength of her conviction. This extraordinary analyst deserves a stronger, more dedicated and more magnetic portrayal.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good flick, though with the watering-down of the Chastain character and the hurried preparation of the Seal teams, the story lost much of the impact it could and should have had.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|I liked the way the author used the diary to tell the story. A good twist at the end too
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George Martin's series are rivoting and have surprising twists.  I stay up way too late reading his books and love his style of writing.
B002GLWMK2|5.0|Still not sure what's happening in the beginning.. I'm sure there is some symbology to lopping off a head followed by a fountain of psychedelic blood  that escapes me, (a little more Monty Python than grand master wizard of guitar) but hey its the whole weird British 70's aesthetic played to perfection.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|The book was very sad but I would read the book again.otherwise I loved the book a lot .it is still a sad book
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Isn't it wild when a movie seems to have the same idea you've had for years?<br /><br />Look at parents in the world today. What competitive advantage will any parent<br />deny their child? What disadvantage will any parent willfully inflict on their<br />child?<br /><br />Now imagine that every parent has the power to choose which part of their genes<br />are passed along at conception. How many people would walk away from that power?<br />How many people would choose less than the best for their child?<br /><br />Gattaca is a blueprint for how genetic engineering could spread like wildfire<br />throughout a society.<br /><br />What is more powerful in a society than parenthood? Government perhaps?<br /><br />Consider the health care situation today. Is it sustainable? Now consider how<br />to change it. There is an old idea called \\"the hoof and mouth cure.\\" It goes<br />like this:<br /> \\"If there are no hooves, and there are no mouths, then there is no<br /> hoof-and-mouth disease.\\"<br />Would any government pass up the opportunity to eliminate health care problems<br />at conception? Imagine what could be done with the billions, the trillions, of<br />dollars saved.<br /><br />This is just the starting premise for Gattaca. I don't like to write spoilers,<br />so let me just say that the above \\"Utopia\\" has all the flaws we'd expect from<br />our own experience. There are no perfect people in this movie, not even close.<br />Neither are the science nor the government perfect: they're just groups of<br />imperfect people.<br /><br />Beyond that, Gattaca is a great example of a \\"science fiction\\" movie where the<br />science, and the special effects, dwindle into the background. This is not a<br />mega-budget CGE movie. Its a people movie.<br /><br />Again, consider the degree of competitiveness today. Now imagine a world where<br />every person has the full power of reproductive science backing their individual<br />goals.<br /><br />A more level playing field meansthat the small errors become more critical.<br />More focus is required. More self-monitoring. Less subconscious or impulsive<br />communication. Actions, even insults, must be limited to serve the person's<br />strategic goals. People have to be at their best, all the time. Social failure<br />is as fatal as work failure.<br /><br />That's where the acting comes in. All the actors here are a part of this new<br />world, this new way of socializing and competing. There are no weak links in<br />the acting in this movie. The audience is left wondering about every character.<br />What is going thru this person's mind? These characters are all fully developed<br />individuals, and their words and actions, no matter how eloquent or direct, are<br />only part of that individual. The level of detail and nuance in the acting here<br />is deep.<br /><br />Gattaca is one of the most thoughful movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />Its high degree of competence echos and underscores its basic story, in a<br />powerful and unsettling way. Can any of this be avoided?
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This is probably the best, most practical and effective book I've read on creating the life you want.  Well researched and  backed by facts and studies,  this book  is credible and easy to follow.  What  do you have to lose? Just think what you have to gain!
B005NNUKF4|2.0|First off, the music is incredible.  The concert album is really exceptional material in content and quality.  The bad: the download from Cloudplayer to my device was poor.  Tracks would have a one second-long section of music missing at various points in the song.  Second, like Rick Wakeman's  &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; MP3 album, the breaks between tracks are abrupt, disturbing, and located a few to many seconds before or after where they should be, causing a complete disruption of the mood of the song.  In the case of the Wakeman album, I also bought the CD and deleted my Colud download and ripped the CD to my computer creating a far better audio composition than the cloud version.  In short, buy the CD's, not the MP3 download!

B000N2HCKQ|5.0|No matter how eloquent your writing style is, if it isn't remembered, it was a waste of time.How often do you remember a radio or TV commercial and can't remember the product it was selling? That commercial failed to &#34;stick&#34;, the product or service will never benefit from it, and it was a tremendous waste of time, talent and money. Bottom line - Your Message Must Be Remembered - and Made To Stick, by Chip and Dan Heath, tells you exactly how to do that.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I used to be a tweet-a-holic and stopped for reasons I cannot recall. I recently resumed activity of my twitter account. I love twitter, it's a great way to connect to people all around the world and follow you favorite famous people. I use the twitter app on my smart phone but it crashes so often, it started discouraging me from activity. I decided to download the app on my kindle fire after reading one day and I'm impressed!

But it pulled me right in from the beginning!<br />And by the time I got near the end of the 3rd volume, I read very, very slowly -- I didn't want it to end!<br />It was a totally worthwhile read and I would recommend it highly.<br />I was lured into the trilogy while visiting an independent book store in Mt. Dora, Florida, which is ruled over by a calico cat named Katniss.  I was embarrassed when the store owner had to explain who Katniss was!  Then a good friend -- who is a non-reader -- mentioned she got a reader for Christmas and couldn't wait for a mutual friend to also read the series so they could see the movie together (she had seen it alone--secretly).  Two recommendations were enough for me!<br />p.s.  I'm not a &#34;young adult&#34; reader, but a 60-something who was amazed at the quality, plot-strength and character development in this story.

B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Daughter & son-in-law watching Bates Motel Series. They love the show. My daughter & son-in -law never saw the original. They are in for a &#34;Real Classic&#34; I am watching series too. Love the show.
B00009NHC5|5.0|This movie I feel really met my expectations when it came to great suspense Suzy the main character had this doll that her husband got for her when he was coming home for a trip at the airport from this strange gal who wanted to get rid of it and this guy finally found out where the doll was and it had drugs in it and he really wanted this doll badly so he could get the drugs and everything finally leads up to the conclusion where Suzy has the confrontation with the guy who really wants the doll and it is very suspenseful and very well done at the end and finally when the police and the husband and her young friend get in and rescue her it turns out really well. Also Suzy is blind and Audrey Hepburn does a wonderful job in that role. all in all this movie is very well done and I really like it, so if you really like good suspense this movie is for you. This indeed is a very well done movie. and of course it really got dark so the guy could not see Suzy.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|We had to switch over to Netflix to watch this movie because it kept stopping and reloading with lower quality on Amazon. The movie was good, though.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was great. I liked that it was told from Pat's perspective and that he didn't seem to fully understand what the deal was. You really feel for him. Movie was pretty different.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|The combination of the olds Golden Harvest style martial arts film combined with rap music just doesn't do it for me.  Some of the Asian actors looked pretty funny in their wigs too.  Story line was weak too.  If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|One of the few movies that I have watched more than once. Loved the action and story line plus the Mini's
B008GOG98Y|5.0|&#34;A bicycle enthusiast in a small college town (Bloomington, Indiana) spends his post-High school summer trying to sort out his future while training for the two biggest races of his life.&#34;<br /><br />This 1979 film has aged well!  I saw it when released over 30 years ago and enjoyed it as much this time around.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Armin van Buuren is proof that you do not need to change with the times.  Over the years he has consistently produced, arguably, the best trance out there. This album is no exception from the first track to the last I was thoroughly impressed.  My favorite tracks from the album are Intense, This is What It Feels Like, Pulsar and Alone.
0316010669|3.0|Gladwell again unleashes a book that, if it does nothing else, makes you think about a subject you might have never thought to think about. Although Gladwell uses the term \\"thin slicing\\" to describe the phenomenon of knowing something without knowing it, it would seem the word \\"intuition\\" might be more common-or \\"hunch.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell argues that there is a way to know deeper truth about a thing from an instant glance sometimes than to fully analyze it. In one example concerning a statue purchased by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $10M, scientists and archaeologists studied the statue thoroughly to verify its authenticity.  The museum made the purchase, then another expert on these particular statues took one look and determined it was a fake. Other experts followed.  Later it was indeed proven to be a fake. It was aged artificially using milk of all things.  When asked how they determined it was fake, the experts sited negative feelings, hunches, something too perfect, etc. Gladwell uses instance after instance of such feelings to illumine the human mind's capacity to make snap judgments that are truer than those developed after long consideration.<br /><br />Problem one Gladwell addresses: prejudice. The snap judgments that are the backbone of racism and injustice in much of our world. He uses the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York as an example of such \\"thin slice\\" thinking gone awry. Gladwell does a decent job of warning against the possibility of misusing these more base mental powers.<br /><br />Problem two, however, Gladwell misses. He says nothing to us at all about how to perfect these abilities or train them or how to determine if they can be trusted at all. Rather he simply illumines that they exist and that we humans use them all the time. Well, isn't that wonderfully trivial?  \\"Humans have this ability to know without knowing. Here are examples...\\"<br /><br />\\"And?\\"<br /><br />\\"And... nothing. I just thought you should know.\\"That's the feeling I'm left with at the end of the book. Perhaps because he writes for the New Yorker, Gladwell is used to such open ended topics as great fodder for dinner conversations. Perhaps these stories are written for the day you land on \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\\" Or perhaps Gladwell just wants to make us think-or maybe not think so much-as it could be that he is arguing for less thought and more knowing without thinking.  I'm not sure that's a good thing. Usually jumping to conclusions before you know something is negative. Blink is basically an argument that sometimes people jump to conclusions and they are right. No doubt everyone thinks they're right at the time they jump. If Gladwell isn't going to help us train this capacity, we might do better to keep thinking first.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I stumbled upon this group by accident, and after listening to samples, decided to buy the whole album.<br />I love this music!  I'm from the golden days of rock, but try to give the newer stuff a chance.  Usually I'm<br />disappointed, but this stuff passes my test.  I'm no music expert, but these guys incorporate so many<br />elements that I enjoy:  grungy guitars, a good strong beat, and great music to tap my toes to, or even to<br />sing along with.  I shared the music with my 30 year old son, and he loves it too.<br />Usually when I download music, I listen to a couple of songs, and then move on to my old favorites, but<br />I have listened to this whole CD every day, often multiple times.  I think my favorite track is Jump On My<br />Shoulders, but on a whole, I'm very happy with all of the music.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|I would rank this book as third best in the first four Harry Bosch books.  It is a little slow at times.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Baseball has always been considered a thinking man's game.  Every rabid baseball fan has, for decades, taken great pleasure in sitting around and either thinking about or discussing stats, strategy, managerial moves, and the merits of every acquisition.  Nothings holds a fonder place in memory than the emerald green and crisp white lines of the field, the sound of a round bat striking a round ball squarely, the endless chatter of players trying to stoke up their pitcher, and the smell of popcorn and peanuts.  Everybody sitting around you has an opinion to voice, a clever insult to toss at the umpire, the need to visit the restroom every ten minutes.  Yes, it all holds a sacred spot in our hearts.<br /><br />But there are deeper thinkers in the bowels of baseball's hierarchy.  In MONEYBALL, Michael Lewis takes the reader there, kicking and screaming, and hardly understanding a word he says.  But, sagely, one has to acknowledge that there's more to baseball than scratching crotches, spitting, and charging the mound in a fit of rage when a ball comes too close to the melon.  Mountainous amounts of statistics are waiting to be studied.  Player performances have subtle nuances to be analyzed, personalities have multiple crevices for collegiate types to probe into and write papers about, and, best of all, there's the cause and effect of clubhouse rumors that fly around like confetti.<br /><br />As I said earlier, Michael Lewis takes the reader to a place that's obscure, to statistics too complicated to understand, to thought processes too convoluted to decipher.  But I, for one, came along because I'm a baseball nut who's convinced there's intelligence to baseball that has always been elusive.  There have to be many ways to evaluate players, game situations, and negotiation processes that are better than those currently being used.  After reading Lewis's scholarly presentation, I'm beginning to see the ghosts of ideas floating around that I'm convinced will revolutionizethe game.  I am now prepared to enter into my baseball talks with beer guzzling friends armed with information that will numb their minds.<br /><br />You will really enjoy this book if you can accept a couple of hints.  Don't try too hard to fully understand what's being said.  You won't be able to.  Enjoy, instead, the inside information on named players, managers, coaches, and even trainers.  The next time you see them on TV or in person at a game, you'll not only understand their frailties and failures, you'll be able to appreciate what a tough game this is to play and what's going through their minds as they wait for the next pitch or the line drive coming their way.  While it's true it's a game of trends, percentages, and minds,  MONEYBALL will show you that there's so much more.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES
B001A5HBAG|5.0|The concept for this show is ingenious and the characters are colorful and intriguing. Weiner's matter-of-fact manner used to  illustrate the rapidly evolving culture of the 1960's through activities in the office, the barrooms, homes and social interactions of the characters is fascinating, especially for someone who grew up in that era.  The heavy drinking, smoking and exclusivity of &#34;The Big Boys Club&#34; are almost shocking in retrospect. The character development within this environment is truly compelling without any maudlin pandering. We will never see &#34;a very special&#34; Mad Men episode. 
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Super fantastic in every way.  Chris Evans played a great all American boy for the time period.  Predictable ending of course but worth it.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Tells a different story of how people react in extremely difficult situations and how easily people can become cruel.  Sad story of extremities and how it is easier to pretend nothing bad is happening rather stand up against cruelties
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages. My four year old saw it for the first time recently and my 13 year old was in the room. Both of them laughed out loud throughout the movie.
B009CVVMSC|5.0|Oerfect edition in color, the edition is amazing and beautiful. It really full my expectations of quality, sound and music.
B008FIHUDO|5.0|Having seen Bettye Lavette in Sydney last month this cd was just what we hoped it would be, a studio recording but with the same deep feel as Her live show.Bettye does songs by Sly Stone like the title track Thankful N' Thoughtful and having the original we were impressed by the personal touch she gives the song while never loosing the heart of the song. Dylans Broken things also gets the personal touch and no doubt Bob would like the reading that Bettyes voice and Band and arranger give the song making it as Her own.<br />The song selection- being from diverse authors who had recorded them in their own way- do not suffer from an original and different  reading which seems do be Bettyes speciallity  The band that play,s behind Bettye on these recording from the pen of Neil Young , Tom Waits Daniel Auerbach  among them ,play with such finesse that you could not imagine anyone doing them an more justice, they are equal to the task and ad their skills to a fine recording that will stand the among classic recordings from any period .<br />I am glad that Bettye has chosen to stay away from songs that are strictly written for a blues artist as they maybe all too familiar
B00785P2QC|5.0|You'll like this game if u like to build with limited energy. It's also fun because you control trucks and send them to there destination
B004UPANGM|5.0|Evil Dead 1 didn't turn out to be the B horror movie it was intended to be. I turned out to be more of a comedy, and they ran with it in this movie. Hilarious !! Bruce Campbell is awesome. The 3rd movie in this series is the best of all - Army of Darkness. A must see !!

B0064MGU98|5.0|We have enjoyed watching this series and are looking forward to Session 2.  More interesting than<br />many things on tv.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Rather than go through the PS Store, this was a better, easier (and cheaper) way to get Journey.  It requires the disk to play any of the games, even though they download and install, but not really a big deal.  The art extras are nice.  Over all a good package.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Finally got around to reading this book.and after reading it, I can't believe it took me so long. Incredible story of life in Ireland in the 30's and 40's.
B008EKMB82|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel. I think it was a little stretched. But it left me with a good feeling.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The concept of the orphan trains was really amazing and offered possibilities for both great happiness and terrible abuse.  I enjoy authors who have more than one story line going on simultaneously although with the difference in time periods, these plots were parallel but not intersecting as in The Time Traveller's Wife or The Night Circus.  That said, the characters were fairly textbook and the ending a little neat.  I would recommend it as long as you are not looking for revelations.
B00AVF8USS|4.0|Amazing movie. Absolutely loved it. And it was ok for the kids to watch. My daughter had to put it on her iPad so she watch over and over
B000FC1RCI|4.0|Book is a classic, but needed this for an 8th grade ongoing (like forever) project<br />Kindle for PC works just fine and the search feature can save time versus chasing this info with a soft-cover book.

B003JBHQP4|5.0|This can reader can be beat in it's class. For the money you get a great card reader that will easily rival any other brand.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|This is an interesting story that a lot of people thought was adapted well to film. I don't agree. The tiger is all visual effects and although they were impressive, they were not ready for prime time and the tiger looked fake and did not have very tiger-like behavior. The story definitely dragged considerably and the direction was terrible.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|A faithfully rendered film of Tolkien's masterpiece, perhaps with a few more details than needed to get the idea of the story. Can't wait for the next segment where we get to see Smaug in his full glory. Terrific special effects and visuals made possible by New Zealand, really breathtaking. The direction could be better, especially of the dwarves.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I have immense difficulty trying to keep two pages on a single notebook. Every time I swipe to go to the second, it freezes and I'm almost always forced to shut it down -- the app. not the Kindle itself. I don't know the root of the problem, but take my words into your mind when you have this app. because. . just in case I'm not the only one.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I read about half of the first book when it originally came out in paperback and somehow lost the book, so when I got my Kindle and saw that all four books are available in this set, I jumped on it and boy, I am so glad I did! Although I enjoy the TV series very much, it is impossible for a TV series to convey the epic scope of the story that the books offer. Although each book is big (both literally and figuratively), I found myself obsessively wanting to turn page after page each time I opened the book. The writing really is that good!<br /><br />If you love the TV series, fantasy novels or even just a well-written, epic story, this series delivers the goods.
1616550414|5.0|I was struggling to find a gift for my daughter who is a Zelda fan.  I pre-ordered this before it was released and had to tell her so she wouldn't buy it herself!  Quality construction and LOTS of details. She sat for HOURS and poured over every detail. Tired of buying a game for your kids?  Buy them a book!

B000EOTAM6|5.0|ONE OF FOUR OF MY FAVORITE FEMME-FATALES CHARLIZE THERON DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB. I LOVED THE SPECIAL FEATURES, AND THE CGI WAS WELL DONE. THIS ONE IS DEMANDING A SEQUEL.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|GWYNETH PALTROW AND ANGELINA JOLIE WERE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN BEFORE THIS PRODUCTION. THEY DID VERY WELL IN THEIR SUPPORTING ROLES.  THE STORY WAS DONE WELL ALSO.  THE ENDING LEFT ROOM FOR CONTINUANCE, AND I WOULD CERTAINLY BUY IT IF IT EVER CAME OUT. AS ALWAYS, THE PRICE, PRODUCT, AND SERVICE WERE EXCELLENT.

B008RA3X5E|1.0|This app works well, it's a great clock, but I don't understand why they require so much access. This leads me to believe that this app is used to collect data on its users. I have privacy concerns about this app.<br />Functions great. PRIVACY, intrusive.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|Typical alien trying to \\"get us\\" plot. Lots of nice CGI. Same old boys club sci-fi. When I see something like this I always have to ask, \\"Nasty aliens, where are your women?\\" Apparently they don't have any or have decided not to clone any for obvious reasons...so they can engage in unmitigated violence against people in general and women in particular. Yet they do understand reproduction quite well and use possession and rape in an attempt to create a hybrid. Am I the only one that thinks this behavior would be beneath a civilization this advanced??<br /><br />Sci-fi needs some new ideas that don't support the concept that everyone wants to use violence and biological warfare to dominate others. Every world does NOT advance toward a military dictatorship just because we seem to be headed that way. I'd for once like to see truly enlightened thinking. \\"The Fountain\\" comes to mind. In the end a woman does set out to the alien's world. This has to be the singular most stupid idea in the movie. But perhaps she is really headed toward a future movie, one about a really \\"advanced\\" civilization rather than a future world based on our projected paranoia.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I tried the free version first.  Liked playing the games, but too many ads, so ordered this version.  It's fun, challenging, and sometimes quite difficult, but I love it!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, and i gotta say, totally worth it... if there were a 6th star i'd give it that... i really am looking forward to the 3d version... (i only saw the 2d one in theaters.)
B006BDHAX0|4.0|It is more challenging than some mahjong games, but not hard enough to lose interest. The background music is soothing.

B0098466CK|5.0|FIVE STARS. If you can't get enough Black Sabbath, wish time hadn't passed, want to be transported to a place where headbanging still exists, with no male makeup (I don't think) or Cookie Monster vocalists, just wild rides and riffs, pick this up. Heavy, and slow enough on the skins to be, dare I say it, relaxing. It jams.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie ever. its one of those movies that you HAVE TO watch. i dont want to explain the movie, i would most likely spoil it for you. great acting, great story. i dont really know what else to say, other than WATCH IT

B00009P1O0|5.0|Each of Neil's albums have their own unique flavor and On the Beach tastes like black liquorice: heady, spicy, but not for everyone. The songs shimmer as they loop in long slow arcs, langorous and soporific, with harmonics that may infuriate some listeners while leaving others ecstatic. (Just listen to the electric piano on \\"See the Sky About to Rain\\" if you don't know what I mean.) If you don't dig Neil's alienated period then you'd be better off buying Harvest, but if you want a really fascinating, cerebral set of songs then this is a good choice.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Strong performances and very human reactions make this more than a disaster movie. Well worth watching, this film avoids most disaster movie cliches to focus on one family's story. The mother is a testimony to the power to parent in any conditions and that makes this film suitable for young people, but it is likely too intense for small children.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You go through every possible emotion in this book! I cried from both sadness and joy!<br /> It makes you recognize the good and bad in the characters and yourself and learn that it's ok to live with both.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I firmly believe that this drivel should be tossed out the window or fed to the dogs.  The sheer lack of editing in the novel is proof that whenever an author becomes big in this country, the publishing company will accept the first draft ending to push the marketing and hype the audience.<br /><br />-There will be spoilers you have been warned-<br /><br />Let me start off by saying I have always loved the Sookie and Eric paring, and I was expecting him to come in at the end and help her out.  However,  those are not the reasons I am so disappointed in this novel.  I honestly would accept Sookie/Sam if it had ever been implied that Sookie had feelings for him by the first eleven novels.<br /><br />Who on Earth was responsible for character development? Sookie just brushes Eric aside as if to say he never meant anything to her.  Also, I am fairly certain that Sam does not randomly start talking like a valley girl afraid of what her boyfriend might think of her feelings.  This happens right after they have sex.  I'm also certain that Felipe Castro's right hand man wouldn't just go and attack Sookie for the hell of it.  His character was randomly used as filler and a bad plot device.  So many characters couldn't stay in character, maybe it was because there were so many of them in one story.<br /><br />Another problem with the story is the feeling and syntax.  The whole time I was reading this book, it felt like I was reading a freshly posted fan-fic by a ten who just experienced her (or his) first sexual encounter.  The whole<br />book has a \\"rose colored glasses\\" feel, as if everything were conveniently wrapped up in a pink bow.  The only<br />part that feels remotely like an actual Sookie Stackhouse novel is the beginning of when she was kidnapped.  It<br />falls back apart when Claude declares his reason for it was because she would not \\"have sex with him.\\"<br /><br />The point to this review is that life is never  conveniently wrapped up in a bow,  it's messy andcomplex.  If she hadn't tried to fit every character in to 250 pages, Mrs. Harris could have succeeded in a successful and satisfying ending.  There was extreme retrograding character development in this book.  I was expecting more from an accomplished writer,  but I guess one has to fizzle out sometime.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I just bought all of the Jesse Stone DVDs and love them all.  Hope that Tom Selleck makes more movies<br />In the same series.  Interesting and intense plots as well as good study of human character.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|This movie keeps your interest. The sets and clothes are cool and the action keeps it moving. You don't take much away from it, which is fine, they all can't be Avatar.

B004AUGJS8|4.0|I thought this would be one of those movies that I could predict the ending but it left me on the edge of my seat and guessing the whole time.  The ending was..... interesting but definitely worth watching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new Temple Run 2 is exciting and will have your fingers sliding across the screen. The graphics are beautiful and compatible for any device.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Every so often I am fortunate enough to be privileged to read a book that not only entertains but also informs and inspires. This book not only provides a delightful history of a much misunderstood genius but it inspires the \\"genius\\" in the reader as well.  I will take much pleasure in passing it on to my budding scientist grandson!
B009AMANH4|5.0|AN excellent historic movie.  Mt daughter who is a history major could not find any major historical point.  Will use it in her class.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really liked this little booklet.<br />In about an hour's read, it gave a concise, yet fairly thorough account of Tesla's life, philosophies, and incredible inventions.<br /><br />In particular, you can sense his total selflessness, and undying philanthropic philosophy.<br /><br />It's also a scathing condemnation of power, wealth, and greed's hold on those who would  wield those destructive weapons, to the detriment of mankind, simply for the sake of securing their own hegemony.<br /><br />What a different world this would be if, instead of being motivated by greed, Tesla's partners  had shared his philosophies and worked for the common good.<br /><br />Imagine if all of his inventions had been encouraged and produced, instead of stifled?<br /><br />A friend, who once worked for Exxon Solar (yes, you read it right), said to me: \\"We'll see the widespread use of solar power as soon as the power companies figure out how to run a sunbeam through a meter.\\"<br /><br />Yup.<br /><br />The Educational and inspirational analysis was nicely done as well, and dovetails very well with the historical narrative.<br /><br />The fifth star was for the very reasonable price.  ;-)
B005S9EKCW|5.0|What can one say about this awesome movie.  Once I saw it in the theatre I knew this was one I need to have to pass down.  My daughter who teaches History use it to help my grand-children to understand what was going on in France during this time period.  This movie got my 15 year grand-son to want and read the book.
B00CAJP0ZO|4.0|Party music, great selection of beats even though some of them may have allegedly infringed! Songs like Geekin though are catchy and original. Love the album.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Love the graphics fun to try to expand without spending real monies too expensive if you use real money<br />Play for free would like better help
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Kindle edition books are great. I got it instantly and that kept me from having to wait to see the next part of this great story! Sylvia's writing is wonderful. I was looking for a series after reading the 50 Shades series over and over that would compare to that. This is an equally great love story that keeps you eager to turning each page to follow the story and still has the ability to make things a little steamy for those who read them for the &#34;love scenes&#34;. Great love story!
0307887898|4.0|How to get maximum output for a minimum amount of work/time when you're testing ideas. Must read for entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is perhaps the best assembly of characters in my life-time.<br />Don't dismiss my enthusiasm just because I am 937 days old.<br />But really, I loved the script, the actors, the camera work, the craft and their craft.<br />Thank you for an amazing and awesome first season.<br />Dave Enyart
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Although it is supposed to be a book for teenagers, it surely brings fun to people all ages. I needed a hero after Harry Potter lol.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I love both SG-1 and SGA. They're my go-to series. I was so happy to find SGA on Amazon so I could watch it again
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Perfect for young kids. Keeps them occupied and busy (when needed to). Recommended for nemo and fish lovers, mostly small kids.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is a great movie. I can't believe all the details that is in every scene. The people who designed all the scenes are geniuses.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is no exception, however this can not stand up to the musical performances of the tenth anniversary concert at London's Royal Albert Hall. Although the performance is powerful and captures the essence of the original Broadway play there are some spots that miss the mark. Hugh Jackman is no Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean (voice or performance) and Ruthie Henshall is by far the better Fantineas is Lea Salonga as Cossette. Even with these short falls I still love the movie the only performance that I found really lacking was that of Russel Crowe as Javert. His voice was OK, however he appeared to be sleep-walking through the movie. He was either uninterested or he was concentrating so much on his singing that he forgot to act.<br />If you enjoyed this you might want to checkout the tenth anniversary concert...wonderful!
0062215507|5.0|My son loves everything Harry Potter. This book has a wealth of information, with neat pullouts on many of its pages.  It is a must have for HP enthusiasts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for all horse lovers! I am one and I really think you should vet it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I rate subway surfers 5 stars because it is so epic, fun and addictive when my kindle isn't charged I go on the iPad but it wasn't working. I love subway surfers!!! X
