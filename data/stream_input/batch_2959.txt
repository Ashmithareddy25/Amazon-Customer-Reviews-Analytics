B0037XPP84|4.0|History movies are my favourite. This is a good movie, I really enjoy it! Cate Blanchett's acting is amazing as always. Great cast, picture and costumes!!!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The author's skill in writing the story in different time frames was remarkable.  A very good story that kept your interest despite the time frame differences.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Like a roller-coaster ride, this movie was a lot of fun. There's plenty of action, humor and CG effects...need I say more.
B0073HHV96|4.0|I have read several books by Wilkie Collins.  He is a great writer.  But he was aced out by Charles Dickens (obviously a great writer), who published during the same period.  The Moonstone was frustrating because, written in the style of the day, it is very wordy by 21st Century standards.  Personally, I enjoyed Drood more than The Moonstone. The Mystery, Drood, actually frightened me. Both are novels well worth reading.
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|The series went on and on and on-seemed like the story could have been told in half the time.  Characters over dramatized their feelings, new suspects were pointed out at every episode to keep the interest-did not care at all for the conclusion and the extremely high drama-could have done without the details.  All emotional scenes became very tedious and the actors overplayed their roles in these scenes.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Great game.  Fun to play.  I love the way you can play all the way through every level and reset the whole thing and start all over again.  It's like playing a whole new game.  It's challenging no matter how many times you play it and the graphics are clear and colorful.  I think anyone who likes to play mahjong would enjoy playing this game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Who knew solitaire and golf went together so well?  The little story line is cute and the twists between the games tying the two together are great!  Whoever thought this one up deserves a raise.
B003RV43X4|4.0|This is a great movie for those who like mythologies it has a lot off action and has your attention cought through all the movie.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|It was interesting to know the back story for the Reacher saga, that said, I must confess it was a little slower then most of the other books. It is still a good read.
B00CFITJKW|1.0|I will play with it more to see if I can make it work...but over all very poor planning and roll out of a game..  Amazon's should either remove it or have developer reduce the price.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Awesome as bedside clock!!! Easy to set all types of alarms and reminders. Love the opportunity to change to all the different clock face styles!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Much more helpful than using my phone when set up on a dock. Would recommend to anyone. Very nice app.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I've always loved Star Trek so having this collection on blu-ray is awesome! Great pricing also when I bought this! Well worth it to buy this for any Star Trek fan.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Love it! Keeps you guessing. I bet you can't guess the ending. It's a 98% family movie for all ages.
B00BV9Y8B6|5.0|Comes in a nice big case and has a cool book on the inside describing some of the making and artwork of the movie. I would certainly recommend this combo pack to anyone that enjoys the hobbit and wants something that's more of a collectible.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Excellent, engaging storytelling with an equally impressive cast of characters. The way the story jumps around time is definitely something that makes me want to read the book again, because I feel like there are more folklore references, nuances and symbols to find. I only give it four stars because I feel that the romance between the main characters was slightly rushed; however, this book is much more than a romance, so that didn't bother me too much.
B004UJCH9O|5.0|Really neat steelbook collectible, well worth the money. I just recently started collecting blu-ray steelbooks and I have to say they are awesome. They protect discs better and hold them better than plastic plus they don't break and fall apart over time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg its award-winning super cool apps that the movie rope is free to get the movie is not so much more<br /><br />Frederic Graff FedEx draft fgq f2f. The g. f vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv cc. F f2f. Vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv.
B003Q6CUAI|4.0|Apart from occasional grammatical errors the recipes are easy enough to read and execute. Good quality food photography. A section with explanation  of  basic cooking techniques might be useful for beginner cooks.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|To tell the truth, I have never read a book like this before. It goes to deep dark places. Yet, at the same time, it is filled with humor and excitement. I guess, since I'm only one year younger than the main character, Charlie, I can identify with him. I tend to also see myself in his thoughts, actions, and beliefs about life. I loved the book. For any one looking for something different, something filled with artistry and creativity, I recommend this book to you.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|This is a much better version of Glee, without the music.  Smartly written, fast-paced, and altogether enjoyable. The main characters are very believable, and the guidance counselor is a total trip!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|One night Clary is going home from a club but when she gets home she immediatly sees that something is wrong, the place is trashed and her mom is missing. Clary is about to discover a  world hidden from normal people, a dangerous world with demons, vampires and werewolfs. But there are also shadowhunters that hunt and kill demons and Clary finds out that she like her mother is one. Now in company by other shadowhunters she is determined to find out who kidnapped her mother and get her back even though she knows it will be dangerous.<br /><br />This book was good, it had an interesting story line and some action but I still think it could have been better, some of the characters didn't really get to me and I was a bit dissapointed with the ending and think that the author could have done more with it. But all in all I really liked this book and will start reading book number two soon.
B00BR5KBU6|5.0|This was the finest book I have read in the last five years.  I simply loved it.  I hasn't left me still.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|Great interaction with reader. Bruce's ability to fight after fatal stabbing too far fetched but forgivable. Great detective story and really fun read.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|From the Hollywood Icon, the pop music was great!  I listen all day!  It is wonderful that she has made another album! You will love it!
B007JZGIMS|3.0|Was looking for a player that would let me play one song at a time from my playlist.  This one won't let me do that.  In fact, it auto-starts the next song every time I FF.  Will keep looking...
1597801585|4.0|This man can write.  I can't fault him for his setting and characters.  His language is rich in imagery but allows the reader to often fill in the details for themselves, which invests you in the story of this sad world that lives and dreams right on the edge between human hope and despair. The only criticism I have and it's entirely subjective, is that at the end, I felt like a terrier chasing down too many rats at one time.  In having so many characters of equal importance and trying to wrap up their individual story lines within the finale, I felt like the momentum fragmented.  But would I recommend?  Absolutely.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|It was OK but not want to watch again.Probable wouldn't watch again. My husband like it more than I did. He would watch again.
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|Reading about another modern culture, the American modern culture and how both exist with modern tech devices (cell phones, blogging, etc) was interesting. It seemed there were too many characters with too many sidelines and the ending was disappointing. It seemed there was a sudden decision it had to end and the &#34;main&#34; character's decisions were a copout.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|It was a good movie,  I enjoyed. Probable wouldn't watch again. My husband like it more than I did. He would watch again.It had sone good twist
B00382S9TQ|5.0|Love it. The slim packaging is a much better look than the bulky ones, and I love the show. This is a must have for anyone who loves Sex and the City.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Have had this for almost two years and it is simply amazing. I can't type on other phones anymore because it doesn't know me like this program does and I actually have to put work into having a conversation.
B00382S9SC|5.0|Love it. The slim packaging is a much better look than the bulky ones, and I love the show. This is a must have for anyone who loves Sex and the City.
1451668945|4.0|I will always buy one of her books.  Although not as griping as some of today's mysteries and thrillers, she does have interesting ideas and her books are great fun.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story tore my heart.  Written as historical fiction, I have no doubt that it is reflective of many of the lives of the thousands of children who were caught up in this astonishing project.  I delighted in Vivian's late life joy with her computer and felt every tear at the multitude of sorrows life brought her.  The author wove skillfully the connection between the orphaned train rider and the modern day foster child.  It is a thought provoking and sad commentary on humanity.
125000098X|3.0|There was a lot of catch up with this book and the story and characters not near as good as the 1st book in the series.  I felt that the author coasted with this second book in the series.I hope that the third installment will be better.
B00FF56IR4|5.0|While taking off where the Avengers movie ended, this is an entirely different product. Joss Whedon fans will rejoice at the inclusion of two characters who have worked with him in the past, one from Firefly and one from Angel.<br /><br />I am not an easy person to please, but this show has everything. Great writing and acting, lots of action, peculiar sci-fi, an engaging plot, and really, really likable characters. If the rest of the season is as good as this pilot, then we have a great show ahead of us. Let's have episode two!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Try it.  What a voice and I loved the selections.  I can't say anything more that hasn't already been written.  Bocelli's voice is an instrument from God.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great costumes, decorating is out of sight and the story lines are outstanding. Looking forward to season 4, 5.  6 and beyond.
B00F5F0208|2.0|due to icon clip on mobile app was unable to tell it was the edited version would have wanted the uncensored version of the album but album is still great
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The storyline at times seemed too far fetched, however for the most part I enjoyed the book.  Would recommend to others
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This new Star Trek adventure is surely among the best.  Great production and fantastic special effects!  Not giving away any plot points, but I highly recommend this film to Star Trek fans and non-fans as well.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I like my Mac Air, but having to buy a stupid adapter is the price I pay for not wanting to carry something a little thicker and heavier with me all day every day.<br /><br />Then there's the fact I keep losing these things, so I order one then about the time it comes in I find two I lost.<br /><br />I tried buying a cheaper USB to gigabit adapter and it drops out on large file transfers, this apple adapter works perfectly fine with no issues. Good quality just wish it was a little cheaper, but who doesn't.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was wonderful cruel simply exhausting because it couldn't be put down. The characters are raw and believable, you pray each chapter for their safety. I was moved to tears.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is one of the best TV series so far.....I recommended  to everyone who happened to watch season one and season two as I did..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can watch one right after the other, I so enjoy these. It amazes me how much things have changed or gone down hill with the passage of time.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you're a Zep fan you gotta have this!!  The gig at the royal Albert hall alone is worth it, plus Earls Court is Fantastic!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|And wonderful read! Best I have read in years. Left me wanting more and sad to see no more word's.
0689835604|5.0|I think this was one of the favorite books for both of our kids when we started to read to them.  Highly recommended.
B0031QVW2U|4.0|Needed stability in my Black Rapid strap, this more than adequately filled the need. Wish it came with the original strap, seems a given, but the price didn't deter me from purchasing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best way to fill your time...best game available for kindle fire hd!  Love the many rooms to play in.
0761169253|5.0|Got the book on a whim from the library, excellent read. Immediately went to Amazon to find this book. Very creative, very inspirational.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I spend lots of my free time playing Bingo Blitz lately. It is so much fun. I wish there were ways to refresh points systems faster to continue playing. I don't like having my time managed for me! I like the interface, the rewards system, and the satisfaction of winning simple things. It's harmless to gamble with imaginary currency, but this can really eat up your time ;)
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a show I passed up watching on TV.  Now that I'm watching the videos, I find it mesmerizing.  Great series!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was more light-hearted than most of Grisham's work but thoroughly enjoyable. He's a good writer any way you look at it.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Really enjoyed the fullness of the story and the expansion of the characters interaction with each other and the situations they encounter.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you have any connection to world war 'll  read this. If you like airplanes, read this, if you like happy endings,read this. Filled with human emotion ,steeped with history.  Great story!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I found the Chromcast easy to use from my laptop or phone.  The quality is great.  However the streaming choices are limited - MUST have Amazon Prime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although i watched the movie beforehand the book was even better. The few changes they had made in the movie seem minor still, but the book and the movie are great separate and together.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Its a great game but i would love it if i wasn't forced to buy tokens just to play every time. Other than that this is a great game to enjoy no other flaws :)
B00594XOZU|5.0|Well it stopped working so I uninstalled and reset my kindle Fire HD and I did it multiple times yet It still won't let me sign in please fix it.<br />Updated version-<br />(It finally works after several months it runs somewhat smoothly depending on your internet speed. It's also updated so yay!)
B001BANK32|5.0|Very well written.  The marriage complications they have are scarier and more real than any of the other stuff.  Good book though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it always is fun to play Abbey maids love to play it anytime I can I play it
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This novel is different from anything I have read in recent years. It kept me up late into the night; was absolutely &#34;unputdownable&#34;. A touching story of a doomed love with a difference. I wanted the story to end differently: yet I was totally satisfied with the author's decision.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I like the movie, HUGE G.I. Joe fan, I won't give away any spoilers, but it wasn't as good as the first.  Action was good, I liked that they focused on the &#34;ninja&#34; side of the Joe's this time around a bit more
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good book. I did  not want to put it down! It really makes you pause and think about the what ifs and the would  have could haves! Wow!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Cool game to kill time not bad at all just need to figure out how to get more peanuts with out buying them I won't spend money in the game other than that cool game
B00992CF6W|5.0|I could write a one thousand page review of how awesome this game is. Except that two kindle fires cant do multiplayer together. I recommend this game so much.
030758836X|1.0|Rarely is our book group unanimous in our opinion of a book, but all ten of us disliked Gone Girl.  We could not understand how it was on the Best Seller list for one week, let alone 68 weeks!  If you are curious about Gone Girl, save time and money by waiting for the movie version.  Better yet, read a Harlan Coben novel if you are looking for the \\"can't put the book down once started\\" experience with plot twists and at least one likable character.  For me, the lesson of Gone Girl is to pay no attention to Best Seller lists.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik isn't logging in or creating a new account on my kindle please fix this I love kik over all though
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun game:) I could not put it down!  the graphics are really nice and u do many tasks for the horses.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|It's amazing...the pull of music...how it can wrap you up and float you away...connecting you to a place you haven't been in awhile. You expect the old familiar songs to do it, but it's even more remarkable when new songs accomplish it. The piano playing is intricate and classic as Elton draws from his early years at the Royal Academy of Music.  If Schubert were a rock star, he'd be Elton John.  The production is stripped down and pure. This album is mature yet fresh - it reaches back to the simple bass, drum, piano mix that made Elton famous. Bernie's lyrics are lush, touching on topics from the dangerous lure of fame to the reflections of those returning from WWII as they think of the friends who didn't survive. The blend of classic production with songs that could only be crafted by years of experiences makes this a brilliant addition to Elton's catalogue.<br /><br />I was among Elton's first collection of fans. I connected with his tiny picture in the back of 16 Magazine in the days when David Cassidy and Donny Osmond were commanding the large headlines on the cover. I was 10 years old, and he was the only rock star in the whole mag who wore glasses...it gave an awkward bespectaled fifth grader hope. And now, as a fifth decade adult, the sound of his songs still touch my spirit. I still buy his records, and this one is well worth the investment.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app!! I love being able to make a note and have it synched to all my devices. I am just scratching the surface on this app's capabilities. Highly recommenced!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Visually arresting with strong performances by DiCaprio and Edgerton, but somewhat miscaast/misinterpreted characters otherwise.  Could have been much better  Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan were downright grating.
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|This long-awaited album was certainly worth the wait.  Hope Sandoval's entrancing vocals, combined with David Roback's sweeping guitar - along with the talent of all the other musicians involved - makes for a powerful combination, capable of guiding one fluidly through this journey of emotional highs and lows.  It is truly complex in its simplicity, and once again proves that Mazzy Star is exactly where they need to be.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|What a great read! This was an absolute page turner, a must read! I couldn't put it down once I started
B00F35BV64|5.0|Yah, it rehashes a lot of story elements from The Wrath of Khan, but so what.  It's so much fun to watch.  The action and special effects are non-stop.  The characters are also done really well.  It's two hours of entertainment.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Horrible acting. Boring senseless unbelievable plot. Not Brads best.Must have needed some cash to feed the little ones.<br />Oh well.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Ok, if you're not a Rush fan or you don't like Rush music... then besides being completely lost, this DVD is not for you.  For the rest of us intelligent human beings, this is a must have for your Rush collection.  Keep it with the rest of your Rush DVDs and CDs.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It is FUN.<br />You get to play in either world,  buy things, to upgrade,  an help make the game more interesting, an challenging.<br />It is all around FUN !!!<br />I recommend this to all ages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awsome I'm at 7.5 I mean this game is really for every one 5 stars for this uhh vhvivhvhvhvhvv oh :) j
1432794426|5.0|With the mounds of sensationalistic, tabloid material of Michael Jackson seemingly everywhere, it is really great -- and uplifting -- to see a positive, realistic, and interesting book about him.  Thanks to the author for her courage, insight, and dedication to MJ's legacy.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game can be a lot of fun except when it glitches. Numerous times it has removed peanuts from my stash for no reason. Very aggravating to watch what I earned just disappear. Also upon rescue of several breeds the peanuts earned for saving the species just disappeared. Seems to me the developers are trying to force me to spend money for peanuts to continue the game. Why else would they just vanish?
B000SGGUWS|4.0|A few differences in the book and tv series, but then again that's usually how it goes.? on to the second book now.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|This movie is OUTSTANDING Brad Pitt is great. Action,action and More action. Hold on, within 15 minutes you will be<br />Raving.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|My mom and I rent thus movie from redbox today because the preview look very good and so we watched it and it was not good at all
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book.  It held my interest from start to finish.  I did not find any slow or dull chapters.  The characters were completely engrossing.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This kik app is horrible. It will not let me log into my kik on my Kindle Fire. You need to fix that. Thank you.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is perfect! It is so fun and works great for a kindle fire HD, i bought it not really knowing if it would be good i was pleasantly surprised it is a wonderful app. It makes the pictures so perfect and professional!:)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great it helps out when we need some quit time on the go.<br />Nap time has gone much easier with it on it calms and the whitenoise put her out every time.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|I'd replaced the ear cups on my 7506's before with some cheap ones online before, and these are less expensive and actually feel better than those!<br /><br />I don't remember what the fit was like with the OEM ones, but these were kind of a struggle to get lined up and on-- which should hopefully mean they're equally hard to get off!<br /><br />I saw in a previous review that the ones they got didn't have the foam insert. While this was true of my initial replacement, the ones that i got on Amazon did.<br /><br />Very happy with the purchase, hoping to get years of service from them!
B000PXUA5W|5.0|This is a very cool watch. My seven year old loves that it is lightweight and that he can change the colors of the band.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|There is plenty of fantasy action going on in this movie. A first rate Villain and a colorful mix of Super Heroes battling against all odds.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I have used this a couple of times. some are tougher than the others. boy do I need practice every day.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|If you know Bob, you know this album is the best. If you don't, this album is the best. Nothing else to say is needed.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|It's not a lot of fun and I will be able to play we wish you a marry Christmas and a happy New year.
B00CATSONE|5.0|An amazing inspiring story that took no time at all. Very motivational and informative. If everyone read this growing up, we would have wireless electricity by now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very fun game. at first I had downloaded it for the children just because they asked me for it. I was annoyed at first about the speed of the download for each game,  but after awhile it did not bother me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up. Easy to use. Fast. Good value.<br /><br />This streams Netflix in HD while my Xbox 360 sitting right next to it will not...<br /><br />For $35 it could have worked half as well and still have been worth it.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|Still a great movie....after all these years..Seen it several times since 1959.  Audrey in one of her best roles ever.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have never had the pleasure to use a Kindle before.  It is convenient and so easy to use and so much better than carrying a book around with you.  Lots of great books can be downloaded.
034580404X|4.0|this is the adult version of twilight. the third book neede more adult action but it was a good ending for the characters.
B0042AGNCS|3.0|Great service but product quality a little questionable, however I might just have a random flawed disc!  We still watched the disc but I only paid about $4
1451695195|5.0|This book was enjoyable and fascinating, tho a bit technical at times.  The author's neurological background is apparent, but all in all its a great book, and may change your perspective on death and dying.
075666733X|4.0|I like this book because I am studying a nursing so  I read the book it really helped me to see what are the functions,images are great very helpful.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the show and the price. The video works great and the quality is HD.  Nothing negative to say about the DVD.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|small amount of storage came free with my kindle fire. At first when I down loaded my pics from face book it did a great job but there were a few pics missing, especially my mobiles. Then something happened to my reader and I had to restart it. I lost everything. I couldn't get much to down load from face book, especially my mobile pics. I had to do it manually. It was very frustrating. If I want to down load a new pic from face book it down loads it plus all the other pics I don't want. So I'm constantly deleting pics. Like someone said before you can't organize them and you can't edit or caption. I also couldn't get it to download from my phone, but could from the computer which was time consuming.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Great help for the amateur singer where a piano is not available for practice.<br />Suggest earphones for use in crowded room
B004YXE438|5.0|I love doing puzzles and this app has some good ones. The pics pop right out.  the colors are very vibrant on my kindle fire hd. I love that the pieces can be rotated and are given in different positions. Others I have played has the picture in the appropriate upright direction giving no challenge to  the puzzle. This one makes you work more but it's fun love it so much..wish theyhad many more puzzles to work on
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my daughter loves this app. she loves all the different toys that appear.  I think you will.like this app too.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A wonderfully written piece which revives ones faith in the human character. One of the best books I have ever enjoyed. Thank you for writing this!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really great in its complex characters and witty dialog. A brainy show like this one doesn't come along every day.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|We recently just started watching Amazon Prime.  We really had fun watching this show.  The characters are great and Louis is hilarious.  Looking forward to the new season.
B000002KKC|3.0|30 years later, \\"Tusk\\" is still the self-indulgent product of a extraordinarily-talented band that desperately needed reining in.<br /><br />Self-indulgent, I say? Double albums, back in the day, were always a \\"tell\\" that a band had reached the self-indulgent stage where no one has the power to bring them in under control. Why did they need the USC marching band for the title song? When I heard Fleetwood Mac live touring for this record oh-so-many years ago, the brass section was handled by Christine McVie. Playing an accordion! And it was awesome. That sort of lighter touch would've helped on the LP. Of course, properly focused down to a single LP, the high point of the record, \\"Not That Funny,\\" might've been omitted. So there's that.<br /><br />Edited down, this record would make a great Lindsey Buckingham showcase. He shines on this record and his songs dominate. This is his band at the \\"Tusk\\" point of his career, especially when you compare this record to the other four albums from the classic Fleetwood Mac golden period. But on \\"Tusk,\\" the Christine McVie songs are not that strong. Stevie Nicks sound just like her stuff on the two records before, and the two records after, but just not quite as good.<br /><br />Worth owning, as are all five records from the great run with this line-up from \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" to \\"Tango In The Night.\\" But not every track is worth listening to.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a great game - it's simple enough for non-gamers to learn quickly, and it plays fast. It's a great game to use to kill 20 minutes.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|I got this for my Grandson and he loves it .  Has been playing it now every chance that he gets
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so fun and it is exsiting I love it and if you ask me I cool 50000000 stares #cool #cray. so ya cool
B009CGCQPU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I watch it all the time. I love the time period it's placed in and the romance. Jane Austen is one of my favorite past times.

B00F875N98|4.0|Having been a fan of Kings of Leon since \\"Youth and Young Manhood,\\" it's been interesting to watch how they've changed and matured as each album comes along. \\"Mechanical Bull\\" is their slickest yet. Cleanly produced, vocals upfront, heck, even strings (on \\"Comeback Story\\"). It's also the Kings' most blatantly commercial album, even more so than \\"Come Around Sundown.\\" If you found that album to be too much for you, you're not going to like \\"Mechanical Bull.\\"<br /><br />However, I do. It's OK for a band to progress beyond their roots. With all the infighting going on after \\"Sundown,\\" I'm surprised we have an album at all. But, as they say, blood is thicker than water, and when Caleb Fallowill sings he'd \\"take one in the temple for you\\" (on \\"Temple\\"), he could easily be talking about the relationship he's got with his fellow bandmates. They're back to bringing out the best in each other, including some very tasty guitar on \\"Coming Back Again\\" from Matthew Followill, who is in top form throughout \\"Mechanical Bull.\\" Be it the arena sized soloing (\\"Rock City\\") or even just using it for subtle coloration (\\"Beautiful War\\"), he's become a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />\\"Mechanical Bull\\" revels in that diversity. Between the aforementioned strings, the pedal steel on \\"On The Chin,\\" and the album's leaner feel, Kings of Leon are finding their way to greener pastures. And that's no Bull.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I am so  sick of 'dumb' zombie films. This was a fast paced intelligent little gem. If looking for a gore fest go to another movie. Although there was plenty of action and violence. The graphic nature of it wasn't the selling point. The story line had substance and Pitt and all the other main actors did a very credible job.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book. Even if there was some places in the book were it felt like it was draging out a bit. I am a little disappointed in the end. I kind of ended on a knifes edges. I am looking forward to the second book.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I bought this book because of the amazing number of 5-star reviews, and regretted it in the first couple pages. The language is child-like, the story is hackneyed and predictable (have you read any story about survive the apocalypse underground? Then you've read this book.) The penultimate source of tension is cause by inexplicably slow writing during action scenes, where every motion is described in agonizing detail. Instead of saying &#34;The strap fell to the floor as she cut it free,&#34; the author would write which direction the knife was facing, how she was holding the handle, what kind of motion she was using to cut, which muscles were tired from doing that motion, and why she was already tired. Think you want that kind of detail about everything? Trust me, you don't.<br /><br />Now on to the ultimate source of tension. A source of tension that pervades every chapter, almost every single scene in all 5 stories. A nemesis so stultifying that Hugh Howey had all the characters fighting against it as some point. Stairs. Yes, the spiral staircase and how hard it is to go up and down stairs at high speed is probably occupies as many pages as dialogue in this book. There's some paltry revelations, there's some action, sure. But most of this book is going up and down stairs. Sometimes with gear, sometimes at speed, sometimes a few floors, sometimes 100 floors. But damn are stairs boring to read about. Seriously. Stairs.<br /><br />Character development is non existent, every character is introduced how they leave, and no one does anything you wouldn't expect. The &#34;love&#34; story is 100% commonplace and 100% uninteresting. Ignore all the good reviews, and don't buy this book unless you really like stairs.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Way beyond all my expectations, this was a tour de force film.  What a fascinating setting, a retirement home for opera singers and musicians, that's an ideal platform for both comedy and sentiment.  Billy Connelly is remarkable and Maggie Smith is, yet again, absolutely brilliant.  Characters come to life here and are welcome in our lives as well.  Don't miss this.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I have adored Cher since the early 70's.  I have followed her career through every up and down and twist and turn and I always enjoy her work.<br /><br />This new CD is one of her strongest efforts. It deserves to be a tremendous success.<br /><br />I like the majority of the songs on the album but my very favorite is the song \\"I Walk Alone\\", written by Pink.  It is an unusual song which stands out as quite different than anything else on the album. It has a bit of a \\"gypsy\\" feel and even uses the word \\"gypsy\\" in the lyrics.- which echoes Cher's #1 hit of many years ago. It also contains the lyric \\"closer to the truth\\" which gave the album its title. The use of multiple recordings of Cher's voice is excellent on this song. I would enjoy the song with an even more pronounced beat and can easily imagine a wonderful dance-oriented remix.  I hope they give this song a shot as single and do a club version as well.<br /><br />Well done Cher. Well done.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I read this book because I heard it had been banned by some school(s) and I was curious. While there is some bad language, it is central to the story and no worse than you would hear on a daily commute.  The characters are well developed and I completely lost myself in their story. I will see what else this author has written; she has set the bar high with this book.

Some of the best features like the Startup Manager will only work on rooted devices.

B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is a great twist on the original.  Many different facets you don't get with black and white.  Lots of fun.  I probably wouldn't pay $5 for it, but it's worth a few if it's ever on sale (I got it as the FAotD).

0761171703|5.0|(Really rated it 4.5 stars. I wish that this was a hardcover book - personal bias.)<br /><br />A sweetly inspirational look at daily life, events and moments, featuring people with a grace beyond the typical mortal. It's great to know that the images weren't doctored to make models look like dancers... these *are* dancers (with dancers' feet and thighs :-) and their grace shows through. A book to savor.

B009ME47H2|2.0|If the developer would adjust the playback volume it would go a very long way with this recording app.<br /><br />Otherwise it's only useful if you want your recording to be whisper quiet or have access to a good audio app to normalize it.
0812550706|5.0|The story was amazing. After reading it I decided to buy the rest of the Ender Quintet. I hope the rest don't disappoint so that I can move onto the Shadow Series, and then the others. A 5-star review all the way! I have only one gripe...<br /><br />On page 222, there is a typo in the sentence: \\"Ender got to his fee.\\" This is surprising considering the many revisions of this title, it is, by the way, the Definitive Author's Edition. Something so small should be corrected at this point. It's not that big of a deal though and I'm sure there are more but none so noticeable. I'm just disappointed. Still, an amazing story. Just figured I'd stand up on my own two fee and say something.<br /><br />See what I did there? =)

0812983459|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage Of Harold Fry is so spectacularly good the main character will literally lumber right off the page and tromp through your house with his bad blisters and sour memories and indefatigable resolve. His socks may smell, his voice may quaver and he may devour a lot of your food but don't miss the chance to get to know him. He's one of the sweetest, saddest, funniest and utterly endearing men ever to be cast into existence. And no, I didn't just consume 3 bottles of booze and smoke great quantities of peyote. I saw Harold. I walked with him. I would have offered him a bed for the night, a suitcase of provisions and a basin of hot water to soak his tired feet in.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because Harold Fry is glorious. He's hope reinvented. He's a pack of angels, if there are angels, all white and frothy, floating across a Tartarean sky.<br /><br />And when he leaves, you need to follow him.<br /><br />You must sneak along, in the shrubs and brambles, in the muck and sand and trampled grass.<br /><br />His journey isn't glamorous and Harold is the last person to seek the spotlight. He's like a big overgrown child who for the first time is stumbling out into the world without any supervision or guidance. This book bursts with wry humor, reams of philosophical wisdom and luminous spellbinding prose. Rachel Joyce fuses genres, breaks molds, and has created such a unique plot -- so deceptively simple, and yet so jampacked and satisfying. She has put Harold on this earth and he will not stay down. He may be inconspicuous and timid but he will consistently spring up like a a beach ball shoved under water. He will nestle in your thoughts at the oddest times and someday you'll remember something he thought or did. You will reflect on his 600 mile journey and marvel that this utterly unforgettable man lived life without ever drawing a breath.

B00CDUVDEC|3.0|It is best to know in advance what this album is not, and that is Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual and Arson Anthem.  Phil is not one to repeat himself, and this album is a continuation of his desire to push the limits. This album is pretty far out in the realm of metal and anyone thinking that it contains any groove or catchy chorus will not be pleased.  Phil is showing off his experimental side and succeeds at times and bores at times.  Honestly this album needs some groove and melody.  With those ingredients the abrasive qualities of this album would have more impact.
B008D28HYS|5.0|A lot of fun and very addictive.  My only concern is that whan I get to the more difficult puzzles it will be hard to solve them on my phone, due to their size.

B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved this book because it was interesting and different and the characters in it changed so much so quickly
B0082Z447U|3.0|While I found this book to be intriguingly composed it was a very exhausting read for a 21st century mystery reader more accustomed to the pace of Christie.  In order to navigate much of the prolix, Victorian  narrative I continually had to remind myself of the period of writing and the very important place it occupies in the history of the mystery novel. However, I certainly appreciated the ground-breaking use of the epistolary style and the intrigue of the web Collins weaves.  It's definitely worthy of a read for the sake of its importance and craft, but don't be expecting a page-turner!

B00D1QBQ2G|5.0|Franco Fagioli is universally recognized as one of the finest countertenors performing today and for once in recent history we have a large number of countertenors for he many roles being placed once again on opera stages. Fagioli is from Argentina, is in his early 30s and his voice, with its huge three-octave range, has been unanimously praised for its beauty, while his dazzling virtuoso technique has set new performance standards. Here on his recording he evokes the musical world of Caffarelli with the young and dynamic orchestra Il Pomo D'Oro under its director Riccardo Minasi.<br /><br />Caffarelli (born Gaetano Majorana) was, with Farinelli, the most famous castrato in operatic history. His vocal and interpretative brilliance - and his mercurial temperament - fascinated the audiences of his time: For each of his musical triumphs there was a story of artistic rivalries and eccentric escapades. Over his sometimes stormy career he amassed a fortune and was honored with the title of Duke of San Dorato. Caffarelli created roles in Handel's Serse et Faramondo and it was for him that the composer wrote Serse's celebrated aria `Ombra mai fu'.The album from Naïve Records includes a  full-color 76-page booklet with essays and pictures about the music life in Naples, Caffarelli and Farinelli.<br />There is little to say except a sigh of awe in the prformances here recorded. Fagiloi's technique is effortless and flawless and he is matched in caliber by the fine orchestral support from Minasi.  The works included here are as follows:<br /><br />Cafaro: Rendemi pi&ugrave; sereno (from L'Ipermestra)<br />Hasse, J A: Fra l'orror della tempesta (from Il Siroe, Re di Persia)<br />  Ebbi da te la vita (from Il Siroe, Re di Persia)<br />Leo:  Misero pargoletto (from Demofoonte)<br />Sperai vicino il lido (from Demofoonte)<br />Manna: Cara ti lascio, addio (from Lucio Vero ossia Il Vologeso)<br />  Odo il suono di tromba guerriera (from Lucio Papiro dittatore)<br />Pergolesi: Lieto cos&igrave; talvolta (from Adriano in Siria)<br />Porpora: Passaggier che sulla sponda (from Semiramide riconosciuta)<br />Sarro: Un cor che ben ama (from Valdemaro)<br />Vinci, Leonardo: In braccio a mille furie (from Semiramide Riconosciuta)<br /><br />This is one of those rare recordings that will doubtless be headed for awards. Magnificent singing magnificently accompanied and recorded.

B00947N6D8|5.0|As an aunt with a toddler niece & nephew, I have seen my fair share of animated movies. This  one is at the top of the list, trust me! You don't see many animated movies with a deeply rooted meaning that can both entertain & move you, but Guardians delivers. Aside from being ridiculously cute & funny (no naughty words or innuendo), it teaches children that fear is a poison that can only discourage you & keep you from achieving your goals in life. It teaches that hope & faith are at the center of success & happiness. It isn't about the Boogie Man & fictitious childhood heroes like Santa Clause & the Easter Bunny. It's about so much more. With all the political & social unrest in the world, children need more movies like Rise of the Guardians for positive encouragement. I highly recommend this for all ages!!!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I really cannot imagine a better way to stay current on what for me is a wide range of idiosyncratic topics. Using it on Kindle Fire Hd without any glitches.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|A) Don't listen to the religious fanatics who have negative things to say about this movie. Those who live by the code, \\"Thou shalt not judge\\", are usually the first to cast stones. What good is the testimony of a hypocrite? Trust me, The Princess & the Frog has absolutely nothing to do with encouraging the use of dark magic. Voodoo is simply used as a cinematic device to emphasize the overall life lesson of the movie. And that is the very hard fact that nothing worth having is achieved through magic or wishing. It teaches children the value of hard work & not taking \\"the easy way out\\". Your children will not become evil & join a cult after watching this. And it will not give them nightmares. My 7 year old niece & 4 year old nephew LOVE this movie. Should a child be accompanied by an adult while viewing this? As with all tv, YES. People should stop counting on TV to raise their children the way they want them to be raised. Tv cant take the place of your duties as a guardian.<br /><br />B) This movie is not racist. People are only saying it's racist because for the first time in a Disney movie, predominately white characters are not at the forefront of the plot. There is nothing wrong with highlighting a specific race or culture in a Disney film. Disney's been doing it with American whites for years... And for anyone saying this movie is racist towards African Americans, no dice. I've been to New Orleans & I'm quite the history buff. The portrayal of both AA & white cultures in 1930s New Orleans society is right-on-point. Nothing vaguely racist about it.<br /><br />As a bi-racial person (both African American & Swiss American), I personally enjoyed this movie the million times I've watched it. It has fantastic meaning & the story-line truly is captivating. If you can get past the restraints that religion places on society & just watch this movie with an OPEN MIND, you'll enjoy it. Trust me.

8866137626|3.0|It's been suggested (here and elsewhere) that Moleskine/Evernote consider marketing the tagging stickers separately from the notebooks. Great idea, but I doubt it will happen, and here's why: the sticker recognition only works when the stickers are applied to the special Evernote Moleskine pages, with either the dotted lines or dotted grid.<br /><br />As an experiment I tried applying stickers to regular Moleskine notebook pages and to plain notebook pages and the app didn't recognise them and wouldn't auto-tag. The app is clearly designed to look for the sticker *and* the special dotted lines. So all the evidence suggests that this is a carefully constructed closed ecosystem. (And the advantage to both companies in promoting loyalty to two products/services is pretty clear.) So users can forget about using/reusing the tagging stickers on their other regular Moleskine notebooks or on other documents. Manual tagging and indexing only for these things.<br /><br />Embracing this system as an existing Moleskine user, therefore, means switching from your previously preferred notebook. (And if you like plain, unlined pages, that means you're out of luck. You're also out of luck if you use several different Moleskines, perhaps mixing the classic notebooks with Cahiers and Volants.) Personally, I like grid pages and the dotted grid, while not quite as refined as the solid line grid, suits me ok. What I'm less keen on is the obvious branding of the embossed cover, which is a bit cheesy with all its clip-art style images. Not classy or \\"timeless\\" in the Moleskine tradition.<br /><br />To be blunt, the Evernote iOS apps work just fine scanning pages from most documents and notebooks. Use dark ink and photograph the pages carefully on a dark surface and you'll be fine. Yes, you'll have to manually move those images to notebooks and assign the tags you want. But you'd be doing that with any note you created in the app anyway.<br /><br />So what does the special notebook offer:<br />1. Sheets of tagging stickers - which do work well to automatically tag and move photographed pages to folders, but only when used in the special notebook. Really, they're a gimmick, because the true value lies in...<br />2. Three months subscription to the Evernote Premium service - in my neck of the woods, that's valued at AUD15.00, which means I save AUD8.00 off the cost of purchasing a regular grid notebook and Evernote Premium service separately.<br /><br />In short, providing you're a dedicated Moleskine user who fills a classic notebook every three months *and* you are taking full advantage of Evernote Premium, this product combo is excellent value.<br /><br />In my case - because I use several different Moleskines - I find each notebook lasts me quite a bit longer than three months - closer to a year. And I'm still trying Evernote Premium (I moved to Premium as a result of the notebook purchase, which is no doubt exactly what Evernote intends from its side of this partnership). I'm not sure I really need what it offers in terms of space/uploads/additional services. So if I find I'm not exploiting it, I'll be back to the free Evernote service and regular Moleskines, sans cheesy embossed covers.

B00007E8O5|5.0|Jerry Cantrell's first solo album was, to be polite, forgettable. His second release, a double album, atones for the failure of the first. Any fan of 1990's Alice in Chains should add this album to their music collection. If you do not care for Alice in Chains, you will likely not care for this, either. The album's 25 songs vary greatly from heavy metal to somber accoustic to bluegrass/country; even some pop rock, much like Alice in Chains' catalog. Songs like \\"Pig Charmer\\" and \\"Spiderbite\\" will satiate any metal fan's ears. I highly recommend this album to any fan of metal/rock music, most especially past, or current, fans of Alice in Chains.

After several disturbing nightmares and hallucinations about severe weather, Curtis, who lives in a suburban area and works at a blue collar job, decides to renovate his storm shelter. But even while doing this, he doubts his own sanity (his mother was institutionalized for schizophrenia many years ago), and visits a counselor. His wife and brother and co-workers become very concerned about him, but he can't be dissuaded.<br /><br />The plot moves along at a slow pace with some intense emotional scenes well acted by Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as his wife. A sense of doom pervades the plot, as you fear that Curtis' irrational actions are going to spiral into madness and ruin his family life and marriage. And he can't seem to stop it. After he builds the storm shelter, there is a storm warning and they spend the night in the shelter, but it's not a major storm. The family eventually takes their summer vacation at a beach house at the urging of a psychiatrist that Curtis visits, and all seems normal until the final scenes of the movie. A menacing storm arrives and the movie ends... everything unresolved, leaving you to make up your own ending. I liked the movie well enough right up until the ending, but then I couldn't figure out what I thought about it.... Thought provoking and complex - I'll be thinking about this movie for a while.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Lots of great special effects.  LOTS of things blowing up and major sound effects.  Good addition to on-going Star Trek &#34;history.&#34;
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Steelheart is a bit different than Sanderson's previous work, but not in a bad way.  It's basically a really, REALLY good movie screenplay.  Concepts, background, characters are all distilled into a very concentrated, very potent form.  This is used in the best fashion, to let the worldbuilding (that Sanderson is incredibly good at, evinced by his other stories) fall a bit to the wayside and get to the action ASAP.  Many will say that it uses tropes a bit too much, using archetypes to make you \\"know\\" a character without so much character development, but I see this as serving a greater goal.  Like a comic book (and given the series setting, this is infinitely appropriate) it paints in broad strokes the background so that the pacing of the story is kept tight and taught.  It also has a second, meta-contextual level that makes it a subtle commentary on both humanity, as well as our fascination with the super-hero/villain and the power-fantasy.  Who are the heroes in this story?  Who, the villains?  And what, ultimately, is the differentiation?  Steelheart poses all these questions to the reader, I'm fascinated by where Sanderson is going with this?  The only drawback is that the series isn't done yet!  And isn't a film(s)!  Hollywood/HBO, THIS is your next blockbuster (doesn't hurt that much of the action revolves around \\"ordinary\\" humans, might keep the VFX budget a bit under control.
0470913029|5.0|My daughter ordered this book as she is always looking for ways to eat healthier foods.  I do not use this how can I rate it for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow! What a great story. I couldn't put it down. It has everything you could want - hope, love, heartbreak, murder, mystery and much more. I can't wait to read the next installment in this very engaging series. It's a definite must read.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The only negative is waiting for coins to play another game. I love the real feeling to it. It feels like you are playing in person with a deck of cards.
159562015X|5.0|I work somewhere where you constantly get told everything you're doing wrong.  I bought this book to make me feel better about me but learned even more than I expected in the process.  I highly recommend this to everyone!
B0091REZMW|3.0|As a way to pass the time, this game is perfectly fine. Daily logging on allows you to win prizes just don't be in a hurry to complete it all at once, that way it  shouldn't cost you extra.
B007GYM86M|4.0|Great read. Truly interesting to learn more about his life behind the scenes. The account from all of his past friends and family is a great treasure all wrapped up into one read. A National treasure that left this world WAY too soon.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Read them in elementary school and loved them. Now I've graduated high school and started reading them again and love the series just as much.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I don't have this anymore. I thought it was a game.  Hmmmm have to learn to read better.took it off my kindle
B0012HEB32|4.0|Good piece of action and sci-fi, intresting background plot and character personality. Anyway I like powerful girls. It should be admitted that it isn't original to see yet another commander Data-like character
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. I am not good at it.grandkids love it.thanks so.much Amazon we really like you.a good game for<br />10 year olds.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|While the unit is functionally very nice, it makes noises when data throughput is high. I suspect this is some small coil or other electronics inside the unit. When I do heavy download/uploading through it, I can hear very feint sounds, similar to a hard disk seeking. This could be slightly annoying in otherwise silent environments.<br /><br />Also, the blue LED is obnoxiously bright.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I don't play this game. My grandson really likes it. He plays until my kindle goes dead. A good and interesting  game from Amazon.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Living in the Pacific Northwest, the weather can change drastically at a moment's notice. The regular updates on Weather Live help me in making decisions about wardrobe &amp; travel arrangements.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I didn't understand this game. So I just deleted it. Maybe should read more reviews before buying. Will study a few more reports before ordering. One good thing, you can delete them, if you don't like them.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|This product is awesome! Super comparable to the Boss TU-3. Practically the same pedal. The only difference to me was that the Boss pedal is made out of metal and seems a little more sturdy, and this is just a super strong plastic with some metal parts. But you shouldn't be smashing your tuner pedal much anyways so they both should hold up equally. The best part of this is I ordered it halfway through a Thursday and it was at my doorstep early on the following Saturday morning! Worth the buy!
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I have always loved the material from these shows. I found myself listening to the orginal records and the CDs for many years. When I saw that there was going to be a new release I was beyond excited!  This box set does not disappoint.  If is an amazing release!  I must own!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Game appears to work better than vice city, which i also own. Only issue is downloaded money pack never showed, working on that with gameloft. Otherwise, great!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I love me sum zombies and these zombies are the stuff. Spoiler alert... They find a cure in the diseases that already exist. Everyone who gets a deadly disease is invisible to zombies.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|We are The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club, to know more about this book, go to the post in our website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you are interested, you can visit our website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club's Review:<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />I'm bookstruck. Yes, Book Addicts, I'm not only madly in love with Travis Maddox, but I'm truly, madly in love with Beautiful Disaster.<br />After a few interviews with some authors, I saw that they had a thing for Travis Maddox and this book, so I needed to know this guy. And holy grail of hot characters!<br />The story of this two characters, Abby and Travis, is a mess. Their relationship is a train wreck and they are a disaster. I totally understand now the title of this book.<br />Abby Abernathy has a lot of potential as a character, however there's a lot of times that you want to slap her for a lot of reasons. She's smart and it's not afraid to say or do whatever she wants. However she has some moments that you start to doubt her. Like when her father arrives at college and she's in mode salvation on. I would slap her and her father for being such a jackass who has a serious problem. Or when she has a possessive controlling moment with Travis. I mean, girl, tell him to give you some space, I you love him, but you need to tell him that he's overreacting and it's being controlling and exhausting.<br />Another thing I didn't like, probably because I was Team Travis from the first page, was Abby's relationship with Parker. Come on, girl! The boy is exhausting in a boring way. He's the typical wealthy, handsome boy who's going to Harvard. And Abby goes with him, because it's the right thing to do. She cannot go back to her old life, and Travis represents all of that.<br />Travis Maddox, well, ladies, I'm in love with him. He starts like a player/heartbreaker/womanizer and ends up being a desperate/puppy guy. How the hell did that happen? I mean, it's okay to change the guy, because If I were Abby, I won't date him If he was saying other girls, but to \\"turn him\\" in a needy guy? Come on, where's the Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox? I kind of missed him at the end of the book.<br />Despite this, Travis is a sweet guy, that was waiting for the right girl. The right girl who would make him stop partying, stop the fights, stop the one night stands and turn him into the perfect guy who would do anything and everything for her. And that her is definitely (*drum roll*) me Abby.<br />Okay, one tiny little thing that I like, but didn't find believable was the bet. I loved how they played along and Abby kept her promise, but in a real situation, with a boy you have just met... would you go live with him, for a month? Even If it's Travis Maddox? Don't think so. It was not realistic at all. However, I liked it. This bet, put the two of them in a situation where their sexual attraction is really tested and they barely hold themselves. And in more than one of those situations you want to slap Abby for being so naïve and not see how much Travis had changed and how much he cared about her.<br />And who's the character you hate the most in this story? Abby's father. He's a jerk that thinks that her daughter screwed his life by taking his luck away from him. Say what? Yep. A total moron. He clearly hates her daughter and it's not ashamed to show it. So when he shows up and asks Abby's help, I kind of hated him and couldn't believe that she said yes.<br />I loved Travis' family. It's like a house full of sweet testosterone and I saw that Abby was comfortable around the boys. It's like she was supposed to by with this family from the beginning. They're beyond sweet and we loved them for it!<br />This story is full of tension, drama, fights, bad decisions and true love. I really enjoyed it, but, as I said before, this true are both a mess and they need to heal first, before being together in a relationship. They are a bomb that you expect to see it blow up during theirrelationship, and that bomb would mean break-up and drama, high level drama. And at some point, you that bomb goes off. It was a matter of time. Their love story is surely intense and they both need to improve some things, like Travis controlling character, or Abby's insecurities, but this story shows us that, sometimes, love is enough.<br />Why I highly recommend this book? Because Abby and Travis relationship has such a strong intensity and passion that would consume you. And because they are a mess, they need one another to heal and be a better person.relationship, and that bomb would mean break-up and drama, high level drama.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The plot was interesting, it was well written, and relevant. Great characters. I couldn't wait to get home and read more!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|my son loves this movie.  The special effects are great and he's learning about the mythical gods/creatures of lore too!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For once, the sequel draws you in like a visit from your favorite friend. Well written as only King can be. Just when you think he couldn't tell a story to beat the many he has told before, he slams another one home. If you liked The Shining, you will love seeing Danny Torrance again. Doctor Sleep is a must read for every Constant Reader.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a real fun &amp; easy spider card game.  I like the automatic feature (and that you can turn it off).  I also liked the different backgrounds &amp; card backs available.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This novel is a throwback to King\\"s early works. It meshes the original \\"The Shining\\" reminiscent of \\"It\\". BRAVO!<br /><br />Claymate
B00AESN8XY|5.0|BEST GAME EVER. YOU MUST HAVE THIS GAME. IT ONLY GETS BETTER AND BETTER THE FARTHER YOU GET! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! MORE! MORE!
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Great collection of Whitney tunes.  THe only thing missing is her Star Spangled Banner, but I'll just purchase that separately as an individual song.  Love this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am addicted to this game...everyday and every night I have to play. Fantastic graphics and very challenging. I can only hope that I beat all of my friends scores.
B0000024YL|3.0|I grew up in the 70s, so I just know I'll be able to sing almost all the song on this CD by heart.  I love Paul Simon and his wit, so I know I'll love the non-classics on the disc as much as I enjoy the classic songs.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I don't usually review games, but I felt on this game I must. The plot... not much to say. Om nom travels in time to meet his ancestors. But who gets games for their plot anyway!? On to the gameplay. Awesome. Although it does resemble the original in a way. Something about it feels brand new. Maybe it's the new objects (blades and bombs anyone?), Or the stunning HD graphics. Who knows? One complaint however... only about 1/3 the amount of levels than the previous hit game. Why? I have no idea. There is (or so it says) more on the way, giving me a reason to hope for more soon. Oh, and one more thing. This game is extremely hard at times. I have managed to collect all the stars, but not without truckloads of effort. So anyway, Have fun!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Another well written book by Ken Follett covering all countries involved in WW11. Love the way he incorporates the true history of events into a novel.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have been playing this game for a couple of days now (not continuously) and am having a wonderful time.  The game is challenging and contains a nice variety of puzzles at various levels of difficulty.  This is a fun way to waste some time.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|If you need to increase your signal strength then this is the item for you... I love it, finally am able to reach out into the distance...I am using the antenna that came with the unit, don't think I will need to get a larger one..
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The book is a great read. It displays a rollercosters of emotions, and makes you cheer in victory when the enemy is defeated.
B00371QQ2U|1.0|I like to collect the movies I really enjoy. Apollo 13 is one of the best movies I have seen and deserves a 5-star rating on its own, but this review is for the Blu-Ray disc I received. In short, I purchased this understanding that it was a NEW copy. It was not. The movie was sold by Phase 3 LLC and fulfilled by Amazon. The first thing I noticed was that the front appeared rippled and the shrink wrap was not normal for a Blu-Ray (I've worked at Target's entertainment department for 13 years, I'm very familiar with the wrap). After opening it I discovered the plastic was more the consistency of Saran Wrap than the typical cellophane. The inside of the case contained odd white particles and the disc had finger prints on the back side of the disc.<br /><br />Basically, this movie is fantastic, but I wouldn't trust Phase 3 LLC or Amazon on what they consider new and used. From now on I will only buy an older movie from Amazon when there is no other option.<br /><br />EDIT: I also just noticed that the corner of the case is broken, but no pieces fell out on the table I unwrapped it at. This tells me the case was definitely re-shrink wrapped.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After looking and comparing we purchased the Anker 8000.  It arrived early, and very simple setup.  We added all the weights and programmed the profiles easily.  The quality is good and has made gaming more efficient than using a regular 2 button mouse.<br />I would definitely recommend this to others wanting to up their gaming from a regular mouse and take it to the next level. We feel that this was a great price for a great product!  We have paid more in the past for less functionality and quality.  We are very pleased with this purchase and would definitely purchase more from Anker.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|I didnt find this book useful or informative.  It seemed to me to be a history of Javascript and HTML5.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All my friends were recommending this book, so I finally bought and read it and now I see why they were suggesting it. The book is very well written, with believable characters, situations, and the characters' s responses to those situations.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|One of Their Best Recordings. Lots of new things to listen to here. Love the use of slide guitar and keyboards. Seasons of Your Day and Flying Low the stand out tracks for me. The organ intro at the beginning of the CD was amazing. I gave it 5 stars myself - the recording seems to have taken place at one time rather than at different times in the last 17 years. I've played it over 100 times and it along with the two Hope solo albums will get lots of play. YUM! Way to go Mazzy Star! I've heard that they have enough additional material for another album - can't wait.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I first played this game last year on my aunts iPad, but now I have my kindle to play this game!! It's super fun if you like taking care of horses (and a bit addictive ) and u can buy a UNICORN!!! ^_^ but if u like action and killing then I recommend u to not get it..... I love it!!!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|No romance novel could compare to this. Louisa may Alcott was the best writer ever!  Must read for all wages
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun, before you know it you'll have played for an hour. I absolutely love love love this game!!!!!!!
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|this app is like i went back in time. i recommend it for all of us old schoolers. worth the money
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in 4 days...the first book I've picked up in years. Felt so good to ESCAPE into a story. I think I've found a new hobby. Now onto book two!!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 9 year old grandson loves this game and says its better than the first one in many ways. He rates it excellent.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is so amazing I could cry right now.<br />And it is so cool that I am on level 17.
B00B2166BS|1.0|The cable does NOT work as described.  It never worked from the first second I got it out of the box.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Absolutely love this fun and rewarding game, my favorite past time to relax with and no other will do !!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a very fun, addictive game. I love all the movies. The game is very much like the movie. I like making the families.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I spent 1 hour watching the first 30 minutes of the video. What I saw was good but waiting for this thing to download was the worst I have experienced. I gave up on the video at the rate it was downloading it would take over 4 hours to watch. I do not have a problem with my provider the problem is your facilities. Please do not charge me for this. I just upgraded to Amazon Prime and it did not make a difference. Please advise.
014241543X|5.0|Amazing!! I couldn't put this book down, I just had to find out what Mia would ultimately decide! I loved how the author was able to fit so much of the background and history into the story and characters even though the book itself  takes place over just one day. The blending of memories and the present events was flawless. If you love YA read this book, even if you don't, still read this book! In YA lit it's right up there for me with the haunting Thirteen Reasons Why. Both truly breathtaking and beautiful reads.<br />One of the best goodwill book finds I've had!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I bought this mouse primarily for gaming, and it's pretty good so far.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Smooth scroll wheel<br />-Adjustable weights included<br />-Programmable buttons<br />-Good response<br />-Sturdy cord<br />-DPI adjustable on the go<br />-Very reasonable price!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The \\"customizable\\" lights don't seem to work the way intended...trying to use a custom color results in a random color showing up on the mouse. Oh well.<br />-The thumb buttons on the side are easy to accidentally click. I'm not sure how the design could be adjusted to fix this.<br />-Those thumb buttons also seem loosely attached, they shift around when touched even if no pressure is applied. Not really a problem but it's a little annoying.<br />-Doesn't come with the control panel software (at least my purchase didn't). I had to download from the manufacturer's website.<br />-For some reason my games don't seem to recognize the 3 thumb buttons as such. I need to first program them to a specific key that I know I won't use, and then assign that key in the game. My previous mice never required that extra step, I'm not sure what the deal is there.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I'm quite happy with the mouse. Any of the cons I listed weren't huge problems, more of little things that made me knock off a full star.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|My dad saw the original on VHS, he was amazed at the clarity of the picture and the details you could see. Lots of extras too.
0425263916|5.0|Read the Crossfire series and can't wait for book #4 to come out. I would recommend this especially if you liked the Fifty Shades of Grey series
B00C90T4QK|5.0|I absolutely love this album! I was very excited to see that Young at Heart is one of the songs!
0810979772|4.0|I got this for my grandson ( 8 years old) for christmass. He like these books and I think he will have a great time with this one.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I have really enjoyed this soundtrack. There isn't one song on it that I don't love. I love the combination of new and old.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|Old uncle Henry, wish everyone could have one. Albert Finney is perfect as Henry. &#34; Do you know why I like wine? He asked. Picked early or late, this delightful nectar will wish per in your mouth, it can not lie. ( A close translation).<br />A movie of just his lines would be great, but pop in Fanny Channel and madam Duflot, mix a little Charles Tenent and enjoy a feast.
B009AOFNU4|1.0|I bought this controller for use with my nexus 10, once it arrived I excitedly put it through the paces. The real make it or break test for me was playing a platformed. I found Super Mario World to be intolerable due to the latency if this device. The control sticks also do not seem to register graduation, you are either tilting left or not at all, there is no strong left or weak left. For the price I am extremely disappointed, this is what I would expect from a 10 maybe 20 dollar device. I expect better from steel series as a owner of many of their mice's and keyboards over the years.
B000O179EK|2.0|I wonder if it was a blank disk with a label on it? Tried two different players, would not load.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft is the greatest app. Plus I love CREEPERS. MINE CRAFT MINE CRAFT MINE CRAFT MINE CRAFT MINE CRAFT MINE CRAFT MINE CRAFT
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved Husband secret. A wonderful tale of the complexities of life and the wonderfully terrible impact every decision we make has.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game or is almost like subway surf but better for kids because it does not make you side with a graffiti artist
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game so much because it is not boring at like all that's why I like it so much
B00DU77QP2|5.0|Really enjoyed this book as it was a great easy holiday read!  I recommend it for all ages. Very similar to hunger games & vampire books with more action!!
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I give it 4 stars because the button on the bottom piece feels really cheap. It works, but I decided not to use it. You still have to turn the top to power on after you put the kit together which I am guessing is the reason some reviews say that this product doesn't work. The button issue aside, I think the kit is worth it for the LED upgrade alone. It is much brighter than the stock incandescent bulb.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game takes me and can take you to a land that your mind can't . It's is awesome and very fun
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Respected Nikki's honesty.  Speaks truth of the addictive behaviors addicts have.  And some hilarious moments that made me laugh out loud.
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|You might think it's faint praise to say a musical act gives listeners more of the same especially when the *same* is from 15 years ago.  But that's not what Mazzy Star is about as listeners know.  This is both a good starting point for new listeners and a great continuation of their work for the longtime fans.  It's actually sort of surprising that they sound as good as they do after all this time. The same instrumentation and vocals are there for a nice set of atmospheric music.  I'm really enjoying it.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|It's not boring, at the very least, and it was truly entertaining, to say the most about it. Anyway, it was for entertainment that I watched it so I got my money's worth. Great acting from what I thought was a bunch of mediocre actors. Dancing was fantastic; very athletic in some cases!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my son loves this app. wish it were easier to move to higher levels without paying.  waiting for the next one
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I never thought I've not known much about our planet! I was convinced I knew the fundamentals, which could help me cruise a conversation or two about our planet, but was I wrong! This DVD indeed gives a real picture of what our planet is and what it can become, for better or worse, depending on what we do about it for stewardship.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Only read after I saw the trailer for the 2nd movie.  So glad I did.  Now I need to see the first movie and read the next book.  I'm sure neither will disappoint. Yf
B00003CXFV|5.0|No matter how many times i watch this movie, i still cry at the end!!!! watch it over and over...sender did good, worth the money, would do it again. could onley find on Amazon!! thanks!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love love love this app.but it stopped working on my kindle fire HD and&nbsp;won't let me log bac in for some reason other wise this app is perfect
B000002O7C|5.0|Great soundtrack. My family has always loved the Hunt for Red October movie and now love the soundtrack as well.
B002PE0HCU|3.0|...the movie really doesn't stand the test of time.<br />We bought it after going to visit Bodega Bay up the coast from San Francisco so it was fun to be there and see the places in the movie.  But the story line really is ridiculous.  Guess it was scarier when I was a kid.  :)
0060555661|4.0|Book tells the real facts.it can change ur mindset.it transforms u.a book relevant in all times.amust read for all those who want to make money from stock market
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I thought this book had beautiful detail and some unexpected twists I enjoyed it so much and I can't wait to start the next one.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is a great app.it is colorful ,easy to use, and informative. I Like it after lot,and recommend it to all.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|This spring I walked the Camino de Santiago--over five hundred miles--in my Teva Tanzas. They were fantastic. Light and comfortable, they handled every type of terrain imaginable: from mountain trails to cobbled streets, to mile after mile of concrete and asphalt. And all this with a 30 lb pack on my back. Most people wore traditional hiking boots and thought I was nuts wearing my Tevas. I had actually started the Camino in Traditional boots,but soon switched to my Tevas after my well broken in boots began chewing up my feet.  I never looked back. Even through the rain, snow, and mud their performance was exceptional. I will not hike in anything else.<br /><br />Unfortunately that pair of Tevas only lasted about ten months before the soles wore out, but I figure I put somewhere around fifteen hundred miles on them in hard daily  use, so I don't think I can complain about them not lasting longer. In fact, I just bought two more pairs because since the Camino the Teva Tanza have become my goto footwear for everything.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Reading most of Cornwall's novels, I found that I preferred some of the earlier ones. She has added so many layers and characters, I think it took away from her plotting skills. This one was more plot – driven, and I appreciated having a bit more of Lucy. My rating is actually a 3.5, but I'm willing to extend to four stars.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I've read some reviews starting box damage and bad paint jobs and I have to admit I find so very few errors on mine. First-off, my box arrived in perfect condition, none of the bend edges or water damage as mentioned in some of the other reviews; the tissue paper was torn when I opened the shipping box, but I was going to tear that off anyway so I didn't care. Secondly the paint, I've seen several photos and video reviews online where the figures appear to have sloppy painted edges, mainly around the tops of the boots and where the skirt and top meet,  mine lacked these errors.<br /><br />I preordered this back in July to ensure I received a 1st edition, I really wanted the winking face,  and I am very happy with this figure.  My only complaint is that the stand is a tad hard to work with. The clamps that go around Sailor Moon's waist could have had a tighter fit, and sometimes if you don't balance the figure with the stand properly she falls, but other then that I'm thrilled with this figure. I've found that the trick with the stand is that you have to balance the middle with the figure or else she weights more then it can support, once i figured this out she stopped falling.<br /><br />I've been a Sailor Moon fan since 1995, have collected several figures over the years, and I couldn't be happier with this figure! I can't wait until Venus comes out.
0345803485|2.0|Kudos to the author for being able to write--and sell--so many copies of this book. The writing is competent enough, but it is virtually impossible to suspend disbelief with this book. We begin with a 22 year old woman who is a virgin--yet gorgeous--and somehow so socially awkward that she's never really had a boyfriend and blushes no less than eight million times throughout the book. Unfortunately, it reminded me of the Twilight series, and that is not a compliment. She drones on and on about how beautiful Christian is--repeatedly--and the author reuses so many phrases and words that it becomes about as pleasing as getting a kidney punch by the end of the first book. I won't be going on with the rest of the series.<br /><br />Then there is Christian, who at 27 has already become a pilot, finished college, oh--and become a billionaire. Yet he spends most of his time sitting around and emailing or texting like a teenager.<br /><br />The sex--not nearly as risqué as I was expecting, but perhaps this appeals to middle-aged soccer moms who haven't experienced anything like it? Not sure. I don't want to waste too much time talking about it since the other reviewers have accurately portrayed what the book is like.
B0025KVLTM|1.0|While Sgt. Pepper's is one of the most influential and well-crafted pieces of music in the modern era, this CD is to be avoided. To play it on a Windows computer requires the installation of Quicktime, a buggy piece of software that is an open conduit for malware. There are no individual audio tracks on the CD; no .wav files, no MP3s. You must use Quicktime or, on Linux the free and open source VLC player. Even then, the audio breaks up continuously during playback. The whole point appears to prevent you from getting fair use of the music you have purchased. While I have never done so before, with the nefarious and inferior nature of this CD I must recommend you buy the tracks elsewhere or pirate them. This CD is not a standard audio CD, as advertised, and isn't worth the plastic it's burned onto.

B0089EHWQE|3.0|This book was well written. The main characters had a good voice but about halfway through I realized this book wasn't what I expected, not entirely in a positive way. I'm still not sure if I feel manipulated by the plot, which I thought would be about love but ended up being about something else. Still worth reading though.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Teen Beach Movie is a breakout part for Ross Lynch of 'Austin & Ally Fame'. Ross is a natural casting for this role, as Ross is the mirror reflection of surfboards and musical numbers. With college level acting training, Lynch has the potential to be an actor on an extremely high level. Remember though Elvis Presley did not have formal acting training when he did all of those beach movies and other movies in the 1960's. Lynch is extraordinarily liked by young people, though not loved to the extent David Cassidy triggered teen idolatry.<br /><br />Lynch is cast as the teen beach love interest of Maia Mitchell. The additional rehearsal footage of the musical numbers which comes with the DVD shows the musically talented Lynch to be a relaxed performer, while the musically talented Mitchell appeared tense and not so thrilled to be working with Lynch.<br /><br />The Teen Beach Movie comes off like a teeny bopper version of Grease crossed with West Side Story given a modern cable television treatment. The choreography is spectacular to perfection, the music numbers divine. Broadway actor Kevin Chamberlain of 'Jessie' fame is again typecast in a silly role. Truth is Chamberlain has the potential to be a box office movie star if given the correct role, but he is being stereotyped worse than Jonathan Harris on 'Lost in Space' or Paul Lynde in the center square of 'Holylwood Squares'. Chamberlain's appearance is sparingly, though. He does not distract from the main characters or the movie plot.<br /><br />The main criticism here is not with Disney. This is a fantastic movie for young people and absolutely clean. The main issue is whether Ross Lynch wants to continue protecting a an image which is too clean. He does not kiss Mitchell with any love intentions during the entire movie, and Disney needed to accomplish this for maximum effect. However, conversely, Miley Cyrus PR team has has her image publicly trashed in overexposure to the extent nobody wants to see her image anymore. Ross needs to be able to kiss a girl, be more of an action actor, if he wants to break out of the teen mold. One noticeable point is Maia Mitchell is so totally beautiful opposite Lynch, it becomes obvious to the movie viewer that Laura Marano, Lynch's co-star in Austin & Ally, is a talented actress but extremely homely. Why Disney Studios would do Teen Beach Movie to such complexity and not have Lynch and Mitchell do more than embrace is a mystery, but the net effect of it is the movie will not reach prime time but is doomed to Disney channel and download because it is not romantically bold enough to become a mainstream crossover work. All being said, it is an excellent kids movie nonetheless and a musical achievement for Disney, who hopefully will transition Lynch to the movie big screen leap beyond television, where Marano is trapped.

B007V65R54|5.0|Full disclosure: I was a massive skeptic of this book before reading it. I was in college during the &#34;poker boom,&#34; and met countless college kids who thought they were the next Chris Moneymaker. The fields that Silver discusses in the book (baseball, poker, politics, etc.) are full of arrogant d-bags making obnoxious predictions--but Silver sets himself apart as a genius of prediction whose methods are based on Bayesian theory.<br /><br />The book gives the reader many opportunities to put its theories to the test, and I am absolutely going to put the question to Bayesian thinking in my next card game with my wife!<br /><br />The book is muddy in many parts, which will probably frustrate you. Nearly all of its conclusions are uncertain. If you read the book slowly, however, you will realize that is the point--life is full of uncertainty!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|At times it seemed the intention was to drag out the story line rather than it naturally moving along.  Too graphic in its depictions of violence.  Less is more in my opinion.  But overall entertaining.

B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|Upon it's release, I initially avoided After Earth like I would a pack of rabid baboons. Terrible critic reviews and middling audience feedback gave me the impression that this promising-sounding sci-fi was another one of M. Night Shyamalan's recent streak of bad films.<br /><br />When I actually watched it on DVD (thankfully, on our HD TV), I expected the ABSOLUTE worst, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie was NOT a miserable trainwreck. It wasn't great, wasn't classic. Wasn't even entirely awesome. But, as I begrudgingly had to admit, After Earth was the first watchable Shyamalan movie since Signs, nd not a *bad* movie...<br /><br />That having been said, the movie had flaws big enough to drive Shyamalan's ego through. The dialogue was *absolutely* cringeworthy. Laughably serious, terribly mundane, and cliched in that way that only pulp sci-fi can be (\\"It has found you.\\"), it had that joyless quality that only Shyamalan can bring. The acting was little better.<br /><br />Will Smith is dead serious, and as stern and commanding as the world's most humorless general. The gravitas was still there (That \\"Take a knee\\" line is strangely moving), but without his usual charm and charisma, Smith Sr. seemed to drag the movie down like a guy who had both his legs broken. Oh, right...<br />Jaden has no real reason to be here (other than his father being in the same film), and we all hoped for a stronger actor, but he managed to be....watchable. Juuuust watchable, not extraordinary in any way. Though there were scenes, such as his climactic fight with the Ursa, where just a little of his father's talent and screen presence can be viewed in him.<br /><br />Other cons include the plodding pace the movie accepts at times, and the looong time it takes to get off the ground (literally). And the \\"What the--?\\" accent everyone is using. No, seriously: What the--?!<br /><br />...<br /><br />But prepare to be amazed when Shyamalan just shows you amazing stuff: a group of men jogging underneath a bloodred sun, herd of bison roaming over hills, a lush forest under the sky, a volcano floating flakes of ash down from the sky, a troop of monkeys running through a rain forest. The CGI was not the best I've ever seen, but the creature design and amazing cinematography really made up for that.<br /><br />As a huge animal lover, I was majorly entertained any time some wierd and wonderful animal came onscreen. The fact that sabretooths and giant vultures exist is absolutely ludicrous, but ludicrous in that suspend-your-disbelief-and-take-it-for-what-it-is way. Love the monkeys, but weren't there okapi's in the trailer?<br /><br />The landscape itself became a supporting character (again - the whole rainforest freezing thing is ludicrous, but passable). The cinematography was, at times extraordinary. That volcano fight at the end was gorgeously shot, and, I am ashamed to say, somewhat moving (being the only moment in the After Earth that I could actually label \\"cool\\" or \\"awesome\\"). The biggest surprise for me was the score by James Newton Howard, which made sit up straight and go \\"Whaaaat? This movie has a good score? I gotta get this on iTunes!\\" And mention has to go to the costumes and tech, and for being the first sci-fi movie that has wood and cloth interiors rather than chrome and glass, which was pleasantly original.<br /><br />And hey, that speech about danger and fear is some profound stuff, man.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />CONS: Dialogue abysmal and laughable. Acting joyless and stiff. Story unoriginal and pace plodding.<br />PROS: Stunning visuals, amazing cinematography, excellent score, costumes, and set design.<br />My rating? I give After Earth a solid 3 stars - not great, not awful. All that negative reception is understandable, but not wholly warranted. This is not a classic for the ages, but rather, a pleasantly enjoyable night at the movies!<br /><br />P.S.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|After 12 long years, Cher is finally back in amazing shape with Closer to the Truth, an album that goes toe to toe with any album out there right now. Divided between punchy, hard-hitting tracks and ballads, the upbeat half is by far the best; it's where Cher heart truly lies. Cher's voice is as strong as always but this time around it's more prominent than on her previous albums (Living Proof comes to mind...).  The highlights are many to detail but basically the first seven songs rock my socks off but the bonus tracks I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream and Pride are so fantastic that they should've been included in the standard edition.

B00BC24NT4|5.0|Forget the Russians, Chinese or even terrorists: in &#34;A Delicate Truth,&#34; his latest espionage thriller, John Le Carr&eacute; (&#34;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&#34;) conjures a world in which mercenaries and their weak-kneed enablers in the government turn dishonest dollars  based on lethal lies and misrepresentation..<br /><br />It used to be good guys versus bad guys in Le Carr&eacute;'s fictional universe. At times there wasn't much separating them, but at least they were working against each other. In his craven new post-Iron curtain universe, almost everybody is a bad guy -- even the people who served as heroes in his earlier works.<br /><br />The novel's plot is sordid and anything but simple: the &#34;delicate truth,&#34; of the title is the counterpart to the official lies used to cover up an intelligence catastrophe that occurred on the British colony of Gibraltar during the Gordon Brown era. The disaster occurs when a team of British special ops soldiers are assigned to snatch a terrorist who is supposedly temporarily hiding on the island. Although British troops are used for the op, control over it has been ceded to a private intelligence-for-hire company by the British government.<br /><br />As it turns out, however, the corrupt U.S. firm is only interested in collecting Her Majesty's paycheck for the job: the terrorist has actually never been on the island. Two innocents are accidentally murdered during the botched kidnapping..<br /><br />Despite the screw-up, the operation is termed a success and everyone involved is either paid off or discredited. One of them is Kitt Probyn, a past-his-prime Foreign Office flunkie who was assigned to oversee the scheme because the British military would not commit combat troops to an operation that was not putatively under the control of the foreign office. Probyn, a kindly and patriotic bureaucrat, is far out of his depth, a perfect foil for the plot's real masterminds.<br /><br />Probyn is posted to a posh Foreign Service sinecure in the Caribbean and then pensioned off with an honorary title designed to keep him from discussing the Gibraltar incident. Meanwhile, a more astute foreign service operative named Toby Bell launches his own completely unofficial investigation into the kidnapping and its aftermath..<br /><br />Working separately, the two men meet through happenstance and piece together the real story of what happened on Gibraltar, but the novel reaches its cynical climax leaving readers uncertain whether they succeed in making &#34;the delicate truth&#34; public or are themselves victims of government suppression.<br /><br />The story is vintage Le Carr&eacute; with characters whose personalities are so clearly portrayed you can almost visualize them in your mind's eye. The plot, given the recent history of botched intelligence operations, the use of mercenaries as an adjunct to official military force, and the reliance on mendacity by governmental policy makers, seems like something you might read about in your morning paper.<br /><br />The &#34;Delicate Truth&#34; is, this novel is Le Carr&eacute;'s way of warning us that our political leaders are taking us down the garden path and we shouldn't trust them for a minute. It is clear the master spy writer is mad as hell about the way the lines have merged between government policy and private money-making schemes. &#34;The Delicate Truth&#34; is a hell of a read and Le Carr&eacute; has done us a favor by writing it.e sinecure in the Caribbean and then pensioned off with an honorary title designed to keep him from discussing the Gibraltar incident.

1781162646|4.0|Stephen King is not primarily known as a mystery writer. Nonetheless, when he writes a whodunit, he writes a good one. Such is the case with &#34;Joyland,&#34; released as a Hard Case Crime imprint in June.<br /><br />Devin Jones, a college student, takes a summer job at Joyland, a beachfront North Carolina amusement park that has seen better days. Jones, a down-and-out scholar who needs summer employment to continue his education, answers a help-wanted ad and ends up literally spending the summer as a &#34;dog's body,&#34; one of the general maintenance &#34;helpers&#34; who keep the place going.<br /><br />During Devin's first visit to the park he learns Joyland is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a young woman whose throat was slashed by a mysterious attacker in a creepy ride that is often used as a make-out spot by Joyland's teenaged patrons. The crime remains unsolved four years later and Devin takes it on as a sideline to his maintenance work.<br /><br />By the final pages, Devin gathers enough clues to unmask the villain. The solution to the mystery is not one of those cheapies where key facts are withheld until the bad guy is revealed: King arranges all the evidence as if challenging his readers to identify the culprit.<br /><br />But &#34;Joyland&#34; is not one of those novels where unmasking the villain is a critical part of the fun. Like one of the amusements at the park, the best part of &#34;Joyland&#34; is sitting back and enjoying the ride.<br /><br />All the characters in are deftly sketched and portrayed with a vivid and loving touch. Even relatively minor figures get King's undivided attention. And he makes good use of carny lingo to add believability to his characters as members of a credible subculture.<br /><br />Part of the book's charm is that it leaves the reader with the sense that he or she actually knows these people. King manages to pack more than a summer's worth of action into less than 300 pages, yet readers will finish the book wishing for more.<br /><br />-- William E. Wallacehing for more.<br /><br />-- William E. Wallace
1476727651|4.0|I'm assuming, like most King fans (hopefully), I was a little skeptical when I heard he was writing a sequel to THE SHINING.  The Stephen King of today is not the Stephen King of yesteryear; in most aspects, this is a good thing (first and foremost, he probably wouldn't still be alive), but there's no denying that his novels have changed.  For the better or worse, that's up to you (and I think it depends on the individual works); but the fact is, today's Stephen King would never have written THE SHINING in the exact same way.<br /><br />DOCTOR SLEEP got my hopes up after I started reading it.  The first 100 pages are brilliant; they're among the best King has given us recently, and fit perfectly with THE SHINING.  But as soon as Danny starts to mature, the more matured King settles in, and we're thrown into a meandering tale in which, surprisingly, there don't seem to be any real stakes; not once (outside of those first 100 pages) did I feel any of the characters were in any real danger.  King seems more focused on building character depth, which he's become fairly great at; but his characterization gets in the way of the story, slowing down the plot (remember 11/22/63, which could've done without roughly 300 pages and made a lot more sense?).<br /><br />As for plot: enter Dan Torrence.  One winter long ago, Danny and his  parents spent the winter at the Overlook Hotel.  They weren't alone there, however, and Danny's father succumbed to alcoholism and supernatural forces.  Fast forward to the present (with a detour through Danny's childhood, hence SLEEP's brilliant beginning), and Dan has hit rock bottom.  He's his father's son, a struggling alcoholic with a violent temper.  He finds his personal low...and shortly thereafter, he finds a second chance in a small New Hampshire town.  He also finds a strange pen pal: a young girl named Abra, who has the shining and has it bad.  So much so, in fact, that she's become the target of a group of psychic vampires: the True Knot, led by the sadistic Rose the Hat, who tortures children with the shining, thus gaining something pretty darn close to immortality.  The True Knot are moving in on Abra...and thanks to a third-act twist that is hardly necessary, Dan may be the only person who can help keep Abra alive.<br /><br />Except...like I said earlier: not once do you ever stop and think, \\"Huh, this may not end well for everyone involved.\\"  Part of it is King's devotion to his characters.  He goes so far out of his way to humanize everyone, you don't really see the True Knot as a real threat (except for a key early scene).  As with 11/22/63, DOCTOR SLEEP goes on too long.  It could easily have ended as soon as Abra hit her early adolescent years (no spoilers).  Instead, King draws the story out.  We get some great characters in the process, but the plot suffers.  DOCTOR SLEEP is still worthy of a spot in your collection; but it pales painfully when compared to its predecessor.  The worst sin a sequel can make is not justifying its existence as a sequel; SLEEP could've existed without Dan Torrence, since after the book gets started it's not even about him.  However, if you step back from its origins and ignore some glaring plot holes, DOCTOR SLEEP is a decent read.  Not the best King has given us, not even the best lately, but Constant Readers will still enjoy it.not, led by the sadistic Rose the Hat, who tortures children with the shining, thus gaining something pretty darn close to immortality.

B00005JN0T|2.0|A film with a lot of interesting ideas almost completely buried in over-the-top action sequences, mind-numbingly boring dialogue and surprisingly shoddy-looking special effects, this EXTREMELY loose \\"suggestion\\" of the stories of Isaac Asimov would have the master rolling in his grave, if he were trite and clich&eacute;d enough to engage in it. Mostly a mishmash of BLADE RUNNER, A.I. and every antihero cop movie ever made, the film follows Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) on a quest to find the killer of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the genius behind the workforce-dominating humanoid robots that fill up nearly every scene in this clunky CGI/live amalgamation. The film supposedly takes place in Chicago, but there is not one slight reminder of that city until a shot of the river near the very end that's vaguely recognizable. Spooner hates robots and suspects them for some reason from the beginning, but we never get to know him well enough to care; the film spends much more time erotically fascinated by Will Smith's big pecs than it does in creating a cohesive person for him to play.<br /><br />Of course, robots aren't people; robots can't kill, or so we are told. There are many quick, fleeting references to interesting themes throughout the film such as:<br />* what does it mean to be human?<br />* is hating a harmless machine similar to being racist (both Spooner and his long-suffering boss are black, in a world that seems to have nearly, but not quite, forgotten that fact)?<br />* at one point does a human with replacement parts start to become more machine than man * does it emasculate, or ameliorate humanity to have its menial tasks performed by something man-created?<br />* can you actually program a machine to think for itself?<br /><br />etc etc...but they are all subordinated to endless chases and explosions and gun battles. There are no characters of consequence here, and even the seeming possibility of a love story between Spooner and scientist Susan Calvin (based on one of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere. There just isn't time with all the action they have to put in! Not to mention dozens of product placements, and, did I forget to mention, Will Smith's perfect-as-a-robot sculpted body. In fact, given the way the principle actors seem to sleepwalk through this film, the most interesting idea I was left with was a question as to who and what was most robotic in the film; was there, in fact, any human touch to the movie at all?of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere.

B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I like this game very much. It helps you thinks before starting to play. I play it while sitting in the car traveling, when I felt tired after long hours of study, and when waiting at the doctor's office. And best of all everyone can play it without age limitations.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|I read this book about two years ago, (before I bought my Kindle) but I still remember the story quite clearly. When I started reading \\"Room\\" I wondered how the story could fill so many pages if it was all based in one room, but the author did a great job of keeping the story interesting and exciting. Exciting in an \\"Oh no\\" or \\"run quickly\\" kind of way, not exciting in a happy way. \\"Room\\" is quite a dark story.<br /><br />I'm dropping one star because of what I thought was a far fetched part of the story. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, so I won't go into too much detail. I'll just say the part of the story where the little boy was quietly rolled up in the piece of carpet seemed a bit far fetched. In saying that I can see the author had to move the story on and I can't think of another way she could have done that? So, maybe I'm being a bit unfair. The problem for me was that part of the book pulled me out of the story because I was thinking \\"they'd never get away with that!\\"<br /><br />All in all this is a very good book. I liked the main character and her Son and rightly so I hated their kidnapper. This story really makes you think, especially as there have been so many similar stories that happened in real life. Its frightening when you think of it.....

B009AY04A8|2.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire and had similar problems as previous reviewers. If you play in timed mode, you are constantly penalized for random taps when you are just using zoom or moving around the screen. Also, the dialogue is endless.  I got bored after the first couple of conversations and tapped through, but even then it takes a while. Absolutely not worth 2.99.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|This was such an appropriate role for Nicholson in his younger years.  Without a doubt madness is his game and he could scare children without doing anything.  I could easily believe child playing his son in movie related to him or product of too many close relatives on the family tree.
0385368267|5.0|I finished this book a few days ago, and I've been in a book hangover ever since. I can't get Eleanore and Park out of my head. I can still see Eleanore and Park holding hands. There was something about that scene - when the two hold hands for the first time- that made my heart skip a beat as I read the words. Ms. Rowell allows the scene to unfold so beautifully it evoked emotions in me from the deep recesses of my brain; scenes of the first time I held a boy's hand (and I'm old enough to barely remember the first time a boy held my hand!). The beautiful language she uses to paint the scene and the voice of these two teenagers was so pure and genuine I wish I could have HUGGED those words.<br /><br />You can't help but love Eleanore, even with all her quirks. And Park is that guy from high school who would have made the perfect boyfriend, even though all the girls were probably too full of themselves to notice it. And Park's family? Don't we all wish we had parents that cool!!??<br /><br />The story takes place in the 80s, and part of me wonders if I fell in love with the book because I was a product of the 80s. But no, I don't think so. I think anybody who appreciates a good love story would love this book, no matter how old they are.<br /><br />I did spend some time with the audio version of this book (I had to take the book with me on my runs, and I found my runs were much longer listening to the audio book). I will say the readers were quite good. While I thought the voice of Eleanore sounded slightly older that a high school student's voice should sound, the voice of Park was spot on perfect. I loved how the voice of Park read Park's mom's dialogue in a fairly convincing Korean accent.<br /><br />One of my favorite books of the year. I bow to you Ms. Rowell.

B000002HK4|4.0|I really appreciate Dream Theater, bought this album, and will keep it, but it's definitely not the best album of theirs. The three-star rating is based on comparison to their other work, not to other music on the market (of which this still beats 90%). You'll really enjoy the first track, and the others are fun. It's always neat when a band covers the work of others, and these are enjoyable. However if you're looking to spend your money on only one or two Dream Theater albums, this isn't for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've bumped up my rating to four stars to match Amazon's rating guide. Three stars equates to \\"It's ok\\" and four stars is \\"I like it\\", so four stars is a more accurate rating for me.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Queen Elizabeth really annoyed me whenever there was dialogue between herself and other characters. She pretty much seemed to have a limited vocabulary, with the phrase I don't know being her major fallback. I found her boring, flat and tedious anytime she was speaking. She seemed to only have a phew key phrases that just kept getting repeated. That being said, I enjoyed the plot for the most part. I even enjoyed the the delving into Elizabeth's thought process, I just hated her dialogue. I also found King Henry a little repetitive also. I just felt that the author could have put more effort into character dialogue and conversation.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Television can be such a wasteland but I found this series appealing in so many ways--a fascinating woman lead character forced to reenter the legal world due to an unfaithful husband, a mother demonstrating strong parenting skills, a single parent struggling to find the right path to success and happiness-not just for herself but for her whole family. It's a relief to watch a program with no explicit sex scenes, violence nor vulgar language and yet have it be captivating so that you eagerly look forward to the next episode.
0446699616|2.0|I normally don't write book reviews but in this instance I felt compelled to do so. I have been a fan of Nelson DeMille since he first started writing, what, 25 years ago? I have almost always enjoyed his books and was particularly taken by \\"Charm School\\" which I always thought would make a terrific movie and which I'm surprised nobody has taken a shot at. However, I digress. I have not read any of DeMille's books for the last few years and decided recently I should get back to his writing. I therefore acquired what I think is one of his most recent books, \\"The Panther\\", a tale of trying to find and kill the terrorist (\\"The Panther\\") responsible for the attack on the Cole. The protagonist is a tough New York City detective by the name of John Corey who has been working on terrorist cases for some time. He is joined by his wife who happens to be an FBI agent also working on terrorism. Unfortunately, his wife is a unnecessary addition to the cast and adds nothing to the story. The two of them are selected to go to Yemen to hunt down and kill \\"The Panther\\". One of the most annoying problems with this book begins in the very beginning and runs throughout it. For some reason that is incomprehensible to me, DeMille has created in John Corey a character who, throughout the book, literally never says anything or has any thoughts without them containing a smart ass wisecrack. And this is consistent throughout the book. Absolutely everything Corey says or thinks consists of one or more smart remarks. The result is that Corey becomes a caricature and totally unbelievable.<br /> Most of the story takes place in Yemen where DeMille has seen fit to almost turn the book into a travel guide to the country, outlining all the various corrupt factions in the government as well as all the primitive and corrupt local Arab tribesmen. DeMille also spends too much time delving into all of the various US intelligence operations such as the CIA, NSA and Department of Defense, etc. All of which ends up being TMI (too much information).<br /> Another basic problem with the book in my mind is that there's an awful lot of talking and discussion and very little action until the last two chapters.<br /> All in all, a very disappointing novel and not up to DeMille's usual high standards. I certainly wouldn't spend the $12 to buy the hardcopy or E version. As a matter fact I probably wouldn't even waste the gasoline to drive to the public library to pick up a copy.ch ends up being TMI (too much information).<br /> Another basic problem with the book in my mind is that there's an awful lot of talking and discussion and very little action until the last two chapters.<br /> All in all, a very disappointing novel and not up to DeMille's usual high standards.

B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I was first introduced to Nine Inch Nails through an acquaintance in high school. He told me I needed to listen to his copy of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" in the middle of 1990. At the time I thought Mr. Reznor was doing something few others were doing. Of course, in retrospect, I know he was working a similar vein as Ministry, Skinny Puppy and Front 242, but I wasn't familiar with those bands at the time, and so \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" sounded like something I hadn't really been exposed to. Still, I held back, didn't buy a copy of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", but filed Mr. Reznor away in the back of my mind as someone to pay attention to in the future.<br /><br />The \\"Broken\\" EP didn't register to me, and so it wasn't until 1994's \\"The Downward Spiral\\" that I really paid close attention. The video for \\"Closer\\" grabbing me with its disturbing scenes and dark imagery. \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was nothing like anything I had heard before, not even like what Nirvana, Pearl Jam or Soundgarden were doing at that time. I bought \\"The Downward Spiral\\" eventually along with \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"Broken\\". I also remember my freshman year of college (1991) that I could hear songs from \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" blasting from various campus dorm rooms like some kind of rebellious mantra.<br /><br />And so, several albums later, and many years later, here I sit with my copy of \\"Hesitation Marks\\". I remember when Mr. Reznor toured and then pulled the plug on Nine Inch Nails. I remember thinking it seemed premature. And so, five years later, here I am with \\"Hesitation Marks\\".<br /><br />Like all Nine Inch Nail albums, I know I have to repeatedly listen, letting the music just saturate my mind, letting the soundscapes and moods drift in and out of my consciousness before I pass judgment and write my review. Although I like Nine Inch Nails, I wouldn't classify them (him, Mr. Reznor) in my top favorites of all time, but there has consistently been an interest in whatever Mr. Reznor does with Nine Inch Nails over the years to where I own most all of his music under that moniker.<br /><br />I know I will get hate mail and negative votes for this, but I am going to type it anyway. I liked \\"Hesitation Marks\\". I liked it a lot. I listened to all of Nine Inch Nails previous albums throughout this week as well, for comparison. \\"Hesitation Marks\\", for me, is a very good album. I like what Mr. Reznor is doing here. Working with Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac) and Adrian Belew (Paul Simon, Frank Zappa, David Bowie, Talking Heads, Kind Crimson), two of my favorite experimental guitarists. I felt \\"Hesitation Marks\\" was well crafted, meticulously so, and mature for Mr. Reznor. Whereas in the past he could be all angst with noisy buzz saws and quiet, reflective moments, here, on \\"Hesitation Marks\\" he restrains himself. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" is a master craftsman carving out the highest quality furniture you could possibly buy--solid mahogany and sturdy oak. This is album Mr. Reznor (age 48, mind you) has been threatening to make--an album that sums up all the best elements of Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />I wanted to give it five stars, but I restrained my self, knowing five stars would mean it's equal to, or greater than \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\"--two seminal, classic albums by today's standards. Yet, this could be right there with those two albums if, with time, listeners soften and realize how well done it truly is.<br /><br />I found myself going over the tracks, looking for weak ones, and struggling to find them, but I guess, perhaps, \\"Various Methods Of Escape\\" might qualify, but that's track number nine. The first eight tracks are virtually seamless in their quality and track order. \\"Copy Of A\\", \\"Came Back Haunted\\", \\"Find My Way\\", \\"All Time Low\\", \\"Disappointed\\", \\"Everything\\" and \\"Satellite\\" all fit well together, varying their degrees of sound and rhythm with thought-provoking lyrics. \\"Came Back Haunted\\" might be one of my favorite tracks here. Thelast four tracks \\"Running\\", \\"I Would For You\\", \\"In Two\\" and \\"While I'm Still Here\\" finish off the album, with some interesting turns by Lindsey Buckingham, particularly on \\"While I'm Still Here\\". If you, like me, have been a long time fan of Adrian Belew and Lindsey Buckingham, you can hear their influences throughout, but also hear they are trying different things here, things not found on their solo works, or works with Fleetwood Mac and King Crimson.<br /><br />So, I'm not really sure why fans would be disappointed by \\"Hesitation Marks\\". Especially fans who, like me, have been listening to Nine Inch Nails from the beginning. This is a mature, evolved piece of music that you can listen to from front to back without hitting the skip button. That's a feat in today's cannibalized market. Whereas, Mr. Reznor's earlier works were demarcated by jagged juxtapositions of harsh blasts of industrial angst punctuated by nearly inaudible moments of reflective moodiness, \\"Hesitation Marks\\" sands down the wild mood swings of yesteryear and replaces it with a sophistication Mr. Reznor could not have achieved in his more youthful form. Again, for someone who is 48, \\"Hesitation Marks\\" shows no signs of aging. It is remarkable that Mr. Reznor left for five years and delivered one of his most thought-provoking works in years.<br /><br />So here is how \\"Hesitation Marks\\" compares with Nine Inch Nails previous works:<br /><br />1989 Pretty Hate Machine: Five Stars<br />1994 The Downward Spiral: Five Stars<br />1999 The Fragile: Three Stars (a double album that would have been much better distilled into one album that might have been five stars)<br />2005 With Teeth: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 Year Zero: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 The Slip: Three Stars (I don't count the instrumental \\"Ghosts I-IV\\" as a legitimate album, even though I know it is)<br />2013 Hesitation Marks: Four and a Half Starslast four tracks \\"Running\\", \\"I Would For You\\", \\"In Two\\" and \\"While I'm Still Here\\" finish off the album, with some interesting turns by Lindsey Buckingham, particularly on \\"While I'm Still Here\\".

In the penultimate scene of the movie, Fonda's musical theme intensifies, culminating in a full-chorus backed crescendo.  The scenery is fantastic, the story is compelling.  Each character's story is unique, yet overlaps with the other characters' stories.  This is a must purchase for anyone who loves epic movies.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Anyone will like this book so delightful and touching , but true in a way .  I remember hearing about the orphan trains.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This was the first time I \\"read\\" it.  Well...I listened to it. It was well read and I was thankful that I didn't have to try to read the parts spoken by the characters with strong \\"accents\\".  It was easier to understand when someone else more skilled at deciphering their dialects read it for me.  I will recommend the narrated version to my friends.
161655164X|5.0|beautiful pictures, both art and screenshots. Fascinating sketch series to show how the final appearances were developed. highly recommended to any fan of this game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Really nice and relaxing, I enjoy making my own sound mixes. My child uses it to fall asleep at night.
B001TM14VC|5.0|If this picture has not been seen before, it is a must.  It was great reviewing this movie of the Top Gun once more.  It was a great movie when it first hit the screen, and it is still a great movie now.  Film work was great, acting great, and all together Top Gun is still great after all these years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I simply love this game it's fun challenging and u can never be bored with it . Hope u like it too
B009LMBVTW|3.0|The show is great but the sound quality is horrible.  It sounds like an audience recording.  VU fans like me will still love it but it's not for the casual fan (if there is any such thing with VU).
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm a CC and Neoclassical listener and  like Lindsey's spirit and some of the pieces that I listened to on YouTube, etc. so I decided to check her CD out along with a couple others (Bond, Escala).  Let me say- it became a quick repeat player in my car!  The short review clips on Amazon do no justice to the full songs on this album.  There is a lot more variety and depth on this CD than I thought there would be.  Lindsey certainly capitalizes on her videos, dancing and overall personality, but the technical aspects, arrangements and production of this CD is underestimated.  She certainly has assembled a VERY good team for her burgeoning carreer.  If she composes the original works herself, she is truly a very multi-talented musician.  I am not a youngster by any means, but the dub step influence on this offering forces me to turn up the volume.  I personally can't wait for her next CD to come out in 2014!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Very good! Loved it chugging away on mice and men but I like this book way more than of mice and men
B00AEBB86A|5.0|Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is on an illicit mission in Ethiopia with a fellow sniper, but as the US military are not supposed to be there, their military support is withdrawn leaving them to their own devices. Swagger's comrade is killed in action but he escapes - to retire from the U.S. Marines to live in peace in the country. He's then approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to plan an assassination attempt on the president, on the pretext that they want to know how a real assassin would set about it. In reality, Johnson and his corrupt colleagues, under the control of Senator Charles F. Meachum (Ned Beatty), want to assassinate an archbishop from Ethiopia, appearing on the platform with the president, because the archbishop is in America to expose atrocities by the U.S. military in his country.  With an all-too-familiar conspiracy plot, Swagger is made the fall-guy for the archbishop's assassination and is hunted down by Johnson. But an FBI agent, Nick Memphis (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) who becomes suspicious of the frame-up joins sides with Swagger and the two of them see that justice prevails. As part of the conspirators plot, they also capture Swagger's girl-friend, Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara), who has also to be rescued by Swagger and Memphis. A really thrilling, action-packed conspiracy movie.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|At first I thought this app was practically perfect, but then it said for me to shoot anymore videos I'd have to but it with &quot;camcoins&quot;-things you either buy or go to worthless ads to earn. So, I decided to get rid of virtually all my videos and try again-but it said I still needed camcoins! Got rid of app, re-installed, still need stupid coins. I know you probably think that I should just buy the coins and get it over with, but I honestly don't think that wasting money and looking ads that I don't want is worth shooting a couple videos.<br />So, I got rid of the app.<br />But, if you feel like shooting a couple videos and buying the app, go ahead! Don't let me stop you. The pause button is very nice.<br />I'm just very upset now, now that my favorite camera app requires me to pay to continue making videos. If you're going to make a lot of videos, be prepared!
B009LQKHIO|2.0|I liked the story a lot but the writing is terrible. Repeated words and grammatical errors everywhere. It seemed not to have been edited at all! Very unprofessional.
B000SEH13C|5.0|Kurt = Master, and this is a fine example of his humor, his craft, his way with words. BUSY, BUSY, BUSY...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It's a well written book.  Exciting!  You felt sorry for the family with that terribly secret.  And the revealings of the facts in the last chapter was the best part.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Any Star Trek fan will like this movie as pure entertainment.  As long as you don't sweat the little things.  Any reboot of a classic can be nit-picked to death.  It was more of the sale of this movie that I found alittle off.  I always thought pre-ordering something would give you a break on the buy.  Whelp...not in this case.  Could have gone to anyone of the local big box stores and pick this movie up sooner than I received it.  AND...for $5 bux cheaper.  Oh well...it happens.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books are amazing and the whole series is just breath taking. So excited to reread them! Great books for anyone to read
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This show was outstanding. Fully developed characters and intelligent storytelling made for a fascinating mystery. You weren't able to figure out the culprit within the first episode which is rare! I highly recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have been on a real reading kick. After finishing the White Mountains trilogy and fourth book that was new since reading them as a child, I stumbled accidentally upon Ender's Game. I had heard of the author before, but only the name, and had no idea what his books were about. The cover of the book on the kindle was also not very exciting and it was several weeks before I actually opened it up.<br /><br />It wasn't until a long airport wait and business trip to London that I was able to read the book and read the book I did. It is good to find a book that you read cover to cover in two days. One that changes your unconscious dreams and leaves you thinking for days, longing to get back into the book. That is why I am so glad there are four more which I will be purchasing right after I finish this review. Can't wait to get started and pick up with Ender where I left off.
B00F5F9WF4|5.0|GREAT JOB! Drake is the man. Classic and he is so far ahead of the game. I can't wait for the next album!
B00CH87HF4|2.0|I REALLY LIKED PLAYING THIS GAME. I HAD MORE BAD GAMING DAYS THAN GOOD ONES, UNFORTUNATELY. SOLO PLAY WAS FINE. MULTIPLAYER HAD TOO ISSUES FOR ME. IT LAGGED OFTEN AND WOULD LAG U OUT OF THE GAME. MULTIPLAYER WAS FREEZING UP FREQUENTLY. POTIONS DIDN'T RENEW THEMSELVES AUTOMATICALLY. THE SPECIAL POTION LIKE 24 hour ONES DIDN'T WORK,  I STILL HAD TO BUY REGULAR POTIONS AND USE WITH SPECIAL POTIONS. IN THE WEEKLY CHALLENGES YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET THE PRIZES.  GAME IS ONLY FREE TO DOWNLOAD. THE REST OF THE STUFF U NEED PLAY GAME YOU HAVE TO BUY GEMS TO PURCHASE THEM. THE CASH YOU ACCUMULATE IN THE GAME CAN'T BE USED YO BUY GEMS. YOU BUY GEMS WITH REAL CASH. GAMELOFT DOESN'T SAVE YOU GAME INFO, SO, IF LOOSE DATA FOR ANY REASON, ITS GONE FOREVER. I HAVE HAD TO START OVER TWICE. GAMELOFT GAVE ME SOME ITEMS TO HELP ME RESTART, BUT IT DID NOT COVER WHAT I SPENT. GAMELOFT STATES  THEY HAVE SET AMOUNTS ON WHAT THEY REFUND. MY RECENTLY CRASHED AND I LOST ALL MY SKILLS,  GAMELOFT STATES I HAVE TO START OVER<br />I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's a fun game and its exciting but I hate the movie it's based on but u will love this game
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I really wanted to give this 2-1/2 stars, because it's somewhere between ok and I don't like it. My Pandigital Supernova comes with a terrible YouTube player, I can't seem to get anything but some the latest, and to put it kindly, mundane YouTube videos.<br /><br />The good thing about the Downloader, it works on my Pandigital and it goes to any YouTube address. You can download the YouTube in several different formats. Although the audio download format is something my audio player can play, though it looks like a large file for an MP3.<br /><br />What I really, really dislike about Downloader, -- it has a warning that pops up, which reminded me of some Windows programs that I have had, saying I have viruses on my gadget. I seriously doubt my gadget does have viruses on it. Even if it did, I'm not going to let a program that I'm unfamiliar with, have a chance to actually put viruses on my gadget!<br /><br />Now, to be polite, perhaps the Downloader is  misreading something on my tablet; but there are some very good antiviral programs on Amazon Marketplace, and if I'm so inclined, I'll download one of those to check the tablet out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever because you get to mine a lot and get diamond and gold and iron and cobble stone dirt and more
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Thank you for this app. It makes watching youtube videos so much easier to do. It also makes searching for videos a whole lot easier.
B005CVWWJY|3.0|Well thought out dystopian world.  Yet, the characters are interesting and complex, well maybe some of the baddies are a bit two dimensional.  It's a world lived in virtual reality, which is a much better place to live than the real one. And our protagonists are aware of this. Their goal is to save their preferred world.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and I love it. It's super fun and the minions are adorable they have little jokes when they have little jokes inside when you download. There are some little times when it freezes for a little but it's only for a few seconds. Besides that I give it a five star.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I have been a fan of Demi ever since 2010, but the only songs I knew were  \\"Skyscraper\\" and \\"Give Your Heart A Break\\". But after listening to Demi's new album, \\"DEMI\\", I feel that she has grown more and more mature. Her songs are beginning to have a meaning to me and they help me through life. They may be a little emotional, but it is amazing!
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I truly enjoyed every story but was somehow disappointed that he did not linger on the subject of how to change or reform your habits.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a great game because Noch has great ideas for people that play minecraft and other games.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|If you like flying old plane's and like history then this is the game for you.This game is awesome it work perfectly and doesn't mess up your iPad or phone if I was you I will get right now
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Nick cage approved its worth your time in getting the game it's very easy to master and has good perks to help you become a master at the game
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Discuss peak in Utah killed white hydro pings why McMinn free of such week pc :(ssh hex with its fifth of ssh :(it week pc they kind enough for me to the public domain names of such as the most common form of ssh the first place for a wee bit of such a wee
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|The package is a Three-Disc that was shipped in a Two-Disc case. This is not good for the two discs that have to sit onto of one or the other.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|Simply put I love this release and after many, many listens it is far and away my favorite by the band to date.  Having wet my appetites with the title track &#34;Loud Like Love&#34; and &#34;Too Many Friends&#34; the full release blew me away.  There isn't a bad track on the CD, and the mournful passion of Brian Molko's voice is at it's finest on tracks &#34;Exit Wounds&#34; and &#34;Bosco&#34;.  Slower than their previous release &#34;Battle for the Sun&#34;, &#34;Loud Like Love&#34; is a stronger, more complete album.  Personal favorites are &#34;Begin the End&#34;, &#34;Exit Wounds&#34;, &#34;Purify&#34;, and &#34;Too Many Friends&#34;.  The only negative is that the bonus track &#34;Pity Party (For One)&#34; has to be obtained elsewhere.
1932100660|5.0|I bought this book as it was recommended by a friend who turned his health around. This is a well documented book for those who are interested in health and nutrition and the effects of diet and environment.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't review too many items, but this game is so much fun. It's challenging, frustrating, exciting, and fun. And did I say exciting and fun?. I love it! No more need be said.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's a great game I would recommend it to anyone, but it's a lot better if played on a Tablet or large screen. Via Kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love playing this game. I like the challenges of collecting items as well as maneuvering through the train station.If you download this game you will like playing it.
1401938906|5.0|This has become one of my favorite books. The experiments work!! You won't be disappointed. You will be amazed!!! Just try it!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is so awesome it can not be put into words it is just so fantastic BUY IT TODAY!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Controls are good and the action is very good for a side scrolling game.  My girls like it too and they are young. Good family game
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great view of the life of quadriplegics and the challenges they face, while great humour throughout and great development of the relationship between the key characters.
159315724X|5.0|If you just read the book, it would be a nice read and could possibly motivate some.  This book is much more than that, it is about taking action and promotes hard work.
B00A285OOW|3.0|There was too much text which repeated the King's paranoia, and little development of the Queen's other thoughts.  Little loopback regarding the prince in the tower.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I have been trying now for over 45 minutes to buy and pay for this Music. Surely it can't be this hard. The 1-click takes me in circles. Can't find an \\"Add to Cart\\" Button. I have bought things from Amazon before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a better best game in minion history make a second one and id bet lots of people will play it for a long time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just..... can't stop crying. Beautifully story thank you very much I enjoyed everything... really sad and touching. Thank you
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies are a really cool group of kids who outsmart two different kinds of crooks.  Really good move for kids all ages.
0385737947|5.0|The story of Thomas and the Gladders is a great one.  I liken this to a long episode of Lost; for every question you answer 10 more pop up in it's place.  The characters are very likeable and you're pulled into the world of the Glade and the Maze.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just love watching the little trucks running around making deliveries. It's challenging trying to find space to put things and the money to build them, but it's addicting I keep checking it throughout the day.
0385738757|5.0|This book is equally as good as the first.  There were just more questions on top or questions on top of questions.  Once again you get sucked into this world with the remaining Gladders.  You don't know who to trust, who to believe, where to go next.  What is wicked up to?  Can Thomas and the Gladders trust them?  Which of them will make it through the scorch trials?!
B002RI9HT8|5.0|It kept me out of trouble for about 3 days. As I was reading I had a niggling feeling quite often that Zadie was a bit up herself but I still read it and enjoyed it nonetheless. I guess it must be good, she received a squillion dollar advance for it. A shame it hasn't been made into an art house movie. I still gave it five because it shines alongside most of the other crap that's on the market. I think you call it \\"refreshing\\".
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I haven't played it a lot, and it is kind of small on my kindle fire, so it makes it a little hard to see. I would probably enjoy it more on my asus, and I will probably download it on that device. It would be more fun to play if I could see it better.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|What is there to say? He's Reacher, he's tall, he's considerate, he's a mean fighting machine , he's a loner but best of all he always catches the baddies and sorts them out. He also knows a lot about guns. 4'8'' Tom Cruise as Reacher is just plain ridiculous. Nothing against Tom (apart from his crazy addiction to Scientology and how he has stuffed up two beautiful women's lives) he's an action hero but is a bit too small for the mould this time. If you like Reacher try Christopher Brookmyre's books. They are also written by a Scotsman and are a tad better. They have a short hero, so maybe Tom can get another try.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I haven't played it a lot yet, but I think when I get the hang of it, it will be a lot more fun to play!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is not, as Stephen King puts it on his website, \\"a return to balls-to-the-wall, keep-the-lights-on horror\\".  As he says in acknowledgments at the end, he's a different writer than he was 30 years ago. This is a feel-good book that you trust won't go anywhere too dark. That's not intended as a criticism, because I thoroughly enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I was surprised at how appropriate the sequel seemed. The Shining is about Danny to a large extent, and you're left wondering how he'll end up. Definitely worth a read to find out.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I had been wondering if we'd be blessed with more great Elton music, and these tunes are perfect for those of us that grew up with this talented artist.  Wonderful CD
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I purchased this as a time filler, and was so pleased! I have no idea how it guesses correctly each and every time! My friends and family love it! I recommend it for anyone! It's a blast!!
0525952926|5.0|nice
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Love this game I play it all the time when I'm bored. I reccomend this to anyone who likes a challenge in a game.
B00000J6AG|5.0|The CD came in such excellent condition!  The music was just as excellent also!  I'm really enjoying listening to it very much.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I had heard of this classic reading, but until now had never read this book. Very good reading, that I enjoyed
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is really great. I love the way you play it and the play is really easy.<br /><br />The tutorial was really helpful and I love seeing the pictures that show up once you finish. I dont know if I would actually spend $5 on it, but as a free ap of the day? It was perfect. :)
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is one of Dylan's best efforts.  I am especially taken with Aint Talkin.  It is a masterpiece.  My cat, Cutie Pie, loves the lyric, \\"Eatin' Hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.\\"  She loves pork.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|The book was a great commute read, and serves as a reminder that we ultimately determine how we feel and what we do.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Wow. I've never read a historical novel that was so historical before.  Fischer knows his WWII! And not just the facts, but he takes the reader and places him/her right into every-day life during some of the most horrible days imaginable. He does a great job at showing how people were brainwashed by the Nazi propaganda machine, and the impact that such lies had on Jews all over Europe. If you like the time period and want to step into the shoes of a family faced with all the trials of that day, then look no further. The Luck of the Weissensteiners is for you.
B005PK56TA|5.0|When I saw the commercials I thought its unorganized horror. It wouldn't make sense and it would be fake horror. I don't like horror that's really fake like creatures made up. Only it was totally the opposite and loved it. Only I recommend not to watch it before bed cause you will not be able to sleep you will have nightmares all night.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I've probably read over 100 WW2 books in the last 25 years. This is one of the best I've ever read.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. I was given this ad a gift and couldn't be more excited. Now I can finally get rid of my Vhs tape lol.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. Some parts may be a little scary so I'd say 10 and over.<br />but I watched The Shining when I was 10 so who knows :)
B008M0NDOK|3.0|No more game is support this controller, so what?? Gameloft?? What is this?? A disposable game controller?? Come on?? We need more support for example MC4
B00ET47USI|5.0|this is a great card game pleasing for all ages i have this game on my computer and was glad to see it for my kindle
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Like a lot of trilogy sets - what can you say after two books?  The third one is a slow read, but worth reading.  It ties up a lot of details of the story.  I especially liked the updates and beginning tie ins at the end of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my children are completely enthralled with this app. the interactive screen play is cute and without being graphically violent or too obnoxious. I give this five stars for cute creativity.
0439796644|3.0|I wouldn't recommend it for unenthusiastic readers, it's rather slow. As usual the book is better than the movie, but not much better.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Probably one of the top two funniest books I've ever read. I can't wait to keep reading about Drew and Kate. And I definitely want to read more books like this, from the POV of the hero. It's hilarious!!! Highly recommended.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|With North Korea on the news lately, one may want to read this for some insight. This certainly will leave you wondering how there can still be countries in the world that treat people as described in this book.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is not your typical parenting book giving explicit instructions. Instead this book offers different ways of seeing and doing things.  I don't agree with all of the things that french parents do but I liked some of the things that they do and will try and incorporate these in my parenting. Great book and worth the purchase!
B00742GBDM|1.0|This movie has many politically correct things awkwardly forced into the story that were never in the novel or any other theatrical version of this. Ignoring the fact that this has nothing to do with 'Mansfield Park', this movie is still a 1 star movie. This is because it's not entertaining at all - unless you're a pathetic weasel who thinks watching phony politically correct trash means you're a good person. The most annoying where the lesbian scenes, the slavery crap (slavery is wrong but to put it in a movie just to be politically correct is stupid) and one scene that would please any pedophile (yes, this is the most disturbing part of political correctness). If you choose not to watch any movie directed by Patricia Rozema you'll be better off for it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Incredibly funny yet so wise and practical in the manner its written.  I loved every page and when I finished I started to reread again.  That's how much I enjoyed it.  An incredibly brilliant insight into how things work around you and how you can use this to your own advantage.  Not to be missed for any reason.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|This was not a Zombie movie as the title implies.  It was an action movie and a rather lame one at that.  I guess that the studio who made this movie and good old Brad thought that they would cash in on the recent success of The Walking Dead.  NOW THAT is a ZOMBIE MOVIE or rather episodic Zombie TV Series.  World War Z has absolutely none of the blood, gore, or suspense that we have become accustomed too over the years.  There are so many low budget, independent Zombie films that get the formula and know how to put it out there to chose from and World War Z just doesn't get it.
B002361MLA|4.0|Thought provoking and a valuable insight into appreciating the absolute power of now.  A book that's written by someone with an extremely high level of perception and for the purposes of educating ourselves as to the tricks the mind can play on you and making you aware of it.  A truly fascinating perspective.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Great game but we need promo codes for game and mine wont let my facebook come throughout please fix it
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Fiio E17 is very good at widening the soundstage and making even cheap headphones / earbuds sound 'huge' and deep!  I love it with an iPhone and my Bang and Olufsen Form 2's, my Klipsch Image One II's, and my Phillips SHE6000's (especially big soundstage with these 'surround sound' earphones!).<br /><br />Works great with iPhone using Fiio's 30-pin Apple connector to Aux-out adapter, and from Mac Air on either USB out or Aux Out!!!  Can't wait to get an HDMI/SPDIF out converter to hear the Mac Air output in full 24/192 to the E17 SPDIF Input.  Will try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter, into the HDMI/SPDIF converter, to the E17.  Thinking of getting the Monoprice converter, since it is cheap and seems to do the job (from the reviews) [...]
B0088D076I|4.0|This album is quiet unique the singer's vocals are better never really cared for the singer do to him being from Rhapsody of Fire cause I have never ever liked that group I found them to be very over rated but this group is much much more than that group in my opinion the guitars are great , drums are pretty sweat, and I like the background chorus of this album its epic.<br /><br />all n all if you like Power Metal I would Recommend it to you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow this game is great it's so realistic it's almost like talking care of a real horse. The graphics are unbelievable. You can even pet your horse by moving your hand in a petting motion on your screen. Can any regular game get better than this so far no
B0038AOZOQ|5.0|Valley of the Damned is such a great and classical album its fast, and Damn ZP's Vocals are freakin awesome along with Sam and Hermin's Guitar Rifts the drumming is very outrageous to Didier done some great drumming when he was with this band to bad he is not with them anymore cause he was a great drummer, Diccon Harper did a great job on the bass to. The whole damn album is great from the sound and the story's that the song tell is awesome.<br /><br />all n all a epic classic
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. Challenging. I recommend it to people who like puzzles and a challenge. I wish there was more levels. I could sit and play this all day long.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Awesome game, great graphics sometimes a little hard but overall awsome!<br /><br />The characters that you can be are varied and all are fun to be.
B00CLMA3HK|4.0|Faster than a speeding bullet, the action-packed plot of AURORA CONSPIRACY; THE STORY DIDN'T END zooms along at breakneck speed. Brilliant, orphaned farm girl Jesse, beset by visions of a spaceship crashing into the farm's windmill and her mother disappearing into thin air with a laser-eyed man, discovers a box of her mother's belongings. Among those belongings is a crystal that will change everything...<br /><br />When Jesse sets out with her friend Marcus to solve the mystery of her mother's disappearance, the plot kicks into high gear. With elements of \\"National Treasure,\\" \\"Raiders of the Last Ark,\\" \\"Star Trek,\\" and \\"The Last Starfighter,\\"  THE AURORA CONSPIRACY is full of action, suspense, and every manner of peril. Jesse's wild adventures take her ricocheting not only through space, but through time as well.<br /><br />This is a very well-written scifi adventure. Characters are interesting, but not much time is spent developing them. Action, wonder, and adventure are keys here, and character is largely created by dialog and action. But that action takes the reader on a wild and exciting ride!<br /><br />AURORA CONSPIRACY is written with clarity, never confusing the reader despite the breakneck pace of the story. I noticed only one unfortunate typo - \\"anecdote\\" for \\"antidote\\" - but otherwise the text was very clean. It was a real pleasure to read, and left me breathless, with a big grin on my face!<br /><br />Recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down.....I will say I wish she had ended up with gale in the end. Over all I loved all 3 books
B00C9QQBA6|4.0|I very much enjoyed AURORA CONSPIRACY THE SERIES: CRASH LANDING - EPISODE 1.  I'm not much of a scifi or fantasy fan, but I thought this story was exciting and entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the contrast between the time setting - 1897 - and the crashed-spaceship situation. I couldn't help but think this was the \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" movie that SHOULD have been made!<br /><br />The characters are defined primarily by their actions and dialog. Except for a short first chapter introducing us to the aliens, their history, and their current dilemma, there was not a lot of exposition, which I thought helped move this action-and-romance story along very well.<br /><br />This quick plunge into action and adventure in CRASH LANDING was a plus for me. I find it awfully difficult to wade through scifi stories that immediately overwhelm the reader with page upon page of dense mythology. Painstakingly crafted and beloved by the author as that mythology might be, it's very daunting to a non-fanboy. So many scifi books begin with something like, \\"For millions of millennia the High Inscrutable Scrimshaw of the Cranberrusians had kept Vice-Emperor Zurg of the Grilledcheez Command safe from the treachery of Mudbathians, who defeated the Guineapygs to colonize the third moon of Hopscotch in order to secure the Stone of Anthrax, which held all the power of Zurg's ancestors, the Dingbats.\\"  Thank goodness, authors Ginger Gelsheimer and Christina Keats wisely avoided this pitfall. We get just enough information to realize who and what we're dealing with, then the story is off and running.<br /><br />I thought the characters were fresh and original, and even the alien hero is comfortingly human, despite his otherworldly origins. Emily and Aurelius are instantly likeable, and it's very easy to root for them to overcome what seem like insurmountable problems.<br /><br />I did notice anachronistic dialog. The likes of \\"Gotcha,\\" \\"You're not kidding,\\" and \\"Big Bad Space Man\\" pop up hereand there, but that really wasn't a problem for me. Han, Luke, and Leia talk that way, don't they? It's scifi adventure, after all, not Regency romance or Napoleonic High Drama.<br /><br />It should be noted that CRASH LANDING is not a complete novel. It is, as it claims to be right up front, the first episode of a serial story.  Novella-length, it's a quick and entertaining read. It does end mid-action with a cliffhanger, so be prepared to stock up on the next episodes as well to avoid nail-biting frustration. The stories are reasonably priced to accommodate this.<br /><br />All in all, this story is well-written and a lot of fun!

1582701709|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Secret and watching the movie, as well. It's a very good message that explores some wonderful universal truths, the most important of which is that our thoughts become things. I enjoyed reading all the positive quotes and ideas in the book, but I wish it offered more in terms of examples of how to use The Secret. It would have been nice to see some real-life stories about people who have made this power work in their lives. I won two considerable lottery prizes with the Law of Attraction, so I know this power works if you work it. This review was written by Eddie Coronado, author of the book titled \\"Manifest Your Millions!: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\"

B00D82BNLC|5.0|This is a well-written book with a simple compelling idea. A young widow with a passion for ghost hunting wins lottery money which she uses to finance a professional paranormal investigation team. Author Carolyn Bennett gets the tone just right and the story builds to a nice, suspenseful climax. This feels like a book crying out to be adapted into a movie. A brisk, well-paced entertaining read.

1476727651|3.0|So what's Danny Torrance been up to? Apparently Stephen King's been thinking about Danny since THE SHINING was published in 1977, calculating his age as the years rack up. He finally put the question to bed with DOCTOR SLEEP, his 530-page follow-up to the saga of the Torrance family. The problem for me is that the Danny we spent time with in the Overlook Hotel, albeit he was only five-years old, seems at odds with the Danny (or Dan) that we are presented in DOCTOR SLEEP, which, after a brief introduction, picks up with Dan in his 20s, an alcoholic making poorer life decisions than his pop did. Dan has become one of King's recent \\"everyman\\" protagonists, with Dan not much different than UNDER THE DOME's Dale Barbara or Clayton Riddell from CELL, with Dan's quirk being his \\"shining\\" and his alcoholism. It is intimated that \\"the shining\\" is less obtrusive from he drinks, so once he joins AA the memories and thoughts come flooding back, especially a mental connection with Abra Stone, a young girl twenty miles away who shares Dan's gift. The third tier of DOCTOR SLEEP is a new bunch of baddies, called the True Knot, who are a type of vampire that lives off \\"steam,\\" which is the essence of \\"the shining\\" in children. This makes them obviously interested in Abra and what she can offer. The True Knot comes across as a group of Manson Family Gypsies, with carny-like nicknames, led by the beautiful femme fatale Rose the Hat. The book plods along from AA meeting to AA meeting, with Dan's \\"shining\\" pals slowly gathering forces for a confrontation with the True Knot, who, in their Winnebagos and Bounders, are camped, where else, in the shadow of the old Overlook Hotel. Or where it used to be. King has a nice, throw-away shout out to son Joe Hill's NOS482, but the usual King style seems tedious and dawdling. In the end, this reader just felt that Danny needed a better story, after all that poor child went through.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|A book that has contributed to a complete change in the way I present. A little too much focus on Japanese culture for my taste, though...got to be somewhat distracting.

0061339202|4.0|I had seen this book referenced in some other books and I thought I would go to the source.<br /><br />It is an interesting book, but the structure and style of the author's sentences make it hard to read at times.  The reading of the book doesn't, well, Flow.  (The joke here being that flow in the sense of the ease of reading and the namesake state of being are probably both separate and the same thing.)<br /><br />My preconceived notion of what \\"Flow\\" is tracked closely with what they call when athletes are \\"in the zone\\" and why I have come closest to in practice, where you just turn off your conscious mind and react through muscle memory.  I was pretty close, but my notion was more limited.  For the author, you can have flow at work, which to me seems ludicrous at first blush but is true.  I can think of personal experiences where I was making pizza years ago, and in explaining how well I worked with one coworker, I called it a \\"dance\\". I didn't always dance at that job, but when I did, it was beautiful -- time flew and the memory of the shift was a pleasant memory.<br /><br />You don't always flow though, and that's what concerns me.  The author shows all these people experiencing these states, but I am wanting to know how to create these states.  Reading the book, an d explaining it to my wife, she asked if it was a 'self-help' book with the negative baggage that comes with that phrase.  It is not, but I for one wanted more hint on how to get to there from here.<br /><br />One big thing about reading this for me was that it needs updated and expanded (and I'm sure the work has bee furthered).  It is a twenty + year old book and the research it is based on is even older.  I would be interested in seeing the physiological reaction to flow.  Can you throw someone in an fMRI machine and induce the fl,ow state?  If so, we could see in a different manner what a flow state looks like.

0307719227|5.0|As a traveler and reader ... I have been seeking a historian or economist that would clarify my observations regarding economic and cultural disparity. Over the course of a couple years I had exposed myself to the symptoms of extractive behaviors but felt like I was clutching at straws when trying to diagnose the causes of human suffering. Being suspicious of simplicity in an ever increasingly complex world, I just assumed that the historical culprits of societal stagnation could only be rooted out on a case by case basis. Overwhelmed, I thought that I would never be able to propose or communicate a solution to suffering without identifying what encourages it.<br /><br />Now, I refer to the concepts in this book more often than any others when considering politics and inequity. It's not unusual for a book to tinker with or slightly expand my understanding of the world, with maybe a handful of phenomenon aligning themselves neatly along it's premise. But your observations, once reinforced by well told and interesting historical narratives, have made a significant impact on how I categorize information regarding this subject.<br /><br />I would imagine that a good doctor needs to consider a wide range maladies before treatment, and would give precedence to common afflictions before testing for exotic parasites. I think that's what you've done here. You've provided a reasonable jumping off point for addressing the failure of nations and the implications surrounding their failure. I've never written a book review before ... but wanted to take the time out to thank you :)

B004AQR29C|1.0|This video, which I paid $1.99 to rent had horrible audio quality!  The movie itself, is a great shoot 'em up, guns and guts kinda movie.  If you like movies that starred any of the cast of The Expendables, you'll like this movie.  Listen closely for subtle, snarky jabs at each other's careers in film...  Back to the ONE STAR rating: Usually when watching Netflix having the volume on 25-30 is MORE than enough to hear the quietest dialogue.  For The Expendables I had the volume at 80 and it was still almost too quiet.  I stopped the movie and played another movie to see if the sound jumped  up, and sure enough, the volume back at 30 was MORE than sufficient to hear everything.  Resumed The Expendables, and had to turn the volume back to 80...  Ruined watching the movie as a lot of the talking is under their breath or whispering.  Amazon usually has very high quality movies, and while this was a first for me with Amazon, it still ruined the movie for me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I absolutely loved it.  The interactions were so accurate from my years of corporate law work experience.  I was enthralled and absolutely wanted to see more.  The casting is well done and the story is well written and \\"in my opinion\\" fairly accurate.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I don't know much, but I do know Dylan (not the man, only his art and career which is just fine by me).  Many, perhaps most, of the folks who rank themselves among his core fans will never appreciate this release.  The sad truth is that Dylan's breadth of interests and genres exceeds that of virtually all of his fans, myself included.  That's a real shame as this particular Dylan release not only contains some his greatest songs but also some really nice covers of both other artists' and his own prior work.  This all comes from a period when Dylan was actively trying to deconstruct his image and to disappear from public scrutiny.  He documented his perspective at that fairly well in his \\"Chronicles, Volume 1\\" autobiography.  This release is a split between what is essentially a different release of \\"New Morning\\" and better material from his \\"Self Portrait\\" and \\"Dylan\\" cover albums plus a few outtakes from Nashville Skyline.    My starting perspective was that I generally like this era and have long considered \\"New Morning\\" to be one of Dylan's top releases.  However, I cared little for \\"Self Portrait\\" and \\"Dylan\\" save for a few scattered gems.  In order to get to an ideal frame of mind to review this I avoided all liner notes and sequestered myself and my wife for two weeks on an almost vacant beach.  I took along \\"Chronicles Vol 1\\" and studied it along with the Wikipedia Dylan LP ring from \\"John Westley Harding\\" through \\"New Morning\\".  I brought along all released material from that era including some Bootleg Series outtakes from the period with George Harrison and Johnny Cash.  What? Am I some rich retired millionaire who can simply fly off and dedicate this kind of effort to a review?  Nope.  We were just a harried and harassed couple, sick of our jobs and subject to an unexpected stream of negative chaotic events over the past 2 years.  We had arranged for a badly needed off season vacation with a mindset to hide from the world's cross hairs, much as Dylan and his family were doing in these years albeit for much better reasons and on a grand scale.  Still, we were in that mode in our little world and this release came out just as we were to depart.  Upon realizing that Amazon allowed immediate mp3 download I grabbed it along with Chronicles on the way out the door.  I've just picked up the physical package 3 weeks later, but I'll crack the shrink wrap after I review to avoid any influence from the liner notes.  Have I mentioned that I'm in an ideal state of mind to review this?    Without exception, all of this material is better than or equal to the previously released versions.  Here we find Dylan in great voice, and it is his natural voice without any affect whatsoever.  Critics have written that he had an extra octave on New Morning and indeed Dylan has claimed that his voice throughout this era was sweet from quitting smoking.  Not so. That's typical Dylan media manipulation and it's patently absurd to think that smoking cessation could change the voice of a young man in his early 30's to that degree, particularly as the main difference is far more stylistic than tonal in nature.  Further, Dylan had an additional octave beyond this material on his very first release as clearly demonstrated on the yodeling in the \\"Freight Train Blues\\" recording.  Shift forward 3 or 4 decades and we have the croaking Dylan of the last 5 releases, the raspy Dylan DJ of Theme Time Radio Hour and the wheezing, creaking Dylan of the Mike Wallace 60 Minutes interview.  I just have to laugh as we also have recent recorded evidence of a silky smooth Dylan speaking voice.  \\"Manipulator of crowds\\" indeed. The fact is that Dylan's vocal command has always been nearly unrivaled and this hasn't changed.  Outside of Billie Holiday I have yet to hear another vocalist who could match Dylan's ability to intensively focus to the point of giving every single syllable on \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", \\"Highway 61\\" and \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" its own special consideredtreatment.  In this era, he chooses to treat honest folk and country songs with an honest voice.  That's an artist's choice, a good one in my opinion and much of the reason why the casual radio listening public generally enjoyed the best known work of this period, \\"Lay Lady Lay\\", without any of the usual complaints about \\"that awful Dylan voice\\".    New Morning - 5 stars all the way    To me the \\"New Morning\\" material here is what \\"New Morning\\" should have been.  In \\"Chronicles Vol 1\\" Dylan wrote of how the press was waiting for his next move, his next vision, denied that he's the voice of a generation, etc all of which is pretty true.  He then sequed to a car ride conversation with Robbie Robertson of the Band where Robertson asks \\"So, where do you think you're going to take it [the music industry] next?\\" and Dylan claims that he couldn't believe that even Robertson doesn't get it, that Dylan isn't a leader, etc.  But these are two quite different topics and this is merely an example of Dylan's typical word games.  Dylan wasn't the voice of a generation, nor was he a movement leader.  However, along with the Beatles, he undeniably had been setting the musical direction in folk, folk rock and rock for nearly a decade at this point.  In fact, this was exactly the problem, the very role from which he was attempting to extricate himself.  Dylan easily could have taken the music industry in a new direction with \\"New Morning\\", and in my opinion this material proves that he was considering doing exactly that.  I believe that he was wrestling with this decision and that the incredible horn based title track of \\"New Morning\\" as included here could have been a startling genre changing #1 single in 1970.  That of course was exactly what Robbie Robertson was asking about, totally within Dylan's power to do and indeed what he had already been doing for years.    The previously released \\"New Morning\\" title cut is a great song in its own right with a sparse, stripped down acoustic/electric arrangement kicked along with a nice groove by Russell Kunkel's typically stellar drumming.  But this alternate full blown horn based \\"New Morning\\" that we have here is an animal which simply cannot be contained.  It would demand radio play as surely as \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" had in the prior decade  These horns are commanding; alternately brash, ballsy, melodic, triumphant and even humorous as the song calls for it.  The electric and acoustic guitar overdubs that have been added back in are also spectacular.  After 3 solid weeks of listening I still cannot believe how compelling this take is.  All of the other original takes from \\"New Morning\\" included here are similarly better and quite different from the release.    Dylan wouldn't approach this level of orchestration again until he was fully out of hiding in the late '70s \\"Street Legal\\" and throughout the '80s and '90's starting first with the incredible horn Tour de force \\"Brownsville Girl\\".  It is important to realize that when \\"New Morning\\" was released in 1970 it was to a post Woodstock/Altamont/psychedelic era into a directionless vacuum which would not be filled until the mid '70s disco direction.  Had this horn based \\"New Morning\\" been released, we would have had an entirely different 70's scene.  Late 60's/early 70's soul & Motown artists would have quickly added more brass.  David Bromberg's Chicago big band concept (did it start in these \\"New Morning\\" sessions?) would have been bigger and more successful.  The Stones would have added bluesy horns in a flash.. there would have been no Rolling Bee Gee's \\"Emotional Rescue\\" LP.  The 70's would have been very different, far more diverse. New Wave and Rap may well have been avoided... ahhh, well... we all have our dreams.    The alternate takes of \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\" are fascinating.  The originally released Gypsy has this great understated electric guitar which just hangs back throughout the entire tune with very few, always tasteful, jaggedriffs... invariably at just the right time... all just waiting to cut loose at the end.  However, in the end the guitar does kick in and sizzle but it never quite cooks and that is maddening although it really is a great cut.  Here however, we have an early acoustic demo version and I'm going to guess that it's David Bromberg playing lead on it because his playing is as recognizable to me as his face.  He plays melodic riffs and games with Dylan's vocals throughout, but there are gaps in the song... key lyrics and ideas missing.  But it all is just great. The final lyrics on the released version (and here as well on a second great keyboard based Gypsy) is better and details backing \\"He [the Gypsy] did it in Las Vegas, and he can do it here...\\" are more fleshed out.  Maddeningly though, the final lyrics do drop the single best lyric (only heard here): \\"I contemplated every move, or at least I tried\\".  But to be honest, it was dropped as it really didn't fit the rest of the verse.  That's how one can tell that this is an early version as typical Dylan outtakes have substantially different poetry and imagery which arrive at the same meaning.  For example, on \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", \\"Idiot Wind\\" contains \\"I ran into the fortune teller who said beware of lightning that might strike.  I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like\\" but the original had \\"I threw the I Ching yesterday, it said there might be some thunder at the well. Peace and quiet's been avoiding me For so long it seems like living hell\\".  Very different, yet the same vibe and meaning.  So we are still waiting for an ultimate version of Gypsy with something akin to the final lyrics but I'll be enjoying the three that we now have for at least the rest of my life.    One song which came off truly badly on \\"New Morning\\" was \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", due to horribly misplaced and discontinuous skat singing which rendered it all but unlistenable.  Here however we have the same backing vocalists with much better yet equally quirky jazz tinged vocal arrangements.  \\"Time Passes Slowly\\" which was beautiful before is even better now, more rhythmic, a little better arrangemed and some great \\"la, la, la-ing\\" vocal work from his Bobness.  And there is still yet another great arrangement of it as well on this same release!  It is just all too much... considering the full impact of what \\"New Morning\\" would have been.  There is also some ghostly keyboard throughout these sessions which to my ear might be the same player who participated in the original New York sessions for \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".    I've left a lot out, there is just so much more to say and tracks that I haven't mentioned.  But this is essential listening.    Self Portrait - I waffled between 4 & 5, but there is no choice.  5 stars    The Self Portrait/Dylan portion of the release is complicated for so many reasons.  In \\"Chronicles Vol 1\\", Dylan notes that he recorded covers, threw them against the wall and released whatever stuck.  But he also writes about how he was intentionally trying to drop out of the public eye and he later told Mike Wallace that he had intentionally made some bad albums in this era.  Although it did contain the beautiful \\"Copper Kettle\\" and a nice take of Paul Simon's \\"The Boxer\\", it is clear that what really \\"stuck\\" for him was a release of lesser takes which could serve to diminish his profile.  That is not so on this release.  Incredibly beautiful takes of tunes such as \\"Pretty Saro\\", \\"Tattle ODay\\", \\"Spanish Is The Loving Tongue\\", \\"Thirsty Boots\\" as well some of his own tunes (\\"I Threw it All Away\\" & \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\") are easily as good as anything that he's ever done.    The \\"Self Portrait\\" material is yet further complicated in genre and song selection in that his fans were generally not interested in their protest and electric folk hero moving to a soft middle of the road folk/country genre, let alone doing covers.  True, Dylan had picked up so manyof these tunes in the Gaslight Van Ronk/Peter, Paul and Mary scene followed by the Joan Baez/Eric Anderson London hotel rooms as documented in \\"Don't Look Back\\" but fans of the time weren't clued in to that.  Later early '90s Dylan releases \\"Good As I Been to You\\" and \\"World Gone Wrong\\" were also all covers and far better accepted even though less than a third of the material was well done.  But the original \\"Self Portrait\\" had less than 3 good covers on a double album so you certainly can't blame the fans.  Also, by the '90s people were used to Dylan changing and blues were more palatable to his core audience than folk and country can ever be.    But one insurmountable problem remains with Dylan doing covers.  Simply put, most artists' top signature songs are just not going to rank as top or even second tier Dylan songs.  This is true of \\"The Boxer\\", \\"Thirsty Boots\\" and all of the others here except for a few of the traditional ones that I noted above.  Good as Dylan's covers are, the material simply does not equal his own.  For example, his takes on standards such as \\"Alberta\\", \\"Days of 49\\" & \\"Little Sadie\\" would easily rank as career best signature efforts for country and folk/old time artists ranging from Willie Nelson to Doc Watson.  But in the Dylan pantheon they simply don't rank at all and are now gone from my iPod after 3 weeks as are most of the original \\"Self Portrait\\" versions.    But I can't hold that against Dylan in ranking this release as they are top takes in their genre.  Unless Amazon lets us go to 6 stars for Dylan or limit other country, folk and old time artists to 4 stars, we just have to accept that other artists in this genre can and do get 5 star reviews for far lesser takes.  So the Self Portrait/Dylan half of the collection gets 5 stars as well in my book.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Let me tell you this movie does not disappoint! There are four sub-plots working throughout this film so even if you are not an action fan there is something for you.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal is a serious upgrade over Katie Holmes in the Rachel character. She brings more emotions to the part than Holmes ever could. I have too admit when I first heard Michael Caine was going to portray Alfred in Batman Begins I had some reservations. For us fans of the comic we understand just how important Alfred is to Bruce Wayne. Not just a servant but also a medic, social worker, best friend and conscience. Caine delivers in the films most under rated roll in my opinion.<br /><br />Believe all the hype you have heard about Heath Ledger's Joker! He brings the anger and lunacy to the part only the comic readers would recognize. His sociopathic behavior is perfect. As is his total disdain for all things. He (The Joker) obviously only truly values chaos, and Ledger's gritty performance captures that perfectly.<br /><br />I do need to warn anyone who plans to see this film It is two hours and thirty minutes long. Make sure you use the washroom before it starts, and do not get the large drink. I found it funny but, at the two hour mark a character on the screen makes reference to using the bathroom and I heard four people around me groan. This film is that riveting, you will not want to get out of your seat.<br /><br />I give The Dark Knight 4 3/4 out of five stars. It is not your typical summer block buster. Action packed yes, but with a substantial plot and excellent acting make The Dark Night the best super hero film of this, and any summer to date. Until next time the balcony is closed.........
B009MYARIK|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella books and this one did not disappoint.  The characters are likable and easy to relate to with a story that is charming - the further you get the harder it is to put down.
B001AR4K8K|1.0|I probably should have read the reviews but I'm too trusting. Its a copy of the movie & the case was broken. Very disappointed.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|A fast-paced novel of suspense, action, cunning plot twists, and a love affair for the ages.  From their first meeting it's all too clear that Suza is destined for Nathan, but is love to ever be a part of his future?  Amid the backdrop of history's most infamous--and secret--heist comes a thriller from a true master.
1936891026|5.0|This book- paired with great conversations with good friends and kind strangers- was the beginning of a turning point during a pretty significant existential crisis of mine. how do you deal with the paradox of self-sabotauge and procrastination while on the path of achieving something you love and that you KNOW is bound to be your life's work? you love what's written on your heart- your \\"calling\\", so why do you psychologically fight yourself along the path to self-realization? why are you your own worst enemy? simply knowing you're not alone in feeling this way is a big help, but you'll feel MUCH better after reading this.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|One of my all time favorites! Just what I expected, I wasn't looking for fancy features I just wanted this film on DVD!
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I like the more in-depth story of Tony Stark coping with his ordeal from the Avengers. Just like his alcoholism in the comics. What makes him Iron Man is his inner strength. Some have commented that this show of weakness in this 3rd movie is out of character but I disagree. I do however believe the biggest mistake of this movie is the Mandarin's role in the movie which is a complete mistake. He is one of Tony's archenemies in the comics and is reduced to a joke.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love this game. I find it challenging enough to keep my attention. Would recommend for any age and skill level.
B00AGDW8II|2.0|Recently noticed that Black Widow was added to Amazon Prime and was really looking forward to watching this gem today.  Unfortunately, the video (yes, going back I noticed the 1987 Release Year) is the Debra Winger version.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Disappointed
1577314808|5.0|It's a great book with powerful  messages and it's very easy to read. I'd recommend it to all my friends.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book is a good solid read. Main character is likable but not overly memorable. Nice easy read but if you are looking for edge of your seat this is not the one.u
B008D28HYS|2.0|This game reminds me picross on the day but with more colors. Would have been a five if the user interface was better, but the frustrating controls brought it down to a two, yeah it's that bad.<br />Suggestions for next version or upgrade:<br />1. Add in &quot;x&quot; as a block so you don't have to tap a square multiple times to make the &quot;x&quot;<br />2. Lock the square so you can't accidentally change the color once you set it to a color,<br />3. Create a erase button. Not to be confused with erase all.<br />4. Secondary erase option would be to select the same color. then tapping the square.<br /><br />Nintendo had it right with the user interface for the picross games, follow those controls and this game would be great.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|This book came as a total surprise. The narrator whom sounds really young added to the story by putting a voice to a very young hero.<br />The world building is exceptional and the move between one world and another is easy and seamless.<br />The characters came to life and I can't believe how much I ended up loving the story.<br />If I have any complaint at all it will be that this...the first book in a series is way too short.<br />If you love NA or Fantasy then this is a book you must add to your tbr pile.<br /><br />WaAr
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game so cool must not stop playing minion rush Even seen the both movies I like them watch them both
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|A fun read, anda typical Jack Reacher.  I liked the plot line and it was interesting in the backstory, addineg more depth to Reacher.
B000J1AGQI|3.0|Average.  Some of the acting was so 'scripted'. They worked hard to make Sam Elliot look 'toughass' with select phrases here and there when he doesnt' need it to begin with so it ends  up looking like the directors tried too hard.<br /><br />I'm not much a Platoon fan (the movie), but that movie is better then this IMO.<br /><br />Apocolypse Now is better then both by a long shot.<br /><br />I like Mel Gibson but some of the acting was just too 'scripted' and fake. Kinda disappointing.<br /><br />No disrespect to Vets who enjoyed it, but from purely a movie perspective, there are better options.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark books. Once again she has a great book with Daddy's Gone A Hunting!! Thank you Ms. Clark!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This app is almost useless.  I spend more time restarting it than reading.  It freezes up or completely stops working.  I don't have a kindle at the moment so I downloaded this app on my phone to give me access to my extensive kindle library. Out of desperation, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app with the hope that it would fix the problems.  It didn't.  Also, for some reason, I am unable to access my entire amazon library to download books even using the search on the kindle app.  I usually have to access my library directly from the amazon website and send the book I want from there to my phone.  I was hoping to use this as a temporary replacement for my kindle until I was able to purchase another (mine died) but that isn't the case:(  I also prefer to have only a few books in my kindle carousel.  There have been many times that I have deleted books from the carousel only to have them reappear the next time I open the app.  All in all a frustrating experience.  Glad this was a free app rather than paid.  Amazon needs to fix these problems!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I loved it at first but about a month into having it I had to take the case off my phone so people could hear me!!! Very disappointed
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had been using a different app to clear my cache and junk data on my phone for years. I tried downloading it to my daughter's tablet and it kept freezing. So I tried this one......whoa!  The difference is astounding.Quick and succinct in clearing data caches and needlessly running apps, it is head and shoulders above the other one. I quickly downloaded it to my phone and now my kindle.  I would recommend this a thousand times over. I mean, you clean your PC, why wouldn't you clean your tablets and phones?  They're just smaller computers. They need maintenance, too.
B00DHHFKE4|5.0|Fantastic book that I could not put down. A very emotive account of life in prison making you grateful for your own life.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This TV series is hilarious to watch and enjoy with your family and friends of all ages its just that funny!!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|If your a fan of the Beatles music, this movie is a must have for any collection. A bit trippy, but then again so are the Beatles. I will always love them and this movie!
B005VMSATA|5.0|this one movie is even hard to find in stores so i just bought it from amazon so i can watch it over and over again.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|It's a very tense movie that I found very entertaining. I am not sure why others might review it low. If you like thrillers, then this is a good one. I could've given 4 or 3 stars, but I don't like that. I either like something or don't.<br /><br />So if you have even the slightest interest in this movie, check it out and enjoy.
1250030951|5.0|I read this book like any true fangirl would - within a 24-hour time period, on trains, in bed, before work, after work, at work, on benches, on sidewalks, in restaurants - I read and read until there wasn't anything left to read, and then I went back to the beginning and combed through it again, smiling at my favorite parts.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell has not just opened the New Adult door - she's ripped it off its hinges. This is the first college novel I've read that isn't melodramatic, overstated, and often entirely unrealistic. Instead, Fangirl tells the story of what happens to so many college students in the age of social media. They move away from home and then hermit in their computers because it's familiar. It's safe.<br /><br />This book - though in very different ways - is just as outstanding as Eleanor & Park, and I cannot wait to read more from this fantastic author. I might just have to write some fanfiction for her in the meantime.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|We were looking for this cd for the song &#34;redneck boys around here&#34; Daughter loves this Cd. plays all the time.
B00CRMX53S|4.0|I listen to this song at work and it always feel like a good day, even if it is a bad one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm really enjoying the series! The love story is more central than the kinky stuff. Can't wait to read the 3rd!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This harkens back to the King novels I grew up on, and, come on... we all wondered what happened to Danny, didn't we?
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was sweet, wonderous and magical. I wish there was a sequel. I loved the description of joy and of growing and learning. Beautiful!
B00DU77QP2|4.0|well I enjoyed reading the story, of course in mho books are better, disappointed more in the movie having too many changes, but enjoyed the movie on its own standing, recommend reading.
B009FXIICK|2.0|Start the game with no limit as long as get 100 animals you level. After leveling the first time,  it reverts back to time limit.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I could hardly put the book down. Lots of action, twists and turns.  The book kept you off balance when you don't know what to expect next.  I had trouble believing some of the story, but it was a fun read.  I recommend this book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Such a thought provoking book.  So many hardships.  The details were amazing.  I really felt as if I knew the characters personally. Wonderful insights into many different cultures.
B004YXE438|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game. The pictures are nice on the Fire HD. I like that you can make your own pictures into puzzles so you can have unlimited puzzles. I just turned a picture of my dog into a puzzle. They do sell other picture/puzzle packs which have nice pictures, but if you are an avid puzzle fan, you could get through those fairly fast. With the ability to use your own pictures, you can play endlessly. I've only used the easy setting, but those that are good at puzzles should know that this game has several levels of difficulty breaking the pictures into smaller/more pieces or bigger/easier pieces. You tap the puzzle piece<br /> to rotate it and press and hold to drag it into place. When the piece is in the right place, it will show a check mark if you try to move it, and it won't move. A nice puzzle game, and you don't have to worry about losing any pieces.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I've played a lot of similar games. I found that the navigation in this game to be cumbersome compared to other games.  I enjoyed the beautiful scenes and many mini games once I got use to moving between screens.  The HINTS can be cryptic, which for me made the game more interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install, as advertised.  I teamed it up with Netflix and can watch all the TV show I missed, plus movies.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I didn't like it it wasn't what I was looking for not what I thought it would be never used it
B005PW3OS8|4.0|I never got the chance to see this move when it was in the theaters, but always wanted to.  I thought it had she nice pacing to it and the story unfolded nicely.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game it's fun amazing cute has goals verry pretty and soothing underwater theme I play it everyday have had it for months and if your friends play you can visit their reef in your game! Great for kids and I'm 28 & love it.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays and was really looking forward to seeing it, but alas, I was disappointed.  It's dull, bland, without life.  The actors (many of whom I really like) were just saying the lines not acting the parts.  And a female Conrade, lover of Don John, please!  As much as I would like to like the contemporary versions of the plays, they just don't translate.  Shakespeare lovers beware.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Use it all the time. Especially when my daughter is sleeping and I need to go look for something in her room and don't want to wake her up
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was about 100 pages too long. While not bad, it moved very slowly at times. I had a hard time maintaining interest in the story. The writing was just okay. And the ending was a little bit too neatly wrapped up for me but I'm glad I finished it.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Great ending to the trilogy.  It was definitely not what I expected but books always have to end somehow. I felt like all the really important things happened in the last few chapters but leading up was kind of long. I definitely recommend rereading the first two before this one of its been a while!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I knew this book would have a little extra- well, shine, if you'll forgive me.<br />I was dying to know what happened to Danny Torrence and I was not disappointed.<br />Thanks Steve, I loved it.<br />Your constant reader.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love the app! Doesnt need to be woke to work and thats what I needed. I recommend it highly.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Note that I think this is a Japanese game that has been translated. I mention this as some of the English sentences don't read quite right, though they are quite understandable.<br /><br />There are three ways to play:<br />Normal match 3;<br />Zookeeper Battle--online battle with global players;<br />Tokoton--Catch 100 animals and advance to next stage.  <br /><br />The Zookeeper Battle apparently requires a download of a separate app.  Tapping that mode takes one back to the App Store and the Zookeeper Battle app, which is free.<br /><br />You are given a goal for the number of tiles to clear of each type.  The goal, which is the same for each type goes up by one with each level.  There is a timer bar at the bottom that bumps up with each match and goes down as you delay between matches.  It goes down faster as the game progresses!  If you run out of time, there's a &#34;Retry,&#34; but you start over at level 1, not at the last level you were on..  So, you have more tiles to find each level and less time to find them in.<br /><br />Some of the reviews complain about the poor graphics. Actually, I'd say that the quality of the graphics on my HD8.9 are quite good; but the style is reminiscent of the 8-bit graphics, so it has a very retro look.  But the pieces and videos are quite well rendered.<br /><br />You can turn of the sounds completely, or adjust the volume of the background music (BGM) or sound effects (SE) individually, either from the start menu or the pause menu.<br /><br />There is a &#34;How to Play&#34; that says, in total:  &#34;Catch more animals than target and beat all stages.&#34;<br /><br />If you run out of time and the game ends, there are cute graphics of a judge telling the zookeeper stuff.  One was  &#34;Don't neglect your duty.&#34;  Another &#34;fail&#34; graphic had the judge telling me I  was missing something...and the latest one I got said &#34;You'll never be good enough.&#34;  I tend to agree!<br /><br />There was another cute little graphic between levels six and seven, so I expect others as I play.<br /><br />You can pause a game in progress, but if you quit, you start over at level 1, you can't save your progress.  To resume a paused game, tap the &#34;pause&#34; button again.<br /><br />The only &#34;power-up&#34; I've encountered so far is a little spinning icon.  When you tap on that, all the instances of the tile that is up when you tap it are cleared. 82 of 124 reviews are four stars and above.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it four stars; the ever decreasing time which puts a lot of pressure on very early in the game, the imperfect English and the a-bit-too-simple &#34;how to play&#34; keep it from five stars for me.r cute little graphic between levels six and seven, so I expect others as I play.<br /><br />You can pause a game in progress, but if you quit, you start over at level 1, you can't save your progress.  To resume a paused game, tap the &#34;pause&#34; button again.<br /><br />The only &#34;power-up&#34; I've encountered so far is a little spinning icon.  When you tap on that, all the instances of the tile that is up when you tap it are cleared. 82 of 124 reviews are four stars and above.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it four stars; the ever decreasing time which puts a lot of pressure on very early in the game, the imperfect English and the a-bit-too-simple &#34;how to play&#34; keep it from five stars for me.

B00DHNB5CY|4.0|Everyone knows that the original EVIL DEAD is a classic. This remake (with a female lead) is very gory (I think the MPAA was asleep when they gave this an R-Rating!), moves quickly and has a nice little stinger at the end (you won't see it unless you stay through the end credits).
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Characters were interesting.... But book loses luster about half way through. Netflix series does a good job of dramatizing the book.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I don't use Twitter often, but when I do on my Android devices, I use this app. It works great and is very easy to use. Isn't that what apps are supposed to do?

B004SIIBGU|3.0|If you are looking for a quick view of what you are bidding for on eBay, this app will do the trick, but if you want to search for items for bidding, you should use the actual website, because it loads much faster than this app. If you are going to use this app for bidding, be prepared to be sniped often, because it sometimes moves slower than a snail covered in molasses.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the way Nick's story was presented and then Amy's. I could not put this book down! Amazing Amy was warped by her crazy parents, and I can't wait to see the movie!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found that Dr. Aslan's book helped me to see reasons for the struggle I have long had with the varying faces of modern Christianity. Through this historical account, I was finally able to learn about the context and time in which the events occurred, the political agendas that led to inclusion of certain aspects more than others in modern Christianity, and confirming for me the importance of not taking the Bible literally, as it was indeed written by humans, not by God, and has many contradictions. I hope my friends and family will read this book, too! It should lead to some very interesting discussions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was very interesting and I can't wait to read the other one. I really can't imagine what will happen after what Gale said to the ending of the book. I recommend the book to all teenagers.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|This is a nice sound for John Mayer; all of the songs have a nice beat and easy to enjoy.
B00F91G5BS|1.0|I don't typically read too many reviews for fear of having too much spoiled.  But in this case I sure wish I had because maybe I would have then know that this is a ZOMBIE MOVIE, which I have absolutely zero interest in watching.  Although TECHNICALLY this is about a virus, the effects are exactly the same.  They are hard to kill, want to devour your flesh, and you turn into one if you get bit.  I can't believe Brad Pitt made this movie.  If you like Zombie movies, then maybe you'll like this. But if you don't then you won't.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|This is a fresh new &#34;spin&#34; on his first three albums, in terms of sound and style.  We love it!

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is the exact kind of<br />hidden objects game for which I have been waiting! I love it!....kindle fire HD
B000JMKQX0|1.0|From the title I would have expected a first person account of their activities during the zombie attacks and resolution.  Not even close.  It turns out the book is nothing but interviews that jump across countries and individuals.<br /><br />Not only is it uninteresting but boring.  I'm got as far as 23% hoping it would get better.  No such luck.  I imagine I will have to run out of anything to read before I finish this &#34;story&#34;.<br /><br />Not only would I not recommend this book, I'd return it for a refund were that possible.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is so cool you can have you own ice age village. You get to play games watch videos. I give this app a five star review.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun addictive game.  Just wish credits would regenerate a little faster.  Downside rooms get more expensive and htg items can sometimes take weeks to win.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely. Nikki Heat is a super strong female character. Like the banter between the two, and it was a good fill in between Castle seasons, for which I am addicted. Can't wait to start the next book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it. I use this at night in bed when I can't sleep and I don't have to use my light fir my kindle. But I still prefer my kindle for daylight, by the pool etc.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|I was disappointed at the &#34;James Bond&#34; ish role of Tony Stark.<br />Iron Man is just a highly skilled scientist and inventor without the suit.<br /><br />Having an Iron Man movie without Iron Man hmmmmm.<br /><br />We will have to see what comes next for Tony
B00755MHXG|5.0|simply a lovely story about the important things in life. in a time when children are being led to believe that looks are everything. all teenagers, parents and teachers should read it.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I was surprised that so few JO's were at the opening raid then all but 4 JO's were killed? from the first movie there were a lot of JO's and I would assume that a lot more recruits would have joined, and what happened to the JO's from the Rise of Cobra?<br /><br />Not a very thought out movie, not much of a tie in to the first movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of King's very best books, and I've read them all.  I will not divulge any details here, but if you are interested in the plot and theme of this book then check out the NYT book review from last Sunday's paper.....found online at NYT.com (sept 22, 2013) A stellar review btw.<br />  I try to only read 1/7 of this book(60-70 pages) at a time, so I can enjoy the strange and beautiful realm of this other world all week!  People in recovery (even those who 'don't like SK') will find this book captures that world (the full spectrum of AA)  better than any other work of fiction ever written  no wonder, as SK himself has been there.  read it.  it rocks!
B006Y9BULE|5.0|Beautiful divers watch at a great price. Very accurate and sturdy with a nice feel on the wrist. Highly recommended.

B005N9EZ90|1.0|Let me start by saying that my review is in no way an insult towards Diamond Head or their music. The original album is five-star material all this way. This review is exclusively for the 2CD \\"Deluxe Edition.\\"<br /><br />Diamond Head should need no introduction, they were one of the finest bands of the NWOBHM, constantly pleasing audiences and being a massive influence on so many bands, many of whom have become far better known than Diamond Head themselves. Not surprisingly, they are a band whose back catalogue has seen numerous reissues over the past several years.<br /><br />By my count, prior to this release, there were no fewer than three different releases of this album, including a \\"White Album\\" reissue with the original seven album tracks and seven bonus tracks from EPs and singles and the likes, and a \\"Diamond Nights\\" CD with different mixes and a \\"scrambled\\" tracklist of the album and EP material from the era. I was really looking forward to seeing a Deluxe Edition of this material, which would being even more rarities and remastering treatment to the table.<br /><br />...I never would have expected the so-called \\"Deluxe Edition\\" to be the WORST release this album has had to date!<br /><br />All they did was took the same 14 tracks from the \\"White Album\\" release and SPREAD THEM ACROSS TWO DISCS. You heard me right. There is NO ADDITIONAL OR NEW BONUS CONTENT. They just took a one-CD version of this album and spread the tracks across two discs, adding nothing new. Seriously, the record company couldn't hunt down some unreleased outtakes or early live material? In essence, all this release does is takes already-existing releases of the album and makes them more expensive by spreading the content across two discs. There is a ton of wasted blank space that could have been filled with so much unreleased stuff. If ever there was a wasted opportunity, this is it.<br /><br />Long story short - get Lightning to the Nations, but don't get this version. The \\"White Album\\" reissue, containing expanded liner notes and featuring all of this material on ONE CD (the way it should be) is the way to go.
B000OXHRRC|4.0|It is a good movie but the quality of the DVD got weird at the end.  Just at the ending 5 minutes all the subtitles were pixilated (not the film, just the subtitles).  It was hard to read what they were saying which made for a confusing ending.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely love this game and I am a level 44. there's just one issue. this game is always shutting down on me unexpectedly mostly when I'm trying to visit neighbors! this bums me out because I love this game I just wish it would stop shutting itself down all the time. please fix it!
B00915G6MG|5.0|My family is a NCIS fan, I brought it new so all the disc where good and the packing was great. I recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this for my kids and I am hooked too!  Super cute game, but it is very slow moving. The gems are so hard to get, be careful in spending them. Save them for Rarity, and Rainbow Dash.  Having all 6 main ponies is the only way to beat the game, and unlocking their elements too.  Wish I could give it 4.5 stars, if they give you more ways to get those precious gems I'd give it 5. :D
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I really enjoy this game so far, the levels are varied and challenging, and the new characters have some great special features.  The only thing was I felt is was a little bit short and I wish there would have been more levels.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|I love this game.it involves having to use your head on placement of everything.it kills hours of boredom.great deal<br />.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I totally love using this app.  I trying using a different one previously and it was way too complicated.  This one  does exactly what you want a simple calculator to do.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is probably the best researched and studied diet book that I have ever read. A study that is based on actual research, not hearsay or antidotal evidence. I know there are detractors out there that will try to poke holes in this or that portion of the study. However, overall the fact remains...its true like it or not. Sure there are people out there that are being paid by big pharma, meat industry, and the milk industry that would object to this truth. As you can see from the few negative reviews. But in my own personal research this is the best data that I have found.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really lots to learn and do in this game. Nice graphics. Really fun. Probably the best hidden picture game I've played in awhile.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so much fun it is hard to put down. The game is cute and easy to play making it a game for everyone.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is not about the game<br /><br />If you need to update your game pres the thing in the middle of the back arrow &amp; the magnification glass
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I imagine we all have secrets of one kind or another. This book explores the secrets of three families whose lives inter-connect in a loose, albeit strong, fashion. I have not read a book by Liane Moriarty before but will definitely read her others now. Told so well, the stories of these families flow gracefully and then encounter rapids, like rivers heading towards one another, culminating in rough water.  After the stories reach their climax there is a calmness, an easy flow of the the words bringing everything together. The epilogue is priceless.  Very unique. Definitely worth the read.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I love this book and that's just how I am short and simple but it says I have to have seven or more words so there.
0345529057|5.0|I suspect many people were drawn to this as I was:the show is excellent. These books are better.<br />All are pretty long (over 1,000 pages each) and challenging, with complex plots, many characters, and switches among widely-separated characters almost every chapter, but more than worth the effort: I fairly &#34;flew&#34; through the first three, and am taking my time with the fourth (A Feast for Crows) but enjoying it very much.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I would give it 5 stars, but the two strands of hair I found inside the box made me reconsider. Good thing it's a device that doesn't have to be touched frequently.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|As the above, I had heard a lot about this series and looked forward to seeing it.  I was not disappointed, as its 8 hour format enabled it to explore the affect the murder has on the characters and the larger community of a small town on the Coast of Southwestern England.  That part was well done. The scene at the end between the two women most affected by the crime was particularly good and unexpected (at least to me).  The plot was full of the usual obvious red-herrings, but at least they weren't incredible as many are in comparable stories.  And, I think, the identity of the murderer was a genuine surprise. David Tennant's character was yet another tortured detective, whose agonies became a little tiresome as the series progressed (why was he still a policeman?), and who it was increasingly hard to sympathize with especially as I couldn't understand half of what he said (due to his thick Scots accent and mumbling).  In fact, the difficulty in understanding the dialog was my major gripe - not the British accent, but the fact that no one talks into a microphone or enunciates clearly, so large swathes of dialog are lost.  But enough remained to render it a very entertaining story.  There is to be a second series, I understand - will look forward to that.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and literally couldn't put it down.  There were no dull moments!  Steohen King has written another classic.
B00DTOZD4C|5.0|Hilarious!  Kind of a melding of Candide with Simplisius Simplicissimus...and a pinch of Hermann Hesse Bildungsroman.  Sardonic humour sown about in silly, episodic plantings. Loved it!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|As Cath struggles to assimilate to a college culture her sister Wren seems to dive into without hesitation, she's caught between two worlds: the fandom one in which she knows exactly how to maneuver, and real life, in which she feels hopelessly out of her depth.<br /><br />Like most new adult novels, we see the typical coming-of-age stories with boys, but they are less central to the story (and for this, I breathe a huge sigh of relief). Instead of being about ALL TEH SECKS, Cath's journey is about finding herself, not defining herself through a relationship with a boy. Boys are secondary. This is all about Cath.<br /><br />Best of all, Rowell totally gets the world of fandom. She has created a complex, Harry-Potter-like world that Cath's fan fiction exists in, and she walks the fine line of how unbelievably nerdy it can seem to outsiders while still showing how all-encompassing the world can become for some. Best of all, she acknowledges that great writers can exist in fandom -- and come out of it as well.<br /><br />This the the Kindle book with the most highlighting for me, and the one I probably have felt most intensely. For those of us are are -- and have been in the past -- a part of a fandom, Rowell has written OUR story. And it's fantastic.<br /><br />This review appeared previously on Goodreads.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved Season 3. Just wish some of my favorite characters hadn't been killed off. Looking forward to Season 4!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I enjoy both crossme color and crossme. I wish they would add more to them or create a new one. I am so hooked it has become just about the only one I play. Thanks for the fun and clean pics.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|Tracy Letts' work typically portrays the lowest of the low in humanity and Killer Joe is no exception.  Because his work is so controversial and in-your-face, subtexts and even key overt elements are often overlooked.  For example, I have never read a single review that explores the reason Dottie is the way she is - she clearly suffered brain damage when her mother tried to asphyxiate her in her infancy, an incident she claims to actually remember.  In addition to the obvious disgust elicited by her dim-witted father's and \\"devoted\\" brother's willingness to have this fragile, virginal creature defiled by Joe as a \\"retainer\\", the brother's sexual desire for her is palpable.  One oddity is despite the fact people are shown vomiting, bleeding, and spitting on the floor, the trailer in which the main action takes place is and remains relatively neat and clean in appearance.  The actors all turn in genuine performances. If you've seen the play, you will never think of Killer Joe as anybody but Matthew McConaughey again.  While the other performances evoke emotions ranging from deep pity to utter disgust, McConaughey makes Killer Joe a person anybody in their right mind would fear from the moment they met him.  The violence is graphic, but believable.  We need to be reminded of the consequences of real violence sometimes lest we all succumb to the GTA mentality that it's all just a game we could go out and replicate in real life without harming anybody or anything - a mentality that may have resulted in recent mass shootings at malls, movie theaters, workplaces, etc.  If you want to see a film that moves you on an organic level, see this.  If you are easily offended by representations of human debris, don't.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Shooter is a good movie, but a very hard movie to follow.  You have to pay close attention to details and what the characters are saying to understand the whole movie.  I ended up reading the full synopsis, on IBM, to understand the movie and to understand why they chose Bob Swagger, Mark Walburg, to be the shooter in the first place.  It's a shame that you have to read the synopsis about the movie, even after you have watched it 5 times.  But all in all, it's a good movie and they couldn't have picked a better actor for playing the part of Bob Swagger.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I started reading this with slight trepidation. It has been a while since one of Stephen Kings books has grabbed my attention. I missed the old stories he used to write, but that has never stopped me from buying each and every one of his books. Because in the end I am still a fan. This book brought me back to when I used to stay glued to the pages till the very end. There was no struggling thru the first few paragraphs to get to the good stuff this time.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|It helps me keep my mind sharp. I wonder how many levels are there. If you like puzzles this is a must have. I strong recommend this game.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|The oddness of saying you must see the Werner Herzog 3d movie notwithstanding, this is a terrific documentary.  Get the 3d version, so you can really understand the skill of the artists.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Bingo blitz should not have any non-tradable items in slots, or any rooms for that matter.  The fun of the game, not only is winning items yourself, but by getting to meet new friends by trading items. This new item gifting block is unliked by me & many other players as well.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Get it, Listen to it, Achilles Last Stand is one of the greatest of all zeppelin songs if not the greatest.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love the concept of this series - Mystery writer and the police solving stories.  The Castle and Beckett side story just adds more to this series - Mystery, Comedy and a Love story.  Couldn't ask for anything better.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I think this game is funny and cool. The dog's name is Ben. Me and my little brother play this game and we make videos of it. This game is so funny!!!
B00CL0J99K|2.0|I'm not an iron man fan boy, do I'm not crying about the villains in this. BUT this movie was so horribly written, first 1 1/2 was virtually no action, all dialog. Then they had to add an annoying damn kid in the mix, and that scene, that was reaching for comedy, with the \\"mandarin\\" was so painful. Tony Stark was iron man for 10 minutes or so of screen time. I love that all these people, pepper, villains, can just jump right into the suits and fly, fight, launch weapons, all with no learning curve. By far, not even close, the worst movie of the year, and is planted in my top 7 worst of all time
B0094BB4TW|1.0|i tried downloadiing the app  it sends an sms code  i enter the code & I keep getting the message facebook has stopped. terrible!!!!<br />UPDATE: I've tried updating this app since it's 15 months out of date!!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game so fun erasing ur own horses looking to my hourse 2 so yeah love it hope everyone else loves the game as much as me
B008M0NDOK|3.0|Not universal enough to keep my son interested as long as I thought it would and he loves gameloft games, currently looking for a better controller
B004MC0FO8|5.0|It really is like magic.  poitn it to the TV, radio, another's iPod and it will not only tell you the song, artist, album, etc., but will send you to where you can buy it or listen to it off the cloud.  Excellent App.  If it's been recorded somewhere, it will find it.
B00ECLU346|1.0|Hangover 1 was great very funny lots of laughs.  Hangover 11 not so much. Hangover 111 not at all. Big disappointment

B000FCKGPC|4.0|So many new characters!  The plot keeps moving and thickening. The series is a world of its own that is totally engrossing.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This is pretty fantastical, is that a word. A revised take on the story, the color, the filming, everything was really great.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Three shooters of Vodka and O.J. before takeoff--just to take the edge off. Got to love Denzel's very likable human portrayal of a man doing his job &#34;better than by the numbers&#34; in crisis. And in the end acknowledging, despite his superb flying skills, he had an addiction while flying.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the reminders, love that the whole family can use the same account and we can all read and complete plans.  I can read what my 13 yr old daughter is using for her plans and we can talk about it whenever the chance arises.  No problems using the app on my laptop, phone or tablets!
B00F35BV64|4.0|The actor who played Khan(sp?) stole the show. With him the movie has a depth of emotion beyond the action. Well worth the price of admission.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I read this after Let's Get Visible. Both books compliment each other very well, and I would recommend them to any independent author looking for info on how to market their book. They are must reads.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I believe because I love to Cook that I love this game.  I love the challenge in making sure what I have put to Cook doesn't spoil and attract those dreadful flies!  Decorating is fun too since there are a variety of themes to choose from.  Thanks for all the fun to the creators of this addicting game!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like how you search the room for all these tools and advance to the next floor. Not too challenging that I'd give up easily but not super easy either. A fun little puzzle game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really awesome kids will love it<br />Need to buy it<br />Kids WILL love<br />Best game in the world<br />Many levles that are aweaome
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down! It kept me on the edge of my seat! I never could have guessed what was going to happen next! Great book, recommend it to anyone who likes a great fast read. Took me an hour to read it!
B00A285OOW|1.0|I enjoyed the other &#34;Cousins' War&#34; books, but this one is pure tripe.  Characters are flat and inconsistent.  I wonder if Ms. Gregory handed it off to someone else to write.  Don't waste your money.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book...it was a true work of imagination, uniqueness, and definitely one of the best books of the century.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|When you play, there is no indication about how you are doing. Or maybe there is and it is too fast for me.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Been looking for something like this for a while. Great game minus the couple glitches I have ran into. Heres twenty.
B0063M22QO|5.0|such a great pass. time. I enjoy the challenge. .good for the eyes and the brain. never played before.Good to learn something new.
B00AALXPN8|4.0|For the most part I love this movie. However they do use some language that I do not want my 2 year old to repeat, such as: Shut Up, Jack Ass, Ass, and Stupid. I just make sure my kid knows those are not nice words and should not be repeated.
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|I have heard of Lorde but haven't heard her latest known single, \\"Royals\\", until now. This song is already one of my favorites and I find myself replaying this song over and over. In my opinion, this song doesn't get tiring, heck, I could listen to this song all day. Finally, an anticipating new talent in the music industry who shows her originality without trying to seek major attention. You won't regret listening to her latest single, she's a talent who is destined to be successful as long as the music industry doesn't \\"popperize\\" her material. I'm a singer-songwriter and the lyrics in this song are creative and original. I would like to meet her one day and possibly collaborate with her. So far, \\"Royals\\" is one of the best songs of 2013!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|This is a great Cher album, kinda a mix, of Cher Love Hurts, and Cher Belive album. All the songs are good except, the songs: favorite scars, and lie to me. This long awaited cd was well worth the wait, the two bonus songs I don't have to sleep to dream, and pride rock. If your a Cher fan there is definitely plenty of songs on this album, that will be some great ear candy to your ears.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|nothing streams better than this. right now, only google play, netflix and youtube work. i think hulu and hulu plus? not sure. i can't wait for others to sign up like nfl network, anime stations, etc., etc. cast from your phone or your computer or pad for the price of a date at the taco truck.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Since most of the shows are on hiatus for the season. I decided to give this show a try. I always assumed from the commercials that it would be another Law & Order law type drama. Wow were the commercials misleading. 10 minutes into the season 1 premiere I was in love and hooked!
B000P0J0D8|5.0|great movie. fantastic. one of those one of a kind special projects that captures a moment in time that you can cherish and relive over and over again.
140006922X|4.0|I liked the book a lot and Aslan's perspective on the historical Jesus made sense to me.  At times, it was little bit like reading a text book, but still very worth the read.  It is the first historical perspective I have read that was not from a biblical viewpoint and I found it mind expanding, which is always a good thing.
B002ZG9846|5.0|There is a bit of humor a lot of action and quite a bit of drama in this movie. The movie is not your typical super hero type movie it contains some fairly unfamiliar acting at the time of its release but the story was nice and I enjoyed it. I will warn not knowing that there is going to be some profane comments in this movie would make me wonder just what someone would be considering when reading the title so it may not be for everyone but I gave it a shot and thought that it was well worth the purchase. A 4.7 out of 5 stars to be exact I would rate this at. While it may seem a bit generic in some aspects and the acting of the villain seems a bit generic it is actually just the scripting and the role that he plays it is supposed to be mildly sarcastic and corny so really the role is played well.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is amazing. It works great on kindle fire and iPod an  iPhone.the only thing that is bad about this app is that you can't just text your friends with their real phone number..........your friends have to have a username and stuff to b able to text them. But besides that amazing app
B00AEFXCG0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm a sci-fi geek so this movie was a theme park for me. I'm also a big fan of the original MTV cartoon series. I thought they did a good job translating it to a live action film. It got 5/10 on IMDB, but I would give this movie 9/10. I suppose it's not for everyone.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really liked the two other books that K. Hosseini has written although liked may not be the right word.  If you have read those books you know the stories were horrifying and hard to read at times, yet I found I couldn't put them down. This book is a history lesson without  all the gruesome details.  I liked that but it was a slower read for me.  Much of the book is very thought provoking and I did enjoy it and would recommend it.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Really fun movie for 9 to 90 year olds.  Good young actors who show up in a lot of movies since making this one.  The family gang is funny and makes the movie
B008OOYALE|5.0|An intriguing and challenging game for all ages!  I recommend it and enjoy the opportunity to play with others from around the globe. Get it and play with family and friends.
1439102813|4.0|Excellent book! We read it for book club and I wasn't too enthusiastic about reading it- thought it'd be depressing. Once I got into the book it was quite interesting and not depressing. It was written like the author was inside the mind of the woman with early onset of Alzheimer's. It takes exceptional writing to accomplish that type of writing or technique. Good job! Would be an excellent read for anyone and certainly for families affected by Alzheimer's.<br /><br />Cynthia Briggs<br />Cookbook Author<br />[[ASIN:1403381658 Pork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and Reflections]]
B00BEIYP1W|4.0|Ron Howard's Rush succeeds on two levels, as a compelling story for the non-race fan and sufficiently accurate for the Formula 1 fan.<br /><br />The film is about the fierce competition between two Formula 1 drivers, James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. The central piece of the film is the 1976 racing season where Nikki Lauda is badly burned in a horrific crash. The two drivers are polar opposites, Hunt loved fast cars, fast women, and a fast life; Lauda was the technician who worked hard and was serious about everything. The differences between the two make for a fantastic drama.<br /><br />The casting was perfect. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) plays James Hunt the perfect combination Val Kilmer, Jim Morrison, and sex symbol. Daniel Br&uuml;hl (Bourne Ultimatum and Inglorious Basterds) does a magnificent job as the calculating and angered Nikki Lauda.<br /><br />This is a review of the theatrical release.<br /><br />Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan knew nothing about Formula 1 before they embarked on this film. I was convinced this film would go the Days Of Thunder direction. Thankfully they spent a lot of time with Nikki Lauda and some other drivers to get things closer to right. They still missed at times; the film isn't perfect from a racing perspective. They did a good enough job to keep the film entertaining without going crazy on racing details. Lauda has endorsed this film.<br /><br />Ron Howard appropriately paid homage to Grand Prix (there were several shots that looked exactly like James Garner in the 1960's car) and Le Mans; two of the greatest racing films ever made. This film concentrated more on the dramatic on track conflict between Hunt and Lauda and less on the backdrop love story that bogged down Grand Prix. Howard did not fall in the massive bear trap of over juicing the racing footage - Days Of Thunder and Driven being the worst racing films ever made. He did misstep a few times, drawing in a bit of NASCAR with two cars banging wheels. In Formula 1, open wheel racing, those two cars would have flown off the track and not just bounced off each other. There were a few moments where cars flew past each other, another Hollywood trick that doesn't ever happen in a real race. Other than those small things, the racing was well done.

In a day when there are constant in car cameras during actual races, it is hard to come up with new angles for racing. Rush found those new different angles.<br /><br />I liked the mix of historic footage and similar new footage that had an old school heavy grain to it. They did a masterful job blending those elements. Surprisingly the film was shot exclusively in Germany and the UK. Through editing and careful dressing they managed to make that footage look like tracks all over the world. They didn't do very well with Monaco, I'm not sure where they shot those short segments, but something was wrong with them. The cars from 1976 were beautiful. It was so wonderful to see those cars on a track running again. The sound was incredible - the rasp of those engines was superb.<br /><br />The film is rated R for nudity, language, and drugs. Strong language is used a lot in the film. The nudity is brief glimpses of women's breasts and full rear nudity of Chris Hemsworth (which would have passed for late prime time television). Drugs use is shown several times. There were several scenes about 2/3 of the way through the film that I couldn't bear to watch. Lauda's crash - I knew it was coming, I knew which race it happened at; but knowing didn't prepare me for how brutal it was and how it was depicted on the screen. I honestly, closed my eyes at that moment. I couldn't bear to watch the scenes in the hospital with the bandages and his lungs being vacuumed out. For those reasons, this is probably a film best left to mature audiences.<br /><br />Rush was an exciting film that I enjoyed a lot.eel racing, those two cars would have flown off the track and not just bounced off each other.

B0055S348W|5.0|I love being able to print from my kindle! I am able to select the individual pages that I want to print vs printing a whole document!
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Charges My note 2 quick without any issues.  Only use for emergency that's all I bought it for or long international filights.  Only issue I do not like is you have to unplug it right after it is fully charged our it will be damaged peer the manual.  Would be nice of it would just stop charging when full.  Besides that no problems.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|So far I'm really liking this game. Let's see how it gets. OR if I'm gonna have to pay a SHIPload for the remainder of it. These G5 games are pretty good, but not cheap.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game I have been looking sleep. Very addicting it would be nice if some stud was cheaper
B008D28HYS|4.0|I love this kind of puzzle and the colors add a whole new level of difficulty.  The only thing I would change would be to include a black space in all the puzzles to allow the player to fill in a blank when they have already figured out that no color will go in that space.  Otherwise, keep them coming!
B00499LTLM|5.0|I just recently discovered this show and I must say, Amazing! Cumberbatch is great! I'm looking forward to Season 3.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Martin has a gift for creating a universe that completely envelopes a reader.  I enjoyed the rich character development, breadth of the world, and incredible plot twists.  In many ways the expanded world served as complimentary characters - each new place an entirely new component of the story that interacts with the protagonists here.<br /><br />The pace of A Feast for Crows is markedly more deliberate than The preceding A Storm of Swords-  and readers should be warned that half (!) of their favorite characters may not show up at all during this stage of the epic.<br /><br />Overall a rewarding and engrossing read that slants closer to literature than &#34;Fantasy&#34;.  Still, I wish Martin had exercised a stronger editor to clean away some of the backstory and minor characters that seemed to clutter parts of the narrative contributing to the feel that this was more of a transitional novel with a lot of setup.  The thing with The Song of Ice and Fire series is- one never knows which &#34;minor&#34; characters and piece of the &#34;backstory&#34; becomes integral to the incredible plot twists that make the reading so unpredictable and enjoyable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LOVE the large keys, simplicity, functionality and more, all superlatives about this app. It's also very flexible, and would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />SLOUCHYBUD
B00DGKQF2S|3.0|I like the guys voice a little like chris cornell but his guitar solos are really lacking feeling but he can SHRED just not my thing! Bass Player Sheenan=Awesome Drummer Portnoy=Awesome but I really don't like the sound of his kick

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This works exactly like a calculator should.  It is simple and basic just what I needed.  I have it 4 star because it would be better if it would rotate with the screen.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It has great video quality, easy to use interface and the instant videos download fast and easy.  I would recommend it very much.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|HORRIBLE MOVIE!! Started off really good and had really great potential and then the ending SUCKED!! It made me so angry I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this!
B00CWVGNS8|5.0|Watched Yossi and Jagger a few years ago, that's a great one. Now, there's only one of them, living in pain and vain, which reminds so much of myself. Anyway, it's a fantastic movie, especially the description of mental activity. Just love it. And, two consequences after watching this: love Tel Aviv, definitely my next destination; and you are not alone.
0375836675|5.0|I read this one as part of my school book club. As another member of the club said, &#34;Reading this book made me a better person.&#34; I agree. You can't look at the world the same way after reading this book.

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! THEY JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER WITH EVERY MOVIE THEY MAKE IN THE WHOLE AVENGER SET. A TOTAL MUST SEE!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Took me awhile to get through this one because I kept falling asleep a couple pages in at a time, that's how slow this book feels through the first 3/4's of it. The last 1/4 of it, however, suddenly builds up and leaves you wanting to know more about the secondary characters that you never really paid much attention to through the first books of the series......
B002APU580|5.0|The characters, acting, scenery..... basically everything was amazing. Loved this movie. Definitely one of my favorites by far. This will be my go to movie on rainy nights.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|A lot of people say there are really bad permissions. But I have had those app for about 1 year now. And nothing bad ever happened. My virus app had scanned this as safe. And my kindle fire HD 7 has been fine. So there r just a bunch of . people out there who worry to much over a great app.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Remember, it is just entertainment and this one is OVER to top in UN-reality. Check your common sense at the proverbial door, buckle up and go for the ride.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and hopefully I didn't lead you too far astray.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's an erotic novel yes but if you have any intellect, you'll realize it's poorly written. More for teenagers not for me.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a really good series, I have told lots of my friends and they are planning to watch too......

B00CATSONE|4.0|I knew almost nothing about the man, other than what I've read on Wikipedia and other places. I found out he was the father of our electrical system. Well worth the money and time to read. I also liked [[ASIN:B00DF4SBA4 Up!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is really fun game. It is really addictive I can't stop playing. My little vision love this game so much It keeps her q
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Loved the first four books. This one was long and boring, but I felt I had to plow through it just in case the next book in the series was of the quality of the first four.<br />Not sure exactly where this saga will continue from here, but the characters that remain seem shells of their former selves. Most of the attractive characters have died.<br />George Martin is a wonderful fantasy writer and I'm always amazed at how he presents a huge cast of characters to the reader without confusion.
0307271609|5.0|Few rulers from Imperial China cast as long a shadow nor suffer from as much infamy as the Empress Dowager Cixi.  An extremely clever and resourceful woman, Cixi by dint of bearing the emperor a son and her own ability to seize any and all opportunities, rapidly moved up from low level concubine to top level concubine to Dowager Empress after the death of the Emperor in 1861.  Cixi and the wife of the late Emperor Xianfeng, Empress Zhen, engineered a coup with the aid of several Princes and allies.  Cixi proceeded to be the ruling force behind the throne for the next 47 years.  This was amazing for many reasons, not the least of which being the extremely patriarchal nature of Chinese society then.<br /><br />However, history has not been kind to Cixi, who these days is more known for her notorious behaviour - long fingernails (a sign of not having to work), daily meals of 100 courses or more, spending the entire budget for a navy in building her marble boat in the Summer Palace outside of Beijing, and resisting reforms leading to the collapse of the Qing dynast.<br /><br />Author Jung Chang sets out to correct this view in a well-researched and well-written biography of Cixi.  She presents a revisionist view of the Empress Dowager as an fair ruler and reformer.  By peeling back the layers of the onion, and using primary and secondary sources, Chang is able to develop a better and more nuanced portrait of Cixi.  Yes, she was ambitious, but rather than the anti-Westerner that stories have lead us to believe, she was quite interested in the rest of the world (in contrast to the previous emperors whose arrogance provoked the wrath of European and American governments).  Indeed, she sent delegations abroad, promoted learning in China beyond the traditional Confucian classics, and sought to improve the lot of her country.  However, as powerful as she was, there were many entrenched interests who wanted to restrict Chinese industrialization and development.  Ultimately, she was not able to prevent the disintegration of the Qing dynasty.<br /><br />Chang has written a fascinating book, starting with the background of Cixi, and then as she blossoms into a ruler during a tumultuous time.  This engaging effort to rehabilitate Cixi's reputation shows us that this complex woman did much good for China.e was not able to prevent the disintegration of the Qing dynasty.<br /><br />Chang has written a fascinating book, starting with the background of Cixi, and then as she blossoms into a ruler during a tumultuous time.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|As an avid Razer user I was a bit skeptical at first with this.  After reading the reviews and doing some online research, though, I thought I would give it a chance.  I am excited to say that the mouse exceeded my expectations for it's price point.  It has a solid weight in my hand and it fits nicely during long gaming sessions.  I like the rubber on my thumb side, it helps prevent slipping.  I like this mouse, and would definitely purchase it again.  My only concern is longevity.  At this price point I'm concerned that over the course of time it will not hold up as well as others I've purchased.  We will just have to see, though, right now I'm loving it.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|I bought this app but then it didnt work at all so it was a big ripoff please fix this
B0076DELIG|3.0|This is not a bad book and is skillfully written.  But the story could be told in half or one third the time and that would be a lot better.  I listen to books while I exercise and I kept wishing Connelly would just get on with it!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This up is fun and addicting it's just like subways surfer it's just that it goes faster I give this APP 5stars :)
B00BG08FKK|1.0|I love the film soundtrack as much as I love the other eight Les Mis recordings I have, but the cuts on this \\"deluxe edition\\" are outrageous -- most egregiously the climax of the entire show, when Valjean frees Javert at the barricade. What were they thinking keeping all the incidental music and some spoken dialogue yet leaving that out? If you want to listen to the film soundtrack for Les Mis, play the Blu-Ray or stream the video on your phone -- don't waste your money on this decidedly NOT complete soundtrack.
B000W93CHC|5.0|With great care for accuracy and research, Follett has surpassed himself in this thrilling tale of romance, intrigue and life in England in the Middle Ages, when the ruthlessness of knights and the ambitions of clergy and nobility was surpassed only by the poverty of the serfs and the devastating, relentless advance of the Great Plague. Set in fictional Kingsbridge some 200 years after Pillars of the Earth, the descendants of the original story now populate a completely believable and more complicated world of political intrigue, poverty and a disease that doesn't discriminate between classes. Written with great compassion and sensitivity to detail, Follett paints a memorable tale that follows the lives of characters we truly care about. Rarely have I read a book that I was sad to reach the last page, wanting more. Prepare yourself to lose sleep over this long and rewarding adventure. It's impossible to read in one sitting, but you will be tempted to do just that!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app. It works well and I like the at-a-glance ease of use. I have it on all my devices.
B005LF9OCE|3.0|Fun stuff. The writers  are starting to run out of creative ideas though.. Looking forward to the final season.  Yes
B002HHPVHQ|5.0|Great story, excellent insight, quick read, really enjoyed this one. I found myself google-ing the characters in the book to see what happened to them since the crash....very interesting tale
B00ET7INY0|5.0|I have been a Ry Cooder fan since his Paradise and Lunch album. Went back and bought his earlier albums as well as all of his future albums. I especially like his line up with the musicians of the Tex Mex sound. Wooly Bully was a complete surprise which I have played over and over. It wasn't until I did some research that I found Ry and Freddy Fender recorded with Sam the Sham during the recording sessions for the soundtrack of the Border. Ry Cooder seems to just keep getting better with age.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I've seen the show, Orange is the New Black, which I think is great. The book isn't as openly dramatic & actually has some really touching scenes. I couldn't get enough of this story. Piper shows the unfairness & unethical ways prisoners are treated & how they rely on one another when the system fails them.
B00DJ80VMM|3.0|Let me first say this; a fan I definitely am.  So I've heard all of their albums.  A lot.<br /><br />This one is top notch, musically.<br /><br />What I can't get over that is spoiling my listening enjoyment is the recording quality.  It's mixed and mastered just fine; but I'm hearing distortion!<br /><br />At first I thought I damaged a tweeter.  I have a hi-fi system...one caveat of it is that if there's something to be heard on a recording whether it's supposed to be there or not, it makes it audible.  I hear this throughout some portions of the album.<br />1:20 into \\"illumination theory\\" the guitar riff is begun to be played back through the left channel and it distorts, non-harmonically.<br />So, I play my downloaded version of it on my computer.  Same thing!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J. Abrams continues his Star Trek reboot with this power-packed blockbuster. This is a must-see for any fan of Star Trek! The 3 formats make it super-easy to access the feature film from almost any device. There are simple instructions to follow to activate your digital copy. As if the feature film weren't enough there are wonderful behind-the-scenes special features about the making of the film. I can't get enough of it!

B002WV5A9G|5.0|I rented this again to pick up where the new Star Trek - Into Darkness was possibly going to pick up at.
B00A285OOW|2.0|was boring and very poorly edited.  The same idea was repeated over and over again sometimes on the same page and the book was spell checked poorly.  For example, referring to  the two sons  as the princess instead of the princes.  A good editing job would have reduced this book by half.  The book was mainly endless wars, rampant speculation about the missing princes, and a portrayal of Henry as insecure and frightened over and over again.  So disappointing after waiting so long for the book.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love this app I have not had any trouble with this, in downloading my music and when I am using my tablet, and<br />there's no wifi, I can still listen to my music, it is worth the 5 stars!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great game. Entertaining and allows you to keep having fun without making you by credits. I highly recommend this game of you enjoy defence style games.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the best books I have every read! ! Highly recomend. I really enjoyed the look into the culture of India.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Cool! So what is the next Star Trek going to be about? To me, the trailer to the movie was a little deceiving. But, I guess that was like judging a book by its cover.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|Please note that this is a READER only - you cannot edit or create documents.  Also, when it opens, it advises you to purchase the font pack (which really isn't necessary).  USELESS.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have all of the modes. Plus me and my brother play it all the time. Hero brine is in it to if you put in the seed herobrine. Overall awesome game.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I am in love with so many of 22learn's apps! I believe this is my 5th or 6th app purchase from them and they never cease to amaze me. The colors are always vibrant, the games fun, and the sounds catchy. This game specifically teaches the alphabet and is soooo beneficial! There is picture and matching and shape awareness which continues to educate on a different level. Overall a FANTASTIC app! The paid version of this game has so much more than the free one! I am SO glad that I upgraded! Vibrant and simply amazing!

B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors, especially now that he's older. The idea of a man who wrestles with alcoholism while still doing his job is one with which I can relate.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game, frustrating when you run out of coins. Addictive, too. Set aside a lot of time to obsess over it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun, easy to play and a free download! :) it's great you don't just get so far then find you have to pay extra for the rest, as long as your happy to wait for the energy bar to fill up daily.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I have been an avid reader of Patterson and Lee Child for many years, however, recently I have felt as though their stories were somewhat repetitive and had lost their uniqueness.  Over a cup of coffee, a friend of mine had recommended this book, The Time Killer.  He praised it for its originality and the unique perspective that the author introduces.<br /><br />Taking him up on his recommendation, I picked up the book.  Right away in Chapter 1, the authors establishes a gruesome beginning that sets the tone.  I was instantly hooked.  He author did an amazing job of weaving a complex story and didn't fail to deliver in the end.  I was also a big fan of the complexity that existed between Max and Jesse.  These different levels made the book feel unique and created a  spine tingling effect throughout the whole book.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone looking for a new fresh approach to a great genre.  Looking forward to ready more by Todd Thiede.

B005721W9O|5.0|Galaxy Quest remains one of the best spoofs ever done.  Sam Rockwell is fabulous as Guy Fleegman and Enrico Colantoni's portrayal of the Thermian commander, Mathesar, makes the entire  farce possible - the movie's Gracie Allen.

1476734941|3.0|This book explains the benefits of useing this diet. i read the main part but otherwise you can just forget the book too much stuff in it that nobody cares about .diet could have been explained in 2 paiges ,not worth the money.

B00CL0J99K|2.0|I have not purchased this item, nor seen the movie...my review is simply about pricing. The current price for any version/format of Iron Man 3 is outside my break-point and I don't understand why Amazon is not more competitive. Similar newer releases and pre-orders such as The Wolverine, World War Z, Man of Steel, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Pacific Rim, etc. are all offered for much less and I consider the price point for this title to be unrealistic in comparison. At $31.99 for the 3D Combo-Pak it's too much for me but I will happily purchase it at Walmart for $24.96 ($21.96 after the Disney Movie Rewards coupon)!
B00A2K7QH8|5.0|This dvd is the original 2008 version of the film.  The special features include Presto and Burn-e, which are the original film shorts and another short in that order.  For $1.50 you cannot beat it ($3.99 s/h).  The only thing I didn't like were the previews, advertisements at the beginning and end, but a younger person might like them.  I would recommend this video for all ages, particularly the younger generation

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is fun, quick paced game, that allows the player to select either winning or random deals. You can also choose from a number of backgrounds and card back designs. There are advertisements but they're not particularly intrusive, and the game is free after all.

B002S8AGZG|5.0|This movie is very cute. I have loved this movie since it came out in the theater. But to be honest, I watch it for Heath Ledger.
B001AHM2C6|5.0|His music is so full of emotion!  You can see the movie via music. WOW! Between James Horner and John Williams, Zimmer can paint pictures with music!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I knew a bit about the orphan trains and was interested in the book because of what it is about.  I also knew it was a novel and not a work of biography or history.  But as I read the characters became as real as any people can become.  And I loved them -- loved the children on the orphan trains, loved esp. the one to whom my attention was directed by the author -- Vivian.  I loved her as a lost girl and I loved her as a 91 year old woman who decides to learn how to use a computer.  Molly, the Penobscot girl who was also displaced from a place in life that one would wish for any child, was not as real to me.  I think it's because we spend so little of her life with her.  I was pleased to read the remarks by the author about her struggle to blend the two story lines in a way that would not leave the reader eager to get back to whichever one it was that she preferred.  I was SO happy the novel did not devolve into a romance.  I will look for other fiction by this author.  I've read a couple of her edited books.
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|the cast is awesome, the story will keep you interested & paying attention all throughout the movie. its a great thriller.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Installed quickly and worked great from boot up no problems at all. That says a lot right there I had boards in the past that started out with driver problems and crashes right from the start. Seems very compatible with a large variety of games. So would recommend it to anyone as very good upgrade path.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Packed with Action, Adventure, Mystery, Comedy, Love, and all Great Actors! Besides you can never go wrong with Morgan Freeman or Bruce Willis!
B005HI4LLY|5.0|What a refreshing take on slasher movies. Roles reversed! Super funny and a must own for your slasher movie collection.
1476727651|5.0|I can't believe it.  Danny is back and that is all I'm going to say.  I'm on page 120 already.  I would have read longer but I have to cook and take care my elderly Dad.  I have to admit I burned a pot of rice so I had to put it down.  It came 9/26/13.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|This movie is nothing like the book. You may enjoy it if you haven't read the book yet. With that said, the zombies are the result of a viral infection- just like in '28 Days Later'. IMO, this is a weak effigy of that movie, at best.
B005GYGCOI|4.0|easy to take to your trip (especially since the printed edition is BIG)<br />only setback is maps dont zoom in as much as i'd wanted to.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|A bargain price wise, Does a fantastic job of cooling CPU, VERY large and mounting is somewhat awkward for the AMD cpu but it is a good buy in my opinion anyhow.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|I love Agent Phil's Humor and not that serious till I say so persona. I just hope that the writers and production staff can find a strong story to tell or rehash the &#34;heros&#34; thing really really well. Oh yeah Alphas too forgot
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|its okay I wish it didn't take so long to refresh your energy did not like it do not recommend
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I ordered pearls and got the email that they were purchased using my amazon coins and they haven't popped up on the game and its been 3 days, if I had known that would happen I wouldn't have purchased them. I can stand the add that pops up ever 2 mins or when I go to do something
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game it is so cool and so life like I had to ask my brother to see if I should get it and he said yes get it it is a super fun game anyway I love it it has a great price and it is all worth it thank you
B003274QH6|5.0|You'll have to get all the seasons once you've been hooked on season one. Well written and well acted. Enjoy.
B00122KUEG|1.0|I love Madonna but I hate this Album her other albums her first ones are good but this one sorry it's not good at all. I'm actually not a fan of this album but could suggest better ones Like a Virgin, True Blue and Ray of Light
1781162646|5.0|It really depends on what you are looking for:  It's a wistful coming-of-age story told within the context of the traditionally creepy setting of an old-fashioned carnival complete with fortune-tellers, fast rides and unsolved murders.  It's not apocalyptic horror, it isn't jarring or disturbing--think quirky Hitchcock mystery with supernatural elements. A strange and personal little story with moving characters.  It's not a long book and doesn't require a huge commitment in reading it. I found it to be utterly charming.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. I like the ability to watch the weather where all my kids are located. I like to use this to keep tabs on the weather here at home in case of frost.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Its fun. Takes a little concentration but its great trying to figure it all out. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a wonderful  book.  Hard to put down!  There were so many aspects of the story that sent you thinking of yourself, or someone  you know, who has had to &#34;come of age&#34; in the way that Harold did in his journey.  And, then his wife had to also evolve while he was gone.  Don't miss this book!
B003NS1JHY|2.0|I held off on seeing this movie for the first time since I have never been much into remakes of old TV shows, and I am a big fan of the original. However, I also recently became a big devotee of Steampunk, and after I heard that it was one of the quintessential Steampunk movies, along with \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and \\"Van Helsing,\\" I decided to try it out and rent it for a day.<br /><br />What a disappointment! I got through about the first half hour or so before I fell asleep, woke up just as it was ending, and while I still had about a half a day left to watch it over again and catch the parts I missed, I decided--Nah! I have better things to do. Like take a nap.<br /><br />It is awful! I've read a few other reviews of it, and most of them said that Will Smith and Kevin Kline have no chemistry, and that was spot on. I've always loved pretty much anything that Will Smith does, but it's kind of hit and miss with Kevin Kline, and this one was definitely a miss. The dialogue between the two was forced and unrealistic, the stunts and special effects were contrived, and the whole thing pretty much--well, face it, it sucked, and please excuse my French.<br /><br />The only bright spot in the movie was Salma Hayek, although it wasn't enough to compensate. While looking as fetching as ever and while she tried to make a mousse out of a cowpie, she just couldn't pull it off with the lines she was given. Another one of my favorite actors trapped in a miserable mess of a film. I like Kevin Kline too, most of the time, but he does seem to gravitate toward these bottom-feeding snooze fests. Far cry from \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" my friend.<br /><br />I gave it two stars only because it did a somewhat worthwhile attempt at Steampunk. Otherwise, save your money.
B00122B8EW|5.0|This is the last great album Green Day put out IMO.  And the best on top of that. All of their poppy stuff before this was great too.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great book! Very easy to read. I found myself making excuses to go read, I haven't done that in years. Tesla was brilliant, some of the stuff I already knew but it was neat to read the details, and it was amazing to learn more about him. Very good read, definately reccomend it.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|Josh is trying to move on and grow as an artist by branching out. I get that. It's cool--I just don't like it. I wish him the best of luck, but this is the second album that just didn't do much for me (and I was a big fan of his older stuff). Maybe he feels like the old classical-crossover type work was stifling or trite or just not his cup of tea anymore; however, that's the style I fell in love with years ago and that I'm not finding on his recent productions.<br /><br />I have two general opinions on Josh's music which are both very evident in this album:<br />First, he has such a gorgeous, rich, deep voice--and he wastes it with soooo much falsetto. A little bit here and there is fine, but I feel like he way overdoes the high range.<br /><br />Second, I just feel like Josh is trying to be someone he isn't, vocally. He has a classically-trained, big voice. And it just sounds...hokey and out of place when he tries to sing jazzed-up pop songs or (on the other end of the spectrum), delicate acoustic folksy melodies. His voice is just too heavy. I wish he'd go back to David Foster who seemed more adept at giving him material that fit his voice instead of trying to be \\"cooler\\" by seeking out producers of rock and other styles that don't fit. That's just how it comes across to me, anyway.<br /><br />Bottom line: He still has a lovely voice and I generally think his lyrics show talent and depth. I enjoyed one or two of the songs on the album and it's obvious by the other reviews that he has plenty of devoted listeners who have embraced the change and will be keeping him in business. I just probably won't be one of them anymore.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Excellent movie. Very good outcome. I really liked an original movie, finally. Instead of trying to copy another movie, very pleased.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it totally rocks!!! I love rue she was my favorite charactor i give this book five stars
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This album is a very good album & several songs are especially fantastic, but I had to listen to it through to take it in & not have the typical kneejerk reaction that many fans can have when their favorite bands change some. Judged based on it's own merits, the album is supurb. I wouldn't say that it is another 6 degrees or octavarium, but it does a good job at trying. There are elements they are trying to bring back (instrumentals, 20+min song) That are good, but there are going to be notable imperfections. Given a little time for acceptance, it'll be a new staple in the DT collection, but it does feel a tad rushed. I suspect that someone (perhaps a record company rep) pushed this project before it was fully ready, though this is pure speculation.
B00DW0TFP6|5.0|Well done album. New drummer adds a new vibe to band which is good. Not standard Avenged but you have to move foward and change and grow and this band did and its great, the hard drive is still there but a different feel I love you will too A++
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I got this so boyfriend and I could have something else in common lol.  Last night we watch 4 hours of it and we're very entertained. This is def an adult series but a good one! I want to read the books now!  It has everything from action, romance, love, lust, lies, betrayal, hope! Go get you one!
B000FC12SM|5.0|The best book ever! I have learned so much reading it! Thank yoi so much! It has Us so much!
B0031RS7X6|5.0|Always readable, Kinsella has produced another light, funny and fast book.<br /><br />Her characters are real, honest and believable. Just love her books!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Still learning, all the features one at a time, always something more to make it easier. When you start to feel comfortable with what you know something is added or changed to put the????? in the operation
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Need more levels and need more clues some rooms don't make since by Will play when more rooms come available
B00F2362IE|2.0|Like most everyone else, my experience with this game has been all bad.  My son spends more time watching it &#34;loading&#34; than he does playing the game.  I instantly regretted the purchase.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I was so happy to read this book.  I strongly recommend that you do not skip to the start of the diet. It is very important to read the why and how and the science behind how this lifestyle works.  When you read why and the science it gives you even more will power to keep on this lifestyle because you know what bad carbs do to  your body and that its not worth it to cheat. I have done Aktins before and lost 100 lbs very fast. The results are instant.  And even after only 2 days you begin to feel great and full of energy!  This isn't a diet fad this is a lifestyle change.  And don't worry you will be able to eat carbs again once you have lost the weight you want.  Some people can have as many as 100 carbs a day which is a lot and still maintain that hard work they have done.  This book is amazing and I learned so much!
B000JPRPAO|4.0|I actually really enjoy this movie. While predictable, I do think it is a good story-line with lots of action. Charlize Theron is absolutely beautiful and was excellent in this movie.  As a new MINI Cooper S owner, I bought this because well, it only seems fitting and I love the movie anyways.  :)
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I found it quite interesting to learn how Presidents use Presidents.  Fantastic read, and I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|Plausible world building is always an essential element.  While we have a detailed description of dystopian United States, we don't have any idea how we got there.  If you are going to make a world in the United States, you better make your readers believe there was a plausible reason for the development of this strange world.<br /><br />The main elements of the world are:<br />1.  Love is evil.  Let's surgically remove it.<br />2.  We all live in big walled cities.<br />3.  Our religion tells us that the people who are saved are those who don't give into the disease of love.<br /><br />Love is evil.  I don't know if a big war has decimated the world or what, but it was determined if love was removed there would be a lot less war.  People of the United States, we have decided for your own good to perform brain surgery on you and remove the disease of love.  Never again will you love your children or spouse, nor will they love you in return.  I can't see anyone lining up for this surgery, except for the mentally ill.  WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER COUNTRIES?  If the U.S. has an emotional lobotomy, how will this stop other countries from going to war against us?  It doesn't.  If you think too hard, you realize that this element makes no sense.  All it would do is further divide the citizens of the United States and create a civil war.<br /><br />We all live in big walled cities.  It sounds like an urban prison camp.  For some unknown reason, people willingly gave up their homes, businesses, and farms in order to live in a walled urban camp.  You aren't allowed to leave.  How would you sell this to make people willingly do it?  In order to save you from war, you must give up all of your possessions and come live in a walled urban prison.  I don't think many people would willingly sign up for this.  And if everyone was so for this, why would they have to be moved into big urban camps?  To save you and your property from wars, we will give you brain surgery, take away your freedom, and take away your property.<br /><br />There is a new religion.  The United States is a largely Christian nation, and the leaders are mostly people who say they are Christians.  No reason is given why we would allow our religion to be changed.  It is clear that religion is still important to the people, so it makes zero sense why these same people would allow the government to change their religion to suit their own needs.  You can only be saved and go to heaven if you have the disease cut out.  God has spoken.<br /><br />I awarded zero stars for a plausible world.  The author just put in her own 'cool' elements, and she failed to make them believable.<br /><br />Lena's character was very carefully crafted and explained to us by the author.  It was made clear that she was DETERMINED to never catch the disease because she had a very difficult childhood living with her diseased mother.  Her mother ultimately killed herself.  She also had a difficult time at school because of her mother.  People like her were ostracized due to having relatives that went crazy from the disease.  Lena was looking forward to being cured, and she was extremely negative about anyone who did not act in the proper manner.  The author has given us a strong character who is strongly motivated to be a good citizen.<br /><br />Alex was super hot and he winked at her, so Lena does an about face on all her moral beliefs.  She breaks rules.  She falls in love.  Alex is an uncured who is hot.  Lena could hardly believe he was interested in her because she wasn't hot.  Other than Alex being hot, Lena had no motivation to break the rules.  So the author provides this piece of repulsive motivation, all her matches are ugly wimps.  Oh why do these books continually do this?  He's super hot, so I am a totally new girl...*excuse me while I vomit in my mouth*.<br /><br />Then to make the love match seem even more unlikely, the author carefully explains that when one member of the family suffers from love that the entire family will be punished for it.  Lena willingly throws her family to the wolves in order to feel love...unh!<br /><br />I award this zero stars.  I hated the characters.<br /><br />While the author had a nice writing style, I couldn't buy into anything in this book.  So two stars for a nice writing style.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|to keep with the upside down theme of this film i've rated it five stars .. because it's actually a one .. at least according to my tastes
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I find this calculator easy  and trustworthy to use.  It is my first choice for balancing my check book and doing my budget. The number keys are large enough , as is the answer. It works well on my Kindle Fire.  It keeps the calculation just entered under the tally number which helps to keep correct for the next entry, even if interrupted. Like it a lot.
0545265355|5.0|Sick of Twilight then read this.  They movies don't do is Justice!  This is a great world that Collins has created and it could forshadow what are country could turn in to.  This is for guys and gals.  Amazing read and you'll get hooked! I couldn't put it down!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book brought to light some serious deficiencies of the incarceration system in this country.  It seems the author clearly projects how rehabilitation seems to be lacking in most prisioner's time of detention.  It left the reader wondering just what should be done to help prepare these people to return to the outside world once their sentences are served.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|What a tale of both inner-turmoil and outer-perseverance!  I was taken with how each came together on this journey.  Strayed recounts with stark honesty her pain at her mother's death, hard to take at any age but particularly for someone at only age 22, and how this contributes to her self-destructive behaviors that rip her marriage apart.  Other family relations crumble as well leaving Strayed quite alone in the world.<br /><br />Strayed doesn't present herself as a heroine in her story.  She exposes the dirt in her life in a way that most of us would find difficult to share with all but our closest friends/family and, even then, most of us would rationalize it.  Strayed does none of this as she truly bares her soul.<br /><br />While \\"Wild\\" does share moments on the trail, this is not a travelogue or a how-to.  More of a how-not-to.  I started reading it expecting it to be more of a recounting of an adventure on the trail to help me plan a hoped-for future trek of my own along the PCT.  I quickly realized I was reading a different type of book and, really, that was just fine as I enjoyed it for what it was.<br /><br />Some of the negative reviews chastise Strayed for being self-absorbed.  Huh?  That's the very definition of a memoir.  Maybe they shouldn't read memoirs then.  I came away from the book with renewed appreciation for my life.  I didn't lose a parent until I was 49 and it was hard enough then.  And, yes, I was self-absorbed in my grief even though I had many more resources than Strayed to help me get through it.  I actually think I would have benefitted from embarking on a similar physically-demanding adventure when grieving as it would have gotten me out of my head quicker.  I admire her for that.  And for her honesty.
B0071MDA2U|1.0|I got this as an audiobook from the library.  This may be important that it was an audiobook because the author was presenting two separate timelines at the same time.  One timeline was about the trip from Portland to Brooklyn, and the other timeline was what happened after they arrived in Brooklyn.  When it first happened, I thought the CD was damaged and skipped to another portion of the story.  Later, it just became annoying and confusing to jump between the present and the past.  There wasn't a good reason for it, and it didn't add to the story.<br /><br />The story also still suffered from a poorly built world and awful, non-inspiring characters.  Because this is a sequel, those poor elements still existed.  If you were hoping for something that would make this world plausible, you can stop hoping, because it doesn't happen.<br /><br />Lena goes undercover as a citizen, and she joins an extremist pro-love removal group.  Lena gets to fall in love again.  Yes, again.  And the book ends with a set-up for a love triangle.  I am hating these type of books.  And her new love comes off as a young child rather than a 19 year old.<br /><br />I won't be reading book 3.
B000I0XLYO|3.0|ben stille has better movies but its good for a laugh but don't take it to you're mom it kinda racy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it... Need I say more. You women out there who's into romance will understand what I'm talking about
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not a big Cruise fan but we wanted to watch this one for the story.  If you've seen one Cruise film you've seen the plot to most of them.<br /><br />Crisis which requires his intervention.<br />Pretty girl...rather, damsel in distress, who needs Cruise to make her world right.<br />He saves the day, gets the girl....or at least almost gets her.<br />We're supposed to leave with the awesomeness of his character.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sylvester Stallone.  Steven Segal.  Chuck Norris.  Even Clint Eastwood.<br />Their films all follow the same plot.<br />It's kinda sad to see talent wasted on ego.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an awesome read...I didn't want to put it down! I cried when it ended...and I WILL be reading it again!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I just started this game.  So far so good. Now I need to get friends. I also need to find out how to use my spouse and children. Enjoying it.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I loved the whole trilogy, although i think this last book is not quite as powerful as the first two. it's softer, maybe that's part of why... but still, it's a pretty good way to end the series. I'd definitely read it if you liked the others.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Humm, no wonder it got so many awards. Great story, great actors. I wanna watch the rest of the seasons!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This was a very good book that makes you yearn for the wilderness and to be in a more adventurous place.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I only get free games on my kindle fire and I wanted to see what Minecraft was all about so I downloaded this game. I played 5-10 minutes before it told me to buy the full version!DO NOT get this game!!!!!!!!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I have to admit I haven't been this excited about a collectible in a long time. Sailor moon is all about nostalgia for me. It was the first anime I ever got into. That being said, I have never been this disappointed.<br /><br />I checked out the reviews before placing my order for the figure and noticed the various complaints about damaged boxes. As a collector this is a HUGE deal breaker. I went ahead and made my order anyway and selected 2 day shipping hoping that the less the package was handled the better it will be upon arrival. Boy was I wrong. Once I completed my order I called Amazon to voice my concern about the figure's original packaging being damaged in transit. They assured me they would take every precaution to ensure the it arrives in good, undamaged condition.<br /><br />It was very upsetting to find the mangled box that arrived on my door step. The Amazon box looked like someone had just stomped on it. The entire bottom half was smashed. I had no doubt of what condition the actual figure packaging would be in upon seeing the state of the outer packaging. There was no bubble wrap or anything remotely protecting the interior. Only a single sheet of defeated bubble at the bottom of the box. I didn't even get an invoice inside the box. Not to mention it sounds like something is rattling inside of the box...maybe some of the pieces came loose. I didn't know I chose not to open the figure just incase.<br /><br />I called Amazon again and told them what happened. I was treated very nicely and promised the issue would be resolved. They said that they would ship a second figure through one day shipping and email me a return label to return the damaged one at no extra cost to me. I was pleased with this but I'm still concerned with the fact that I have yet to receive the email regarding the return or a confirmation of the new shipment. Perhaps they need more time, but If I don't receive some kind of notice by Monday I will be calling them again.<br /><br />This is all very disappointing considering I plan to order the rest of the sailor scouts as they are released. I would not like to have this problem with the rest of the figures. PLEASE FIX THE PACKING AMAZON! a BIGGER BOX with maybe some bubble wrap and packing peanuts would help!<br /><br />*update<br /><br />Amazon has given excellent customer service. I got my return label and a shipping confirmation for the new figure. Hopefully, there are no more issues with the shipment/transit of my figuart and moreso I hope this solves future issues for other collectors that order these figures. I definitely can not complain about amazon's customer service they have been great every step of the way.
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|My favorite characters from this show have to be Charming & Snow because I'm a sucker for a epic love story and the Evil Queen because she is sooo good at being bad. Cannot miss this show ever. Another addition to my series collection!!
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|It was a great book! I love how it was drawn, I also loved the page when it had peach crayon. It was so funny when he was NAKED!!! Ha Ha!<br />At the very end I loved how you made all the animals and everything different colors...<br />But you might want to give blue crayon a break, coloring all those blue things might not make blue crayon stubby anymore, you might not know blue crayon is in the box anymore! But anyway best book ever!
B000I9VZJ8|4.0|If you like movies about kids in high school going through what kids in high school go through, but with a somewhat off beat twist to it, you just might like this movie.  It's not one of my favorites, but on the other hand, it was worth watching.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|I liked this movie.<br />Other than killing each other for the sake of killing it goes to the characters heart and<br />as they examine their lives understand that the hate have to end.<br />I recommend this movie. Is a great moral story.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This angry birds game is AWESOME! It's so great that within a day or two I'm already almost done with all the amazing levels! I only buy free games on my kindle fire so this game was a huge bonus. I'm amazed at how many characters they have created for this game. They include Boba Fett,Darth Sidious,Count Dooku,Qui Gonn Jinn,Darth Vader,and many others! Another bonus is that you can play on the pork(dark) side! The only bad thing is that there is only two worlds that you can play. PLEASE GET THIS GAME!
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|is a very nice watch but the quality of the brand is very bad.<br />the clock stopped working a few days of purchase. send it to invicta for repair, came back after 2 months and less than a month returned to have the same problem
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Some things never get old. They were meant to make music together. Sabbath is back. Give me more black Sabbath.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Dislike.  A few passages wordy. Can skip without missing storyline<br />Rating.  Because of unnecessary filler sections<br />Overall a good story. Love when I finish a book and can't quit thinking about the story. Also makes you feel what they go through.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood gives another great performance as the Korean war vet who moves back into his old neighborhood.  If you've never seen this flick, rent it.  You'll be happy you did.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|While the game at its basic root can be relaxing because it's a simple puzzle game, there are some problems with it.<br /><br />1. You can't track your progress. What I mean is that you have no clue on how many levels you've already completed and it doesn't really give any indication on how many levels exist.<br /><br />2. It's easy to circumvent the system. If you don't like a puzzle you can just hit the back button on your device then hit start and it generates a brand new puzzle.<br /><br />3. No real challenge. I've been playing this game off and on since it was offered as the FAoTD and I've yet to receive anything less than three stars on a level. It doesn't matter how long I take or the amount of moves I make. It always awards three stars. I once had a puzzle where it took me 50 seconds and 18 moves there was still three stars awarded.<br /><br />Otherwise it's not that bad of a game. If we could track progress and be able to tell how many levels we have completed, I would be more inclined to give it more stars for a rating.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is an extremely fun game. I love Despicable Me so I immediately got this game. It is a fun version of Temple Run but with a twist. The unfortunate thing is that it is really slow.<br />  I would be rating this a 5star but it is to slow ): .
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great book but with so many characters it was easy to lose the plot as the chapters skipped from one character's story to another.
1401917232|5.0|I had the honor and privilege of checking out Gary Renard's long anticipated 3rd book, Love Has Forgotten No One: The Answer to Life, this past summer.  Here's my review for it.  The book is set to be released on October 8th. Enjoy!<br /><br />In Gary Renard's third book, Love Has Forgotten No One: The Answer to Life, Arten and Pursah are back with their very outspoken yet very sincere approach to the pure non-dualistic and non-compromising principles of A Course in Miracles, reminding the reader that he or she is never a victim, that the world is not your home and God has nothing to do with any of it, and that the application of true forgiveness is the only solution to all your perceived problems.<br /><br />In addition to his usual talks with Arten and Pursah, Gary also gets to chat face to face with two of Jesus' disciples from 2000 years ago, Thomas and Thaddaues, who share a bit of their experience and forgiveness lessons during that time period. Additionally, Gary very candidly shares with all of us many of his personal forgiveness lessons he's endured since the release of his first two books - likely much to his chagrin as the chapter titled \\"Lessons of Gary\\" is the longest one in the book!<br /><br />Also in Love Has Forgotten No One, Arten and Pursah explain to us what happens when you die. They also talk about healing modalities or \\"bones for the ego\\" on the level of form that may be helpful to you in your healing while applying true forgiveness into your everyday life. The events of September 11, 2001 are also discussed herein (but don't expect the mainstream news media version.) And it wouldn't be a complete book if Arten and Pursah didn't give us a little tease as to what to expect in the future here on \\"psycho planet.\\"<br /><br />Of course, it's never Arten and Pursah's intent to discuss the aforementioned topics to make them real, but to point out that they are to be used as forgiveness opportunities so you can break free from the world and go Home. At the same time, they reinforce the idea that the Holy Spirit's message is never about giving anything up physically, but about releasing our psychological attachment to it all, and that it's totally appropriate to do normal human things while enjoying what the world has to offer us on our way to becoming enlightened.<br /><br />With Gary's prior books, The Disappearance of the Universe and Your Immortal Reality, being my personal favorites ever, 1A and 1B respectively, naturally Love Has Forgotten No One is 1C for me. As Arten and Pursah say in this gem of a book in regards to this world, \\"God didn't bring you to it, but the Holy Spirit will see you through it.\\" Giddy up!<br /><br />~ Mike Lemieux, author of Dude, Where's My Jesus Fish?: A Compilation Highlighting the Blunt and Uncompromising Teachings of Arten and Pursah on A Course in Miraclest the same time, they reinforce the idea that the Holy Spirit's message is never about giving anything up physically, but about releasing our psychological attachment to it all, and that it's totally appropriate to do normal human things while enjoying what the world has to offer us on our way to becoming enlightened.<br /><br />With Gary's prior books, The Disappearance of the Universe and Your Immortal Reality, being my personal favorites ever, 1A and 1B respectively, naturally Love Has Forgotten No One is 1C for me.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We went through the first three seasons in three weeks! Pretty awesome! Without spoiling anything, this season saw some resolutions to some situations from season 2, but presents a big one at the season finale!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|I've enjoyed listening to Roy Orbison for years.  This album did not disappoint.  It's a good addition to any playlist.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a very very great app not to mention that it's free now I can check the weather without changing the channel on my tv

B00CATSONE|4.0|This was a very enjoyable experience. The book is short, which is not a bad thing, and easy to read. Very informative and inspiring.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|One of those apps that actually work!!  Love it!! I use it to help me sleep and it works like a charm
B0006AAS5G|1.0|The seller contact me, but I never received it.. this is the second watch I don't receive and I don't get a resolution.  If I buy a watch I don't want my money back, I want my watch.  but it seems some seller have difficulty with the courier the choose.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I can't believe they made this movie on only a 10 million dollar budget compared to all the huge budget movies of today. This was a really entertaining movie! I wish they would have spent a few million more on an advertising budget. This deserved a bigger release.<br /><br />The acting in the move across the board in the movie was terrific. Throughout the movie I was telling myself that the lady sure looked a bit like Reese Witherspoon. In the middle of the movie I looked it up and sure enough it was....not the type of movie role I associate with her. Mathew was great in this movie also.<br /><br />It was a bit drama, a bit mystery, a bit suspense, a bit adventure. You weren't sure who to believe at times.<br /><br />This was not the current genre of over the top shootem up, bang, bang, blow things up, get shot 10 times, run over by a tank yet still be able to get up and fight off 40 bad guys to get the woman and be the hero. This movie actually had a pretty good level of realism to it. It also had a story line that I think most would find very interesting and entertaining.....even if you enjoy the bang, bang, explosive shootem up movies.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Tons of fun, practise, practise, practise pays off. Can not be beaten for a buck.Turned down senistivity on tilt steering, big improvement.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I had vaguely heard of the orphan trains,  but was unaware of the magnitude of what occurred.  Even though I am not an orphan, I could relate to some of the difficult experiences that Vivian faced. The book was well written and hard to put down.  Thanks so much for a story worth telling.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down. I also couldn't wait to get to the next book. I truly love this trilogy.

B00F8L2VO4|1.0|This app looks ssoo awsome but the thing is they only have like 5 languages to pick from... and they DIDNT have the language i want to learn... that sucks cause it really looked like a good app for learning langauges
B00DURHYWC|5.0|I must admit I was somewhat disappointed with what was coming from Pink Martini on their last couple of productions and they were starting to remind me a bit of the Andrews Sisters. I'm very pleased to say that this is not the case here. They are back on top form, doing what they do best and oh do they do it so very well on this album. China Forbes uses her voice to it's very best. The music and production is of the very highest quality and the inclusion of Rufus Wainwright in their ensemble on the last few tracks is magnificent. He is so at home here and fits in with their groove like a velvet glove. As the title says &#34;Get Happy&#34; and that's just how this album makes you feel. in fact it makes you feel just fabulous. Let's hope they continue to bring us more like this in future.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This has really helped me relax and sleep. And that's saying a lot since my life is currently in ruins.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Christoph Fischer nails this mid twentieth century story by painting a vivid life of survival during a dark period of European history.  The Luck of the Weissensteiners had me wondering how mankind can be so cruel to one another.  I really thought deep about what it must have been like to be in the shoes of some of the characters in this epic but sobering novel.  Two thumbs up for this thought provoking history lesson!
0440237688|4.0|What would it be like to live in a world where everything his ordered and dictated by a manipulative hierarchy? Where your meals are brought to you daily and your job is predetermined and assigned to you at twelve? The Giver by Lois Lowry tackles this question in more in a tantalizingly thought provoking novel.<br /><br />Jonas's world is perfect. Everything is under control, and there are no choice. Fear, pain, love, and war. All have been eradicated as a sense of \\"Sameness\\" is being strived for in the Community. But when Jonas turns twelve, he, chosen from amongst all the other children, is assigned the prestigious role of \\"The Receiver of Memories.\\" He is to receive special training from The Giver. The Giver holds memories of the true pains and pleasures of life. He alone is burdened with this task as the rest of the Community remains oblivious. Colors do not exist, singing does not exist, love does not exist. But now it is time for Jonas to become the receiver of the truth. For him, there is no turning back.<br /><br />Lowry uses well-crafted prose to create this image of a dystopian world masked with a facade of utopia. It is thoughtful and well worth a read through or two. It is a good starting block to anyone interested in dystopian literature although its deep themes and intensive emotional level will require a slightly older, more mature reader--especially to appreciate the author's talent and the message.<br /><br />While it may be hard to grasp the concept of such a different lifestyle (and for some it may be hard to sit through), it is important to remember, Lowry is not advocating this flawed society. In fact, she is only inviting us to consider if our society shares any similarities with the flaws of The Community. Do we erase memories too painful to bear? What extent to we go to ensure equality? Do we place stigma against things that go against how things are supposed to be done?<br /><br />Ironically, this book has often been a subject of controversyand has found a place on banned book lists. Celebrate the freedom to read the just passed Banned Books Week and read a book as wonderful as The Giver. I would not find it to be a regrettable experience.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|all you need to do is go to [...] and on the top type in youtube and it brings you all these great youtube apps I love it but before you do go to settings click on more and then click on device and then looks for ALLOW INSTALLATION OF APP FROM UNKNOW WEBSITES once you find it switch it from off to on. Your welcome! :)
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Love the game, but it resets my coins back to 0 so I cannot upgrade, super frustrating. I reinstalled it and this still happens. Eeeek, uninstalling now
B000NA28I4|2.0|MY EXPERIENCE<br />I have \\"read\\" the superb audio-book version of the entire series several times, and greatly enjoyed it.  I saw the movie when it first came out in theaters several years ago, and had a vague recollection of it being a mild disappointment.  Then (finding for sale on Amazon for $2) I bought a copy.  Incredibly, watching the movie again, I DID NOT REMEMBER A SINGLE CHARACTER (i.e., actor) NOR SCENE FROM THE MOVIE. (Albeit, I did remember the corresponding characters and scenes from the books) The movie was entirely \\"new\\" to me.  That's how incredibly forgettable the movie is.  The excellent \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies actually add to the superb LOR novels.  But the Eragon movie adds nothing, absolutely nothing, to the Eragon story.<br /><br />SAPHIRA, ANGELA, and ERAGON<br />> Undoubtedly, my perception of Saphira is influenced by the audiobook.  In the audiobook, Saphira sounds like a dragon.  In the movie she sounds like a silly little girl.  I simply could not get past the girly voice.<br />> Angela was worse, far worse.  In the audiobook, she has the appropriate voice of a strange old woman---in the movie she's an ordinary teenage girl.<br />> As for Eragon himself, I've long been annoyed by \\"liver-lipped\\" actresses who can barely speak because of all the collagen injections.  But a liver-lipped guy!!! Give be a break!  Check out his photos on-line, he doesn't have liver-lips in most of the photos---so they were clearly \\"manufactured\\" for the movie.<br />> How is it that the characters of the movies and audiobooks are consistent (similar voices) for the Harry Potter audiobooks and movies, and the Lord of the Rings series, but the director of Eragon could not even roughly match the far better voices (even though by a single narrator) of the audiobook?<br /><br />ETC.<br />I agree with pretty much all the other complaints about the movie, so there is no need to repeat them here.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Try the audiobook, Paolini's text, and the excellent narration, bring the story to life infinitely better than this movie.he excellent narration, bring the story to life infinitely better than this movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love it because you can know all words without downloading<br /><br />Love this dictionary because you don't have to have internet
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Needs an update for more levels. Good game overall though. It is challenging without being too hard I'm enjoying it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We did not watch this when it first aired, but we really like the story and the characters.  My daughter who is also a lawyer is also watching using Amazon Prime.  Great show!
B0087GYY92|5.0|A good idea is not enough for a novel. You need characters you can believe in and the ability to describe them. Scalzi tries to build a whole novel around an old in joke about Star Trek. If you read it, you will regret the waste of time
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Well worth reading this book.  The way the secret wove itself through so many lives..and I would never have guessed what it was, by the way.  I found myself asking \\"what would I do?\\"
B005F3GMAO|5.0|I burned through this book pretty quickly. Prior to studying business I gave myself the option of buffing up on macroeconomics or reading Branson's autobiography. I made the right decision. Through the tales from the beginning of his career as a teen up until nearly the present day (there are a few addenda to the book he adds with more updated information), Losing My Virginity chronicles the career and many lives of daredevil businessman Richard Branson.<br /><br />From Losing My Virginity I realized that taking risks is am important part of life and when people think you're crazy for wanting to buy an island or an airline, it can often mean they simply lack your vision. Branson was and is a forward thinker, ahead of the trends, who has a nose for opportunities and an invaluable primal instinct that tells him when to hold on to or let go of a endeavor. I also saw from his experience that passion in life for things other than career and money, like family and adventure, make you more successful in business.<br /><br />It's interesting to see how throughout his life Branson has encountered multiple seemingly impossible situations. How he resolves them is proof of his resolute commitment to moving forward and persevering in the face of daunting obstacles (think, British Airways). I feel like \\"if he can do it, so can I!\\"<br /><br />Humbling and motivating at the same time, this is a smooth, fluidly written book great for anyone who wants reassurance that the best of us go against the current to end up fulfilled and successful.
1849904251|3.0|While the case book is amusing with exchanges between John and Sherlock via post it notes, I just don't see the characters actually doing such exchanges.<br /><br />Fun book, but not really in depth about anything, either the cases or the relationship of the two men.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great and does exactly what it says. Graphics are really awesome and is packed with usefull info on battery life for different functions.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love the Pinterest app and have been using it since I got my kindle. It is continually force closing and I would like to know why. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Turning my kindle on and off, etc. Please help!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Killer was well written, but somewhat predictable almost from the beginning. It was pretty much a page turner knowing that the main characters had rolls in the plot of story.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I bought these DVDs and finished the season in three days. What I like most about season 7 was definitely Deb's development into a more complex character, as well as her relationship with Dexter. Their interactions are really the high point of the season. We also see how Dexter evolves and, for me, he does so in a believable way.<br /><br />After the way season 6 ended, Deb's character has more on her plate this season. She shows us that she has just as much depth and internal conflict as Dexter, it had just been harder for her to show us other sides of her in the past because the story didn't give her as much to work with as Dexter. This season, Deb shows us her different faces, surprises us with the way she reacts and because of how she chooses to continue, we like her even more.<br /><br />There are new characters similar but different to previous villains we have seen. Their performances are as good as previous killers in the other seasons but at this point, the new types of criminals/killers do not thrill me as much as they once did. It's not the story's fault but after six seasons, we get the routine. This is why I liked the way season 7 shook things up and while there were still semi-predictable villains, what these characters really help to accomplish is helping Dexter understand himself better and push Dexter and Deb's relationship to the limit.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this was a great app before the upgrade which I did not know was going to happen. now it freezes up and I cant use my kindle at all. I have held out hoping it would get better but its frustrating. good bye weather channel.
B004IPPINW|5.0|This was a book my son read for a college course and recommended to me. I read it in one sitting. I am still digesting it, so don't know what to say, except, &#34;read it!&#34;
B00B52F278|5.0|I have watched Spartacus form the beginning season to the third and finally season. I have all of the DVDs in my collection and will definitely watch them again! This series was so well done. Incredible fight scenes, costumes, and awesome characters that you either love or hate. I felt like I was transported back to that era. If you don't have a problem with nudity, which there is plenty of it, I highly recommend watching all the DVDs of Spartacus. A story about people fighting to be free during the Roman Empire!
B009P12GQ6|5.0|If you don't have this album in your classic rock collection - it's a must buy!  Emerson, Lake and Palmer are pioneers in their own right with a unique quality like no other band.  Trilogy - worth the investment!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a great sequel to The Shining. I loved reading about Danny Torrance as an adult now. I also love the character Abra Stone Danny helps. The &#34;bad people&#34; are described so eerily they both fascinated and freaked me out. I felt this book tied up a few loose ends and explained a few of the &#34;whys&#34; left after reading The Shining. I think if you enjoyed The Shining you will enjoy Dr Sleep!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Of course I am biased.  What can I say.  I love Cher!  How can a true fan even begin to critique this lady?
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Can't wait to pick up book number three and start reading on again. Bummer to wait so long to read the series but really glad I am now. Provides so much more background and depth compared to the TV show, which is still phenomenal.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game has amazing graphics it is really fun. This game is the best with online multiplayer and it it's really fun when you are on WiFi and you can play with other people
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This was a good and easy read. Language in the book made you think deeper about perspective and life in general.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Running around as one of your favorite minions, collecting bananas, and challenging friends is crazy awesome! I love it and I didn't even see Dispicable Me 2.
B007V65R54|4.0|I did enjoy most of the book. The last part on terrorism is a bit of a stretch and not really necessary.<br />Very good read to understand better the stats an  predictions<br />Thrown at us everyday.<br />Easier to read and understand than \\"the black swan\\".
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game but I don't like having to spend a bunch of extra money so have found that I can play it for short spurts and then let the coins build back up. I have a couple of similar games and just go back and forth when I want to play.
159514188X|5.0|Definitely a must read for anyone. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and want you to keep reading, I'm not a very fast reader, but I couldn't put this book down, I read it cover to cover in 2 days.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|Love the action, the humor and the good old western shoot outs. The plot in this movie is good and the actors are excellent. Enjoyed this movie all around.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This is my mom's but I'm doin this I am nine and I love to draw but when I didn't really draw a car seat,somebody said u r stupid to me and I didn't like that and I was upset I thought it's supposed to be nice and a safe game... well it's not I don't.recommend this to people with low sence of steam.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|After the most recent update it won't play anything on my Kindle Fire.  Installed from amazon.<br />Hope you get it fixed. In the meantime looking for other options.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|When I have  to blow on the plane level I can on my kindle because there is no microphone to blow so get red of the plane one<br />Either then that good God bless you all
B009AMAGXK|5.0|Even though this movie is pretty cheesy I loved it but couldn't find the blu-ray/dvd combo so I was thrilled to find this. Thank you for the quick shipping I received it before the time it said.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|Absolutely stunning blu ray movie.  They remastered it in HD and it is more beautiful then I would have expected.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Sometimes I would plug in my device and  I would think it was charging, only to find out that it didn't charge at all. This so lets me know immediately that it is charging so there are no surprises in the morning!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the series, thought it was slow to start. The last one had plot involved other than sex. I skipped through some as the scenes were similar.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Play this game. it is amazing. it is really awesome game. kinda like league.plz try an ply. don't miss out.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game! So many different mini games inside of 1 game!.....LOVE IT<br />If you like bingo, slots, challenges....this is the game for you!
1476727651|5.0|Well what can I say. Terrific stuff. First of all perhaps I should make clear that I am an absolute, without prevarication,  unapologetic fangirl of everything King so therefore please read this review with that in mind. However as always what you will find is my honest feelings and my genuine thoughts about the readability and standard of the novel in question...<br /><br />That being Doctor Sleep, the long awaited, much anticipated sequel to \\"The Shining\\" and a continuation of the story of Danny Torrance, 5 years old when we met him last, survivor of The Overlook Hotel.<br /><br />Danny (now Dan, a grown man and the Dr Sleep of the title although I'll let you find out for yourself what that means...and look out for Azzi!)  \\"shines\\". He knows what others are thinking, occasionally knows whats coming, and has one foot in this world and one foot in quite another. Up until now, he perhaps shone the brightest, but he has not yet met Abra Stone. Meanwhile the \\"True Knot\\" an eclectic collection of RV owners roam the highways and byways of America. Mostly elderly, they are not what they appear...for they live and survive on \\"steam\\" - a substance released when children who shine are tortured to death...<br /><br />I will admit to some trepidation when I started this new journey with Danny Torrance. The Shining is and always will be one of Mr King's greatest tales, was there any real way to expand and improve on that?  This author does not usually do sequels (The Talisman with Peter Straub and the obvious example of the Dark Tower books aside) although if you read him as I do you know he finds a way of giving us character updates. Well I would have to say he has done Danny proud...<br /><br />As always characterisation is of a high standard. The story has a dark heart indeed and will cause a shiver or two..and Dan has evolved realistically - determined not to become his father, still he comes close to heading down the same disastrous path...but redemption comes in funny ways and at the most unexpected of times.<br /><br />A deeply involving battle between good and evil, this will grab you by the throat and drag you down into those places where nothing and yet everything could be real..Compelling and utterly captivating, I am bereft that I am done with it...I could easily start at the beginning again right now.<br /><br />So, perhaps a bit of help for readers considering this: Firstly, do you need to have read \\"The Shining\\"? Well no, not at all. A brief synopsis in the first portion of the book, followed by a few soundbites that show Danny growing up means everything you NEED to know is right there and done in a way that will not spoil the original book adventure. However I would strongly advise that you do, because I believe in my heart you will get more out of it if you meet Danny when he is a child and understand the way he was back then...<br /><br />If you are a \\"constant reader\\" of this author then this will delight you. We all know how every single one of his books is linked to the others in many hidden ways, this is one of the reasons why I love them so much. Oh and if you have read NOS4R2 by the incredible Joe Hill, son of Stephen, then one or two little portions of this story will have you smiling away.<br /><br />All in all I'm going to do this again. Just read it. Its King. Its Brilliant. Thats all you need to know. (ok ok, fangirl in me popping up one last time before I am done)<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!s and at the most unexpected of times.<br /><br />A deeply involving battle between good and evil, this will grab you by the throat and drag you down into those places where nothing and yet everything could be real..Compelling and utterly captivating, I am bereft that I am done with it...I could easily start at the beginning again right now.<br /><br />So, perhaps a bit of help for readers considering this: Firstly, do you need to have read \\"The Shining\\"?

B00A8ECU24|2.0|Fun game and all but the gems don't need to be there .if you want rarity you have to buy the gems and its 1.99 for 20 gems . I think that gameloft should stop lying to people telling them that its free. Bottom line don't waste your time on this.
B003L20IHE|4.0|I Loved it and Zac Efron i thought was amazing and i was totally shocked by the end but the only reason i gave it 4 stars was the people who saw it with me said it was predictable and bas but i thought it was totally awesome
0425241505|4.0|Set in modern times, but one where the magical creatures of mythology such as fairies, shapeshifters, dragons, and the like still live.  Forced to steal from a dragon, Pia Giovanni is now on the run from both the dragon and the people of Power who are manipulating her greedy ex-lover.  Dragos Cuelebre couldn't believe that someone could successfully steal from him and is determined to find out not only who, but how.  It's a case of immovable object falling in love with an irresistable force.<br /><br />This book had been recommended to me by multiple people over the years, but I just wasn't sure it was something I'd like.  When it appeared on my Sony Reader Store listing, I finally decided to give it a try.  I'm always leery about romance mixed with fantasy, particularly when it is set in modern times.  It can go horribly bad in the wrong hands.<br /><br />Thea Harrison is definitely not the wrong hand.  She's given us strong characters, sharply defined and individual, people and creatures you want to know more about.  Dragos is strong, although somewhat clueless when it comes to polite society and love.  Pia has an intriguing backstory as well as a smart mouth, always a plus in my opinion.  I definitely want to see more from this universe and will be looking forward to the second book in the series.  4.5 out of 5
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app very useful I use it all the time. Love the colours and display ,need more clock display
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!!!! It's about redemption and how you can be saved - the protagonists both needed saving and they needed each other... Sweet book - yes there's violence, but he's a fighter FFS!!! Why buy a book about a fighter if you don't want to read about it???
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I Love This movie so much! It was scary Warning: its really scary and it kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat i highly recommend for horror movie lovers but do not show kids its scary but i love it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am not sure what is wrong, but the TV no longer recognizes the Chromecast.  The light on the Chromecast was red, I reset and now it is white or flashing white (yes, it is plugged in). I tried rebooting and no luck, still is not playing on the TV.  The laptop thought it was playing - so it is between the chromecast and the TV or router.  If you have a problem you will be hard pressed to find answers online.  It seems pretty simple, \\"What does the color of the light signify?\\"  I can't find anything but a Google chat page telling you to go to Chrome help which if you go is not very helpful.<br /><br />I will say when it worked it was great, if limited in it's use.  I wanted it to stream Netflix on an extra TV, so for that is was good.  It looks as if this will be going back for a refund.<br /><br />******<br />I wanted to update my review as after much research and blogs and phone calls finally figured out what my problem was.  It was not the Chromecast, it was my TV.  I had been to the Google help page but never got to the customer care numbers, speaking to the representative helped me eliminate things - he didn't have the answer but it helped knowing what it wasn't.  It was my HDMI input settings, I ran across a few lines on a Sony Bravia update page about how after updating you should always reset the HDMI input ports, which was simple, just uplug all ports then uplug tv - wait one minute and restart - turn on and then replug in the devices and it worked!  I am not even use anyone knows you can reset those or even need to, I reset the Chromecase, reset the TV to factory settings and was about to try one last thing a software update when I noticed that little blurb about the HDMI settings.<br /><br />I changed it to 4 stars as it is still rather limited in its uses so not perfect but it does work great for Netflix.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Say goodbye to even more of your favorite characters...Not quite as bad as season three though. I can't get enough of this show. I've read all the books, watched up through season three, and still not tired of it.
B00CL151G4|5.0|While we've seen the basic storyline of these kinds of series(The Mentalist/NYPD Blues/CSI/Law&Order,etc,etc) the characters personal storylines and episode stories still maintain a good deal of entertainment and enjoyment for myself and many people who watch the series. There does feel a little bit of deja vu between this series and the Mentalist, as you have a quirky but intelligent and resourceful man battling his inner demons personal tragedy to help his police comrades solve crimes and his female partner who keeps him in check and helps him along the way while growing in her own way. Still the series is entertaining and exciting to watch and I truly appreciate that it has been renewed for a second season. So for fans of cop dramas or just those looking for a good series to check out here's one to look at.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|When i bought this item i was so excited the next day i jumped right into it and omg... I was hooked i love the series the shipping was right on time and ery thing was great im very happy with this purchase
B001M4O2VG|5.0|I am reviewing the 1991 German Version of Electric Ladyland - This edition (823 359-2) is mastered using the same original UK tapes as the JVC Japan versions (P20P & P33P) sent to Japan in the early 80's because there wasn't any CD mastering equipment in Europe at the time. IMHO those 2 versions (Japan, German) stand right up there sound wise as the original very rare 2 disc non \\"NoNoise\\" Reprise release. Some people say they are better, but since they used the same tapes I don't think so. Other than track listing (they both have the same sequence) which is different than the original Reprise disc, and Maybe just a little more bass on the imports but other than that I can tell no difference.<br />The big difference is the artwork which has become a collectors item in it's own right. The imports sport the original nudes cover that was banned in the US. So there you have it for what it's worth ENJOY !!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|So, this story may have been done already (Battle Royale, anyone?) but it's different enough that I don't dislike it as much as I thought I would. It's hard to find a Hollywood movie without one appealing factor, though....probably because of all the money thrown every which way. Well...what else? It's a DVD. It works in a DVD player.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Most people have seen or heard of this series by now and overall we get another season of this entertaining supernatural monster series to enjoy until the new season starts and while not the strongest season it still gives viewers what they want. So for fans of the series here's a new season set to add to the collection and for those who just started watching I'd advise getting some of the previous season sets to at least learn more on the history of the two main and other characters in the series.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This is the Most awesome Zombie movie out there. More so Funny than Gore. I love this movie is fantastic.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|very enjoyable game. will not want to put it down. challenging but not to where it cannot be enjoyed. I didn't want to put it down. lots of twists and turns cant wait for sequel
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|Freaks need love too. lol jk...well...I enjoy the realistic depiction of a D/s relationship, and how the movie delves a bit into how a person might come to be that way. I love how it's not portrayed as something disgusting or wrong, but actually beautiful in its way. :) Heartwarming to me. I was rooting for her.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Steven King has done it again - given us unforgettable characters caught up in the unimaginable (except by Brother Steve).  I'll never look at a recreational vehicle quite the same way again.  Shine on, Steve, no pun intended.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't put my kindle down. Took 3 days but it was time well spent. Great book and I highly recommend anyone who has any gaming history whether it be mmo or pen and paper. Well worth the time and money.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I should have listened to the reviewers! Sookie didnt think or talk like the Sookie of previous books. Storylines were slaughtered.  It was just bad. I got no satisfaction from this read in any way.
B000YGIIPO|5.0|I love Pratchett's books. Seriously, everything of his that I've read, I've loved. The dry humor and witty puns, the vibrant characters...just everything. I'm working on collecting every book of his.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put it down once I started! A must read!  Lots of twists and turns that will keep you wanting to read more. Am planning on reading more of her work, fabulous!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|once again I found a story from brandon sanderson to be one that was very difficult put down. I also found the story was both intense and original with a premise I would even go so far to say was delightful.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this app because of the pork side. The pork side has awesome characters such as count dooku or darth vader. coolest app ever!
B00F35BV64|5.0|the alternate time-line continues to deliver, but now I would like to see completely new stories and not just an alternate universe deviation from stories we already know.  This installment was well shot and acted and didn't disappoint.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I use this app in addition to another. I really like the frames and extras. The downside is that the frames take over the edges of the image, so make sure you haven't done too close of a crop.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Just trying out my new kindle fire and came across this app.  It turned out to be fun.it works out just fine if you are into another project..it's a real no brainer. Makes it just perfect if you are multi tasking.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Found this game to be most enjoyable.I spend alot of time in airport departure lounges so a game like this is perfect. Difficult enough to keep you interested but not so hard that you loose concentration. I can highly recommend this game but be careful you could find half you life has passed without you noticing.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|My daughter is on the drama team with her school and they are performing Beauty and the Beast this year for the big performance in March and the Disney Jr theater festival in Atlanta.  I ordered this for her and her brother as a gift and they loved it! One of the greatest Disney movies of all time!
B0097HSS4M|3.0|I love the effects and editing capabilities of this app. It's fun to make photos more dramatic  or be able to correct and adjust the original. The problem I'm having is that it won't work from the picture itself. I have to open the app, then choose the picture. My Kindle Fire HD gives the option to use the app from the picture, but I get a &quot;program has stopped&quot; error when I try to use it that way.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|This is my first introduction to the heavy metal band Carcass, and I love it. It is non-stop head-banging when this album is on, and given how awesome it is it is on a whole lot! HIGHLY recommended for any metal fan.
B004G606K8|5.0|Still just as good as the first time I read it all those long years ago. I'd recommend this series to anyone.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had been doing Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30 which is VERY similar to this DVD. However, this one offers a calmer less in-your-face Jillian which I found much more to my taste. The workouts are good in both and she seems to know the precise time when you are ready to quit to push you to keep going. I follow it up with Karen Voight's Full Body Stretch and feel almost euphoric afterwards!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Continue getting network errors while trying to use and don't know how to fix. I can't read anything except the news feed items.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a great game. I always die in the mines, but I enjoy the different terrains. I like how they have added certain information on the pause screen, but can they add averages? I would like to know about how far I run each time, or about how many coins I get per run.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is an amazing book and no other deserves the Newberry honor but this. Great job R.J Palacio! I loved this book
B00003CX9W|3.0|There were a couple of boring music moments in this DVD, along with not having the dancing skeletons i rmeber from some disney halloween-ish special. But it's stil a Walt original and I'm keeping it for now.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|The gameplay is just complicated enough to be able to apply some strategy, but simple enough that you don't have to be a genius to enjoy. Good game
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|hey buy this game the people who rated bad was lied I got this game on Sept.28.20013 and I had all 4 patents for free.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Out of my 1500 cd's (90% metal) this is the best one that I have ever owned and heard.  I have listened to this at least 50 times and am shocked at the flawless quality on this grindcore,  NWOBHM,  melodic death/thrash metal masterpiece.  The aggressive,  and very melodic,  riff-driven,  metal music is immaculate.  The drumming (very tight and there's also double bassing),  the guitarwork  (machine-gun tempos, solos, riffs, twin-guitar harmonies),  the bass (pounding and relentless),  the vocals (death/black metal) are all godly.  This is a beautiful piece of work,  a beautiful collage,  which is the true definition of Classical music.  The best, in form,  it flows well: brutal and primitive yet refreshingly progressive and phenomenal in the compositional sense.  All musicians (Jeff Walker - vocals, bass; Bill Steer - vocals, guitars; Dan Wilding - drums) are exceptional masters of their craft.  Thank God for the high production quality of this cd by geniuses Colin Richardson - production, Andy Sneap - mixing, mastering, Carl Brown - recording engineer.  This cd can be in a higher-end sound system down to a lower-end boom box and it still sounds great.  UPDATE 30JUN16 = still the best CD that I have ever heard.  Moreover, this S&#62;O&#62;B&#62; never grows old !!!!!!  Playing it again right now.... for the 1000th time.  Carcass discography:  Reek of Putrefaction (1988) Symphonies of Sickness (1989) Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious (1991) Heartwork (1993) Swansong (1996) Surgical Steel (2013)

B002DKGWVQ|5.0|\\"College was a time for intellectual growth often exercised in meaningless conversations on a Tuesday night, hanging around with friends, drinking Keystone Lights, and discussing things as obscure as the greatest bass line of all time. Some people would argue such tracks like Queen's \\"Under Pressure,\\" The Clash's \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\" and, of course, the haunting mysterious bass line from the Zeppelin classic \\"Dazed and Confused.\\" In this hypothetical argument, the answer would have to be the bass line from \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\", as played by \\"Mani\\" Mournfield the first track off The Stone Roses stunning debut. The simple fact is that when you heard it you knew that no matter if you were doing something as mundane as studying for a Psychology 100 exam you were in for a great musical experience for the next fifty plus minutes plus.\\" [...]
B008469DGY|3.0|Fun to play. It's not like a real golf simulation, but I didn't expect it to be.  I will enjoy the few nuances as I relax.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book is a great stand by. I was in the hospital when I ordered this book. I had to lay flat on my back after back surgery so the story being read to me was great.
0307454568|5.0|I finally finished the last of Larsson's trilogy.  I was impressed with all three as I expected endless carnage from seeing snippets of the films and instead found a very well crafted and complex story, complete with complex and unforgettable characters.  The third book starts with everyone in bad shape so things can only improve. Lisbeth recovers from the incredible wounds inflicted on her by her family and prepares for trial.  One of Larsson's themes is that we are all responsible until the last of our days for our deeds and institutions so a large number of greybearded pensioners appear, both as good guys and bad.<br /><br />Some story lines seem un-neccessary (why would Berger have a stalker? how did Lisbeth's lawyer end up in Spain) but they are useful to tie things out and even introduce a few new characters, morals, and approaches. The tragedy is we will never really know what Larsson planned next for us, as he did not live to take on another book. What does the future hold for our journalist with all the girlfriends, the magazine, and of course, Lisbeth?  Fortunately everyone ends up working together in the end, even the press and the police.  Not sure that was necessary but it helps to wrap things up.  Larsson is such a good writer that he ties up loose ends throughout the book, not waiting until the last 10 pages like some of his lesser competitors.<br /><br />Larsson has made this trilogy somewhat autobiographical, although I dont know if he is so polished with the ladies.  We learn some important lessons about ethics, here delivered through the prism of journalists.
0394800192|5.0|i bought this book for my preschool students and they loved it.  they loved when the animals tried to balance the apples.  i recommend this book for all preschool teachers.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|The \\"undead\\" were laughable. They way they moved and sounded was like a mix between a twitching, dying animal and a 2 year old baby. The performance by Brad Pitt made the movie believable and watchable. Other than that, there was really nothing to the film. It was a solid sci-fi film with some interesting new twists.
B004UID2LC|4.0|No more virus people it's gone we can have back the app we love<br />Yay now go ahead and download it again
B001EJGQTU|4.0|The documentary is always interesting and involving.  What is there-insofar as McNamara's background, the story, the history, the actual clips of real time-is fascinating.  Director did what he could.  The movie gets 4 not 5 stars because McNamara ultimately did not come fully clean.  If somehow he gave his final long term honest perspective, it would have been great; but all of that died with him now.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|I received this work for review and I have to say that I am very thankful for the opportunity. This book of poetry is breath taking. It has a pace that just revs you up inside and very often I caught myself not breathing as I read the words. Its an amazing feeling to be pulled into a work so much that you risk suffocation. I will be re-reading this book time and time again.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I have the kindle fire hd 8.9.  The game play with no problems.  This is just another match like clone.  This is a good way to kill time or if you are looking for something brainless.  I would not buy this, but I will take it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Oh goodness I'm addicted. I definitely recommend this game. My kids love it too lol but that's only when I share. Lol
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The characters are fully developped from servants to the master of the house. The twists and turns keeping you intrigued. You want the family and the estate to flourish.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Not sure what all the silly &quot;gift points&quot; are for. I just want to look at the weather.<br /><br />Recently I was on vacation in Brookings, Oregon and this app would not load the current weather. I had a good WiFi connection and was able to look up the weather on the web but not through the app, very disappointing. I have now saved the NOAA website on my kindle and will be deleting this app.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Awesome ... Two great things in one. Seriously ... And it is free too. Just do it! I do not have anything else to s a y.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|the best game I had played on my kindle so far I need this game on xbox or something like it
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The story line draws you in and keeps you interested. You cannot wait to see what happens next. It is a great period piece. Downton is amazing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The early levels will fool you into thinking that this game offers no challenges, but your in for a treat as you advance and the difficulty level continues to climb
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Really, this is such a tight book that it makes as good a use of the novella format as anything I've read recently. Some of the Sanderson crutches are there (a character that plans with computer like precision, for instance) but if you're okay with those (and I totally am), you'll have a wonderful afternoon's read ahead of you.<br /><br />Also, the magic system here is - yet again for Sanderson - innovative and internally consistent. While I enjoy his characters and plots a great deal, I think Sanderson's take on new and interesting magic systems (and the effect they have on the society around them) is what keeps bringing me back to his books.
B0014ERKO0|4.0|I watched the entire series every week. I was such a big fan one of my user names was \\"stargatejunkie\\"! The Ark of Truth is a great movie: it is great to see the whole team together again. I highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So nice to read a book that's clever and warm, both. We get an inside seat in a family drama well crafted and just quirky enough to ooze charm.
B004QK5N5W|2.0|The adapter kills my Data connection on iPhone 4S. The quality is very pixalated and blurry with a pause in network streaming from Netflix every twenty seconds. I watch Netflix in the app with no adapter with very few short pauses in streaming. The moment it is plugged in to the adapter the data connection dies. I may be able to deal with blurry movies but waiting every twenty seconds for the videos to buffer isnot ok. It literally takes an hour or more to watch a 21 minute television episode on Netflix. Also, the adapter causes image to go in and out. I have to plug/unplug adapter several times to get it connected and then a few more times for data connection to work and then spend more than half of the movie/show waiting for it to load evety twenty or so seconds.<br />Pros: Great Idea<br />Cons: Unstable connection, kills data on iPhone, at best long frequent pauses in video streaming.<br />Aside from being an awesome idea, this product is a waste of money. I can not afford internet and was hopeful to stream movies to my TV through iPhone. Wont happen. I am goong to subscribe to Netflix DVD (5 at a time plan) for 27.99 and ditch streaming.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is an unexpected treat. This is an impossible-to-put-down book about a fascinating search for a child murderer in Soviet Russia. While some of the details are quite grim, it is an interesting look at what real poverty is; I had no inkling. While this historical look is intriguing, it is the hunt for the killer -and the shocking ending- that make it one of the most exciting books I've ever read. I highly recommend it and I'm sure I'll be reading it again.
B00E1LRCY6|5.0|First I must admit that I grew up with most of this wonderful music. Saw this in June at Lincoln Center. This is the way a music documentary should be made. Full of information, fascinating interviews, and the music! This is the \\"real\\" story told by the people who were there AND STILL ARE! Only regret: I wish it would have been much longer.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This movie takes place between season 3 and season 4. Yes, Twilight Sparkle is a princess like she was at the end of season 3. But no, the humanizing of the ponies will not affect the 4th season. You can think of it as an episode that is a dream sequence that one of the characters experience but the others have no clue about. It's a great filler while you are waiting for season 4! So don't be afraid of watching it thinking it will ruin the show, it's definitely worth watching!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is incredible for the &#34;backpack&#34; film or documentary maker. It has a spot for everything, literally. This backpack fits my camera, two lenses, mounts, my video mic, and all my accessories with ease. The best part is I can even fit my 11&#34; Macbook Air in the front of it. It is very customizeable, and solidly built. Top quality, I highly recommend this product.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Finished reading the book and immediately rented the movie, was disappointed. Characters were changed, combined, or just missing. I know about artistic freedom, but seriously this movie was awful. I can say it was better than the first Twilight, the acting was better.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Think combination of Soul, blues, rock, blues rock. Susan Tedeschi: think a Bonnie Raitt, Janis Joplin, Bonnie Bramlett combination of soul, blues, and gospel. Derek Trucks: think a combination  of Duane Allman, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. The band wails, yet is tight. Every musician is world-class. The music is moving, intense, rocking, soulful, with great lyrics. Best band to come along in a long time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this because the advertising talks about redirecting your Chrome Browser output to the TV and controlling the TV from your Android device. It didn't say that it can't do both at the same time. I bought it so I could show my Flickr photos on my TV. Turns out that I may be able to do this from my laptop (I haven't checked) but not from my tablet (Chrome on the tablet does not support Chromecast).<br /><br />I'm giving this away. Maybe I'll get another one when they finish development.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Until one day, I tried logging in and it wouldn't let me!  It keeps saying &quot;this is taking longer than expected. Please try again in a bit.&quot; Excuse me? I've BEEN trying for the past few days. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Nope. Nothing. Still won't let me log in! Please fix this!!!!
B00F452NG0|2.0|What good is a game with no sound.I bought two different types but still no sound I want my money back.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I savored each book/chapter like separate parts of a multi-course gourmet meal. Thank you Mr. Howey. I have already recommended this to multiple friends.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Although I see glimpses of good writing, I am extremely disappointed.  I fail to see what has made this book so popular.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is awesome game. This game is just like league of legends. It's super fun for a free game.<br /><br /> game
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I for one am glad the attention that the now famous \\"interview\\" has brought the author and this book. Otherwise it may have fallen into obscurity and many would have passed over this extremely well written and documented work. This is a fast paced and thoroughly engrossing read and sheds light on many aspects and moments of Roman, Jewish and Christian history. This writer loves his work and is not anti-Christian or pro Muslim. Rather he is a scholar and his research shows it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Ive been a fan for years enjoying each bloon game, especially the tower defense ones. I can say, without a doubt, this one put all others to shame
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Good match 3 game reminded me of 7 wonders; which I own  and play often. Great way to pass the time.
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|This book has been around for over 100 years and it is still a great story! I would highly recommend it. I am in my 60's and this is one of those books that is good for any age.
B0024FAG6M|5.0|the picture quality is amazing on this  bluray disc it is amazing to see all the colors so alive and the soundtrack is awesome
