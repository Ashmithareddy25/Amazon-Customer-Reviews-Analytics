B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is very cool. I love it very much except the part where you have to get a certain # of points to buy more games. Anyway I LOVE this game.
B0055SWM08|1.0|Using a VM Samsung Intercept sph m910<br />Apps tend to ignore this phone.<br />So, I hate my phone.<br />Don't buy one.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Its similar to what I played in school 20 years ago. I liked that it was a free app and wouldn't have paid more than $1 for it. Its good and I recommend it.
0765322889|2.0|I was in the middle of the 8th book and have finally managed to put these books aside. If you are like me and you feel that once you started a book you really want to give it a chance and finish then keep reading my review!<br />Here is how I would break down this series. The strengths:<br />- the plot is definitely well-thought off. Everything Erikson describes seems to have a purpose, big or small<br />- there are occasional moments of very fast-paced exciting writing when you can't seem to put the book down and you want to know what happens<br />That's it, can't really think of any more good things to say. Now to the bad:<br />- there are 10 books, each one is about 1000 pages long<br />- for the most part the reading feels like hard work. Many other reviewers have commented on it. You are thrown in the middle of Erikson's world without any explanation. And it continues book after book with what seems like thousands of characters, who are impossible to keep track of, or at some point frankly care. You'd think that by book 6 or 7 you've earned to spend more time with the characters you already know, but no. Lots of new ones are constantly being thrown in.<br />- the characters are extremely one-dimensional. They seem to all be variations of 2 or 3 different types. In particular females are there as sexual objects and nothing more. Each one gets raped at some point or other. I can not think of a single female character that could be described as \\"good\\". All are cold, vicious and manipulative. At some point this really started bothering me.<br />- the books are about an epic gigantic war and are extremely violent and graphic. Descriptions such as \\"the floor was strewn with blood, urine, feces and bile\\" are repeated every 5-10 pages in every book. There is no beauty that I could find,really.<br />- finally, there is too much random philosophizing. It is very boring and very obscure. Every single character is prone to have pages and pages of abstract \\"thoughts\\" whichare very difficult to follow and don't add anything to the book. I think getting rid of all this fluff, would have shortened the books by at least half, if not 2/3.<br />So, in conclusion, you can give the 1st book a shot. If you don't like it, don't force yourself--it's not going to get better! If you do like it, then definitely keep reading because all books are very similar in my opinion.
0345803485|5.0|I am a 34 year old stay at home mother of 6. This book was the ultimate escape from reality for me. I read it in just 2 days! I literally could not put it down. It kept me up into the wee hours of the morning. I truly reccomend it to any woman who is wanting to live vicariously through the characters.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like the old Super Mario Games and the New Super Mario Bros games you will love this game.. its very addicting. Trust me
B007MDB71O|5.0|JOHN CARTER, by the great Andrew Stanton, is really a great movie, with amazing sci-fi action, a wonderful story with unique twists between the real world and the space world, and finally with a cast that plays their roles well and looks good to boot.<br /><br />TOO BAD that the movie suffered so much at the cinemas, people just did not know what to expect with it.  I did not either, and I am a Disney enthusiast.  But I was so surprised at how much I liked this movie.  HOPEFULLY, people will learn about this great flick thru what should be a great BLU_RAY.  If you passed on the cinema version, do not pass on the home video release.  It is that good.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a pretty fun time waster. The graphics are good and you can progress pretty quickly. I recommend if you like the casual games.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is so cool and fun. just like playing Mario and so User friendly. fun for all ages. try it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like playing this game at work makes time go by quick especially when you work graveyard shifts. keep playing trying to beat my scores.
B004HW7JH4|1.0|They really should have quite while ahead - this looks a lot like some college work. This is not even close to the first 4 seasons in terms of quality - too bad- I really wanted to like it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice and simple game play. But it keeps you very entertained. some levels really get you thinking how to get the perfect score.
1439107955|5.0|Great book. I work in the area of oncology with the biotech/pharma industry and this is a must read. It is definitely worth the money as there are so many insights.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is nice to have a game that provides a diversion without a clock running, load explosions, and just lets you unwind with a nice challenge.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great and has so many fun games and it is great for kids at all ages from 7 to 17
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I like the game very much.  It runs very smooth on my Kindlt.  I hats the requirement of friends to move forward though.
B00702NWW4|5.0|As has been said countless times, Lana del Rey is a polarizing artist, largely due to her lackluster live performances, most notably Saturday Night Live. But this review isn't about her live shows, but rather this fun, slightly-edgy group of songs called Born to Die.<br /><br />I was one of those who immediately loved LDR, and my anticipation of her debut under her new moniker was well-deserved. The beats and composition are top-notch. Her voice, sometimes babyish, sometimes sultry, adds a good depth to what otherwise could have ventured into over-produced indie-pop. Overall, the songs interest me, the music gets in my head, and the lyrics are fun, sexy, and/or fiery.<br /><br />I do think there are a couple worth songs not worth listening to on every replay, but I have found few albums in the last 15 years that don't deserve the same comment.<br /><br />So polarizing live, but in the studio, Lana del Rey does a solid job. Look forward to more work from her.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Now I'm never without my notes.  I can clip info from the web and save it for later. It syncs the information to all my devices
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|this third installment of this series SUCKED!!! I'm very pissed off that I spent money on this book ... the author really really didn't do her best job and it reads as if she was not caring about the story. I was anticipating for a good read but was slapped in the face by the poorness of the ending, it lacked the \\"happy ending\\" and made the whole series pointless.. I will never never allow my 13yr old to ever read this series... it sucked so badly and the \\"happy ever after\\" ending never happens. It felt like it was just a rushed job. And it was a crappy book, and very F-up ending that makes me want to throw the whole collection into the trash can where it belongs, And now that I read the whole series I will NEVER take my daughter to see any of the movies!! I say Shame on you to the scholastic corp. for printing and publicity of this series to our young children... I recommend that as parents we should Boycott this book and take it out of our schools libraries.. AND ABOVE ALL ELSE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY SERIES.. BECAUSE IT SUCKS!!! I want a Refund the author is a crook that stole my money and left me with nothing...
B0001Z53C4|5.0|D12 did it again. There sophomore album is just as good as there first album.I'll tell you what I like about each track and give each track stars on a scale of one to five<br />1. Git up - A fun and excellent intro that really got me excited about the album. 5 stars<br />2.

How come - A great insightful song about the tenuous relationships between the members of D12 particulary Eminem and Proof Told with a great backbeat, interesting lyrics, great rapping from Eminem, Kon Artis and Proof and a great tuneful singsong hook from Eminem which is pleasent to listen to.<br />9. Leave Dat Boy Alone - Another great track with a great laid back beat, Great rapping, Intresting lyrics this time By Swifty, Kon Artis and Kuniva and a great tuneful chours sung by Eminem.5 stars<br />10.

B0055SWM08|5.0|addictive and fun puzzling game that challenges the mind as well as it calms the soul...  but warning it is very addictive
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Don't waste your time to watch it and hide it from your kids. If anyone makes a living like the actress, there is no purpose for her to live. Is it the reality you want yourself and your child to live? Why do we have this movie produced? Foolish.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautifully crisp gameplay and graphics. Very original, and it has enriching music that compliments the fresh, smooth mechanics of the game. Well worth the dollar and some.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. All you people who whine about it being a Mario ripoff .... seriously who cares. Every game started as something. Either play or don't.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun puzzle game that's fun and addictive. Plenty of fun for a casual gamer. Definitely worth the time!  Recommended for all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very addicting game. I love it and can't stop playing. I hope you intend to make many more levels!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I am so glad I found this band. They're like a HUGE breath of fresh air. I love every single song on the album. I'm actually going to their sold out show tomorrow in Minneapolis and I CAN NOT WAIT! I'm trying to memorize the whole album before the big day! Even though I do love every song, my #1 favorite song is Slow It Down, I'm a sucker for ballads. It makes my heart melt every time I listen to it.
1856697061|5.0|This book continues the incredible pattern drafting techniques, while advancing the Magic. Another great addition to my sewing library. You definitely need an understanding of pattern drafting to even consider using these Pattern Magic books. I can't wait to get the next one.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love this game. If you like mario you will like this! Totally worth a play!! Download you will not be disappointed!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is mentally stimulating and makes me feel like I'm doing more than just sitting on my ass playing any old game with misleads objectives it also adds a bit of class to my game time
B007PTJOV0|4.0|love the game I only wish that the advertisements could be placed anywhere other than right in front of the button. it makes it almost impossible to play. Kindle Fire
B0055SWM08|5.0|keeps the mind busy.  fun and simple. a child could beat this  game until 1939 , then you get to excercise your brain:)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|That's right, I bought 8 copies.<br /><br />Here's why: this is the best fiction I've read in  years. I was blown away with the world building and character development that was threaded through a perfectly paced story. I belong to a science fiction book group and we meet monthy to talk about our monthly selection and share other favorite books we encounter. All I could think about after finishing this story was that I had to share it with my fellow group members, so I bought each of them a copy. I didn't want to even give them a chance to read something else. I also purchased a hard copy for myself I could lend to my non kindle friends. Everyone needs to read this book. It is better than many hugo and nebula winners. It harkens back to classics such as Dune, Enders Game, I Robot, The Dispossesed. It will be made into a movie, and that movie will win best picture.<br /><br />If you are an avid reader like me, and you're in constant search of a book that trasports you mind and spirit into a world of imagination and wonder, a book that forces you to read it despite daily life and responsibility, a book that refreshes that magical experience of discovering a book in your youth that caused you to love books, read this. The tell someone else to.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Great book...fun read  Couldn't wait to read it when I finished Fifty Shades of Gray.  I just finished reading the third installment and I wish there was more. I will probably read them all again.
B00138KKMG|1.0|This is an album of great songs performed by a great band fronted by a great musician. Bu the mastering on the digital (CD and MP3) releases is truly criminal. I mean, Sony should literally be prosecuted for defrauding the customers who bought this, including me. The vinyl version is mastered the way Dylan himself produced it, with plenty of the dynamic range that true artists put into their playing. But for the digital versions Sony cranked up the volume of every bit and byte to 10. It's grating, and until I heard the the vinyl version I thought it was just a bad album. Do yourself a favor, find a lossless rip of the vinyl online, the audiofiles who share that stuff are better at preserving quality than the radio baiting execs at Sony. Believe me, this is no nostalgic ode to the warmth of vinyl, it's just that until Sony fixes this problem by remastering it like they did for Love and Theft the vinyl is the only good version of Modern Times available. Don't worry, Dylan doesn't need the money and Sony does need the kick in the ass. Find the digital copies taken from vinyl by true Dylan Lovers, available free somewhere online if you look hard.
0240815807|5.0|It's pretty simple, I didn't know how to mix, now I do. Thanks Mike Senior, Your guide is practical, informative, and just enjoyable to read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is AMAZING! Even if it wasn't free I still would've bought it! Best Mario parody EVER!!!!! It is easy to use on the Kindle Fire&trade;!
B005COO1X6|3.0|King's normal creepy style always keeps me reading his stuff! I was disappointed how short this books was but I knew it was a kindle single so I wasn't too upset about that... I definitely wanted a more fleshed out story. I'm not an expert, but I just felt like his writing wasn't as smooth as his typical stories. All that said this story is still suspenseful and a pleasant enough way to spend an hour reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple but satisfying puzzle game with lots of polish. Music is great and art is impressive for a game of this type.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP I HAVE FOUND YET FOR MY FIRE! IT IS RELAXING AND CHALLENGING ALL AT THE SAME TIME!!!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I love The King of Limbs the best but OMG this album is amazing!!!!! its unbelievable. Bodysnatchers is so fast and penetrating and All I Need is one of the most beautiful ballads EVER. Reckoner is a peaceful but meaningful and effective song that brings you in and gets you transfixed. House of Cards is maybe the most calming and smooth tune you'll ever hear. Jigsaw Falling into Place is a tension filled, progressive anger and emotion outlet that somehow keeps its cool as it goes. Videotape is lonely sounding and leaves you wanting something more.<br /><br />5 stars Radiohead. Only Radiohead can be this good. No one else ever has been and It seems like no one else ever will be.<br /><br />Okay I think I'm done. bye!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|u have to get leps word. it is just like Mario. it is so fun. I have been waiting a long time for Mario to come to the appstore but then this came. and the best part is&quot;drum roll&quot;its FREE!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple game that wastes time for me! Worth the price of free. lol. Basically a classic flash game ported to a mobile platform.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Lep's World is a lot like Super Mario Bros. but it is still very entertaining.  I would recamend it................. really.:)
B005OCFHHK|3.0|This is a great box set but my box set didn't include the \\"Half Blood Prince\\" instead I have 2 copies of \\"The deathly hallows part 2\\".  Needless to say I was a bit disappointed.  But the blu ray is good quality as well as the sound.
B000ZP9PYM|5.0|I just love these Croc's- they are the most comfortable shoe that I have ever owned. You can wear them to work(maybe) and then to the beach. I even wear them as slippers....
B0073LWEXK|5.0|it is so awesome. the whole thing is one big mystery. it is worth the money for sure. it will only last a couple of days but u cant get away from it!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|makes me think ahead. keeps my mind sharp. it is creative, imaginative, has good grafics, motion and the options have good variety.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it was a fun game very addicting and fun, the food and leveling is easy to understand and easy to operate
B006OCM0G0|4.0|on this game you can serve food but a lot of the recipirs take a lot of time to cook.<br />other than that i would say this game rocks!!!!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|some vids wont play it says they cant so yeah needs update soon but otherwise great app and downloaded kind of slow
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked this book the least out of the trilogy but I felt compelled to read it to complete the set. I felt it lacked something and left me feeling unsatisfied in the end. Read it, but don't get your hopes too high.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I blame my friend for getting me addicted to Cut the Rope. At first I wasn't to sure about it but I love it. Then I saw this...AND I LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH!!!!! Lol
B005IZLPMY|5.0|From the preview of this movie I was a little skeptical of how it would play out but I shouldn't have been.  This movie is definitely awesome.  Chris Evans really took the character of Steve Rogers and made it his own.  The story is great and you will never be bored. It looks fantastic on Blu-Ray but I like being able to watch it in DVD form when I'm away from home so it's worth the money for the pack.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game the minigames are great and u never know what's gonna happen its a great game ......!!!!!!!!! u wont regret it
B007MNV5WU|3.0|its fun but too easy so if u love angry birds but if you are looking for a challenge don't get this one
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is in a word, peaceful.  You are pushing around a water droplet in rooms made of simpler times.  The reason I enjoy the game so much is its simple  exquisiteness.  The music, the moves, even when you lose its all very graceful.  It is truly a refreshing  change to enjoy a game like this.  If you appreciate quiet rainy days with a fun challenge this game is for you.  Highly recommend!
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun and Zen at the same time. I like the back story, wish it was more involved in the game.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is Brian Wilson's musical magnum opus.  Yet, it is doubtful Wilson's habitual use of hashish, accompanied by the occasional LSD stupor, would have permitted completion of Pet Sounds without the assistance and perseverance of lyricist Tony Asher.<br /><br />There would be precious few spurts of musical vitality from the Beach Boys after Pet Sounds.  Even the occasional innovative and appealing products, e.g Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villains, quickly dissipate into mindless refrains of overused choruses and gimmicky musical synthesis.<br /><br />Although there exists no lack of hop-heads who still acclaim the post-1966 Beach Boys catalogue, their praises are little more than attempts at validating their own descent into a concurrent degeneracy and consequent uselessness.  For example, what many would have others believe is \\"the soulful voice of Dennis Wilson\\" is actually attempts at vocalization through a thoroughly smoked and whiskey-soaked larynx and out a mouth pulled crooked by the drug-damaged portions of his brain.<br /><br />The Beach Boys never experienced the frustration of becoming musically irrelevant.  Instead, the essence of the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson, just plain old self-destructed.<br /><br />Pet Sounds is an exceptional listening experience throughout.  The more melancholy cuts are also very fitting, as they underscore the shame and sadness of the wonderful but rapidly dissipating talent of a 24-year-old Brian Wilson.
B00006690G|5.0|I love this album! It is my favorite out of all of his albums. It was sealed perfectly and the shipping was phenomenal! I expected it in two days but I received it in just the next day! :) Thank you Eminem and thank you Amazon!
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|While not really a \\"zombie\\" film, the vampires in this film are essentially at a zombie-state-of-mind.  Kind of a Vamombie.<br /><br />Good cinematography, appears that it was shot on film and with some good acting.  \\"Mister\\" kept reminding me of Warren Oates, a favorite actor of mine.<br /><br />Well worth the rental fee, this should not disappoint horror fans.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. an intuitive interface and concepts are appropriate for teaching children. look forward to watching my daughter play. \\"A+\\"<br /><br />UPDATE - This game is providing my 8 yr old daughter with incentive to read, and practical applications of comprehension.. GREAT for that purpose..the energy limits on the character provide a natural limit to her play time without making me the bad guy?? COOL! Thanks!
B002VPE1PW|5.0|I currently use this sleeve for my HP TouchPad. It provides adequate protection without adding much weight or bulk. On occasion, I have also used this to carry my laptop accessories when I travel.<br /><br />Overall, this is very well made and appears that it will outlast any electronic item I put in it.<br /><br />I also have one with the handle and external pocket ([[ASIN:B002VPE1Q6 AmazonBasics Netbook Bag with Handle, Fits 7- to 10-Inch Netbooks, iPad, HP Touchpad (Black)]]).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good mix of games.. some are harder than others especially with the touch screen. its a good way to waste time
B0055SWM08|5.0|Thinking + Reasoning and Logic = a fun, sometime frustrating and challenging game.The minds of the involved in bringing this game to fruition deserve kudos and hearty thank you!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|dear creaters,I think you should have the age of science.with a new element atom.stuff like plutonuim and gold is uranuim eft. your game rocks!

0811874192|5.0|I bought this as a gift and another for myself.  It's great for those who have allergies and can't have flowers in your home!  I used my popup book for Easter (first time) as a centerpiece on my dining room tsble.  Everyone enjoyed it!
B0055SWM08|4.0|It builds you up in skill gradually introducing new elements, pretty addictive. Nice visuals and audio sound track, too. Not very Zen if it keeps you from doing what you need to do, then realize you spent too long playing. Arghh!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Too bad that this is made by Warner, they always cut the top of the movie off to make it look widescreen. I have compared many of their movies to the VHS version and I see the top of the heads. Wow, how can they be so cheap as to say it is Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1 Even Harry Potter films show the differences and they are new pictures. Directors and actors should enforce Warner to stop the poor film manipulation of their movies when they release widescreen versions. If you don't take my word for it, then start investigating for yourself. If it isn't wide-screen, then leave it that way.<br /><br />That said: the movie is one of the best Sci-Fi pictures ever. I also like Rutger telling the images that we would never see in space. That could have been extended.  At least it is a Ridley Scott film.  They should make \\"Doom Omega\\" into DVD<br /><br />Remember, wide-screen did not start until 1954<br /><br />sigh-ned<br /><br />Tired of Being Cheated!
B0055SWM08|5.0|i recommend this game for everyone the music is great  and it is an excelent  puzzle game hi hi hi
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Very clean and strong and play on speed games<br /> The only large lack is an inability to save to png files<br /> Recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun for me and my kids. I don't like it though when they can beat a game and I cant.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really like this app its very cool and a lot of throw back games. hope you will like it just as much as I have
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario clone... but still awesome. I bought this game based on the reviews saying that it was a Mario-esque game for the kindle. Also, I couldn't go wrong with the price. I bought this game and I immediately fell in love with it. If you like fun games that will keep you hooked for a while, get this game and you won't regret it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a great way to wake up the thinking process in the morning - love the music and graphics!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very entertaining game for all us OCD folks - always something to do - very nice graphics - would recommend for everyone - I luv it!
0439023521|4.0|I was excited to read this book, especially with all the hype surrounding it lately with the movie release. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So I dove right in.<br /><br />First, I'll be completely honest. The book started out extremely slow. The first couple chapters were interesting, inviting the reader into the idea quickly. But it trailed off quickly -- so quickly that I was bored to the point of almost putting it down at chapter 5. But I thought to myself, \\"There's so much hype, there must be something more.\\" So I skipped 5 chapters to chapter 10 and started skimming from there to see if I'd reached something of interest. Finally, the story was taking off again.<br /><br />The basis of the story is this: A poor society comprised of several districts ruled by a wealthy government are forced to compete in what come to be known as \\"The Hunger Games\\". The Games were started as punishment for an uprising the poor districts of the society waged against the government, but the governing body defeated the rebellion and crushed the poor under even heavier burdens.<br /><br />The rules of the hunger games were simple. Representatives were selected from each of the 12 societal districts, placed into an \\"arena\\", and forced to fight each other to the death. Last man (or woman) standing won food and riches for his (or her) family. But here's the catch: the combatants were mere teen-agers.<br /><br />No novel would be complete without a quasi-love story infused into it (because what good is blood and carnage among fighting children without a love story, right?). The combatants fight their way down to the last 2 remaining...uh...lovebirds.  And what good is a love story among blood and carnage waged by children against other children than a good old fashioned \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" scheme to wrap it all up?<br /><br />I will admit, the idea of the story was intriguing. People who don't know each other and who have done each other no wrong other than living in \\"opposing\\" districts are forced to fight to the death for the hopeful benefit of their respective families. It speaks rather loudly of the depravity of our human condition. Where does a person (or society) draw the line in the sand saying, \\"We will go this far and no farther!\\" ? When do we say, \\"We will not bow to the Establishment!\\" ?<br /><br />While the book raises some interesting societal issues (issues I'm sure someone could relate to war and greed and government in our day), I was disturbed the author chose the main players of the Games to be children. I wasn't offended, just disturbed. Maybe that's because we expect these kinds of stories with adult victims, not children. When we bring children into the equation, however, I think we are forced to think our positions through a bit further than we originally would have.<br /><br />What would you do if your family was in that situation?  Would you stand up and fight?  Or would you cower in fear?<br /><br />I give The Hunger Games 3 1/2 stars out of 5, primarily due to its predictability and slow start. The idea was intriguing, so it deserved at least 3 for provocation and thoughtfulness.<br /><br />You can see my other reviews at my blog site: christiancognition.blogspot.comg\\" districts are forced to fight to the death for the hopeful benefit of their respective families.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so well thought out.  I benefit from the ability to use the highlighting and to write notes as I read.  THANK YOU,  BOB MONTGOMERY
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game reminds me a little bit of Super Mario Bros. And it is free! This game is da bomb!  Get it now before they put a price tag on it!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very sturdy and protects very well, works well as a stand for the kindle. It adds some bulkines to the kindle, but it protects well.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I have waited over a month to give my review, as I didn't want to be influenced by my initial hearing of Bruce's latest CD.  I didn't read any reviews before listening the first time, again because I wanted to form my own opinion.  I will not go into the specifics of the songs, as others have done a great job on that task.  Let me say, this is a fantastic album!  I have been a huge Springsteen fan since 1975, and this is one of his best.  I'd rank it even with \\"The Rising\\", and just a tad below \\"Born To Run\\".  What I do want to address is the complaint of some that \\"Wrecking Ball\\" fails because Bruce is using new musical forms.  Really?  Are you serious?  I am reminded of a friend that I saw at a Springsteen concert in 1978, who complained that he didn't like Bruce's 'new' stuff as much as he did the first two albums.  As he noted, \\"They just don't sound the same, he's not as good.\\"  Of course they don't sound the same!  Springsteen is not an artist who keeps releasing the same album repeatedly, with the same sounds.  \\"Born To Run\\" does not sound like \\"The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle\\".  Nor does it sound like \\"Nebraska\\" or \\"The Rising\\".  What is important is that Springsteen continues to grow as an artist.  To incorporate new sounds while remaining a person who cares about America, and just as importantly, about Americans.  Not in a jingoistic way, but in a very real manner.  This is a great album, talking about real issues and real themes.  There are ballads, and there are rockers.  Try not singing along to \\"Death To My Hometown\\" or \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\"!<br /><br />As of now, he is not scheduled to come to our area on the tour.  But, I keep hoping, and checking the website daily for tour dates to be added.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun puzzles with increasing difficulty. Very nice graphics and smooth game play. I have no complaints so far. I hope the dev adds more levels in the future.
B000W91RUG|5.0|LOL funny funny, a must buy for all you Big Bang fans. This is start of one of the best shows ever made.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|hours of objectives and things to complete. great game.A must have.easy controls and great graphics. try it you'll like it for sure.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am so glad that I purchased the trilogy.  Once I started reading the first book I couldn't wait to find out what happened in the 2nd and 3rd books.  I am looking forward to seeing the movie.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|The acting and story are great. Do not understand why Hollywood has to use such terrible language throughout the entire movie. The bad language was from young children which made it even worse.Otherwise fine movie
0345803485|4.0|I saw this book on the #1 spot on Barnes and Nobles website and I thought, 'hey, I wonder what this book is about.' So I read the description and I think it's a contemporary romance with drama and whatnot, but hey, I sometimes enjoy romance and emotional drama. I load this bad boy onto my nook. And let me tell you...I am SO glad I didn't get this in solid book form. Holy moly.<br /><br />This book is about Anastasia Steele, a recent college graduate. She meets Christian Grey, a young man who is extremely successful (extremely in the sense that he makes billions of dollars and boy do I wish my boyfriend made billions *wink wink*). Ana knows right away that Mr. Grey is a very controlling man who wants to run every aspect of his surrounds, including her. But she is inexplicably drawn to Christian and he to her, but she doesn't know if their relationship will work because of dark secrets he keeps about his sex life.
B0055SWM08|5.0|F is for Fallen Tree Games...they made the best game.<br />U is for u and me.<br />N is for exception, for getting this app right now!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the option that lets you replay the same game so you can move your cards differently and win the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So much better than the first book.  After reading The Hunger Games, I wasn't sure  if I would read the next one.  I am glad that I did.<br /><br />I think I liked this book so much because of the uprising.  I was wondering where the story was going to go.  I like how now there seems to be more to worry about than which boy to date (it is supposed to be a dystopian society after all).  Everything seemed to get a lot darker and more serious.<br /><br />Between what is happening in all the districts to the Quell to the end, this one has it all.  I can't wait to read the third.
B0055SWM08|3.0|I like the levels and the idea of the game but the music is bad and your doing the game in an old house.this could have been an epic game. maybe next time Fallen Tree Games.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game! It's very challenging! I get stuck and have to use my cheats a lot! And people who say it is not challenging or hard enough, they are probally  not on a high level, cause it gets very hard on the higher levels. So you should get this game while its free!:)
B0052U59F4|3.0|This is the written version of a \\"chick flick\\". Every possible romantic twist and turn makes its appearance. She tames and remakes her man and sooths his inner demons. She even marries the guy in the end! The BDSM scenes in the book are remarkably tame--and get tamer as the series goes on. The sex scenes are not bad but get repetitious.There is no reason for a man to read this book except to gain insight as to what woman want.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is so much fun it is just like Mario you should get this app as son as possible .
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game!!! reminds me of Mario... graphics are clear... I give it five star's and will inform friend's of this game:-)

B00785P2QC|4.0|I still prefer the original but it stopped letting me play and this is a decent alternative although it tries to charge you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is very fun. it reminds me of mario bros games. my daughter really loves this game. i highly recommend this game.
B007LEC7CC|5.0|I bought this the first moment it was released on Amazon.  All I can say is MDNA=PERFECTION!!  Buy it and enjoy!  One of her best disks ever...and that says a lot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like playing solitaire when I was a kid but no cards to shuffle and deal.  Love the Vegas scoring.Commercials are not bothersome and go away if you play about 5 games each sitting.
0895260131|1.0|Hate mongering at its finest . Why did he write this book? and  for what reason? to cause conflict and hate? . this is  a skewed view. the title says \\" Islam \\" but what they really  mean is Fundamentalist Islam.  they lump the two together, there is a difference, just like there is a difference between fundamentalists Christians and tolerant  Christians. a book made for back wood rednecks and morons who can't think for them self's .
B006OCM0G0|5.0|im addicted to this game i love it so much lol any one else love it as much as me?? lol!!!!!!!!!! :)
B0060D0XE4|5.0|My Grandkids love this movie they watch it over and over.  It also is a favorite of mine.  I don't have to worry about the language.
1451673442|5.0|I have read the secret and have tried to follow its priciples but this book just puts it all into perspective and helps you to really follow through!! I see things so differently and I am truly seeing magic !!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this version of solitaire has clear graphics and is easy to use I had a good time playing and it was amazing I truely love this solitaire version
B006C1DH92|5.0|I played this game on my friends ipod its amazing. but I have a kindel fire. I would like to get it but its not goodenof to wast your money on. it would be way better for free.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game. make me mad and try to pass levels. its fun and lots of levels. Thumbs Up. Now Where's s the updates? ?
B00457WZEI|5.0|My grandson loves horses and is a natural when working with them so I thought a Kindle and the book \\"War Horse\\" would be an ideal birthday gift.  Not only did he read the book in one day, but I read it, too.  Wonderfully written, exciting, suspenseful, and a lot of history included in this book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game nice and challenging. The puzzles sometimes make you want to beat your head on the wall when you realize how easy they actually are.
0439023491|5.0|My 10 year old son and I read this series together. We were told the second book (Catching Fire) was not as good as the first one. I beg to differ, we read this book in about 5 days. The first one was great, but this one held its own also! Love the twists and turns!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like Mario Game. its great and fun. So we can get more free updates.  thumbs up! lets play and fun
0439023483|2.0|While reading the book, I concluded that it was derivative of five principal sources: Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\"; the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show; the TV reality show \\"The Survivor\\"; William Golding's Lord of the Flies; plus the long, long list of overdone dystopia movies and stories. It was certainly a riveting story that was hard to put down. But let's not confuse it with classic literature. There is virtually no character development. Katniss is the same person at the end of the book as she is at the beginning. There is no serious moral lesson in the book, no catharsis, no eureka moments. All we gain from reading it is a dissatisfying rush of adrenaline like we might feel betting on and watching pit bulls fight.
B006X415GK|5.0|This is the prettiest Frankie to date.  If you you are a fan, you must have her.  If you are new to Monster High, she is a great value even at suggested retail price.  But be patient, she is plentiful in the stores and by reputable sellers here.  You shouldn't have to buy this one from a scalper.  Absolute must have!
1419702238|4.0|My 7 year old son finds the character in the book amusing and he read the book twice. The contents are simple enough for a 7 year old to read and understand.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is just like mario bros its so cool get this app u wont regret it and dont hop in the water and dont get eaten by the bugs level 2is really easy it runs for u you just jump
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it's a fun game and reminds me of the older Mario games. my grandson loves it too and that Lep has red hair.
0345803485|1.0|I purchased this book after reading rave reviews about it and it being one of the NYT best sellers. I was highly disapppointed and won't be finishing off the trilogy. In my opinion, there was a lack of imagination with the erotic scenes..same thing played out over and over again, said in the same trite way. The characters were not likeable....the way they communicated to one another, I found unrealistic. Save your $$$ people or try to borrow this from your friend or a local library.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this for my kindle fire and I love it!  My son (who is a huge Mario fan) also loves to play it.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|easy to read heartwrenching story. recently saw movie as well and the book was definately better. It did leave me with a sense of \\"so what happened next\\" at the end of the book though.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this CD. Adele's voice and music is amazing. Two of her most popular songs are on this CD...Rolling in the Deep and Turning Tables. From ballads to more up tempo, really good!
B004HXIZVC|5.0|great app, lots of music, and good networking. cant be more satisfied. download it! I need more words for this dumb review.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I am currently in Korea and couldn't wait for the book to be in the bookstores. But luckily now that I have my Kindle I can enjoy my favourite author's new book as soon as they are out or even pre-order. Yay. I just love Sophie Kinsella. Have read all of the Shopaholics and other novels. Cannot wait for her new book. Her books are hillarious. I loved the book read it in two days. If I did not have to do other things I would have probably read it in like 5 or 6 hours. The only thing that upsets me is that I have to wait for the next novel.
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you like casual puzzle games with beautiful music, sounds, refined graphics and smooth play... you have hit the mother load. I downloaded the paid version on april,10 2012 as the FAOTD and haven't seen any nag screens or ads yet. it was free so even if I do see that stuff eventually the game play and asthetics compensate sufficiently.<br /><br />Well done, Fallen Tree.<br /><br />No I am not related at all to Fallen Tree...... don't be a hater.<br /><br />playing on a stock Acer Iconia A500 with most current OS update. no problem.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun game with a fantastic artistic and musical style.  This game has a great atmosphere, similar to the atmosphere of Braid.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I was curious how other artists would present the songs of Bob Dylan. I was very pleased with most. At the price for a 72 song treasure trove of Dylan's hits and compilation of various artists across several musical genres this CD is a classic that also supports Amnesty International. A must buy for Dylan lovers and the other listed artists.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|First I must say I am a big fan of the Game of Thrones saga. I would recommend it to anyone who likes adult fantasy. The beginning of this third book was a bit dull and slow that's why I'm not rating it five stars but as the book progressed evrything started clicking and I couldn't put it dowm!!!! Just plod through the first chapters and then get ready to be surprised!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm. a huge leprechaun fan so this is fun.  Try to get all the coins and ammo you can and it becomes quite a challenge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When you have start reading, you can't stop. You can define this felling like \\"the painful sensation caused by the need of read a littel bit more\\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Mario series and this is very similar.  certainly great for free.  quite a challenge even in the early rounds.
B0057UA486|3.0|GERMAN, because contains german language Track:<br /><br />In der Tat, der Film wird in ruhigen Bilder erz&auml;hlt - die es aber in sich haben: die wunderbaren Kamera-Einstellung, Farbgestaltung, Landschaft etc aufgefallen.<br /><br />Interessant ist n&auml;mlich, dass f&uuml;r diesen Film eine neue Kameralinse verwendet wurde, die es erlaubte im nat&uuml;rlich Licht, sowie auch \\"fast\\" g&auml;nzlich mit Kerzenlicht erhellten Raum zu filmen. Dabei durften die Darstelleren wie bei der Szene beim Kartenspielen keine hektische Bewegungen machen, weil sonst die Flammen der Kerzen flackern w&uuml;rden. Dies ergibt eine ganz neue Atmosph&auml;re die man bis dato noch nicht gesehen hat.<br /><br />F&uuml;r die MTV-Generation mag der Film durchaus langweilig sein, aber ich finde, dank dem Drehbuch, den tollen Dialogen/Erz&auml;hlweise des Erz&auml;hlers und satirischen Z&uuml;gen sehr gut gelungen und hat mich &uuml;berraschenderweise, trotz der 180 minuten, kein bischen gelangweilt.<br /><br />Trivia:<br /><br />- Kameramann John Alcott hat ein Cameo: er schl&auml;ft neben Ryan O'Neal und den zwei Girls w&auml;hrend der Orgie.<br />- Vivian Kubrick (die Tochter von Stanley Kubrick), das kleine M&auml;dchen, sitzt w&auml;hrend der Zaubervorf&uuml;hrung hinter der linken Schulter von Lady Lyndon.<br />- Der Film verschlang 300 Drehtage w&auml;hrend einer Zeitspanne von 2 Jahren und das Budget schwoll auf 11 millionen Dollar an.<br />- der deutsche Wolf Kahler gibt hier sein Deb&uuml;t und war dann sp&auml;ter in \\"Indiana Jones - J&auml;ger des verlorenen Schatzes\\" mit dabei.<br /><br />zur Blu-Ray: die US-Disc ist (die ich hier vorliegend habe, nur minimal anderst) Code-frei, enth&auml;lt deutschen Ton, deutsche Untertitel, deutsches Menu, sowie ein Cover ohne den FSK Aufdruck. Das Cover ist genau umgekehrt gehalten: weisser Hintergrund mit schwarzen Stiefeln.<br /><br />Die Bildqualit&auml;t des in 1.77:1 Format gehaltene Bild ist sehr gut, fein und sauber und auch der Ton kommt sehr sauber r&uuml;ber.<br /><br />Die einzige Kritik die ich dieser Blu-Ray anhefte: keinerlei Bonis, Nada, nix! Dabei w&auml;re es bei diesem Film sehr interessant gewesen mehr &uuml;ber die Entstehung zu erfahren (als Audio-Kommentar oder Making Of)<br /><br />ENGLISH:<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is codefree and contains german language.<br /><br />The movie is beautiful filmed and much better than I thought (with his lenght of 180 min).

Each scene looks like a oil painting.<br /><br />The only critic I have: there isn't any bonus feature on the Disc which could be interesting.<br /><br />FAZIT: movie und picture quality gets 5 stars.erlei Bonis, Nada, nix!

B005JE7WKI|4.0|It was better than I had expected it to be. Worth renting (or currently free with prime membership), watch it with friends and have a laugh.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i really like how suzanne collings decided to show in this book that sometimes, anybody, anywhere, could make you feel you,re just nothing
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this game even better than angry birds space. this games was very original and very fun. it was very cool and no violence. it is recommeneded for all ages :)
B0052U59F4|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey, is an excellent read. It is hard to put it down once you start reading it. It caught my attention when a saw a news program that talked about how the book should be banned. I disagree with that because the book is very exciting and  it's subject matter may be not the norm but what is?
0307949486|1.0|I read the first book thinking these had to get better, they got worse. Sexually explicit and not that well written.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This isn't the worst app,but its not the best either. Somedays it would open and close or only half download videos, which then get stuck in my gallery on my kindle fire. it has its ups and downs, but overall its a pretty good app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|if you like games where you build cities this game is great. its fun and can be a bit challenging. the only thing I didn't like is how you always run out of energy and it takes a long time to fill back up
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game keeps you thinking while enjoying yourself at the same time!! I love challenging puzzle games and this is definetly one. I would highly recommend Quell if you enjoy games that make you think.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have to admit that I was quite skeptical when I purchased this book.  I couldn't believe this unknown author had written a book in 30 days that had THAT MANY 5 star reviews.  I read through the reviews and they seemed legit so I decided to give it a try.  I was NOT let down!  I fell in love with Will from the first page he was introduced.  I fell in love with Lake, the brothers, the friends, the parents (dead and alive), the poetry, and every single word on every single page.  I laughed, LAUGHED ALOUD more times than I can count.  I cried! (in public while waiting for my car to be washed.  I'm sure everyone thought I was a nut)  I was so involved with the lives of these characters that I didn't want the book to end.  It's rare that a young adult novel can drag me in like that, especially because I love sex in books, and that's the ONE thing lacking in this... (although there's a good reason for it so I wont give it away).  I finished the book in 4 hours flat, and that doesn't happen unless I'm truly sucked into it.  So congrats to the author for an amazing job!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is very good and for many reasons. one reason is that it is free and that is quite obvious. another reason is that it is addicting. there are many other reasons why but I am too lazy to type them.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game, but I dislike having to pay for all the extras. would rather pay up front than every time I need to complete an action.
1878424319|5.0|I've read this book twice over the past year. Each time I get a new perspective on both the book and myself.  I can honestly say this book was very well done and something that is definitely worth a read in order to organize and simplify the stressors in ones life. Highly recommended.
B0017HPHBM|4.0|Im a pretty huge batman fan! But all in all Good service over all and nice lil gift product for the price
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its a great game! its addicting to me. just one problem, you run out of energy too quickly. but the rest is very fun!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar to old school mario with out the super mushroom powerups. extremely addictive can play it all night long
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well done action adventure written for younger women but enjoyable for all.  Tne first in the trilogy is an easy read.  You will want to get the next book soon.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|Russel Crowe is pretty good in most movies but other then that. disc is in good shape and reasonanbly fast. i recommend itn
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really glad I got this app on it's turn of the free app of the day. I love the charm of the setting in the game
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a pretty good game i enjoy these puzles becaus they're  thekind that if you stop and look for a while you can see where youve messed up though i wouldn't recomend to the impatient because it takes time and consentration.
0345803485|5.0|I read a lot of negative and positive reviews on this book. But I decided to go with my gut and give it a chance. Boy am I glad I did! This book gave me great satisfaction. A lot of people were saying how the sex scenes got repetitive; hello we all have sex and I'm sure a lot us get repetitive sometimes. I don't want to give too much away but at times I hated a certain character but then would immediately warm up to them in an instant. If your reading my review I say just give it a chance and have an OPEN mind :D
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a good game but its a ripoff of mario s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like it but u need patience and time! cute characters and as soon as eveythings going well up pops a natural disaster! addicting!

1612130607|5.0|the best book i have read in a long time funny, romantic, its a page turned. One you read it you will want to read it again
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I really enjoyed her backpack and a large and spacious it was really what I needed and it is also very strong and the only problem that does not come raincoat but this is not liked very much trouble.
0756405890|5.0|I love the stupid messed up mistakes Kvothe makes early in life mostly because of heavy burdens on him and how hard it is for him just to grow up to a certain point then even as he is getting better at things (he's fantastically talented as a matter of fact) he still pulls a few mistakes that leave his life a struggle.<br /><br />Bummer, yet another unfinished trilogy, but that's both good and bad.  Good because there is more to read, bad because I have to wait and wait.  I love the fantasy genre but most of it is not what I would call readable so it is always wonderful to find something engrossing.  A fat book but a quick read.  I love Rothfuss's engaging prose as well as the story.  Even his blog bits are readable like this.
0345803485|2.0|I started reading this book and immediately found a problem. This author knows NOTHING about Washington state. Vancouver, WA is up near the Canadian border. Seattle is in WA. PORTLAND is in OREGON!!!  You would have to go through SEATTLE to get on I5 to Portland which is hours away from Seattle. In the first chapter, Ana supposedly drives south toward Portland to get to Seattle!  HUH?????  And then she supposedly drives HOME to Vancouver where she lives but according to the book, works at Clayton's Hardware in PORTLAND!  Did none of the editors pick this up?  A terrible distraction from what might be a good story. Too bad. Where were Google Maps when they needed them.
B000IYU9IG|4.0|I have always loved this movie and wanted it in my collection...so far since it arrived I've watched it twice.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|I thought I was going to watch a movie about Margret Thatcher, but that came in second to a real depressing look at a woman losing her mind. The movie focuses more on her \\"relationship\\" with her dead husband. Sorry, I really needed a different movie. It seems like every aspect of her character is loosing it. One cannot focus on her life or actions.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Note: This review is for [[ASIN:B007STBUIW Jaws [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)]]<br /><br />Not only is Jaws being digitally remastered for this blu-ray release, but they also went back and performed a full frame-by-frame restoration of the original negative.  That means that any scratches, dirt and debris were cleaned up, and the color was re-balanced to ensure that the image would be optimal for the HD television setup.  Basically, this means that the Jaws blu-ray will have the movie looking as good as (if not better than) a fresh film print that you would have seen in the theater in 1975!<br /><br />The blu-ray will also have an upgraded sound mix, in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround sound.  Those who have a 7.1 setup in their home will be even more immersed in the sound effects and John Williams' haunting score.<br /><br />And to those worried about the artistic integrity... Spielberg monitored and approved the blu-ray picture and sound during this process.<br /><br />Here is a list of the Blu-Ray bonus features (taken from the Universal press release):<br />· The Shark is Still Working: The Impact & Legacy of JAWS: All-new feature-length documentary featuring never-before-seen footage and interviews with cast and crew including Steven Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider.<br />· JAWS: The Restoration: An all-new, in-depth look at the intricate process of restoring the movie.<br />· The Making of JAWS: A two-hour documentary featuring interviews with key cast and crew.<br />· From the Set: An insider's look at life on the set of JAWS, featuring an interview with Steven Spielberg.<br />· Deleted Scenes & Outtakes<br />· JAWS Archives: Take a peek inside the JAWS archives, including storyboards, production photos and marketing materials, as well as a special segment on the JAWS phenomenon.<br />· Original Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />Also included will be a standard DVD, a Digital Copy (compatible with iTunes), and an UltraViolet streaming copy of the film.<br /><br />And if you want that nice-looking Universal 100th Anniversary slipcover, I suggest you buy this as early as possible - because the slipcover will only be available for a limited time.atible with iTunes), and an UltraViolet streaming copy of the film.<br /><br />And if you want that nice-looking Universal 100th Anniversary slipcover, I suggest you buy this as early as possible - because the slipcover will only be available for a limited time.
B004KSR2FO|5.0|One of the best I have purchased. Helping me along nicely. Reading it in French then in English is great fun,and has revealed that I am actually learning the language!!
0553386794|4.0|The longer this book went the more I liked it. To start with I was a little put off with the large cast of characters but I soon started to enjoy it. I must admit I prefer Raymond Feist's Magician (Riftwar Saga) & Patrick Rothfuss, but I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series \\"A Clash Of Kings\\".
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game that requires you yo use logic. nice ambient music and background as well. hope to see more games like this from you guys.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. Good time waster. I recommend this to anyone who wants a game to play in their freetime.
B0055SWM08|5.0|beautiful game, very peaceful to play. smart play, but it's so Zen, you don't get upset if you mess up. love it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have played this game before but on a ipod and its a great game I loved it u get to aim to were u r shooting its just amazing its the best angry birds I played so far.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|David Foster does it again. What a great music DVD. If you liked his first, you'll love the second. Although, I would have loved some more Blake Shelton and Michael Buble.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|great movie, tons of action, awesome ending. really inspiring had a great plot and they did a really good job on this movie
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Its a great application if you need to remotely control a desktop or laptop. The ability to optimize for speed or quality plays a huge role in using the app, depending on your connection you can optimize your view of the remote platform you are controlling.<br />If your looking for an app to allow you to travel lighter, and control a computer at a remote location efficiently this is the app for you.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I'm enjoying this so far. The puzzles are difficult enough to require a bit if thought, without being frustratingly difficult.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was completely enthralled with the first book, The Hunger Games. This one was just as good. It had a bit of a different, even darker feel to it. We see a little more of the Katniss/Peeta/Gale love triangle as we hear about Katniss's struggle to make sense of her feelings for both Gale and Peeta. This book basically centers around the fact that she rebelled against the gamemakers at the end of book one, and how how that decision has affected the entire country. There's a lot of twists and turns, and just like with the first one, the book most certainly does not end on a happy note. I don't wanna put up any spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.
0547260695|5.0|I will buy it again, I got it as a give and now I want one for me!!! It is a classic
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am a heavy sleeper and I need something that is loud, yet not too annoying to wake me up and thats what this app provides. It is simple yet effective, it allows you to have multiple alarms that can be scheduled at different times and reoccur as you please. The range of sounds which you can select is good enough. All in all its an easy intuitive app that helps you receive notifications and set your wake up calls to match your schedule.
B0076R62FM|5.0|Now a movie for the entire family to watch together. There was no concern about the string of bad word being use such as F**** this and F**** that...
B005CGI4EG|4.0|Funny stuff, and i don't think most ppl today would care for the show, but it sure brings back good times for me.The video quality is not the best , but it was a tv series , so what:) any ways , it is funny , and i sure think it was well worth the money... EASY!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the ease of this ap. It literally reads to you. It bookmarks where you stop reading. And sends scripture to your email. Amazing and wonderful.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|entertaining for sure. Its fun to see how the town is doing and what is going to happen next. possibly helps with learning life skills.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it except for the energy issue. but if you leave the devise running and go do something else for an hour your energy will accumulate to your Max energy level.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this after reading the excerpt from Wool 1.  I was enraptured. The story is strong, characters well developed, twists surprising but logical.  I highly recommend this to any distopian future / sci-fi fan.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is one of the best games in terms of controls, graphics during game play, and value that I have come across for my Kindle Fire. Yes, it's a leprachaun (sp?) Mario Brothers. So what. It's easy to play and fun for kids and adults alike. And, for as great as the graphics and overall design function are, it's FREE.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game, very close to old school Mario games. have not put my kindle fire down since downloading this gwme
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I love this app but all samsung owners get a bonous world because rovio must have had a deal or something because my friends tablet had the danger zone world but me as a kindle fire owner had to pay 3$$$ just to realize that I don't get a bonus world which doesn't make Sence because I paid more them samsung owners not FAIR!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):):):)  :):):):):-)it is a great game it it fun I love it it is a great game because u get so many games in 1
B000059XUO|5.0|interviewed, Brandon Lee siad he felt he was born to play this role.  Perfectly matched to the role, it was an amzing end to an all to brief career.  Truly THE Crow movie to watch.  Dark brooding gothic film at its zenith, with a redemptive story of vengence born of love... if you haven't seen it, what's wrong with you!!??  :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game because there are not many others that are like it. It is very fun and I can appreciate leveling up more so that I can unlock more items from the store.
B0055SWM08|5.0|today's free app of the day is a great challenge for the mind, yet simple and relaxing.  similar in design, and difficulty as the Red Wrecker app from a few weeks back.  Difficulty and obstacles increase as level increases.  fun app will keep for a while.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great thinking game. Very happy I downloaded it and would encourage all to play it. My kids love it too.
0399245030|5.0|I bought the board book version of this story for my 6 year old son a year or two ago when I was in England. He absolutely loved it. He wss looking for it recently - he's now 8 - and we couldnt find it, so I bought another copy for him recently, as well as another of Jeffers books. After reading them my son proclaimed he wants all of Oliver Jeffers books!<br />Beautifully written and illustrated.
0345803485|1.0|I had no idea what this book was about when I purchased it for my Kindle. I bought it recommended from another reader who had heard about it but hadn't read it either.  I am surprised I even finished it, and only because I hate leaving anything unfinished, and probably because I was hoping it would get better. It was terrible, every last bit.... It was like watching a bad porno, that's all.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Only have used this once or twice but worked well while I did. Wish it worked with a few more apps but maybe in the future. Very easy to use.
B00000DHTF|5.0|It's the Boss, what's more to be said? I was fortunate enough to see him recently in concert. Won't hesitate to do business with this company again.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game rocks definitely one to recommend and be sure to. check out the dopest music/website around adhdthemovement.com #GETHIP #ADHD
B007ONQ42O|5.0|There is a massive shortage of quality female fronted hard rock. While operatic metal groups like Nightwish are abundant--true hard hitting rock is much harder to find. Which makes Halestorm so freakin awesome. Groundbreaking-no. Quality music-yes.<br /><br />Lzzy Hale and her boys have put out a sophomore album that is much more varied than their previous efforts with tinges of southern rock, arena rock and even some pop overtones overlaid into their bread and butter hard rock. I think their branching out into different sounds really adds a level of complexity to their work. While they didn't get the mixture perfect on every song, the songs don't all sound the same and have much more personality. You won't find yourself thinking you accidentally hit the repeat button as each song is distinctly different which I really appreciate as that's a common problem within this genre. The inclusion of beautiful ballads like \\"Beautiful With You\\" or \\"Break In\\" make you appreciate that much more the hardness of other songs like \\"Love Bites.\\"<br /><br />The outstanding musicianship of the band is especially evident in the crafting of these songs. You'll find yourself waiting for a guitar breakdown or a quiet moment that helps convey emotion. Lzzy is simply an exceptional vocalist who can carry technical riffs, high notes and still convey heartbreaking vulnerability. This album also seems more personal than their last which showcases Lzzy's talent even more.<br /><br />This album is empowering, strong, soft, sexy and an insane amount of fun. It's system blaring, top down on a warm night kind of music. Highly recommend.<br /><br />**Like the others I also recommend getting the deluxe version. I personally wish the extra tracks had just been put on the album.<br /><br />***************************************************<br />Also, beware--if the copy you are buying doesn't say \\"explicit\\" after it, then it's the edited version.<br />The explicit version can be found here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ONSLLQ/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk<br />And this is the edited version http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ONQ42O/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imglnk  And this is the edited version http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ONQ42O/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
B0055SWM08|4.0|relatively easy, yet requires some logic and strategy moves. I recommend it when you need a distraction to keep your mind off of other things.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I laughed, I cried,  a must read.  Loved it.  I loved her journey and her brutal honesty of her regrets.  Going to see what else she's wriiten.  Michelle, author of [...]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a good game I used to play it at school but don't anymore but try this game it will be fun just get the hang of it have a nice day hope you enjoy this game.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game is not compatable for the kindle fire so don't waste your time downloading it. its a good thing its free or else I would be demanding my money back
0451196716|5.0|This was written in 1979 under Stephen King's \\"Richard Bachman\\" fake name.<br /><br />Within its genre, this is a legitimate classic and is King at his best. By genre, it is mass-market commercial suspense fiction - but it's great.<br /><br />This is also a chance to read King at the peak of his writing powers. He can still a good story, like \\"11/22/63,\\" but \\"Long Walk\\" is when he knew how to edit out his worst excesses. You can tell the effort and attention he paid to the very tightly controlled sentences, which I haven't seen in his longer fiction in quite some time.<br /><br />This isn't even a third the length of \\"11/22/63,\\" but it tells as interesting and as well-plotted a story, with characters the reader invests in and cares about. The young 'walkers' act like teenagers, too.<br /><br />With all the hoopla about \\"The Hunger Games,\\" this is a great example of an earlier story that dealt with a lot of the same issues - a dystopian society, a bizarre competition, and teenagers fighting and dying among themselves. It's brilliant - and very, very dark.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|brilliant simply fantastic the game shows very mario like playing but also tying in the lep theme its an easy addicting game for all ages
B0055SWM08|5.0|Have had this game for quite a while and its easily one of my favorites.  Check out Quell Reflect as well if you want a slightly higher difficulty.
B0026MOVO6|5.0|I received this item quickly and it arrived in excellent condition.  This cd was awesome and just let me know how much I really do miss Whitney Houston!!!
0345803485|2.0|You are better off buying BDSM erotica. There is literally no substance to this story. Its like watching a porno video, terrible story line, worse acting, you are really just watching for the action. Save your money. Only gave it an extra star for the sex, which was the only readable part. Even that got boring.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I've been watching The Walking Dead and have the first series on DVD.  I am ordering the second season.  I love this program.  It's got lots of drama, action, and horror and almost seems real.  The characters are diverse and yet they all seem to get along.  Each episode is new and leaves you on the edge of your seat, sometimes not knowing who is going to do what and how.  The \\"walkers\\" are astounding!  Great looks and costumes.  Season 3 doesn't start till November.  I'll just keep watching 1 & 2 till then!
0756405890|5.0|This is my favorite book that I have read in the past year, along with the second in this series (The Wise Man's Fear).  I highly recommend it for readers who loved the Lord of the Rings, and for people who enjoy fantasy novels in general.  It's so good!
0439023521|5.0|This series is AMAZING!!!! I couldn't stop reading it. i just finished and I am reading it a second time.
B002RI8ZPK|4.0|OK, Raymond Chandler is a must for anyone interested in the evolution of American fiction, but on recently rereading the Big Sleep and other novels I remembered that his writing is much more than a period piece offering crisp insight into that era - it is simply great writing. Vintage but never dated, his characters continue to develop as the story unfolds and by the end you understand why Philip Marlow is one of literature's most enduring anti heroes. This is a great Kindle book to travel with.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a fun basic game that reminds me of the ice puzzles in Zelda. and the music calm me down which is a nice change to a lot of the &quot;move fast&quot; games.
B0017VQB40|5.0|OMG I loved this movie from the first time I seen it years ago in middle school. I loved the quality of the picture and sound. It really was better then expected.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love it.....fun game!  Makes you think creatively and I would recommend. I rarely play games. hope they create more levels.
1935670913|5.0|As an aspiring indie author that once had a publishing contract that fell through, John's words especially ring true to me. He basically says write what you want and find your niche audience. This is something a publishing company will not allow most authors to do (in my experience). I would term myself a 'difficult author' in that I don't fit in any particular genre the way a publisher wants me to. I also refuse to market my unique brand of writing and books the way they want so my writing would fit a broad audience. Right on! Now I know they were wrong to try and force me to change for their needs. I will write what I want for a particular set of audience, find them and sell to them for cheap prices that the publishers can't even begin to fathom selling for. John Locke gives hope where publishers would squash it. Bravo! This man is my hero and I revere him for his bravery to tell it exactly like it is. And he's such a genius at doing it that it makes me want to buy every single one of his books. If that doesn't tell you how briliant he is then I don't know what does... I think this book is a must for any indie author that wants to publish and find success. Buy it! You won't regret it. And if you want to chat with me more on this amazing book find me on twitter: @CLeeAuthor. I can't say enough great things about this book.<br />Crystal Lee
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was looking foe this kind of game for long time.because I played this type of game when I was child. I till reneged hoe interesting that game was and there were four base element which were fire water dirt and ice.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|full of fun action and adventure. I would recommend. this game to every one. I played the origanal game in school and always wondered what next now I know.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very clever puzzle game.<br />I'd been putting off trying this game for weeks until lt became the free app of the day today. It's really a fun game!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Love this app - a must have for any Android Smartphone user. Syncs with your current youtube account for easy downloading of videos onto your smartphone. Awesome app
0545265355|5.0|As far as packaging goes, it's quite nicely done and has everything you'd expect from hardbacks. The books themselves are sturdy and have a nice reflective emblem on the front underneath the paper cover.<br /><br />For the story, I've enjoyed the first book so far, though the writing style is from first person so there are a few awkwardly phrased sentences. Plus if your mind wanders while reading you'll be totally lost and have to reread some, because Katniss's mind wanders in the writing itself. It's a unique style, easy, fast to read and enjoyable. Exactly what you'd expect, but the story is anything but predictable. Hope this was useful!
B0055SWM08|4.0|this is a great puzzle game for adults and older children. I dig the quiet soundtrack and sound effects, they definitely help squelch rage induced by puzzle games.
B000I9WWFO|5.0|I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas from my family. It has not been out of my sight ever since. I wanted to put some go to movies for me since I travel quite a bit. The River Wild is a strong woman type of film, where in the end she gets her man in more ways than one. The scenery is great and have traveled to where they filmed on the Rogue River in southern Oregon. Hard to believe it was filmed in 1994. You can pick apart any movie, I just have really liked this for years.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|ok this is the best out of all the angry bird games!  I lllluuuvvvv iiittttt!!!!!!!!!! I cannot give any bad comments for it. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OK I'll admit I had never even heard of The Hunger Games until they started advertising the movie. The trailer looked interesting so I took my Niece and Nephew to the theater to see it. It was a really good movie, but I had heard they'd taken some liberties with the story so I decided to read the book as well. It was fantastic! There were so many little emotions and insights in the book that did not translate to the movie. So much more depth to the characters relationships. I'm usually the type to read a book over the course of a few weeks a dozen or so pages at a time. However this one sucked me in and I ended up reading it in just a few days. Spending time I normally would have spent watching TV or playing video games reading instead. There have only been a handful of books that have ever grabbed me like this, and I'm happy to say this was one of them. :)<br /><br />I've just purchased book #2 of the trilogy and I look forward to starting it tomorrow. I hope it's as engrossing as the first.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I saw all the great reviews and talk of awards for this book and was excited when I ordered it.  The book was not worth it.  The premise had some problems and I really felt like I wasted my time reading this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app we check it every morning while getting ready for school. like that I can have multiple cities that I can switch back and forth.
B00540G3G6|5.0|it is an was super, kids and grandkids love it. they are passing it around to all<br />their cousins and friends
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is pretty easy but still fun! my kids have enjoyed playing, it holds their attention. I recommend for all ages.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The entire process of ordering this book was completely seemless and easy right from the beginning. I am very satisfied with the product and the ordering, delivery experience.
B0055SWM08|5.0|As someone else said, just the right amount of difficulty.  Can be enjoyed without being a game geek.  Five stars!!
B005P3NPXG|4.0|He gave a new stile on each song, the album is one of best in soul tracks... Probably I´ll buy his first.. Soul 1...
B0031RS64G|5.0|I have never read a story so convoluted and detailed.<br /><br />It is clear from the reading that there is a strong RPG background.<br />Nevertheless, Steven Erikson must have been one of the best master or player ever existed.<br /><br />The story is rich, vivid, to the point that you can even feel the smells of the situation.<br />There is no clear end, you never see the future of the path, as it can suddenly go opposite to what you were guessing.<br />The magic system is solid, the strain on the magic user palpable, there are costs associated to the use of magic.<br /><br />No one is good, no one is bad, you get to like an assasin and to despise an holy priest.<br />Every decision taken will modify the balance of both the character morality and your perception of that character.<br /><br />The plot is so well orchestrated, with countless actors all moving according to the direction.<br />One can only fathom at the mind that could handle all of this without losing track of it.<br />The background material necessary to sustain such a saga must be really vast.<br />I just hope some of it will be shared with the rest of us.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This works great on my Transformer Prime TF201 with ICS. The graphics are calming and very fluid.  The game play is extremely simple and very challenging at times.  If you have problems with spacial puzzles this is not for you.  For a .99 game it's pretty nice, I got it for free.  Not seeing the facebook adds that other reviews speak of.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! So glad it was the faotd but now that I've played it, I would easily pay $1 for it. Challenging but not too hard. Great time killer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|its free today so what's not to like? cute game, simple. soothing soundtrack but the name contradicts the games soothing nature; it means to subdue or kill.
1401307450|2.0|I read this book a few years ago mainly because I liked the Red Hot Chili Peppers then and hoped to find out more about their creative process. That information is only marginally in the book. The biggest part is taken up by talking about drug addiction and sexual escapades. The main thing I remember now about the book, and it bothers me whenever it pops up in my mind, are passages where he not only talks about his own exploits but also those of other people.  Washing other people's dirty laundry in public is pretty low in my view. It seems he is trying to say 'Look, I did some bad stuff but so did others. If you judge me you'll have to judge them too'. Disappointing.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|I rarely get on the band wagon to express my own opinion about a film. However, I am going to express that the negative reviews that hit this film when it came out and when it was released on DVD and Blu-ray had me so put off, I didn't take an interest in watching this release because so many people said it was a remake.<br /><br />My mother and I have been huge fans of the original for years, and I, myself, had been waiting patiently to see the prequel and the sequel to John Carpenter's original masterpiece. When she recently insisted on watching the 2011 version I willing went along.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was happy to discover that this is, in fact, the prequel to the original film. I've heard some complaints about the usage of CGI and the similarities to the 1982 film by J.C., but in all honesty after seeing the film on Blu-ray I cannot find any great complaint with this film. In all truth, I find that I rather enjoyed it and will be adding it to my collection.<br /><br />While J.C.'s 1982 film is a masterpiece among film and especially horror, THIS IS NOT THAT FILM nor is it a remake of that film.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this film five stars is because there is, at times, strong sequence similarities to J.C.'s 1982 film. HOWEVER, this in my humble opinion does not harm or default the overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />When looking at this film (the 2011 'The Thing') as the first chapter and J.C.'s 1982 film as the second, there is great understanding as to why they did not do more with the creatures.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the long awaited sequel to J.C.'s film and hope that bad reviews will not keep that from happening. If in fact they ever do get to make the third chapter in this series, this film is an important connection to what eventually happens.<br /><br />All in all, my advice is don't listen to the bad reviews and take a chance to at least rent this film if you are a fan of J.C.'s 1982 masterpiece. If you hate it you hate it, but if you like it you'll be pleased you took a chance on it, but don't let the negative reviews put you off.you hate it, but if you like it you'll be pleased you took a chance on it, but don't let the negative reviews put you off.
B0076NAWWA|3.0|I guess I was expecting more, something NEW from these guys.<br />To me, this is a good tribute album, just like previous Dream Theater albums with Mike Portnoy, there are many many obvious elements from other bands such as Beatles, Yes, Queen, Muse etc...<br />Colored cards or flags on the album cover must be album jackets from these bands.<br /><br />Not bad at all but nothing new here.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I love almost all the songs on this album.  My only wish is that the song \\"Hearts a Mess\\" was on it as well.  Otherwise it is a perfect album.
0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl's classic book, \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\", resonates with significance and purpose.  After reading the book, you should be able to find true purpose and real meaning in your life.  You should be able to be directed in the right course and direction.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts.  The first part recounts Frankl's experience during World War II at the concentration camps.  He recounts on how he was able to survive.  It boils down to purpose and meaning.  Those who had a purpose and meaning to live had better odds of surviving the concentration camps.  The second part discusses logotherapy.<br /><br />How do you find significance and meaning in your own life?  Well, it is important to go through the process and understand and experience life.  By serving others and helping others find their significance, you will find your significance and meaning in life.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book,\\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

B003Y5H51K|1.0|WARNING: SPOILERS. Everything about this movie seemed so cliche to me. The boy who chafes at his father's rules. The crusty explorer. Oh please. What disturbed me the most, though, was the casual morality involved. There was not one but TWO instances of mercy killing. The strings swelled at the second one. What heartbreak! What pathos! No, what heartless cruelty. And then another death involved a suicide -- for the good of the others, of course. What nonsense. I simply could not get past the odious morality on display.
B0055SWM08|3.0|I downloaded this thinking that it was going to be a great game due to its five star rating but was let down. it is ok but not great or even good. I grew quiet bored with it after four stages and do not like the fact that if you want to view the hints you have to go to facebook. after some consideration I uninstalled it. very happy i did not purchase and got it as faotd. I really do not see what the hype is about.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|So much fun! A lot like the old nintendo games I played when I was a young one. TY developers
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love lep's world.I my favorite in the world.u get to explore different worlds and fight different creatures,it's awesome.u play an old,short leprechaun(I named him gephrey.)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If u like Mario then you'll love this believe me. it looks weird at first but really fun and addictive
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is super fun,  but I don't like how you run out of energy so fast. overall, very fun!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like the app. it is a new twist on Mario but I think&quot; Wow this is fun, but I would rather have real Mario instead of this weird midget&quot; I look &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario kart&quot; and nothing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i. lov. this game cuz wen there nothing to do and I get bored I just get my tablet and start playing rambom games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would definitely recommend this app to anyone interested in multiple translations of the Bible, good varied daily readong plans, and reads the Bible in areas with wifi access. I mostly read my Bible at home, so this app worked great for me. If you're looking for a Bible that you can access all the time, this isn't it.
0062060562|1.0|Hard to believe all the raves on this book. I'm here just to try to help balance the scales a bit. There are several excellent one-stars. You can read those. I'm just adding another check mark to the one-star list.<br /><br />This book is, in a word, Awful. It is tedious and repetitive, not remotely thrilling, and not remotely believable. It's the total lack of believability that I most hold against it. It borders on the absurd. I cannot fathom how anyone even got through this dreck, let along praised it. All I can figure is once you've put out the cash for the thing, you have to justify it to yourself by convincing yourself it was good. Good? This doesn't even qualify as marginally decent.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was so happy when this was the app of the day. ive heard really good things about so I tried it what the other reviews say are true.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the humor and the believablity of each character. I read all 3 books. Each book left you wanting more - the final book wrapped everything up nicely, but I still want more!
B003MC5N28|5.0|This novel is for anyone who wishes for a perfect world. Be careful what you wish for. Sometimes having a \\"perfect world\\" means losing things you hold dear in your imperfect world. The book cleverly leads you into this world, making you feel like it truly is perfect but then half way through reveals what's missing from this world and suddenly you realize that it's not perfect at all. Cleverly written, though provoking, and intelligent, this book is perfect for the literary reader.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great set of games that make it a challenge to have to complete goals and get coins in order to advance
B000JBWWRY|5.0|My Granddaughter is delighted with her movie of Peter Pan, and watches it everyday I am told! It came on time and in mint condition. Uncomplicated shopping. I am pleased.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Oh joy to the app gods<br />If only I had a tablet earlier this was my second game download after angry birds:-)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it was a verry verry good and well made game and I enjoyed it verry verry much thank you for it
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Recieved item with speed and ease. I have no issues to write about . I also should say the item was recieved earlier than expected.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it. its just like Mario brothers but even better its a leprechan and guess what I'm not the developer and I said its like Mario bros. would definitely recommend to others. looks and plays great on Fire.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is neat. I play it all the time. It has a great assortment of food. The best part...you'll need to play to find out.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is addicting!  I could not put the first book down.  Wonderfully written, easy to turn from page to page and wonderful characters to read and connect with.  Amazing!
0345803485|3.0|I almost stopepd reading this book a few times but I powered through it for the sake of my book club.  Ana's character is very annoying.  One minute she's balling in front of her mother, then the next she's startled that her mother is asking her what's wrong.  Seriously?  Christian is too young, in my opinion, to be believable and sexy enough for this character.  This book is hardly erotic and I've read better stories on Craigslist.  I will not be reading the sequels as I couldn't care less what happens next.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so awesome.  I beat it and played it again!!  I suggest u play it! !also I wanted to say that whoever came up with this game is.awesome!
B0002IQAN6|5.0|If you like this album - and who doesn't if they are into blues and rock? (Statesboro Blues is just a tune you never get tired of)- then you have got to get this if you have a SACD player. There hav been a few hypercrtical reviews of the sound/mixing of it but I say use your tone controls.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome. I luv this game. it keeps u busy.. some of the games r hard but they still reward u for it. fun. great value
B0063IH60K|5.0|A fun, simple game that is just easy to play, but addictive.<br />Very well done, and just the right price for everyone.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Energy runs out way to quickly and waiting three minutes happens to be extremely annoying. I'm surprised people would pay money to buy items for this game. Maybe the game should be sold for a certain price upfront so the purchasing of items during gameplay could be eliminated.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game.  I wish energy was easier to get or you could toggle through people.  other than that its really fun.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|hook up usb power directly to tv then unit turns on off with tv.<br />unlike the other brands, this one does not output noise when tv is off.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|An another amazing album, There vocals are awesome as usual and the music as well they have a wonderful band.  I can't wait for their next album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just down loaded and started to play but it works well on the Fire and is fun and relaxing. Can't beat free.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is part of a long going journey to seek and understand spiritualism and find my purpose in all of it thank you Rhonda I'm getting there[[ASIN:1451673442 The Magic (The Secret)]]
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this bible app is wonderful. I even take it to church with me. Bible study is a breeze.  highly recommend it for anyone.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|A Mario like game and just as fun as the original Mario. My 8 yr old niece would really enjoy this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is simply the best Bible app in the market.  With all if the hundreds of different translations, and reading plans. If you don't have it get it now!
B0029LHW68|4.0|I've heard of 30 seconds to Mars for a long time. But it's only until recently that I became fond of their music. It's a little different  from what I thought it would be, very nice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is full pf surprises. it has many different plans devotions you name it. will also sync with your android phone.
B007QRWXJG|1.0|Welcome back to Baby Boomer Morality Theater. Betty \\"Francis\\" continues to be an irrelevant drag on the show. Her character remains a one-dimensional boring repository for whatever negative situations the writers want to push in a given week. She is suddenly middle aged for no particular reason. And now she is going through a cancer experience. It would be better if the writers actually tried to write characters again rather than putting so much absurd emphasis on \\"relevant\\" 1960s plot-points like cancer treatment and diet pills.<br /><br />The characters and stories have become as meaningless and ephemeral as advertising itself. The show no longer really captures business anymore like it used to. The office is \\"cast\\" as if it's one of those mid-1960s TV shows where the orders came down from the network to suddenly include people who had been previous excluded. They do it all at once<br />and they do it in the most blatantly obvious ways. Oh and we throw in the rolling stones for no particular reason too.<br /><br />The party in the first episode was good. But its two years past time for Betty and her kids to go away.<br /><br />Tune in next week for Vietnam Soap Opera (Evil male soldiers are all bad, violent men), pill popping, Peggy feeling sorry for herself for the hundredth time, Don acting weird again and learn how there were no serial killers in America before 1966. That Boston Strangler thing from 1962-1964....all of it was lies. Never happened.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|. . . LAST YEAR (2011), THERE WERE THREE MOTION PICTURES RELEASED IN THEATERS THAT DIRECTLY WERE INFLUENCED BY AND /OR RELATED TO MAKING MOVIES: 'SUPER 8', 'HUGO' AND 'THE ARTIST'. \\"SUPER 8\\", THE FIRST EARLY 'BLOCKBUSTER' EVENT FROM DIRECTOR J. J. ABRAMS (\\"STAR TREK\\") AND WAS CO-PRODUCED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG. THIS VERY WELL MADE SCI-FI CRAFTED FLICK HAD (LIKE \\"HUGO\\"), KIDS, ALL UNDER 16 AS THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND ADULTS IN THE SUPPORTING ROLES. STARRING ELLE FANNING (DAKOTA'S SISTER) IN A REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE THAT WILL GET HER NOTICED FOR MORE PARTS IN FILMS TO COME! NEWCOMERS ALSO IN THE ENSEMBLE ARE VERY BELIEVABLE AND WILL GET ATTENTION FOR FUTURE PROJECTS. THE STORY, PACE, EDITING AND SPECIAL EFFECTS (THE BEST TRAIN WRECK ON FILM!!) ARE OUTSTANDING AND SPIELBERG HAD INFLUENCE ON AND OFF THE SET. IF ABRAMS CREDIT WERE NOT ON SCREEN, SPIELBERG WOULD HAVE HIS TRADEMARK ALL OVER THIS. EXCELLENT MUSIC AS WELL! AND THE 'ALIEN BEING' IS AS MUCH A MAJOR CHARACTER AS THE HUMANS, BUT NOT A CUTZY 'E.T.' THIS FILM WITHIN A FILM, TAKES PLACE IN THE MID-1970'S AND THE LOCATIONS, SETS AND PERIOD PROPS DO THEIR JOB TO TAKE YOU ACCURATELY BACK IN THAT TIME 'FRAME'. SEE THIS! AND SEE ALL THREE!!!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 'HUGO' AND 'THE ARTIST' TOO!!!<br /><br />SADLY, AS USUAL, THE MAKERS ON THE DVD DO NOT INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF 'EXTRAS' AND 'FEATURETTES' AS DOES THE BLU-RAY COPIES. I DO NOT OWN A BLU-RAY PLAYER AND THIS 'ATTITUDE' FROM THE MANUFACTURERS JUST PISSES ME OFF MORE AND MORE!!<br /><br />  . . .  FRED K. WILLDERS
B007ORU2BY|4.0|The two-part season premiere was actually good. Unlike most recent episodes there was a sense of fun to it and far less of the by-the-numbers baby boomer historical melodrama. The chemestry between Don and his new wife was fun. The party was fun. Bringing back all the characters in this particular way was quite effective. Looking back, it may be the high point of the season. Because they have about 100 episodes of Betty suffering that they want to do. Joan is also reduced to being a martyr now. And of course we need lots, lots more of Betty's daughter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I actually like having to play to unlock the other games unlike a lot ofbyou others that are reviewing. I'm playing on my kindel fire quick makes it even easier. love the game!!
B0055SWM08|3.0|Ok if its such a great app why am I rating it 3 star? Three stars is for 1 Fun game 2 Addictive game 3 Challenging<br />Now why -2 ? -1 Too much space taken. -2 Better games out there. Really. The reveiws treat it like its the best app out there. I think Quell&reg; needs work. Sorry Fallen Tree Games&copy;
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Awesome content, well put even for the non-specialists. I recommend it to those that look for a book that can provide knowledge along with inspiration and the pleasure a reader seeks.
0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson adds a way to be magical in these books. With the ability to burn metal Sanderson adds an new element to the world of high fantasy.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|this is fun and creepy, in the end it fizzles out with the reason why, but other than that solid horror.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. anyone who gave this game 1 star is either crrazy; or really impatient. Plus it's free; so why not give it a try?
B0000524CY|5.0|the best of all horror films. basically a single location creepfest. loved it when i saw it as a kid and still creeps me out.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game<br />it reminds me of Mario so much. I like how its a lepracon instead of Mario to haha
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is the first book by Nesbo I have read.  Truely enjoyed the story and the characters.  Great story, with suspense, romance and ruthless characters.  I will be reading more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it id an ok app. I like it hut it can be a little hard sometimes. oh well I gu
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is one of the most relaxing, imaginative, and well-produced puzzle apps I've ever played. It makes you think while you succumb to its subtle yet arresting visuals and sounds. Perfectly suited for a lazy, rainy afternoon, which I believe was the intent. And for you Atari Lynx fans out there, it pays homage to that system's Chip's Challenge, which was incredible in its own right. I'd love for Fallen Tree Games to acquire the rights for it, as it would be an awesome follow-up to Quell.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm a huge Mario Bros fan.. but there arnt any good Mario apps... this is just like it and its super fun!! you gotta get it!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|it is a challenging and fun game. really makes you think about what you're doing. music will put you to sleep real quick.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|I feel as though this game stole too much from Mario.<br />While I am an enormous nerd who loves the classics,<br />I can't help but feel that this title is far too unoriginal.Now If you'll excuse me, I'm off to play Final Fantasy II.<br /><br />  Cheers
0345803485|2.0|Look, let me just start by saying that this book is really, really bad. I've read the entire Twilight series and hated it, so this clearly wasn't meant for me, but I've also been a long enough reader of fanfiction that I was intrigued when I read that this was originally AU Twilight fanfiction. How it got published, I have no idea, and I refuse to read Cassandra Clare on the same principle, that what she wrote was taken really heavily from her Harry Potter fanfiction, but this is a NY Times bestseller, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It. Is. Terrible. It is so obviously Twilight that I can't help but roll my eyes. There's a character that mirrors everyone in Twilight: Edward and the Cullens, Bella, Jacob, Mike Newton, etc. Do you remember how Edward saved Bella from a car? Yeah, Christian saves Anastasia FROM A SPEEDING CYCLIST. A BICYCLE. I wish I was joking. There are even things that I feel James stole from Meyer: \\"Breathe, Anastasia\\" as opposed to \\"Breathe, Bella,\\" and the main characters constantly telling each other how fascinating the other is and how they CAN'T STAY AWAAAAAAY. It's really awful.<br /><br />There is a but, however. Anastasia is actually a fairly strong young woman, something that Bella really lacked. I've always felt that Stephanie Meyer was really doing her audience a disservice by denying that Edward and Bella were really meant to be in a legitimate D/s relationship and both characters suffered terribly because of it. Edward is a crazy stalker and Bella is a sad, dependent little girl. James finally does the two characters some justice, but Christian is, of course, still a stalker. Because who wouldn't want her boyfriend to fly 2500 miles to see her when she left because of him in the first place? COME. ON.<br /><br />Ana questions Christian's controlling nature and fights him on it, rather that completely giving in and letting him do whatever he wants because she needs to be taken care of. It's quite refreshing, and the sex is hot. I'll give James that, but they get it on every five pages and at this point (halfway through the second book) I'm starting skip the sex scenes. It's too much. I understand this is meant to be mommy porn, and I'm just not that demographic. I'm totally into reading about their kinky relationship, as, apparently, is everyone else, but it's over-saturated with sex scenes and I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. NO man can have sex that many times in one day. When your readers want to stop reading because there's too much sex and not enough plot, there's a fundamental problem.<br /><br />All of this being said, I AM halfway through the second book and plan on reading the third. It's a horribly written series and I'm starting to hate myself for wanting to keep reading, but I do. Someone please stop me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lotsa fun. wish it would give hints on the screen itself. it's harder than you think. i'm enjoying it. Thank you!
B0073U2FB2|5.0|YES MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT SUCKED BAD WELL TO THEM THATS ALL THEY DO BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO THEN NOTHING, BUT I THOGUHT THE MOVIE WAS AN AWSOME ACTION PACK MOVIE WITH AWSOME VISUAL EFFECTS AND BETTER THAN SYFY MOVIE EFFECTS. I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO AHSNT SEEN IT YET. WILD AND CRAZY EFFECTS, AWSOME USE OF ALIEN EFFECTS A+++++ SUPER AWSOME A VISUAL OF MASTER EFFECTS DESIGN USA TODAY STATES
0312641893|5.0|although quite predicable, this book was still very fast pace and had me screaming at the character to get done what needed to be done. And oh my stars Prince Kai--mmh!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|i originally downloaded the lite version but it did not have many sound features so i upgraded to the full version and i use it every night to help me fall asleep. i love the crickets and the campfire you can also set a timer to shut off the sounds. i love this app its a must have for the kindle fire.!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|only fun if you have a lot of real $$ to spend or don't mind waiting g forever to keep playing<br /><br />.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|reminds me of super mario brothers from back in the day.classic side scroller simple and easy to use controls and fun graphics. i enjoyed  it a lot.my nephew also loved it thanx amazon:-) keep up the good work.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I bought this along with LG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset.  They are working beautifully together.  I just plug the transmitter into my classic 80g ipod and the headphones pick it up automatically.  It also has a pretty good range.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i like the option to download as mp4 video or mp3 song or even acc.works great on my kindle fire.it comes in handy if i hear a song on tv or radio i like.i download and take my favorite music with me on the go.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this puts a whole new spin on the old Oregon trail. love the fact you can fish and huntnfor food.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good graphics and very entertaining. These types of puzzle games have been done before, but this one is done execeptionally well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging puzzle game, wonderful aesthetic, relaxing music. I am quite enjoying this  wonderful game. Pick it up quick while it's the free app of the day, but even if you missed that, you should still get it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has so many mini games to play! there are a few that were to easy or boring bit most r cool.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|If you like the first Halestorm disc, you will love this one as well.  I won't critique each song, but all but a couple are definitely keepers.  All four of the ballads could receive FM airplay (of course, \\"Here's To Us\\" already is).  Interestingly, the other three ballads are in order slapped right dab in the middle of rockers such as \\"Freak Like Me\\" and \\"American Boys.\\"  I strongly recomment getting the deluxe edition because the extra three songs could just have well been the first three songs on the cd.  Some songs remind me of Evanescence while others remind me of Heart, but in the end, it's all Halestorm!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I, also, enjoyed this book immensely.  I am inately shy and take a long time to make friends. This book showed me how to speed up this process. While I can easily recall several key poinys, I will go back and reread the book as the author suggests.
B004XISI4A|4.0|Another great book in the series, love the writtings of George R.R. Martin. A very talented Author. I'm a little dissapointed, as I thought the story might wrap up with this one, but not to be. Not that I'm complaining, I am just impatiently awaiting the next book which I imagine is a long way off.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if u llike Mario ill love lep. def rec o men d it. I n g v hf fy. th vgb vgv. hhv.
0345803485|5.0|OMG!!! This book is one of the best books I've read in a while...I can't put it down...now I 'm on the 3rd book. It's addicting!!  I want more E L James!!! Can't wait to see this on big screen!! A MUST READ!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game. Didn't get boring like most other kindle games do. The fact that the hint button is there is great for any perfectionists out there.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I loved the game. I played for hours until I beat the game and I never have enough attention span to do that. I would have gave it Five Stars but the more I played the more glitchy and slow the game got. I kept having to exit out and use the task killer to end it. Then it world work for one turn and glitch out again. If that issue were fixed it would be a five star game.
B002KVCA1O|4.0|If your a fan of the rolling stones looking for the most hits on one compilation I would advise getting 40 licks and then downloading your favorites it misses because there is no stones compilation that does a better job overall(note theres a few tracks on disc 2 that are edited it didnt bother me much cept beast of burden i bought the full version as an mp3). Or...<br /><br />If you were only a fan of the stones 60s music check out Rolled Gold: The Very Best of The Rolling Stones 2007 Edition on Cd.  The Stones released alot of singles in the 60s but this does cover alot of them if you get the right edition.  It still dont cover the 70s stuff and 40 Licks first 20 tracks are all from the 60s.<br /><br />THIS CD tries to cover to much ground for a one disc compilation missing fan favorites and hits so if u get this youll still have to download favorites it misses.<br /><br />This band has over 100 singles making it impossible to make a \\"perfect\\" compilation. If you read this and decided you know what im going to buy all their studio albums and save myself the headache there is no way ill miss hits then WRONG they released several songs only as singles and or on compilations just so you know.<br /><br />PS Other fans and reviewers seem to like Hot Rocks 1964-1971(2cd compilation) and Rewind cds for it suposedly has no edits and covers alot of the same ground as Forty Licks.  I personally like the new songs only on Forty Licks and like the 60s songs not present on those compilations but might be worth checking out for you.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game.  Only thing id like to see happen is they make it easier to invite neighbors from within the game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so much fun. Like other reviewers ststed its like Mario. This is the best arcade game I have doenloaded on my Kindle by far. And you can't go wrong with the price. The ads are not bothersome like some free games I have tried.
B003KATMYC|2.0|Just as Star Wars started as a unique idea and developed into a drawn out commercial for video games, so Dr Who is going the same way. The only reason to write more (for gods sake enough already) daleks is to set up for what we saw at the end. A long commercial for the Dr Who video game. Note the bright colors of the new Daleks. The writing is horrible and the tone is grating and tired. There is no life in the acting or story line. Just rehash of things (like the first three star wars episodes) all to sell merchandise and video games. The BBC has learned a thing or two from the coked out american film makers. Crap sells. Screw the story line, put in product placement and stoke the furnace of bottom line. It breaks my heart, but I guess it is better than no Dr Who at all. And what is with the new companion. she simply flounces around like a valley girl with no power or presence at all. she would do well on the CW channel in one of the cookie cutter little girl story lines so that no one would have to deal with using their imagination. Lets just have a lot of bored tired people moving about doing obvious things in an obvious manner. Lets have daleks every third episode and make sure to use the new color scheme so that the video game players will cough up money for more game play. Maybe they should change the setting to southern california and have the doctor and his companion go to clubs. That would make it more attractive to their target audience.
0201485672|5.0|The book is very well structured, with an excelent introduction about the theme followed by a catalog of refactorings. It's a classic that every software developer must read and have in his working place.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple but challenging. Good graphics, straightforward tutorial. Pretty easy to speed through the levels, but if you're like me you'll go hack through and try for a perfect score on each puzzle. I like that it tells you the minimum possible moves. Nice little time waster.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reading plans! There are so many great plans to choose from, all of which help me to learn more about God and his plans for my life.
B00005JNJV|2.0|Talk, talk, talk. And this time he and his cast of crew are way too preachy, and Batman himself is no fun, or has no sense of fun much like the predecessors before him. And I thought the complaining of the campy Batman's was out of place, well this is a prime example of what happens when all the fun is soaked out of the Batman series. It is way too serious, with way too serious folks, all on the verge on the preachiness of life. Rachel Daws is such a meandering righteous character here I'm sad to say I'm almost glad she finally got to shut up in the next movie, for good. This is almost what differentiates kids from adults, if you knew like me as a kid, adult conversations were boring compared to the silliness and lightheartedness of kid talk. Nothing was taken seriously. This is an adult grown up Batman with nothing of the camp that made if fun from the 60s television show. Even the villians are boring. No memorable lines, and no over the top campy behavior. This is not based on a comic book as comic books define the term comic as fun, not serious drama as that of a dramatic novel. This movie is a pain to watch from any angle, and I am so glad the 60s series is available on You Tube with complete episodes. The villains are many, and extremely entertaining. I would love to hear the Joker in this series say something as lighthearted as, \\"A joke a day helps keep the gloom away.\\" It will never happen as the Joker in this series is portrayed as a clever demented overbearing loony. And that's how the overall perception of this type of entertainment drama defines itself. The only way I will be able to see the third installment is from Netflix disc exchange, as I refuse to let loose my hard earned money on this serious crap!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I enjoy this game. it is addictive when you don't have much to do :) it is not a good game for those without patience it will make you spend your money.
B00756GKBA|3.0|The reviews here are far more kinder than the consumer reviews on Rolling Stone.com where they consistently leave one word reviews such as bad & sad. I mean, here on Amazon they're labeling it a pop culture masterpiece, and on Rolling Stone reviews are NOT so generous.
B0077ZNRBU|5.0|This is not the best supernatural episode ever but it is a good episode. Supernatural has touched on clowns before with sam and this is just a newer one. Don't miss it!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|The wall decals are wonderful!  A present for my almost 5 year old, she loved them and they are a great addition to her room.  Great price too!  Great item overall!
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Its Coldplay just buy it. You'll love it. Maybe not at first but by the third play through you will never skip any tracks.....Oh and purchasing it for only .25 cents was pretty sick too (though I was prepared to pay full price)
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|One of the most critical elements of a successful plot is for the reader/audience to feel vindicated or avenged. This satisfying romp is for the people whose finances took a hit from the notorious felon Bernie Madoff. All of his victims should attend this film because they want to see a heartless crook get his comeuppance!<br /><br />This is a low-tech version of \\"Ocean's 11,\\" with another likable cast, a loathable villain, and a laudable cause. A wealthy shyster has squandered and lost billions, including the pension plan for the hard-working staff in The Tower, his ultra-elegant, supremely secure high-rise. It's fun to watch some earnest amateurs try to get their pensions back!<br /><br />Here is the gold-plated cast:<br />  * Eddie Murphy (\\"Chicago\\") has to be bailed out of jail; none of our heroes knows how to steal, so they need his professional advice.<br />  * Ben Stiller (\\"Tropic Thunder\\") is the extraordinarily efficient manager of The Tower, organized, resourceful and loyal. It's that loyalty that drives him to even the score.<br />  * Matthew Broderick (\\"The Producers\\") is a trader who just lost everything: his wife, his kids, his job, and now his home...but he sure has a knack for numbers!<br />  * Michael Peña (\\"Crash\\") is a former Burger King counter man; he has just been hired to run an elevator in The Tower.<br />  * Alan Alda (\\"Flash of Genius\\") is the penthouse-dwelling scumbag behind the Ponzi scheme.<br />  * Casey Affleck (\\"Ocean's\\" franchise) cares more about the pending birth of his first child than he does about planning a robbery.<br />  * Téa Leoni (\\"Ghost Town\\") is a smart FBI agent who has nothing but contempt for the crook who just might be getting away with it.<br />  * Gabourney Sidibe (\\"Precious\\") is an immigrant from Jamaica. Her papa was a locksmith, so she learned the trade...<br />  * Stephen Henderson (\\"The Good Heart\\") is the long-time doorman who gives us a face and a heart that represent all the powerless victims of Wall Street.<br /><br />Combine a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, a cute little Brussels Griffon looking for a doggy treat, a funny script, great pacing, plus appealing stars, and you have an entertaining 104 minutes. No sweaty bodies, no profanity that I recall, only one (accidental but important!) gunshot, one fairly humorous vehicular chase and no blowie uppie stuff. A good PG-13 time is had by all!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was the best film that I have seen on the importance of fatherhood.  It is relevant in our society where more and more single parent moms are raising children.  Most important is the biblical setting in which this subject is presented.

B0055SWM08|5.0|just an awesome game. peaceful and semi tricky. very glad was free app today. now i can enjoy it. and here is some filler text
0140544518|5.0|I loved this book when i was younger and recently purchased it for my nephew.  It's helped him understand that there is always another side to every story and we can't take anything at face value, even the most popular stories.  :)
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I would have rated 5 stars the graphics are great for a card game but my complaint is that in tournament mode it can be a bit lengthy and I enjoy to play but as a mom of 4 I can't spend all my time playing games would be great if progress were saved to continue later rather then always having to start over.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read a few of the Lee Childs \\"Reacher\\" books and they were so good, that I started at the beginning of the series to read them all. Love reading them on my Kindles. So compact, I slip it in my purse, and read while I'm on lunch break, or when waiting at a doctors appointment. I've even read when in line at the bank or motor vehicle. Love It !
B004GTLFNW|5.0|This book has changed the way I work-out and is helping me to get into better shape than I've been<br />in years.  And one of the greatest things about Mark Lauren's workout plan is that you can do it just<br />about anywhere!  No gym - no excuse!  In fact, I've done a couple of his work-outs where I would have<br />never thought about working out before... one in a park and one in a field where I used to just run<br />hills.  If you have your body and a floor, plus the right mindset, you're just about ready.  I would like to<br />personally thank Mark Lauren for sharing his workout plan in such a professional way.  Oh, and the<br />app for your phone is terrific too.  The best app I've ever had!<br />Chris A. Knobbe, M.D.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it is so addicting five stars!  keep making these I love them. also shut up you haters your just hating on yourselves. love you teamlava.
B003B1X80Y|4.0|Interesting and somewhat provocative story of young love lasting through old age, and extremely trying medical issues.  Shows the true strength of both characters love for one another, 'til the very end.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very elegant and smooth gameplay on my kindle fire. played it for about an hour or so and have not  had any issues. very fun to play.
B0055SWM08|4.0|other then not being able to open the information blerp before 'buying', I think this is a great relaxing game.

B00005LK94|4.0|Nice and uplifting movie, great filming and good story.  My only complaint is the song near the end while Anna is flying was very annoying.  Maybe it was MC Carpenter but I thought she was better than that.
B000063KM1|5.0|My English professor introduced me to this movie and I throught, this is going to be a lame movie: but the whole class was over whelmed. I brought three of the movies afterwards, that's how good it was to me.  It have so much in it, you have to keep looking at it.  But becarefull, I brought the wrong region. I did not know anything about a region of a movie and had to buy an hemi cord to view it on my TV.  (I live in region 1 and brought region 2). Great, Great, Great.[[ASIN:B001DCZ4IW Harold and Maude]]
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of continuous fun with good challenges. One of the best puzzle games I've played, and as the FAOTD, what's not to love? I definitely would have paid for this game!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game its fun. It is a nicely made real time strategy. I highly recommend this title! yeah.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I thought this game is great.  flawless graphics, Zen like music, you can't go wrong.  well worth the cost of free, but.I would've paid for the game for my home computer if I could.
B00004TA41|5.0|Don't let the pleasant album cover fool you, the music contained on this disc is not for the faint of heart. I admit that I owned \\"Interstellar Space\\" for over five years before I listened to it all the way through. Initially I found it to be too abrasive and would turn it off after a few minutes. However, when I was truly ready to experience what Coltrane laid down on these tracks it was a revelation. What Coltrane played here is technically impressive, and when listening to this album from that perspective one can't help but to be blown away. More important to me though is to step back and just listen. This was a man who did not have much time left to live, and to me it sounds like he was wringing everything he could out of the saxophone knowing that there was no time to waste. For the recording of \\"Interstellar Space\\" Coltrane stripped his band down to just himself and his drummer Rashied Ali, and this bare bones setting doesn't allow the listener's focus to stray very much. If that was Coltrane's intent, it was successful. While \\"Interstellar Space\\" is not for everyone, it is an important part of John Coltrane's legacy. He could have made a very comfortable living by playing standards for his entire career and doing what everyone wanted him to do. Instead, he pushed the boundaries until the day he died and lost many fans as a result. This is one of the reasons I admire the man so much. This was one of Coltrane's last albums, and I don't get the impression that he was ready to pack it in and walk into the sunset as the album cover implies. He went down swinging, and through the torrents of notes he recorded at these sessions I can always feel the turmoil of a man who still had rage enough to live but knew he wasn't going to. That's the mark of a transcendent album, and an incredible listening experience. Fans of John Coltrane should consider this an essential album to own.
B004LROUNG|5.0|As always John Grisham comes through with a great book.  This will have you thinking about a lot of different issues about prescription drugs and the big drug companies.  Great book.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|this app was fun for awhile.its kinda like mario on your tablet.but when i got too a certain level and died, it sent me back 2 full hard levels instead of 1! please fix this annoying feature that has probably set back lots of us consumers.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|This album rocks like the original Van Halen of yesteryear.  After 28 long years the wait is finally over!  Eddie rips, the driving beat is back, and Roth vocals are as nonsensical as ever.  Altogether, the sounds bring you back to a time when gas was $1.19 a gallon and Space Invaders were dropping in at your local bowling alley.  The only thing missing is Michael Anthony's booming vocal harmonies, hence the four rather than five star rating.  Definitely worth the price.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addictive,  and can be challenging.  For sure this game is a keeper.  Will be playing for a while. It keeps me occupied.  Thanks to the development and Amazon for the faotd.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this app. I play it every day. so many things to do on the game. keep up the good work.
1594744769|4.0|Very easy and fun read. The photographs caught my attention and added a lot to the book. It was a fun and different way to read and bring imagination using the photograhs. I have passed this book on to many of my friends.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have recently finished reading THE CITY OF BONES: The Mortal Instruments #1 by Cassandra Clare.I enjoyed the char actors, the story, and the paranormal world that these characters inhabited.<br /><br />This book is definitely written with young adults in mind.  It is also in pre-production to become a movie starring Jamie Campbell Bower and Lily Collins, this casting seems promising.
B007MJSYF0|5.0|With recent news about the Hunger Games coming out I decided to do some research about it and found out that The Hunger Games is very similar to the Movie/Book Battle Royale. I looked at reviews and many people said this movie was amazing. I decided to buy it and could not be happier. Very detailed story, many characters that you can feel for. A lot of Action. This movie is great. If you don't like reading subtitles then maybe you won't like it as much, but you should really still give it a chance. Overall I would say this a great quality movie with a good plot and great characters. 4.5/5
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful Darkness by Kami Garcia is another wonderful, multi-layered, fascinating book that was nearly impossible for me to put down before I was finished reading it.<br /><br />The book continues the story of teenagers Ethan, Lena, Linc, and Ridley and their adventures woven into a supernatural tale unlike any other I've read. Many mysteries are uncovered, secrets revealed. The characters are consistent, varied, and interesting. The love story is sweet and lovely, very real with a bit of angst...complications ensue in this book.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading paranormal fantasy. It is written for young adults, I feel it is suitable for readers age ten years and above.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I uninstalled because every time you start a new hand the screen switches yo an ad. sometimes the ads are videos which are really annoying. I don't mind ads on free apps but not when they pop up after each game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|quite fun always ; like Mario bros. I heart it it is awesome tooooooo fun for everyone awesome awesome. AWESOME!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!##
B001B6EAOY|3.0|I bought one of these cards back in october 2011, and it worked flawlessly until april 2012 when it cracked inside my psp. i needed to order a new one and got one from a different distributor. It didn't work at all, so i returned it and ordered again from Photofast. The new card read inside my psp... sort of. It took a good 20 seconds to boot up, so i ordered another. the new one does the same damn thing. Why they have such horrible quality control is a mystery for me... The first one I got worked FAST and FLAWLESSLY and these new ones aren't nearly as good. like I said they take a good 20 seconds during some loads. Ugh. Not sure if i should even order a new one since these cards require tax.<br /><br />Also its like my PSP wanted to format the old one, but these new ones won't format inside my psp. so annoying!!! If you order, be prepared for some frustration.
B0065NAKRO|4.0|Never knew that I would like dominoes, but this is a great game. Very addicting and helps pass time when waiting for appointments!
B005T87QCI|5.0|I like this and for the people that hated this just choose blacktop. he is good and people that just bought it just choose blacktop. that is how you beat it.FUN GAME.
B002XZOZQA|1.0|I don't know, I'm just joe average but I keep wanting to turn this off...  The sound quality is bad, there's not enough singing and who did the wardrobes, Sears?
B007MNV5WU|1.0|this is the worst game ever I have ever played in my entire life I hope this game gets banned so no one can suffer the bordom
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun app. for passing time. makes you think. not just a boring game but a challenging way to spend some time.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I have to agree with a lot of people on here. it takes to long to recharge your energy. there a lot of people that just stand around doing nothing. don't like that you have to spend cash for upgrades on a lot of things
0345803485|5.0|THIS BOOK STARTS OFF A LITTLE SLOW , BUT THEN BANG! NO PUN INTENDED! ITS A PAGE TURNER FOR SURE.
B000SEI230|5.0|Even though the story line was a bit predictable, but it was a nice read nevertheless. Very well written. I loved how he keeps saying <spoiler>... \\"if you know what i mean\\" every now and then. That's how typical teenagers talk. lol.
1451627289|5.0|What an engrossing story! How does Mr. King do it? I believe he has a mind bubble in his own head whereby he can visit other Stephen Kings in alternate realities and  bounce ideas off of them(himself). There is no other explanation for his unending wellspring of spinal column charging stories. I can truly say that as a lifelong comic book fan and fan of such things as the Twilight Zone, this has become one of my favorite tomes of all time. Not embellishing. I couldn't stop reading it and finished very quickly. Then I was angry that I finished! I wanted to find a doorway and reset so that I could read it again without knowing what would happen! Also, I found myself falling in love with Sadie just like Jake did. I don't think that has ever happened before. Thanks Mr. King for a wonderful story that will live in my memory for a long time!
B0055SWM08|5.0|So fun. Can not stop playing.  A must have game on your phone or mobile device.  Be careful it is very addictive.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This fits fantastic on my Britax B-Agile stroller. I am very pleased with the quality. The Velcro is very sturdy. I can easily put two drinks, a bottle, and cell phone in this tray. I also love that it is fabric and flexible so it condenses when I fold my stroller. Great product.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it to read to me aloud with the kids. They like his expression when he reads aloud. I love using this app on my kindle fire and it helps me when I need to renew my mind with the word.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I like bakery story better but this is a really nice game too.  I feel like the pace of the game is a little slower than bakery story too.  It gives you more repetitive directions too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the best app I have ever downloaded there is tons of games and each is extreamly fun I love it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fairly entertaining game... better than most games like it i. e. frontier city definitely worth a play especially since its free
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hooked by the first couple of pages! It's entertaining, sexy, funny, and oh so romantic... *sighs* I went a whole day without sleeping, called in sick to work.. The book was THAT good. To me anyway. Love love love it!!!!!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like it! Doesn't crash, doesn't seem to infest my machine with malware though it is part of a larger network. Very enjoyable and well done. Kudos!
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome game on the kindle fire... lots of fun. I paid for this app before it was app of the day. there is another version available that is fun too
B000NA28I4|4.0|Good movie but not great.  It follows along with the book a little but varies in key ways.  Of course directors have to have creative license while adapting a book for the big screen but I felt that they fell short of the true potential with this movie.  My 10 year old son loved it but it could have been so much better.  The acting left something to be desired and the story line lacked the development that it truly needed to help draw you in.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great cover.  It adds needed protection for my Kindle Fire, is nice looking and converts into a stand when needed.  I would<br />definitely recommend this product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|worth it indeed. glad I got it . a little touchy. on the controls however not hard to get the hang of it.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|The sleeve for my kindle protected it very well. Sometimes what you see online isn't very durable.  It is very durable and worth the price.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I've heard cuts from various albums by The Decemberists for many years.  For some reason I kept thinking that, as much as I enjoyed those cuts, the albums wouldn't live up to my expectations.  Wrong!  Bought this one about 3 weeks ago and it's been in my car stereo constantly since.  Good stuff.  Plus, anyone who can use \\"panoply\\" in a rock song is OK with me.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Bad focus, not always reconoced me,i don´t use actualy, don´t like the purchase . . . . . . .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game to goof around with. too bad you need energy to do every thing and it runs out too fast &quot;
B002HWRYJE|4.0|As a long-time Star Trek fan, loving the original series, liking the Next Generation, Voyager, and Enterprise, and completely overlooking DS9, I was very skeptical about an original series re-make.  I must say, though, that this film did not disappoint.  The casting for this update was truly great, and in true original series fashion, the interaction between the characters makes the movie.  As for the plot, again, the long-time Star Trek fan will not be disappointed.  The writing staff gives nod to the original series but frames the new story in such a way that the new adventures do not clash with the original story.  This is not the typical \\"old series makeover\\" that has become so popular in recent times.  A definite good addition to any Trekkie's collection!
B005XOPEOU|3.0|Good album.<br />Great price.<br />The rest of this review is an effort to satisfy the reviewing rules.<br />That is that.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game certainly does resemble Mario however it does have its differences such as the ability to throw pinecones and such...............I give it three stars due to the fact that it does have adds which occasionally pop up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Has every version you can think of, multiple languages, audio, notes, bookmarks, sharing, best app available, oh and it's free!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Well it's a fun game and I made mines a drag queen Lol. It's a great family game but I'm glad I downloaded this when it was free.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so far I'm really loving this game. just worried about getting to the point where I would have to use my own money in order to proceed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you like fun get this app. Great Job creator I got it an hour ago and I haven't put it down yet
159562015X|1.0|Most development books, provide some grain of wisdom.  Not a lot of wow momemnts, but for the most part they have one or two thoughts that while not ground breaking or new, make you look at something in a different light and help you focus on something.  Not this book.  This book is a collection of 'strengths'  Each of these chapters on strengths has a vagueness worthy of any gypsy fortune teller.  You are analytical, you like to figure things out or help people figure things out, or like to have people show you things, or......<br /><br />The book comes with an online quiz to identify your strengths.  Even if you click neutral on almost every question, you'll still get 5 strengths idenified.  Then after completing your quiz you get the opportunity to get additonal analysis about your 'strengths'<br /><br />Save yourself the money and 1/2 an hour of your lift and skip this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|addictive game reminds me so much of super Mario bros I love it get it you wont be disappointed at all
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a very fun game that a lot of people ealspecially if you are over the age of 5. it is amazing
B000GT7XXW|1.0|here is the review on the movie Hamlet. The video quality is  poor, had to watch it in small view. sad
B007PTJOV0|5.0|leps world is a great game. it is also really fun and easy to controll. leps world also relates to the popular game super mario. kids of all ages will love this game. before you ask. yes gramps will also love this game !
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I found out about Defending Jacob via a review in People magazine. I ordered the book for my Kindle. I could not put it down once I started reading it. A well written book that leaves you guessing each page. Shocking ending, never saw it coming.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Very much ahead of its time.  Excellent. Great special features on the BluRay.  Transfer for BluRay is great. A Science Fiction must-have collectible.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great way to past the time<br /><br />great way to past the time. play while watching Tv during commercials!! love it I have it on my kindle and iphone
0345803485|1.0|I am currently on the 3rd book and I am uterly annoyed. I do not know how many more times I can read the words, \\"Mrs. Grey, Mr.Grey,I like defying you, damn or jeez,behind (seriously, say A**!), gasped, murmured...etc.\\" The language is so annoying! I have skimmed the past 30 pages because I already know what they are going to say! I seriously know when I pick the book up, I will read, almost immediately, \\"Don't bite your lip, you know what that does to me.\\" \\"Hmmm, I moan, I do,\\" or ,\\"Have you eaten yet today?\\" UGGG!! LAME!!! I find myself yelling at the book. Ha!<br /><br />As if the language wasn't bad enough, we have to read about their over abundant sex life. We get it, they have a lot of sex that seems to last a mere 2 minutes and at that, she comes \\"undone\\" or \\"explodes\\" around him every time. Now as a woman, I can say that is not true, at all. I find it hard to believe the author has a big \\"O\\" everytime she has sex...if she does, she should write a \\"how to\\" and not an \\"errotic\\" novel at which I use the term loosely as it lack any erroticism. I also can not get over the fact that they do it like 6 times a day...no way.<br /><br />There is another word for Christen...stalker; lock that creep up.<br /><br />I am only going to finish the book in hopes that one character dies or something because they seriously irritate me to no end. I have never written a review on anything, but after reading the same paragraph 400 pages in a row (and 3 books at that), I had to...Hopefully I will spare someone from reading these. Watch some porn, you will get a better thrill.<br /><br />-Uttterly Annoyed
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved this game when I was a kid. it's a little different now but still a great game. Wish it was totally free to play.
031603441X|5.0|thanks, recieved book VERY FAST !!!!!!!  Great book for one of my \\"HEROS\\".  Strange hero I know but I just love him, have for 40 years !!!! Always get concert tickets on right side of stage up close .
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great fun. Entertainment that last for hours. I hope they make a sequel to this one! Great for kids too.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lots of fun, smooth controls, fairly addictive from the get go, and free..... me likely bouncey. download it today or you are a total square of the utmost stupidity
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot! its really fun just like mario and not too hard. though of course I die sometimes for stupid reasons, I still love this game (: oh lep, youre so silly.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I'm not a fan of foreign film or any kind of \\"artsy\\" film in general. I like movies where things blow up, killers with hockey masks wield machete's, or elves, dwarves, and men take on the ultimate evil from Mordor. Not to mention the boy who lived, the one who must take on Mr. Smith, or heroes in spandex.<br /><br />So when my arm was twisted to watch this movie, I wanted to hate it. I frowned and nearly threw a tantrum prior to cueing the movie, but I'm glad I watched it!<br /><br />This movie was awesome. No explosions, no heroes, and no horcruxes or elves, but funny, full of charm, and capable to convert even the most ardent slasher film nut into a fan.<br /><br />I can't imagine a soul on Earth who wouldn't like this movie once they make the decision through choice or force to watch.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|This book is one of the best attempts yet to explain a very complicated subject.  With the exception of those who are completely brainwashed by religious dogma to the point of being completely blind, this book is a wonderful 'not to scientific', yet still detailed account of how our universe probably came into existence.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read the entire blog entry here: [...]<br /><br />I'll admit, I didn't finish the book. Not only was the story just all wrong, the writing was horrible and very juvenile. The conversations felt forced and really lacked substance. The characters felt very immature to me and were so flat that I didn't care for any of them. I was bored and never felt any attraction between Christian and Ana. I only knew there was one because the author kept pointing it out to me.<br /><br />The story, as a whole, was ridiculous. First, if you have the flu, you find someone on the magazine staff to go interview the guy, not your roommate who has no experience. Second, Christian repeatedly tells Ana that he is no good for her and to stay away from him. But, then he stalks her. He follows her and sends her gifts. Talk about a mixed message. And don't get me started on the whole drunk Ana scene. That was over the top. After she gets drunk and throws up on him, he takes her to his house far away and presents her with a non-disclosure contract. Wait, what? You see, he is into BDSM and wants it to be their little secret. This comes out of the blue seeing as how he has only kissed her like once in the elevator. He wants her to be his sub and tells her there will be no emotion behind it. She agrees after reading a ridiculous set of rules. Then comes the surprise... wait for it.....She is a Virgin. Of course she is and, of course, no one has EVER made her feel remotely sexual until now. No problem, he will just pop that cherry in a gentle, kind way, but after that it's all Dom/sub and I only want to sleep with you and I will be mean to you.<br /><br />At this point I stopped reading. I couldn't take it anymore. I especially had no interest in trying to read through three books with this theme running through it. I'm not really sure why this book is getting so many good reviews. But, I guess to each his own, right? IMHO, if you want to read erotica, there are SO many better authors out there to start with such as Lori Leigh, Shiloh Walker, and even Anne Rice's early erotica was better than this book.eigh, Shiloh Walker, and even Anne Rice's early erotica was better than this book.

0670023329|4.0|This is the story of Shin Dong-Hyuk, a 26 year old man who was born inside Camp 14. This is a camp that holds political prisoners and as it is a `no exit' camp; all of the sentences are life. Those in the camps have no rights and in many respects have already had a death sentence passed on them, but the timing is less fixed.<br /><br />Some of the prisoners are allowed `award marriages', all congress of a sexual nature is banned; the penalty for infraction is death. The penalty for most infractions is death actually, or torture, forced starvation, severe beatings and miserable work. Everyone has to work, what ever their physical health and if you fail to meet your work quota then you have your meagre rations cut. Public executions are mandatory attendance and Shins earliest memory is having been at one. He is the product of an `award marriage', and as such him and his brother will be born, live and die in the camp. They too will have to atone for the sins of the parents.<br /><br />He is taught to trust no one, to snitch on everyone and to be loyal only to the guards. The camps are the only places where photos of `The Dear Leader' are not compulsorily on display at all times - this is to re enforce that they are outside society. Hence their knowledge of the country, politics and even food is parlous to non existent. They are kept separate from the children of prisoners who have been on the outside. In short it is a living hell and then something happens that makes it even worse and is the catalyst for change in Shins pitiful life.<br /><br />This story has been told by Blaine Harden (Washington Post reporter) after numerous interviews with Shin. He has done a magnificent job or relaying the true story with amazing details and references for cross corroboration where ever possible. There is a really useful bibliography at the back for further reading. This is also an extremely accessible book and one which I found hard to not want to know more.<br /><br />It is split into three parts and the third dealing with trying to adapt to life as a free man and in many ways that is as hard as the actual escape for reasons that were a surprise to me. Blaine Harden has done extensive research for this and tried to keep as much of himself out of the book as possible, but that was always going to be difficult. Whilst I was totally absorbed with this book it was because of the story and not necessarily the writing, so even though I can highly recommend it is just not quite the five stars. Anyone interested in Korean history ought to read this at least once and I doubt even with fore knowledge of that regime that you will not be moved by Shin's story.into three parts and the third dealing with trying to adapt to life as a free man and in many ways that is as hard as the actual escape for reasons that were a surprise to me.

0765324849|5.0|I began to read the prologue and was instantly hooked, but sadly I am very busy this season, so I cannot spend much time reading it. If you are a fan of The Bioshock series (like myself since the 1st Bioshock) then you will love this book, if you have never heard of (or played The Bioshock series) you will love it, and if you dislike The Bioshock series - you do not know what you are missing. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|enjoy playing. great game for passing some time.<br />a worthwhile free game for sure. best thing is that I can only do so much before a recharge so I can look forward to playing tomorrow
B00007GZR5|5.0|I had originally bought this for my mother for her birthday, but I ended up watching it more than her!  The film is very existential, and it makes one think about life. For more information, I would watch a trailer of the movie on YouTube. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is the best free app of the day ever I have never seen a more fun game!!! over all sweet game.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I have seen this movie many of times, and it still sends me back to the 16th century.  With the brilliant acting skill of Kate Blanchet and the awesome direction of Shekhar Kapur one lives the history of Elizabeth, and her Golden Age - I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the coolest game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love the new look for the birds and other stuff!!I don't care if it's only two worlds because I really really really love angry birds!!!people please get this game it is cool.;) ;)lol

B007BVOEPI|3.0|TV show is great.  I enjoyed reading the book and really enjoyed watching it on TV.  The Instant Video Service was VERY disappointing.  The image quality was terrible--and it was not due to my computer or internet connection.  I frequently use Netflix on the same computer without any image quality issues.  Also very disappointing is the inability to share the content with friends and family members.<br /><br />I will not be using this service again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun and cool graphics and sound.  It isn't annoying with review reminders, yes it asked once after I played for 20 min but that's not bad.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like Mario.  If you like Mario, you should get this game!  Love this game! And you can't beat free!
B0052GACNM|4.0|Tony Bennett takes us to dark lounges, intimate crowds and well chosen tunes that have stood the test of time and Tony; throughout the CD and related Video he is the teacher letting new talent try on 'cool' love songs.  Of course his session with Lady Gaga is the showpiece and you can hear Tony saying \\"I could do this all day\\" I think if the two came together for a full album, I could listen to it all day.

0871404133|5.0|I have not read this book yet (since I just ordered it), but have looked forward to reading it ever since I read that he was writing it.  I have read a number of Dr. Wilson's other books, including his auto-biography.  He always comes through as a very likeable person (i.e. not arrogant), but he is courageous also.  He is probably the only Harvard professor who was attacked by a mob of students who disagreed with his non-politically correct opinions. Dr. Watson's review is no surprise.<br /><br />So far I have agreed with everything I have read that he has written.  From what I have read in the reviews, this book confirms a lot of my own thinking on evolution.  I am proud to state that I met the man once at a speech he gave in Cleveland and actually spoke to him and shook his hand.  Down with Richard Dawkins!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I don't understand why this is called quell, it should be something like raindrop puzzle pro or something.<br /><br />Most everything about this game is perfect, so here's the part that's not, it's the UI. It takes FOREVER for the animations from the big window wall to the window or whatever that's supposed to be.<br /><br />But that's about it. This game is totes worth $1, even better free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's pretty cool! It's something you could totally kill time with. It will remind you of growing playing games. If you did.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|super fun, a great time killer. challenging but gets easier as you go on.... add mme as a neighbor when you get it:: purpleigloo

B0055SWM08|5.0|splendid interface, delicate puzzle design, and best of all, easy to begin, the BGM is above average, only one suggestion: integration with SNS so that game records can be saved online
B0055SWM08|5.0|Loved this on the kindle fire. Couldn't put the game down. Puzzles like this keep your brain sharp and Alzheimer's away. Need more like this. Even if you don't like puzzles this is great. I would have gladly paid for this game!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|superb graphics and a relaxing soundtrack make this my go to game when I just wanna relax after work....my only criticism is that it could be a bit more challenging
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was well worth reading although the final chapters were a bit of a stretch in the logic.  However, the movie version was not at all well done.  There was little continuity in the movie itself and many events were not at all explained.  That does not detract from the books which are usually much better in most cases and in this case also.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I have been thinking about buying this for a long time and now It's free! Challenging but simple. I really like it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really like this challenging puzzle game. Thanks for the free app Amazon; finally an app worth downloading.  Keep them coming!!!
B0000683DH|5.0|While fans may still (and likely always will) quibble about which of the franchise films is the best, the choices usually come down to three: the second, fourth, and sixth installments.  (Though I do think that part III is sometimes unfairly maligned.)<br /><br />\\"Wrath of Khan\\" gets my vote.  To my mind, \\"Wrath of Khan\\" contains nearly all of the best elements of `Star Trek': a perfectly balanced combination of adventure, wit, and drama.<br /><br />The interplay between the regular characters is spot-on here (chiefly between the lead trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, although Scotty and Chekov also get some pretty good screen time), and for one of the first times, the franchise characters are allowed a fuller humanity.  The subplots surrounding Kirk's estranged family, advancing age, and stalled career aspirations (highlighted in a marvelous early dialogue scene between Kirk and McCoy) help to root the drama in a genuine human story.  This is important, as the villain (and his story) is so operatic.<br /><br />That last note - my use of the term `operatic' to describe Khan - isn't a criticism.  Ricardo Montalban imbues the role with enormous degrees of passion and theatricality.  Another performer might have come across as over the top or cartoonish, but Montalban somehow manages to avoid that trap, making Khan a passionate, human character.  A villain, certainly, but an interesting one, and one whose motives are worthy of driving the movie.<br /><br />There is a wonderful scene - and one moment, in particular - that unfolds about 2/3 of the way through the film, and it clearly displays the film's primary charms.  It's the scene set in the Genesis cave.  Kirk and a significant female character share a genuinely human conversation about the challenges of middle-age - something almost unthinkable in the old series.  It's a fine scene that accentuates the original series' emphasis on character interplay.  And then, a few minutes later, comes that moment: an exchange between Kirk and Khan - Khan on his spaceship, and Kirk still in the Genesis cave. (Fans of the movie will likely know precisely which moment I'm alluding to.)  Montalban and Shatner both play the scene with passion; but then Shatner takes it up a notch, in a moment of deliriously entertaining, Shatner-esque passion that encapsulates the genuinely sincere, occasionally cheesy charms of this series at its best.<br /><br />Note: if you get a chance, watch the Director's Cut.  There's not a huge difference between the two versions (and alas, the Director's Cut isn't available on Blu-Ray), but the few added minutes do help to flesh out and explain a subplot involving Scotty.ween Kirk and Khan - Khan on his spaceship, and Kirk still in the Genesis cave.

0449011909|5.0|I have a long commute to and from work and actually look forward to it every day because I know how entertained I will be by this book series. I highly recommend it.
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|Hmmm.  Well, I liked the concept, at least. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with much else.<br /><br />Okay, perhaps that sounds unduly dismissive.  It's not all bad.  There are a couple of nice moments of action; and the cast - at least in concept - is good.  Gina Carano acquits herself respectably. The role does not require great acting of her (and is therefore likely a good first film role, one on which she can cut her acting teeth), and she is more than able to handle the physical demands that the role requires.  In that sense, she is the best performer in this movie.<br /><br />But as for the rest...  Sigh. The film is nominally director Steven Soderbergh's stab at genre storytelling.  Not a bad thought - at least not initially.  I like genre storytelling, and action movies; and if you happen to make a noir-infused action movie, all the better.  (Soderbergh seems to have been striving for the latter here.)  Better yet - in theory, again - Soderbergh isn't a stranger to genre moviemaking.  The Ocean's films, after all, are essentially glossed-up heist movies, and I enjoyed them to varying degrees.<br /><br />But this film doesn't work.  A good action film - even a slow-burn, noir-ish, `thinking persons' actioner like this one wants to be - should have a palpable sense of forward momentum.  Alas, this film never seems to build any.  Aside from Carano, the performances have a certain laziness to them; actors like Michael Douglas and Ewan McGregor sleepwalk through their roles.  Only Antonio Banderas seems to have any spark, but even then I'm not sure that it wasn't simply the same glimmer of charm that he always has.<br /><br />Finally, a caveat: except in rare circumstances, I'm still not sold on the overall look of films shot on digital cameras, as 'Haywire' has been. I know that digital may well be the future of cinema, but right now I feel that the format imbues the final products with a rather unfinished aspect; an end result that occasionally feels to me less like cinema and more like old fashioned video.  Soderbergh has been working with digital for some time now and so is better practiced at concealing this aspect than most, but there are still moments when I feel that 'Haywire' looks unpolished.ess like cinema and more like old fashioned video.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to read a book from my Kindle collection on my Android phone (AT&T Avail) and works just like a mini-Kindle Fire...I can turn the pages and enjoy short reads during waiting room visits or while traveling!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great Blu ray, excellent price, lots if features (Online)........ I saw T2 for the first time in 1992 at the cinema, and of course many times on TV... but thru this Blu ray, for the very first time i saw the movie complete with parts i've never seen before... it was like see it for the first time! Highly recomended!!!!.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple enough even I can play yet complex enough it makes me think. It also seems rather addictive. It must be as I CAN'T put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|But I already like it so much better. Not nearly as crowded and I'm not dealing with pop ups all the time. Really fun and that is always a plus!
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Simon and Schuster should be ashamed, there's no reason but greed that a 40 year old books paperback edition which should include things like production cost and shipping charges should be less expensive than a Kindle edition which has none of those things. The only excuse is the publishers greed.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love, love... LOVE Quell! When I'd received my Kindle Fire, this was one of my first few \\" Must Have Apps\\" but I couldn't find it for awhile. When it was available, it had a few issues with the K-Fire but, those seem to be all worked out now. Although, it is today's Free App of the Day, I had paid for my version. Today, it works flawlessly on the Kindle Fire!  For the low price of only .99, I feel, for less than a dollar in change, this fun & addicting puzzle app is worth every penny! I would gladly have paid more! It's one of my favorite \\"Go-To\\" game apps when looking to kill time while waiting either, in the car to pick up my kids or, sitting in the doctor's office for an appointment, etc.<br /><br />There are absolutely NO PERMISSIONS needed for this app! Once it is downloaded. & installed, you do not need Wi-fi or the Internet to play. :)<br /><br />I have found this unique puzzle game to be quite relaxing, (most of the time lol) with it's soothing music playing gently in the background. You can adjust the music & game sounds directly from the apps options. The colors & background graphics have somewhat of a calming effect on me. You may notice this as well in the opening & entry levels in the app.<br /><br />There is a Tutorial Game Mode that I strongly recommend first timers use until they feel conformable playing without it.<br />New puzzles will be unlocked with the successful completion of each current puzzle.<br /><br />Although Quell puzzles are not fast paced; you are given as much time as needed to strategically think through the process of solving each challenging puzzle without become overly frustrated. There are over 80 different puzzles & although every one is not entirely complicated, still, I have yet to master them all!<br /><br />My only complaint would be the regular NAGGING requests to review this app. Well, I've reviewed the app & I highly doubt the requests will stop.<br /><br />To the developers: I will happily update my review to 5* STARS * as soon as an update is released with the NAG SCREEN to REVIEW your app is REMOVED! These requests are NOT calming nor are they rekaxing. Adding a dozen or so NEW puzzles would be very cool, as well!  =)<br /><br />Overall Rating- 4*-StarsS * as soon as an update is released with the NAG SCREEN to REVIEW your app is REMOVED!

B006KX3GXO|3.0|this app was amazing!! Then one day I was trying to edit a pic and it wouldn't upload my picture onto there. And when I tried to get one off of facebook it wouldn't even load it! :P suckish
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun and easily addictive when u get past the begining. after that its fun and not all that bad
0439023521|5.0|You won't be able to put this book down.  Collins writes a fantastic story about a future world where children fight to the death for the amusement of the rich and powerful.  You will fall in love with Katniss and the other tributes you meet at the games. Very well written and I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun, simple, clean, challenging. There is a lot of variety in such a simple concept. But also very relaxing. Great time waster.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I found this game to be challenging but not aggravating. The music gives it nice peaceful vibe too. A good way to fill the void while waiting in line too.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|I don't know what people's problem is with this movie. It was very good. It's tons better than the sequel and Immortals. The effects were great and it was as fun as I expected it to be. It's far from a masterpiece but so is the original. People praise the original to high heaven. As a kid, I loved it. I'm not a kid anymore. While original childhood favorites hold a special place in my heart like Flash Gordon for example, I'm not blinded by the fact that they get dated by modern standards. To say the original is better than this would be like saying the original King Kong was better than Peter Jackson's. Seriously? I think not. Clash should have been longer but people complain about 'long' movies too. When 2 1/2 hours is 'long' to people, that's pretty amazing. You get a more thorough story and movie. I don't think many know what they want at all. I'll watch this again. I have no real gripes here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I resisted-thinking these were adolescent type books--but once you start reading you are hooked! Now I have to read the series.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS.  IT HAS BEEN VIEWED SO OFTEN THAT I CAN'T COUNT THE TIMES I HAVE SEEN THIS WITH GRANDCHILDREN.  TODDLERS REALLY ENJOY DORY AND MARLIN.
B00756GKBA|4.0|MDNA has something for everyone. It's,dance, pop, hip hop, electronica and beautiful  ballads. It takes you on a journey and is refreshing compared to all the mainstream junk out there. Just wish the radio would play these songs. Girl Gone Wild, I'm Addicted, Love Spent, Turn Up the Radio, Masterpiece, Falling Free, Beautiful Killer are my favs.  Gang Bang is good but I definetly need to see a great video for this.<br />Luv you MADGE.
B007C94QRK|5.0|I miss the Muppets!  Jim Henson's creativity lives on with the characters.  Lot's of smiles with a great big slice of cheese on the side.  It looks like that's what the writers were going for.  Great job.
B007918P1E|3.0|Hey if you're a fan of Epica because of Simone Simon's voice(and not so much the rest of the band) then you may be a bit annoyed with many of the songs on this album. Overall I thought that it was quite good, but several times just as I was beginning to really get in to a song, Simone seems to be interrupted by some mediocre growling.<br /><br />I'm also a big fan of \\"Amon Amarth\\" so I do appreciate growling vocals, it's just that I feel that sort of singing doesn't complement Simone's voice well at all.<br /><br />I've listenend to \\"Design Your Universe\\", both \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" and \\"The Classical Conspiracy\\" and although this is worth the purchase I do not like this album as much as DYU; like another person said Simone's voice does not soar as much. If you're looking for the whole Epica style and package, however, then that's definitely here.
B0055SWM08|4.0|They caught me when I was playing with one of those TouchPads at Office Depot and Quell was part of its bloatware suite. That (and Cordy) are the only two bloatware apps I've run in to on a device I've been playing with that I bought from the Market as soon as I got home.<br /><br />The visuals are nice, though nothing spectacular, and the music is of excellent quality leaving it as the only app on my phone without the volume muted.<br /><br />There's really not much replay value, but there are a fairly decent number of levels for a $0.99 game, and some of them are going to take a while to figure out unless you're Rain Man.<br /><br />They do try to sell you Quell: Reflect still, even if you already own it, but the annoyance has really dropped to an acceptable level.<br /><br />Same thing happens with a lot of games though, Cordy is constantly bugging me about Sleepy Jack even though it is installed, ad-free Rovio games are really just Rovio only ad games, pretty much the only things I've picked up that aren't trying to sell me something are indie games and hobby Linux ports.<br /><br />Sad that it's come to that, but Quell is definitely not one of the worst offenders, and it comes without micro-purchases or Feint.<br /><br />All in all I would say it is definitely worth the price, even more so if you're picking it up as the FAotD today, I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone and without reservation to everyone who enjoys puzzle games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire. The music is peaceful and it is a simple but a good challenge for the mind.

B0076D20E8|4.0|The movie was thought provoking and well done. We had some pixelation during it, so it was not a perfect viewing experience. Aside from that, we enjoyed the mix of history and fiction. My husband and I were so intrigued that we delved into the actual historical story! If you like Shakespeare, or are intrigued by the controversy, watch this movie. You won't regret it.

B0055SWM08|5.0|quell is a very simple, relaxing, yet challenging puzzle game. it is absolutely worth the 5 star rating it has. would be well worth the $.99 if i had not gotten it as faotd
B0042JTAI8|2.0|I couldn't get into it, very slow. I found the story or they it has been written quite difficult to get into it at all.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|WOW! Talk about a roller coaster. Hats off to Jamie for writing such a thrilling story that had me entertained and staying up till the early hours of the morning to finish. Travis and Abby's relationship screamed \\"Bound for Doom\\". Honestly these two had no concept of what a mature and healthy relationship should be. A lot of people had mentioned that this book was like a train wreck that you couldn't take your eyes off and they were so true. There was incessant fighting, temper tantrums, bouts of drunken jealousy and plain old immaturity. As much as I should have hated so many things about this book I couldn't help but keep reading. I'm telling you, it's like sugar coated heroine.<br /><br />The story was fast paced, raw and realistic. Throughout the book I kept thinking, my gosh stuff like this really does happen. OK, so not all colleges have secret fighting rings but you do have all the relationship drama, school gossip, frat parties and drunken fights. Basically any typical night in college unless you went to school at a convent. You really couldn't hate on the characters for their stupidity and immaturity because hats how we all were at that age. The secondary characters were as interesting as Abby and Travis. I absolutely loved Abby's BFF America. She was honest and loyal friend and definitely not scared to tell Travis when he's being a total jacka**. We also get to meet Travis' family and I can say that I loved his brothers. From what I've read online, McGuire is planning on at least one more book which follows one of Travis' brothers. If rumors are correct, this brother is less filtered than his younger brother which could make for a very interesting book.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster was exactly that, a beautiful disaster that I couldn't put down. Jamie McGuire's tale of two college students involved in a dysfunctional and tumultuous romance was highly addicting. The book should bare a warning stating , \\"THIS BOOK IS EQUIVALENT TO SUGAR COATED HEROINE\\". This book brought back so many fond memories of my college days including dorm life, attending frat parties, being boy crazed and binge drinking. Oh what I would do to be 19 again! I really can't express why I loved this book so much but if you're like me and like  men to be a little erratic and maybe crazy then you'll definitely love Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW MAY BE VIEWED AT [...]s book brought back so many fond memories of my college days including dorm life, attending frat parties, being boy crazed and binge drinking.

B006BQI1V2|2.0|The makers of Sarah's Key have attempted to weld a grim, powerful Vichy story with a present-day NYC love story.  They failed.<br /><br />In place of what should have been two separate movies we have this.  A compelling and well-acted WWII story intersperses (as is the directing fashion of the day) with flash-forwards depicting the decades-later collateral fall-out on the family and the ones who came after.  My gripes are with the unexplained motivations of key characters: Why did Sarah kill herself 20 years later? Hadn't she come to the states to begin anew? What about the poor truck driver? And on and on.<br /><br />Then we have Thomas's character and her marital discord. It really stretches credulity to cast her as a new mother, doesn't it? What?!? At least she has stopped her trademark excuses for acting: eye-rolling and making funny faces. Then, toward the end, Quinn appears with his jarring, mumbling screen presence, grinding the movie to a complete halt. He actually apologizes to viewers for his poundage!<br /><br />All this sad, fateful suffering to bring these two witless lugs together! What a movie.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I don't know if I am being too presumptuous but Slammed has to be one of THE BEST books I've read in a long time. There are books that I love but I LOVED this book. I downloaded if for my Kindle on a whim Saturday afternoon after reading one review and then proceeded to read and read for the rest of the afternoon and night. Losing precious hours of sleep didn't bother me one bit because staying up late to finish the book was sooooo well worth it. The realness and severity of the events that take place totally blew me away and I was crying, falling in love, smiling, gasping from shock and then crying again.<br /><br />What I loved about this book so much was seeing young adults step up, take responsibilty and actually having a conscious. My preconceived notion with all YA books is that all the books just focus on teens who are either selfish or are weak and stuggle with self-esteem. I forget sometimes that there are books out there that focus on young adults who deal with raw and real situations. It's nice to read a story about a girl who cares and loves her family deeply. A girl who doesn't instantly put the boy above all else (ok....Lake did have her weak moments but she bounces back and redeems herself). It was also nice to see a great male lead who was genuinlely kind, caring, responsible and showed a great amount of love for his own family. Will isn't perfect, he still has his bouts of jealousy and short-temperedness, but for a guy at his age, he's pretty swoon worthy.<br /><br />This review really can't even scratch the surface of what this book is truly about. It's hard to explain everything that happens without divulging too much of the plot. After reading Slammed it was hard to walk away without thinking about the heavy subjects that it touched upon. For a debut author, Colleen really made you think about what you as a reader would think or do if you were ever put in Lake and Will's position. I know that if I was ever in their situation at the age they were in I don't know if I would have been as strong and resiliant as they were. Hoover wrote a beautiful and incredible piece about love and life even with all the bad cards that life deals us with.<br /><br />READ THE FULL REVIEW AT [..]if I would have been as strong and resiliant as they were.

031617615X|2.0|I came to `Twilight' through the movies.  Intrigued, I decided to try the books and ended up firmly parked on the sofa as I devoured the series.  With the greater introspective detail, I liked Bella much more than in the films, and I looked forward to better understanding her insistence on continuing her pregnancy in `Breaking Dawn,' as well as Edward's immediate antipathy to the child.  Unfortunately, the book did not provide these details.  Bella is suddenly overcome by a need to have a baby.  In her own words: \\"I needed him (the baby) like the air I breathe.  Not a choice--a necessity.\\" Page 132. This was not a decision freely made after careful deliberation and consideration of options and consequences.  This was a compulsion.  Rather than having second thoughts as the pregnancy takes its toll on her, Bella holds firm to some indefinable belief that she will survive.  As disappointing as this revelation was, it was made worse by the fact that at no time does she acknowledge the risk to Edward.  She never seems to confront the terrible possibility that for one to live, the other might have to die.<br /><br />The book also leaves Edward's response unexplored. Why did he assume this unknown hybrid was a threat before there was any evidence that the pregnancy would endanger Bella's life?  Given the era in which his moral character was formed (and which required marriage prior to sex, which he insisted on), I wouldn't have expected Edward to favor abortion right away, but only after the danger to Bella was apparent. In a sense, his response is, like Bella's, more compulsion than actual choice.  Baby = danger= must do something.<br /><br />The whole crisis of the pregnancy doesn't bring Edward and Bella closer together or make them grow as characters.  Left wholly unexplored is the division it causes among the Cullen family.  The idea of a rift within their happy collective is fascinating and could have made a riveting plot twist under different circumstances.  But here, Meyer simply wanted a means to protect Bella from Edward's overzealous intentions, so she draws the lines and never looks back.  In reality, some of Bella's supporters might have reconsidered once they saw how the pregnancy threatened her, and by extension, Edward.  And surely someone would have brought up the lasting repercussions if Bella died.  Would the family have stayed together or would guilt and blame have split them apart?<br /><br />But this bleak scenario never materializes because everything works out in the end.  In fact, things work out a little too easily and conveniently.  Bella survives and begins her new existence as a vampire with none of the difficulties that readers had been led to expect.  Even if Bella's anticipation of the challenges made controlling her thirst easier, it would have been more satisfying if she'd had to work at it for a while.  She also seems to get the hang of her new strength pretty quickly.  I'd been looking forward to her accidentally ripping a few doors off their hinges or putting her foot through the car floor trying to brake.  If that wasn't enough, we also learn that she has a powerful ability that saves the day in the showdown with the Volturi.  It's all just a little too much.<br /><br />Renesmee turns out to be the perfect baby--no mention of poopy diapers, incessant crying, or waking up in the middle of the night to interrupt Bella and Edward's now risk-free expressions of affection.  And after the initial shock, Charlie takes the whole business of werewolves and vampires in stride.<br /><br />As for Jacob, he finally moves on--by imprinting on Renesmee.  Instead of working through his attachment to Bella and finally letting her go as a result of emotional growth, he simply transfers his devotion to her daughter. Now he can stay in Bella's life without feeling pain.  Judging from assorted comments in these reviews, this isn't the sort of solution that fans wanted for him, and I agree.<br /><br />We all want a happy ending for characters we've grown to love, but there is a satisfaction in watching them grow as we follow them through various struggles.  We don't see that happening in `Breaking Dawn.'  Instead, everyone stays the same while circumstances around them shift.  For this reviewer, it's a disappointing end to an otherwise enjoyable series.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I think all Whitney Houston fans were feeling a little \\"Whitney\\" during her sudden passing, when I received the \\"The Bodyguard\\" it was in Mint Condition. It came three days after I placed the order...Thanks again Amazon!
0937381888|5.0|I think it goes without saying that this book along with Charlie Papazian's book \\"The New Joy of Homebrewing\\" are among the best books for aspiring brewers. While Papazian's book is a great read, it is just a bit dated. I'd recommend reading it, but I'd also pick up this book for an updated and fresher look on how to brew your own beer. This book provides a very solid foundation for new brewers and if you follow the tips in this book you'll be certain to get off on the right foot when you begin brewing your own beer.<br /><br />Even if you've been brewing for a while, this book is still a great reference to keep around. From troubleshooting a bad batch to providing a refresher if you've taken some time off.<br /><br />It's an easy read, yet packed with information, so there's no reason not to buy this book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|wow i did not know that this app was so much fun and very cool I love it I'm going to play this app all the time
B000JIHP88|2.0|This mobile is way too heavy and big for my [[ASIN:B002HORL1I Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone]], which is by no means a flimsy crib. The whole thing feels top-heavy and leans towards the inside of the crib when installed. The clearance between the bottom of the mobile base and my 6.5\\" mattress is also less than the 7\\" minimum required according to product instructions. On top of that, the music is way too soft even on the highest setting. Therefore, the mobile is going back.
B003VANOFY|5.0|For start - I have never had a better fitting and better sounding headphones in my life.<br />Right out the box I was blown away by the build quality and I have been using them daily for the last 3 months and there is barely any wear noticeable.<br />Battery life - I would say that still I am averaging 5-7 hours of battery life, which is still very good.<br />Operational distance - I can walk out of my office wearing these and still get reception 30-40 ft away from my desk and through the walls (office walls, but still).<br />Sound quality - AMAZING...  and when you hit the surround sound button you will be blown away.  Literally will create a feeling that you are in a large room with speakers in every corner with multidirectional subwoofers...<br />BUY IT!!!

B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is challenging, but fun to play at the same time. The music is relaxing and goes well with the theme.<br /><br />Too bad I paid money for this when I could have gotten it for the faotd. Oh well. I'm glad that Amazon is finally steping up on the faotd, I think they finally took the reviewers advice. Good job Amazon.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Per Lino, \\"Worth grabbing.\\" I spoke with Lino about this free app of the day and he said \\"Worth grabbing.\\" thank you Lino for your insight.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Very nice puzzle. The music and colors are relaxing. Playing on easy mode gives enough of a challenge without it being nervewracking. Just what I need to unwind before I have to go to work. I'm looking forward to other levels and games by Fallen Tree Games.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is very much like super mario. But it is very very very fun. please make more updates! pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game works great on the fire.  Moves quickly and is one of the best solitaire games I have found!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great pick up and play game that actually makes me want to figure out how to perfect each level. Thank you Amazon for this free app! One of your best offerings.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I loved 3 of Brown's other novels, Angels,Davinci,and Deception, but this one fell a bit short.  Follows the same format as the others, which may explain my opinion...Maybe a bit tired of the template?  I struggled in disbelief that after undergoing extreme physical injury and trauma, the heroes happily plug along to the end after the climactic scene, when real folks would be in shock or ICU.  An interesting ending, which I actually liked...I wonder if Dan Brown researched Christian Science before writing the book...in conclusion, not bad, but in the current world of very good $0.99 indie authors, I would recommend searching free and low cost e-book shelves.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is simply amazing  great gameplay that keeps your spidey senses tingling. Don't waste your own time and get this game now!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|children of the 80's had a little video game called Mario...you may have heard of it....this is as good as it gets without infringing. on nintendo copyrights
B001AKTZPA|5.0|There are no bands today like CCR which is very sad. They were an alternative to hard rock and they made it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it really is you should get the game.  it is not a waste of time .please get the game. 5 stars is what this game need
B0055SWM08|5.0|Has kept me busy since the time I downloaded it.  Blah, blah, blah, yadda, yadda, yadda.  That is all folks.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome!  its just like Mario but a little more addictive. make sure you play when you have nothing to do because it will sick you in. super fun!
B004I744AS|4.0|This dictionary is an excellent resource with and without Wi-fi for my Kindle Fire. The games featured are fun and educational.  One thing to enhance this app would be to give an alternate list of words if the word entered is misspelled.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|This is virtuostic and melodic prog at its best. The combination of Hackett solo material and Genesis material works wonderfully. Two of the pieces are slightly reworked numbers from the Wind and Wuthering and Trick of the Tail albums - two of my favorites from the post-Gabriel and pre-80's period which featured some of their most beautiful and accessible pieces, while still being true to the prog genre. I would aver that the vocals on this album are even stronger than Gabriel's or Collins's.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not exactly what I expected having grown up with the original game, but its better then I thought it would be and is a fun game to play. definitely a keeper for me.
0345803485|5.0|Read it! The premise of the story made me apprehensive, but once I started I could not put it down! It rendered me useless for five days... During which I read all three books! It was an amazing, incredible, heart wrenching love story. Graphic?... Yes. Worth it? Absolutely!!!!! I am thinking about reading them all again. I read them so quickly because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. This was one of those books where everything went exactly as I wanted it to!! I am afraid that this book set an extremely high bar, and I am not sure how I will fun another book to captivate me so.
0345803485|5.0|This book is my favorite in the trilogy. If you are familiar with christian and anastasia, you will be looking to have some questions answered, and this book helps. I rooted for them in all three books, but found myself crying when they reached an impasse. was i really that involved? in fake people? i sure was!! and i feel there needs to be 300 more books about them because i will read every single one and cheer and cry and laugh along with them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series by far is the best series I have ever read. Yes, there's sex, and LOTS of it. It's graphic, it's shocking and it will make you blush. But you will not want to stop. The story sucks you in and at the conclusion of each chapter, you can't help but keep reading. I don'r re-read many books, but I will definitely be re-reading these!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game its so much fun...if your the type of person who likes games you can grow in levels and you like to play cronically this is your game i love it!!!
B0055SWM08|3.0|I think some of the levels are way to hard and its dumb that we have to give coins to find the answers
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like it because you made just like new super Mario bros and that you made it super easy to play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I watch the bible network and follow with he bible app. It a great pleasure to view on my cruz tablet.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a game I would say is just as good as super Mario bros. mabye even better. Just Amazing.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it starts off quickly and pulls you in with easy to learn controls and decent graphics. It has everything from hunting to building and item creation. The only downfall is I ran out of energy a lot. I would also rather just pay for a game than have items you have to buy. You can get by without spending money if you are patient.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Ihave had this game for a while now and it is addictive. This is so much better than the one on my desktop. I am using it on my Kindle Fire and it is flawless. Would highly recommend it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is great fun without getting out the old nes. can't wait for Lep 3 to see what they turn him into to fly.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun fun fun!!  just like I remember.  Very addictive.  Music is a bit much but overall a great game.  Well done.
B0055SWM08|5.0|There's not much to say this game is great, graphics are a wonder and it's almost calming to play... great game..
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I just loved this movie, have watched it over and over again several times. Received as promised always pleased with any purchases so far.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I played the original at school when I was a kid and I thought I would give this a try.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|Great series husband loves it great for the sci fi collector,good story line and overall very satisfied with amazon. quick service have purchased many products haven't had any problems with tapes or deliveries
B007SSEGNO|5.0|As always, good story, good characters, and just a feeling of family. Just love the honesty and care between characters.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|For multiple \\"to do\\" lists, shopping lists, project lists, so forth, this has turned out to be a great app.  It works on my android phone, my iPod and Ipad, and right out of any web browser.  This ability to work on each device in sync has proved invaluable to myself.  And it's free!
B0002FR0TC|1.0|I was extremely dissapointed when I received my product...not only did it take 3 weeks to arrive..when i tried to watch it, I didn't work. I tried the product in several televisions..nit just my own , and it still didn't work. Never ordered from amazon, thinking it would be a dependable site  but ill be sure not order from here again.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|4 1/2 stars.<br />\\"Bared to You\\" by Sylvia Day is the wrenchingly emotional erotic tale of Eva Tramell who gets involved with the sensual and privileged Gideon Cross in a complex and often disturbing relationship.  Both have tortuous backgrounds that cause them to be emotionally damaged but they are drawn to each other even as they become entangled in the epitome of a dysfunctional relationship.  Their on-again, off-again dance of sexual need and rejection forms the basis for this Crossfire novel which plays out both at work and in social venues such as charity fundraisers.  Eva is quick to feel rejected and insecure while dealing with the often overpowering and arrogant Gideon and neither is adept at communicating true feelings.  Complicating matters is Cary Taylor, Eva's roommate, confidante and former therapy cohort, who seems to be on a path of self-destruction and dysfunction himself even as his professional career seems to be ascending.  All three of these damaged people must refrain from hiding their feelings by engaging in mindless sex and open themselves up to the vulnerability to placing their trust in another person.<br /><br />An intense tale filled with carnal encounters that initially are used to assuage mutual lust but soon develop into a tenuous relationship between two insecure people.  The frequent misunderstandings and attempts at reconciliation that usually involve the purchase of extravagant gifts and steamy make-up sex make this a very rocky relationship.  Eva is having troubles with her own relationships but feels obligated to find a way to deal with Carey's issues as well due to their shared backgrounds.  There is no true resolution of any of the conflicts, just a temporary bandage on some serious issues that must be faced and dealt with, theoretically in the next book.  A steamy and emotional read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's very easy in the beginning but it does get harder as you progress. Overall I think its a great casual puzzle game
B0021L8UPS|4.0|*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br />Yes, this is another \\"Bad Seed\\" movie, as I've noticed critics of the movie have complained. But I liked it. I thought it had enough twists to set itself apart. Make sure, however, that you don't miss the original [[ASIN:B00027JYNK The Bad Seed]] from 1956. That one's the best.<br /><br />Parts of the movie were predictable, of course. It's obvious from the beginning that the bad things happening are probably because of Esther, the orphan, even though we don't actually SEE her doing anything at first. After all, doesn't it say \\"There's something wrong with Esther\\" right on the cover of the movie?! Then of course, there's the wife who suspects something and the husband who rationalizes away all her fears. And everyone who gets too close to knowing gets hurt. Very typical.<br /><br />What we don't know is WHY Esther is this way. And actually, that never really becomes clear. You would think if Esther could finally just find a family to stick with, maybe she could have somewhat of a normal life. After all, this family cared about her, and if people hadn't been dropping like flies, no one would have investigated. Anyway, we find out that Esther is really a grown woman with dwarfism. It was a plot twist I was not expecting, but it explained everything. And it was sad. Like I said, it didn't really explain why Esther was the way she was. She couldn't change her past, but no one was looking for her. She could have moved on.<br /><br />The best part about the movie was the acting. I was beyond impressed with Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther. When a 12-year-old can pull off a part like that... well, that's just natural talent. She sure has not had much time for training. Too many young actors and actresses these days seem to get parts just because they're in the right place at the right time, or they're related to someone. And then their talent involves taking their clothes off. (We will hope she doesn't go that way.)<br /><br />The only bummer was the end. While it was well-acted, I was thrown off by her being such an old hag! She was seriously ugly. They cannot expect us to believe she turned that face into a sweet 9-year-old girl with a little bit of make-up every morning. They probably needed 3 hours of make-up just to age Isabelle in the opposite direction! Geez, most women can barely make themselves look 5 years younger with makeup. I think a making-of featurette would have been nice, but there were no special features at all. Maybe they realized they overdid the makeup and didn't want to draw attention to it?was the end.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. kids of all ages could play this its worth the download. so what are u waiting for press download.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was looking for a game that I could play while watching Tv with my friends that wasn't too distracting but still interesting enough to play. this is it. lots of fin and quite challenging. glad to see it as a fotd
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm amazed that this game is today's free app. its an incredible game. if you missed it for free today, don't hesitate to buy it instead. its worth every penny.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game.  I have really enjoyed it so far.  Has a good pace and enough different stuff to keep you hooked for a while.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|app kills time. some of the games are fun. wish it wouldn't cost so much to unlock the other games.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I love this it is just as good as the 30 roller apps that do this I love it 4 stars only because furring some videos it glitches but besides that GREAT
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I Love the band, and I enjoy this album just as much as I always enjoy their albums. Great buy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|although I accidently miss tap sometimes (but that is my fault not the games) a rip-off of Mario? nah it only benefits to side-scrolling history.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I heard a lot of talk about Breaking Bad and finally started watching when season 4 was finishing. I watched 3 seasons on DVD but couldn't wait for the release of season 4 on DVD and had to order the Amazon instant video copy.<br /><br />We hooked up my wife's laptop to the HDTV with a HDMI cable and began to enjoy this gripping season of Breaking Bad.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston is masterful. The series has such outstanding performances and gripping storylines.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have looked through many ereaders looking for one to read comics and I found it. I highly recommend it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I never give reviews but I had to with this! It is a REALLY great game that is highly addicting and best of all I found it free! Really do reccomend it.
0345803485|3.0|I loved the storyline of this series but I was just annoyed with the writing. I found mistakes in the writing as well as too much repetition. Like another reviewer commented, every few pages they are having sex and it is all pretty much the same exchange just in a different setting. Halfway through book 2 I just skimmed over the sex scenes. They just werent exciting anymore. I do love Christians character - he definitely does have 50 shades to him - and I enjoyed learning who is is (and daydreaming) to the end. This series is romantic, sexual, intriguing, and thrilling. The writing just isnt great but I'm not a writer either.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game. its really simple and I can jump on for a few minutes here and there and then jump off.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Very addictive!!!!!!!!!! It has awesome graphics and the points add up fast 2 advance in levels.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome game.  its fun.  and my kids like it as much as I do.  very nice graphics and challenging game
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an excellent game.  Very addictive.  We have had it for about a month and I am still working on getting three stars on all the levels.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love the game. great game to play when bored. game is a one of a kind. work great on the tablet
1588167461|4.0|Overall, I think this is a very good book-especially if you're young and looking to improve your style like myself. I actually liked that most of the book is in black and white; it helps keep you focusing on the style and not the colors. The diagrams were extremely helpful, and many of the charts I think I'll keep and reference. Also-I rather enjoyed looking at famous \\"originals\\" that emphasize the style of the chapter.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like is that sometimes I felt that the writing was a bit snobbish, however the overall helpfulness of the book outweighs that.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Pardon the shortness of this review. I'm neither a wannabee or aspiring critic. Anyone can nick pick anything to death with a clever play on words and a little research.    Straight to the point: Bonnie Raitt the woman. The artist. The musician. The performer and road warrior is in excellent form while staying true to her roots. Whether it's a original or a reinterpretation. She will stand you up with her bluesy rockers and sit you down with her heart felt ballads as she always does. As a fine wine she is only getting better.    Another great road album from Bonnie Raitt. For any music lover who appreciates class and great music. This is a must have for your collection.    Purchase and enjoy!!!    __________________________________  Raul X. Garcia  Director/Producer  IFC Short Film of the Month Winner
B007PTJOV0|5.0|you will love this game! Graphics are good and game is just as addictive as Mario on nintendo. Good for all ages and the ads are not too aggravating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!!!  Would highly recommend! Can't wait to read book two and three! Easy read. Saw the movie, great too but love the book more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario great game. I can play for hours on end. one of the best games for my kindle.
0385534639|4.0|Something different!  I had read Water for Elephants and liked the circus theme, so thought to try this book.  It's really great, on a different level.  Would recommend it for anyone looking for something new to read!
B006PTZNSY|3.0|i brought the cd today its not the greatest album but its ok i have the deluxe edition with the extra tracks its ok
0307949486|5.0|This was a great book, with a very interesting plot and less than traditional characters.  I enjoyed author's set-up, although the beginning dragged, slightly.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Such a great game! I just bought it and I can't stop!  it has beautiful calming guitar music and it is over all very enjoyable.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Seriously, this is old-school Super Mario Bros. on your Kindle Fire! The best mobile game I've played on iOS or Aneroid!
B0055SWM08|5.0|enjoying every puzzle and every level.  think before you touch.  almost like golfing in trying to birdie at each puzzle.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter(10) and I both read these books and went to see the movie too. I could not put down the book and wanted to read the first one before we went to see Hunger Games. I loved them both and am probably going to read the series again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great boredom buster for adults! Fun and challenging and the sound does not have to be on, so that is nice. My 4 year old will probably enjoy figuring it out as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy this type of time management game, however I have no desire to always have to have &quot;friends &quot; or &quot;neighbors &quot; or to pay to complete goals.
B004N66XYE|4.0|After watching the original series, this second version I was left hanging, I was hoping there are more but just the same it's alright. I missed Rose, the parlor maid.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game. it works well and looks good on the Fire. its simple and a fantastic time waster.

B0055SWM08|5.0|it is a really fun game, good if you need to kill some time, not too easy not too hard, a recomendable game
1451627289|5.0|I started reading this novel on a flight from Melboune to Perth (Australia)and finished it in two sessions. I can barely fault the narrative and the the story was gripping. I haven't read all of King's book but have read several including the Dark Tower series, that I also rate highly. The detail, and moreso, the attention to detail, was most impressive. I believe that this author does not take his audience, or his following, for granted. A great read for all
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I love the show and in reading the books I can picture the characters. The book was suspensful and humorous too. I read all three books and hope there will be a 4th soon!
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Great story line, great character development and good chemistry among the cast members. One of the best baseball movies I've seen. Ranks up there with The Natural and Bull Durham. Excellent movie.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This season 1, is as riveting as the books. I loved the stories. The nudity was a shock. I liked this series very much.
B0058VA2U4|4.0|I've got to admit, I've never been a huge Joey Belladona fan and always liked Anthrax better with Bush, but...this album rocks!  And, I've got to further admit that I really like Belladonna's singing on this, it goes great with the songs on here.  I almost feel like the fact that his voice has aged and doesn't hit the high notes like it used to is a good thing.  He's tougher sounding, yet still very melodic which works incredibly well with the songs on this disc, especially 'I'm Alive', 'Fight 'em till You Can't', and 'The Giant.'<br /><br />I was really hoping Bush would come back to the fold, but I certainly can't complain with how this album sounds.  I may now finally be able to fully enjoy Anthrax regardless of who's singing which, in my opinion, is a good thing.  I would highly recommend this album to all fans of heavy metal and/or thrash metal, and rate it as a MUST HAVE for all Anthrax fans.  Play it LOUD!
0470449748|4.0|Printing quality is good. Good delivery packaging. The content is useful. Just received it today and will go through it later to provide better review of this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is much like other maneagement games, but it seems to have a few new twists. I like the fishing challenge, and running around shooting at the wild game that runs out of the woods. The only annoying thing is that while you're running around completing tasks, the others in town are just standing around making suggestions.
0812992792|4.0|As someone who has developed an almost morbid curiosity with North Korea over the past couple of years, Adam Johnson's novel did a great job of bringing what precious little we know about the inner workings of the Hermit Nation and the cult of personality that surrounded the late Kim Jong-Il to life. The story is engaging, exciting, suspenseful, and well written. It does a great job of instilling in the reader the sense of hopelessness and dread that must be felt by countless North Koreans knowing that every fiber of one's very existence is determined, controlled, and can be taken away at any moment by the state.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I read this for a book club and was totally drawn in to the main character - her strength but mostly her fears and vulnerability that come from the lack of having a safe harbor called 'home'.  I just couldn't put the book down and am looking forward to more from Ms. Diffenbaugh.  Thank you for showing me another side to humanity and the importance of unconditional familial love.
0307593312|3.0|This is a monumental work - more self conscious than some of his earlier writing. There are pages of brilliant imagery, but it also muddles along and can drag. It would be an excellent book if it were 700 pages instead of ~950. This is case where a good editor could really help.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Someone wrote that you can't upload multiple files at once with the free version. That is incorrect. You can. There's an option to do just that. I use it all the time. This is a great service - and I only have the free account! The only problem I have with this is that uploads are limited to 100 meg at a time for the free account. If you have the paid account the limit rises to a larger size (I think remember what).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Installed on my Kindle Fire and my BlackBerry Torch. Both are easy to navigate through the Bible. Enjoying the reading plans they offer ad well.  Decided to read through the Bible Chronologically this year. Every day they send me the daily reading. I was surprised the day they suggested to me to use the audio NLT version. It's a wonderful addition to my Bible reading: different voices in conversations, a hint of music in just the right places. YouVersion is very responsive to User issues and questions as well. Highlight verses, share readings, use bookmarks take notes.  All this for FREE. Absolutely the best deal you can find for versatile Bible study and reading.
B00632HWOG|1.0|They added ads that slow mail, and takes up a third of screen. Horrible. App was decent but now worthless. Moving primary account to gmail.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|My kids loved this movie and have watched it several times. The story is funny and there are clever jokes for all age ranges, including adults.<br /><br />The 3D on the movie is above average. We saw the movie in 3D at the theater and while it's not quite as good, it is worth the difference in price from the standard blu-ray. The best 3D scene however is not even part of the movie. The blu-ray contains a preview for Madagascar with a pillow fight. It looked so really that my kids were actually trying to grab the feathers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is sooooooooo addicting and fun to play. I always let my little sister play it with her friend
0545265355|5.0|On hearing the buzz about the upcoming movie and seeing friends on Facebook commenting on how good the books are, I decided to check out these books.  On picking up The Hunger Games I found it really easy to get into and quickly got caught up in the whole adventure and was unable to put it down and have found that for all three books. They are very well written, creative and imaginative and yet not too far fetched - very believable and relatable.<br />I just now finished the third book and wow is all I could say... perfect ending.... fantastic stories... absolutely love this series, everything works and is so perfectly created and put together. Highly recommend it for all ages! I'm in my thirties and love it.<br />Bought this hardback edition in the card case also and it's sooo nice.  Glad I have hardbacks to last longer as these books are keepers!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Better than the original. I am hooked on the game. lots of fun and isn't asking you to buy stuff at every click. highly recommend to anyone looking for a good game.
B005N0PJJO|1.0|I heard a news story about how these books were taking women by storm and how great they were. So, being one to dive right in, I ordered all three. I read a little of the first one and it is truly terrible. The quality of the writing and the plot are so sophomoric and unrefined, I refuse to read such drivel. Sorry, but I hated it and have no idea what the hype is all about.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I bought this book at a time when my golden retriever, Beau, was coming to the end of his life. We knew the time was coming when we would have to make the decision to put him to sleep, but we were all in denial. For our own selfish reasons, we didn't want to let him go. Life without him was unimaginable. After reading this book and passing it on to the rest of my family, we knew the right thing to do. Like Enzo, Beau was trying his very hardest to hold on for US, but we had to let go for HIM.<br /><br />If you are or know anyone who having a difficult time with putting an older pet down, please please please read this book and pass it on.<br /><br />And by the way, we did end up getting another golden retriever shortly after we lost Beau and we named him Enzo :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so much fun cant stop wish it was not so addicting even my kids enjoy it asmuch as i do.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I love this product!! It was well engineered and built with quality materials and equipment. On my PS3 with a Blu-Ray it will do 1080p. And it is beautiful! There is absolutely nothing about this product that I don't love. It's nice to know that every now and then somebody gets it right! I did quite a bit of online research about this before I bought it sight unseen. That's how confident I was from reading all positive, glowing reviews about it. I also watched an interview with John Smith, one of GAEMS' executives and was really impressed with what I heard. I took it by my local Gamestop and walked up to the manager and said \\"do you know what this is?\\", he said no, but I think I want one. Whe I opened it up his eyes got big and he said, I will have one of these! LOL. I told him I was pretty sure Gamestop will soon be selling these babies. I am taking mine on a 10 day cruise on Celebrity in the Mediterrnean in October. Oh yes. BTW, I am 54 and am still having fun. You young whippersnappers, I am the guy that just got yout dogtags and was the top player in the game. Old guys rule! PS - As far as the price? Well worth it! Good stuff ain't cheap and cheap stuff ain't good. Trust me I have many years of experience as a consumer to back it up. Who knows, if you are lucky you'll live to be my age. Good luck.
1451627289|5.0|Jake Epping, a 35-year old high school teacher, is asked by hamburger concession owner Al to go back in time to stop president Kennedy from being assassinated. Al has found a portal to the past in his store room. He is too ill himself to make any more journeys into the past (although he's been there many times) and so he hopes Jake will do this for him. Every trip, however long it takes in the past, only lasts two minutes in the current time.<br /><br />Before he makes up his mind, a mature student tells him about a horrific incident in which his father killed most of his family. Jake decides to interfere in this incident which happened in 1958, the year that the portal leads to.  Then he waits until 1963 to try and stop the Kennedy assassination. But while waiting, he falls in love.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot. I loved the 1950s feel. It was clear that King had spend time researching the details to make this a convincing story.<br /><br />The first 100 or so pages were a bit slow, but then the story took off. There were some slow bits in the middle too. At least, Jake spends several years seeking out Lee Harvey Oswald and making plans to stop him from murdering Kennedy. This I found a little boring at times. Too much focus was given on this. I enjoyed the love story with Sadie much more.<br /><br />The book felt a bit disjointed at times because of the different story lines. The result of Jake's visit to the past was surprising and could maybe have been expanded on a little more.<br /><br />But overall, this was a very good read with a great feel for the time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I keep coming to the Amazon free app of the day just to get disappointed. Not this time, though. This game is simple, yet beautiful, gorgeous and challenging.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|My girlfriend and I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is a must see. Its a shame that things like this and worse happened in the past.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book is a compelling read. Refreshing, risqué and daring. A no holes barred look into women's sexuality; specially one that knows exactly what she desires.  Brains, beauty, bodacious cannot be understated. Good read for guys, too.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The beginning of the book has a lot to do with business crimes which can be very dry for none business people (and business people) but as you read the other books it is necessary.  I actually liked the second book more.  I am on to the third.  Watched both the swedish and american version of the book and I still liked the book better.  More details.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Honestly, I wasn't very excited about this game reading the Product Description of it. I figured I'd try it because it's the FAOTD, but didn't expect to like it. I am now addicted and have been playing it on and off for a couple hours.<br /><br />The tutorial to get you started is really helpful and the in game hints (which you can turn off through the options menu) are great to introduce you to new hazards and elements. When you hit \\"Play\\" it takes you to a bookshelf that is labeled with a year and three picture frames. Click on a picture frame and there's four levels to play. It's a unique way to set up the stage select.  The levels are fun, they add new elements all the time that keeps it interesting. It also tells you the minimum number of moves you can beat it in, so you can go back to try to get a perfect score. There are achievements you can get for various things and you can earn coins to unlock hints. The graphics are crisp and the music is good (but I always turn music and sounds off anyway).<br /><br />The details are what makes this game 5 stars. It would be a fun game no matter what, but the extras make all the difference. Even if it doesn't look like a fun game based on the description, give it a chance and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!
B004N6369Y|2.0|This book was a little more harder to get started and not as (can't put it down) then her  usual written books. It toke me longer to read it, but a new story.
B006MGC3VK|5.0|I've been listening to Fire Make Thunder for two weeks straight and it's a great follow up to 2009's [[ASIN:B001TKK3DY Blood]]. Kevin Moore and Jim Matheos have created another unique addition to their catalog that easily is one of the best new prog rock releases so far in 2012. Moore's vocal style is a bit odd and hard to pinpoint, yet somehow it works......brilliantly. Matheos is a highly underrated guitarist and relies on the heavy riffs, along with creating atmosphere in key moments. Once again, Porcupine Tree's Gavin Harrison lends his machine gun drumming to this project and performs as you would expect- with precision and grace.<br /><br />My highlights are \\"Invisible Men\\", which is one of the best songs they've written so far, along with the melodic \\"Wind Won't Howl\\". The album is concise and doesn't overstay its welcome, even though two songs clock in at over 7 minutes each. If you're looking for something a little different in the prog rock genre, this is for you. If you are a fan of the first 3 albums, you won't be disappointed either.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I thought season one was great.  Just recently got hooked on it and zipped through all 24 episodes through rental DVDs.  In short: the 4 main characters were great both individually and how they played together, the supporting characters were great, I liked the action, stories and settings.  See other reviews for details as to why this show is so good.<br /><br />But I have a question.  The characters in the show often say the temperature is in the mid 90's, even said it was 110 degrees one time.  This sounded off so I just checked average Honolulu summer temps and they don't get above the upper 80's.  Does anyone have an idea why the writers would put in this seemingly glaring factual error?  (I know it is fiction and doesn't have to be factual but it still doesn't make sense to me).
B006MW3VGA|5.0|I happened to become interested with Downton Abbey on Netflix and had to see whatever I could to continue. It's a fascinating series and well worth it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was just what I was looking for. Best game ive played on my kfire so far. Please keep em coming....
0060920084|3.0|I got the feeling that while Bryson was writing this novel,  it was more about deadlines than a first hand, interested and intrepid observance of a great land; he didn't really want to be there, doing that.  For reasons known only to him, he had abandoned America for England awhile before, and perhaps whatever it was, became the underlying reason for his unenthusiastic return to homeland.  Ostensibly, he  had returned to take what he hoped would be a \\"Sentimental Journey\\", but wound up being dissatisfied, unamused, lonely.  Perhaps \\"lonely\\" describes his journey best, because not even Katz was there to drink beer with him; he had to drink alone when he could find a waitress who would bring him one after closing time without making him feel like a leper.  While traveling alone can be a boon in certain instances, it can also be a depressant, and it shows.  He drove at his own speed, coast to coast, seeing towns, countrysides and cities I would absolutely love to see for myself, but he seemed unimpressed by most of it.<br /><br />It's an enigma.  After having read \\"A Walk in The Woods\\" and \\"A sunburned Country\\", I dove into this one (\\"The Lost Continent\\" ) with abandon.  But while the first two books mentioned are peppered with a caustic, biting humor livening the travel narrative, which is just my cup of tea, I felt this one lacked a lot of something important; and while I enjoyed it to a degree, I felt rather flat after suffering through his coast to coast \\"missed adventure\\" with him.  As Flat as his descriptions of Nebraska or Kansas.  As \\"nothing\\" as his remarks about Highway 93 to Twin Falls, Idaho; where flat topped mesas born of volcanic fire give way to the beautiful Snake River that wends it's way through a black lava canyon of spectacular vistas, surrounded by magnificent mountains in the distance - none of which he apparently saw, or if he did, neglected to write of it.  The West is a country of vast distances; to travel through at high speed with the sole intent of \\"getting it over with\\" is surely a way to miss most of it.<br /><br />But his disrespect of the East, all the way from Georgia to Vermont, was evident too; instead of using his daring wit as a condiment to the tale as it had been in books past, it became narcissistic in this one; one can't help but feel that he had personal issues clogging his views, dragging him down with them as he sneered his way across country.  In many instances, you knew exactly what he was telling was hard truth; that's always welcome - but the tempering journalistic enthusiasm so evident in prior books was struggling painfully, doggedly, trying to break the surface and never quite accomplished it.<br /><br />I left Bryson after spending a lot of time with him in the pages of this book, but he wasn't quite the same storyteller I tagged along with through the woods on the Appalachian Trail, or in the back country of Australia.  I have mixed emotions about how to rank it; but even though I came away with the feelings I did, I would recommend it to others because there was a lot of worthwhile humor in it if you are forewarned to sidestep the depression.  While I was late to the Bryson party (I always am) I have high hopes for his next book; I know he has another good one in him.
0553801473|1.0|He started out the series so well and each book gets less and less interesting.  You can tell that the end will be fantastic, but it seems that the more chapters he adds the further he gets from the end.  One thing that was great about the series before was that things happened.  If 1/3 of this book was simply removed and another 1/3 was edited to half the size, you could have a decent book (3.5 to 4 stars) that was half the size of this one. Maybe George R. R. Martin will have a new editor step in and help him shrink the next book to remove all of the chaff.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the author appears to think we need to see every side of everything going on.  This means he gives chapters to people that add nothing to the overall quality of the story.  Perhaps their perspective would be useful in a history book, but they don't do anything for a novel.  Seeing the perspective of the \\"bad guys\\" is a technique that can add value, but he goes way beyond reason.  Characters in a novel need to be either likable or interesting.  Chapters aren't very good when the characters are neither.
B00371V6SE|5.0|Fantastic book! Nicholas Sparks is a guaranteed good read! From start to finish i couldn't put it down. recommend this one for sure.
B0055SWM08|5.0|An addictive little game that I keep playing. the basic idea of manuvering around obstacles to get treasures is nothing new but the rain drop idea is what keeps me into it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|My friend got me hooked on this series and I love it! I've read the books as well too love them too, not that they are much a like, but I love them both! If your looking for a different take on vampires with some action, drama, and suspence, this is it!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love mahjong and the different puzzles make it more exciting . Plus many different levels give u something to strive for.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|For those who have lost a loved one too soon, and for those of faith, this book was a most credible witness to the afterlife. Anita's multicultural background, intelligence and straightforward, heartfelt pose make reading this narrative an unforgettable experience! It speaks to our essential natures as spiritual beings and connects us all.
B005PTYOTE|2.0|Too bad you can't return movies.  I bought the re-released Blu Ray of MI-1, and the transfer is simply not the crystal clear Blu ray picture i was expecting.  I swear my VHS copy of the movie is clearer.
B006YDG0KG|5.0|simply a great book! The thing is, it doesn't tell you anything you did not already know, but it tells you how to use it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its awesome there's so many levels Its my favorite game its awesome awesome I'm just putting this because if I do I can get updates for free
B004GYY714|5.0|best app ever you can hear Radios that are in Asia.  the bad reviews are from crazy peaple that probably are using some &quot;bad meds &quot;
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|First, let me say I love the way the game is designed and the play. I had a blast.<br /><br />For about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Once you run out of energy the game is unplayable without feeding real money. Unplayable game = 1 star.<br /><br />It saddens me to rate it that way but to make it free and then try to just suck endless money turns me off completely. I'd have much rather paid 2.99 or even 4.99 and be able to play it as much as I want. Staring at it for 3 minutes at a time while I wait for *1* energy to come back is a complete waste.
B005I6EU48|5.0|It is so nice to order something and when it arrives, it meets or exceeds expectations.  This is very well made, just want I wanted.  Colors muted, looks like real leather, but no animals were hurt in the process.  I am going to order another, for a family member.  Amazon service A+ as usual.
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|Not to be missed if you like English period dramas. Superb cast, wonderful location shots, and the Castle used for the Abbey is just spectacular.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|yes, this is a lot like Mario, but it is still very fun and the controls are easy to manage. great time killer for all ages.
B0054YIQK8|5.0|Own this on Laser Disk, this DVD version in Blu-ray with surround sound is spectacular. Absoulutely the best video recording of any opera. Filmed in Spain at authentic locations with an oustanding cast. Domingo is young and fresh voiced. Mingenes-Johnson though not the greatest voice is an excellent actress who is a fiery Carmen. Highly recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|now this game is so much fun that the only thing that would make it better if the people would neverrun out of energy it is great for kids to learn what the pioneer days were like
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I really enjoyed the DEPARTURES DVD! It's really a moving story about accepting change and letting go of the past. If you had to encapsulate the Buddhist teachings into a single phrase it would probably be something like \\"embracing impermanence,\\" and that's what this movie shows.<br /><br />In it, the main character Daigo Kobayshi (played beautifully by Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player who loses his job when the orchestra has to shut down because of low ticket sales. He has to move from Tokyo back to his small hometown, where his mother left him a house, and he finds work as a  \\"Nokanshi,\\" which is a person who prepares the dead person for the journey onwards. They're kind of like morticians only they do the work in front of the deceased person's family. He keeps his job secret from his wife because it's a shameful occupation, since they basically make money off the dead, and he's haunted by his hatred for his father who abandoned him a long time ago. His wife finds out about the job and wants him to quit and find something else. Towards the end, Daigo finally understands that his position is not shameful, along with others who ostracized him when they found out about his job, including his wife, and they realize that he performs a function that not only helps the grieving families, but also gives dignity to the dead. He's also able to make peace with his father -- when he's faced with the father's death -- and Daigo finally embraces change, which then allows him to fully experience life.<br /><br />The movie is beautifully shot and the soundtrack is gorgeous with the Cello its main instrument. It's in Japanese but there are English subtitles.<br /><br />*****  SPECIAL FEATURE  *****<br /><br />***  Interview with director Yojiro Takita  *** - 11:45-minutes - Subtitles with English voice-over<br />Here the director talks about the Japanese custom of preparing the dead and how this story idea came from the leading man (Masahiro Motoki) a while back, but it took this long to get the story off the ground. He also talks about the challenges they encountered because of the subject matter, since he didn't want the film to be too melancholic.<br /><br />The film won the Academy Award for \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\" and it would have been nice if they included the Oscar clip of the director and crew winning the award, but it isn't here. However, Takita describes that moment in the interview.<br /><br />Again, although the film does deal with death, it has a sad but light feel to it. I guess hopeful would be the word, since it shows grief, but it never comes off as gloomy. There are some very touching scenes, but they don't come off as schmaltzy or contrived. I highly recommend this movie.s long to get the story off the ground.

B00753MBHA|5.0|Accept and Overkill,my most anticipated wants this year.Both amazing!!!!! Accept is what I'm talking about here and it may turn out,just as good as Blood of Nations or better...I'm probably a bigger fan of Accept now,then I was back in the 80's...The album rocks and hits you in the face with blazing metal from start to finish!!! If you were into BON big time,like I was,this effort should be in your collection as well...Get it now and be metal-educated  \m/
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game because it is a good time saver. all I do in. lass is play this game

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game takes me way back when I was a kid but way better graphics and more challanging a lot better than the original one
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I liked it. It works great for a free game. I am not disappointed. If you need a chess game just to play every now and then this is for you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|ive been a gamer a long time,mostly because of games like this.it runs almost perfectly on the kindle fire .has the whole 8-bit feel going for it. nice to play a free game that's truly free as well. meat has spoken.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|that you will love this trilogy. I've read it twice and the books are better the second time around, especially book 3. With so much going on, there were a few things I didn't pick up on till the second reading. Highly recommend these books!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The image quality is good, the music is very soothing and relaxing and it engages your mind progressively. You get a little meditation out of it,  its a perfect game to play before bedtime.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Why isn't this not free on Kindle Fire? Do the birds in Space Fear Fire's Domination in the Galaxies? If I cant play it, it rates just a Meh...
0756405890|1.0|I've dragged myself through. The story is, in high degree, uninteresting, dull, sometimes irritating filler. The dialogues are mostly irrelevant to the story line. Looks like the author, having nothing better to come up, just took it 'from a ceiling'.<br />I regret I wasted so many hours, just because I rarely drop the things I start and those amazon ratings sometimes so misleading. Never know until have it tried myself.<br />So, adieu Patrick. That was the first and the last the book of yours for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a good mind game the is both addicting and cleaver. I have wasted a good afternoon and was pleased with he results.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is such a good game for killing time. Its so peaceful while playing to. This is definitely a game to play while in any waiting room. Kudos to the developers and artists involved in the making of this game.
B000MAOLVW|4.0|I used to travel to the race tracks in New York and New England. I live in Florida now and I have been to Seebring a few times. Too old now!
B0017TYPIG|5.0|I am a film buff and this movie is a must for like me.<br />Even more so that it is on Blu Ray, nicely restored.<br />Hopefully, more of these classic movies will be restored to Blu Ray.<br />I will be keeping my eye out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so fun but the rate in which energy is regenerated is much too slow. please improve! when do I get to put my townsfolk to work?
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has many levels and is very enjoying .Most games are not thinking games but this one is.Olive this game and hope they make rather another Quell or a game like it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|different than the old school one but still a good game would like more selection of my character I almost hope he gets bitten by a rattle snake so I don't have to see the mustachio
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun game to dl definitely worth it. highly recommended for those looking for a good brain teaser. good music and gameplay
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this game on the Amazon free app of the day. A nice crisp looking game on the Amazon fire. its certainly worth a download with lots of challenging levels.
0307593495|5.0|I highly recommend it!  \\"The Troubled Man\\" is the best of the series... my humble opinion. But shared by several friends.. We finally get to see the personnal side of the man.  Very moving!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|when bored this game is pretty entertaining. just like other tap and play games though. interesting none the least. and its free
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very well-done puzzler.  Tranquil music and attention to detail make this enjoyable.  It looks great and the controls are spot-on.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I usually try and avoid downloading games on my phone even if it's free because I simply don't see the need, but this one has so many positive reviews I had to give it a try. I must say, I'm not disappointed at all, great to play while I'm on the go.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a fun game but don't like how you run out of energy so fast. if anyone has a gameloft ID add me &quot;lincsmom&quot; so we can send and receive energy from one another.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|very accurate doesn't drain my battery easy to use. I also love the alerts except that they don't always clear
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun game. it passes time whn u are bored at work or in transit. the new update was decent.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I love this author's style of writing in this series... I've completed part I, and I am quickly soaring through part II... I've been on an emotional rollercoaster since the beginning... The author takes you from mystery to thriller to erotica and back again... Since reading this book, I've also released some of my prudish judgments on things I've never experienced (-_^)... It's a great read!!!!...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome puzzles to keep your mind sharp. Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste. And that's all she wrote.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Dude this game is awesome because I remember back in the days when Mario was just an old video game that was never bought but know,  yo its a friggin leprechaun and the best thing is there's no Mario on the kindle so ya GET IT NOW!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i personally think the first of the series was amazing....i used jason as myself,piper as my girlfriend,and leo as a friend at school.i encourage readers like me(Rick Riordan's #1 fan)to read the percy jackson and the olympians series.read the second book(the son of neptune)if you have read that book, then you would know he is creating a third book called the mark of athena.<br /><br />the next thing is the kane chronicles.i read both and preordered the other one on this kindle. the two were so good i asked if i could get it .so i am.praise to Rick Riordan
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the choice of deal and the fact that you can change the card backs and the back ground design
0545265355|5.0|I love this box set. Perfect for gift giving or in your own personal library. Hardcover books with jackets.  Great buy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A game that makes you think. A great way to press some time. Much better than most of the Android games I have seen. Very mellow music as well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is amazing!! its soo zen and relaxing... yet at the same time a rly fun puzzle game! I could play this forever
B007MNV5WU|4.0|this an AWSOME game I absolutely recomend to buy. one thing Rovio is good at is making kickass games. But I don't like that it only has 2 worlds.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smart game. Peacefully. Its great! A good way to relax. I hope they make more zen games. Maybe a different game style though.
B007MU85D0|5.0|A friend suggested this album to me and I am glad he did!  It reminds me of the lush sounds of Polyphonic Spree.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|I purchased Tony Bennett Duets !! CD that I absolutely LOVE and when I saw there was a DVD of it I knew<br />I had to purchase it.....so glad I did :)  not only do you get to hear the artists sing again but then you get to see the<br />work involved prepping and the joking around and personal interviews with each artist too.
0553103547|2.0|I thought the author was good with his prose and all, but it's a very bleak, nihilistic tale. Its main strength seems to be how brutally and inventively it shows torture, child abuse, rape, incest, murder, degrading sex, abusive relationships, etc. And that is very brutally and inventively, indeed.<br /><br />Absent is pretty much anyone trying to better themselves against this backdrop. To me, that makes it pretty unrealistic and dull. In real life, together with all the creeps and psychopaths, there are brave people who grow, heal up from tragedies, enjoy tenderness with other people, and strive to be kind and true, feeling remorse when they fall short. These are what you would call likeable people. Characters who do this are pretty interesting. Such people are absent in this book.<br /><br />I wound up wondering why the book presented such a bleak world with so much violence, so dispassionately. If the author actually thinks that real life is like this, then that's pretty depressing.<br /><br />There is also very little magic and very little action, by the way. Most of the book is verbal jousting.<br /><br />The plot doesn't really move forward much. Despite all the titillation, or maybe just sickening brutality, the book is actually a pretty boring, plodding slog. Read ahead to reviews of subsequent books, and you will discover just how bored readers get. But all the warning signs are here, in the first one.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|This game will not even open, it just sits at a blank black screen on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus. Please fix this!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this app works great on the kindle fire. it feels polished. android needs more apps of this calibur.  I will keep an eye out for more fallen tree games
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoyable game for my daily commute. also great for lazy Sunday's. Solitaire has always been a favorite game of mine.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Has ads some are full page.  Game plays fine on Kindle Fire.  Did not force close.  Choose to have a great day.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i luv this game as much as i luv mcdonalds :) its just like mario tho. but oh well. it fun
B006ZZANDI|5.0|This Cd is amazing! I love the songs and the extras. I got the CD fairly quickly. Best CD I've ever bought by far!
1408215330|5.0|I ordered this dictionary couple weeks ago and got it very fast.It contains all the things I need. Finding the word is quite easy ,because dictionary is very good organized. It has enries from Thesaurus, pictures,and what I like most,it has online and mobile version too.English is my second language, so I find this dictionary very helpful.
B002DQLGHU|2.0|The fourth HARRY film, (following \\"The Trouble With Harry Potter,\\" \\"When Harry Potter Met Sally,\\" and the series' high-water-mark, \\"Dirty Harry Potter\\"), is a mostly hollow exercise that does little to enliven a once-lucrative franchise. Smugness and in-your-face special effects are no substitute for interesting characters and genuine inspiration. Desperate.
0307593312|4.0|Part I - This is not the first time Murakami writes in third person's view. There are two parallel stories, Tengo is a writer and is reviewing a romance wrote by \\"Fukaeri\\" another is about Aomame, she is an office lady and has an interesting active life. Seems by the end of this first volume that the two stories somehow will intersect each other in the next volumes.<br /><br />Part II - The two parallel stories keep moving on. Tengo reviewing the Fukaeri romance \\"Air Chrysalis\\" and Aomame in her thrilling missions. This second volume reveals some mysteries of both stories, and gives clear signs they will collide somehow. Murakami plays with the approach of such encounter but makes it thrilling and unpredictable such as the collision of two moons floating on the sky (?!).<br />The end of this second volume brings astonishing events, but gives no clues of how will be the third and last volume.<br /><br />Part III - A third character Ushikawa appears and spies on Tengo and Aomame lives. Tengo and Aomame move on with their complex lives, and Murakami takes quite too long developing the final encounter. Since the end of volume two it was clear it would happen somehow but while reading this third and final volume seemed that it would never happen. And of course, Ushikawa was more anxious about this encounter than anyone else. So his curiosity killed him!<br />By the end, going out the rabbit hole was like realizing that Aomame will have a baby, no matter it was Tengo's or not, but it was truly a shock to reality. But whose reality? Aomame's of course.. And what about Tengo's reality? Well, maybe he will still play the Rabbit \\"Role\\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The controls are easy, and its like Mario which is awesome because they don't have a Mario game like this for the Kindle! Its free! GET IT!
B006OE7XM4|2.0|I first heard Gregory on JazzFM.com He was doing an interview for his upcoming (this one) CD. He was quite interesting and his music was great on JazzFM. Upon purchasing the CD I found that it didnt sound nearly as good. Every song has Gregory's voice heavily echoed and the music sounds a bit flag. Normally the singers voice is placed above the instruments and/or during a instrumental section, something will be emphasized to help it stand out; This CD seems to not do any of that. I was quite disappointed, Gregory Porter has a very distinct voice and could be the next superstar jazz male voice but not with a CD of this quality.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like this app and I'm glad that it looks simular to the way my Mail looks on my desk top.
1250008409|5.0|I needed Andy Puddicombe's book because I wanted to break out of What If? and Coulda-Shoulda-Woulda-Land.  I want to live in the moment and enjoy or at least be present in my everyday life.  The happiest times in my life have always been when I'm completely present.  Remember what it was like to fall in love?  To land in a new city on vacation?  To hear a symphony in person for the first time?  Unfortunately, it seems the longer I live, the more thoughts and concerns that I have and the more difficult it is to stop all the \\"what if and could-shoulda-woulda\\" stuff that is buzzing around in my head.  What happened to the days when everything was new and exciting and an adventure?  What happened to the days when I didn't worry about every little thing and just concentrated on the present?  I've read other books on meditation and mindfulness and I've tried, I really have, to clear my mind and just be present.  But telling myself not to think of anything is like telling myself not to think of a purple cow.  The more I tried, the more purple cows that appeared.<br /><br />Andy Puddicombe's book, \\"Get Some Headspace\\" has finally got me going in the right direction.  I'm not totally there yet, but I'm making progress.  The thing I liked best about his book is that he's very down to earth and has a great way of explaining how to get to a point of living mindfully.  He uses lots of stories and analogies.  One of my favorites is the Blue Sky analogy.  Think of being in a storm with dark clouds everywhere in sight and rain and thunder and lightning and noise.  Then think of taking off in an airplane and breaking through all those dark clouds to a sunny blue sky.  The blue sky is like the calm state our minds realize when we meditate.  It may take a little work to get there, but it always is and always was there.  It's just a matter of lifting through all the commotion and noise below.  Andy proposes a way to get that \\"lift\\" that will break through the clouds in a way that is not overwhelming.  His Take 10 program proposes taking just 10 minutes a day to calm your mind.  Rather than trying to not think of all the clouds and thunder and lightning he tells us just to sit back and acknowledge them.  To me that's kind of like sitting in the plane and watching the clouds and watching them fall away behind as the blue sky becomes visible.<br /><br />The book isn't about mantras or chants or connecting with some mysterious force.  While I was waiting for the book to ship I did a search on the title and found that the author has a website that has all kinds of information and 10 minute guided meditations to help you find that calm place and get some headspace.  You can listen to 10 days worth of these guided meditations plus more online content that the book gives you access to.  If you want to continue these guided meditations you can sign up, for a fee, for a month, year, or longer membership that will give you complete access.  The book covers all of this information that you'll get in the free section plus more.  This book is not an advertisement for the web content, like some books I've read in the past.  He gives you all the tools you'll need to get you on the path to meditation and mindfulness in the book.<br /><br />Although the book is only 224 pages (for the advance reading copy) he does a great job of explaining the principles of meditation.  In fact, he is often redundant and could probably have written it in a lot less words.  But if you're like me, with purple cows running rampant through your brain, redundancy can be a good thing.  I needed to hear this message in stories, in analogies and in plain old language to fully grasp just where I'm going and why it's taken me so long to do a seemingly simple thing.  I needed to be convinced.  It wasn't even simple for the author in the beginning. Andy shares in his book that he ran off to Asia and trained as a Buddist monk but he went through numerous monasteries looking to find his way. Hehad the same problems we all have with trying to be present in the moment so he knows how to explain the process. His approach in this book isn't religious and if you watch a video of him on his website he doesn't even look like a monk dressed in a plaid shirt rather than orange robes. And he has a very friendly, easy going manner.<br /><br />I wanted to mention that the guided meditations on the Andy's website have been a great help to me so far and I may subscribe when I finish the free content.  In some ways they seem a bit like hypnosis in that they're very relaxing and his voice is energizing and soothing at the same time.  It helps to chase away the purple cows and all the what-if and could-shoulda-woulda stuff and most importantly, it gets me to a calm place rather quickly.  The nice thing is that the guided meditations are available as a smartphone app so I can listen on my iPhone so I can be anywhere, not tied to sitting at my computer.<br /><br />This book may not be for everyone, but it's been a great help to me.had the same problems we all have with trying to be present in the moment so he knows how to explain the process.

B004FOA84A|4.0|people say this game is short but I cant say so myself because I'm stuck. I would rate this game 5stars but a little to changelling.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Perfectly cast and paced, this miniseries captures the essence of George Martin's first book in A Song Of Fire And Ice.  While there are obvious deeper pleasures in the reading the novels, there are also characterizations and visualizations and clarifications in the HBO version that enhance what you have read.<br /><br />Nicely handled by David Benioff, whose City Of Thieves would take a terrific movie itself.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I just saw that the comments were at a number that was not appropriate for my religion thx... oh and great game btw
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it is borein bud when I'm board i play it. if you like the movie yoy will like this check it out.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|WOW! I love the Black Keys. This is an excellent CD...one that I can play start to finish, and over and over again. The Black Keys are my new favorite artists! I love the \\"Lonely Boy\\" video!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It is super fun and extremely addictive. I made friends with the other players and we give each other gifts it just like farmville only better. the only downfall is that on the kindle fire it is sometimes hard to touch the right food item
0740748475|3.0|I love the collection. The books are vibrant and wonderful....but what I really wanted to get across was:<br />The book holder was damaged. The corner was dented in and when I pulled out the first book, the wrapping of the cloth on the inside came out with the book so now I will have to re-glue this. I am not happy about that. The dented corner is in the worst possible spot, as well.  It seemed to have been properly packaged with wrapping and shipping peanuts. I cannot tell if it was done before delivery or if it happened during shipment (we all know how much those Fedex guys care about OUR belongings)<br /><br />So in conclusion, the damage done to my collection is very disheartening, but the vibrancy of the collection is more than I imagined.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|it's so fun my brother and I love this game it is kind of like super Mario bros but way better and more fun
B004M5HUXE|5.0|For .99 cents who could go wrong.  Needed to read this book for book club and I had never read it before.  Didn't know they wrote such books in the 1800.  People kept telling me it was a classic - I don't know about the word classic but I did read to the end because I wanted to know how it ended.  Our goal for book club is to read a classic a year.  Good choice.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell progressively gets trickier while keeping a calming sense about itself. It's a fun and thought provoking game. I like it :)
055338466X|5.0|[[ASIN:055338466X The Grand Design]]Hawking's the Grand Design is well written, clear and comprehensive. It is the latest of his popularizing books, and I found it enjoyable, illumanating and worthwhile.  The illustrations are a bit overdone and too smooth, they do not contribute much.<br />Of all his books, The Grand Design and A Brief History of Time to me seemed the best.
0385344325|4.0|One thing that truly did bother me was the fact that Reacher is beyond the law...granted, its a novel but alas, should the protagonist in a relatively \\"real life\\" situation have the right to be judge, jury, and executioner? Putting that aside, it was a good read...I loved the Second Son bonus short story as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Definitely a lot of fun but after a while ot can get redundant as some of the games are pretty much the same. And some are a bit costly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couln't put these books down.  I read all three of them in three days.  They  are sexy, kinky, and I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next.  If your a prude then this book isn't for you.  Be prepared, because after a couple of chapters you are going to want to have your significant other tied up or a fresh set of batteries. Going right now to search this author for other books.  Happy reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really thought that all three books were explained and portrayed in exceptional detail, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading them. The only problem I had with any of the books was the end of the third one. Now, I know this may sound cliche but I felt as though the ending was rushed. I didn't have a problem with how it ended, but more or less it was the abruptness of the end that disrupted me. I didn't really see any kind of resolution, which bothered me when I finished reading the books. But otherwise, the books were great reads, and I highly recommend them to any person of any age.
B005LL4U54|5.0|I saw the movie numerous times, and I've played this CD even more.  The richly layered melodies are gorgeous to listen to.  Teriffic orchestra and the string phrases really hit emotional levels that so few soundtracks do.  Like the movie it was created for, this is beautifully produced but not overdone. Play it loud in your car!  it's great!!  Congratulations to Ludovic Bource and every artist playing on this soundtrack!!
0446585025|3.0|I'm not a big fan of audiobooks, but I can't help but think that 'Seriously . . . I'm Kidding'' would be much better listened to than read. Her sense of humor just doesn't translate particularly well to the page. I'm familiar with her cadence and the way she tells jokes so I was able to imagine her performing the essays in this book, but if someone picked this up without knowing Ellen and her style I don't think they'd probably enjoy it much.<br /><br />Overall it was a quick read and there were some funny parts, but if this book is an accurate indicator, then I don't think Ellen's unique brand of humor is best showcased via the written word.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this app is ok all you do is one thing cant they add more to it no wonder it was the free app of the day
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a very good game.  i love puzzles so this is the game for me. i dont know what else to say.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game great to past the time I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it,love it, love it, love it,
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just could not put this book down until I finished reading it. Anything is  possible, and with the historical research involved, this was a very enjoyable/sentimental novel.  I only wish more people were told about the find!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album just came back into my head, 10 years after it was released. I am not a Christinia Aguilera fan at all, I don't like her as a person and I don't like any of her music except this record. This album is a total 'glitch in the matrix' type situation. Not before or since has she done anything like this record. The production is outstanding and lyrically this record is dynamite. Whatever she did to make this record, she needs to do again but I don't hold my breath because in my opinion, great records can not be and are never replicated.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Helps pass time at the airport! Very stable application and easy to use.  Within minutes you could be playing angry birds!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it!  A very easy read and kept me interested until the end.  The movie was good, but the book is better.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Excellent game. Very good tutorial helps to introduce new players. Creative layout keeps you interested and coming back for more.
0345803485|5.0|I bought the trilogy for my kindle and have read all three in less than 2 weeks.  From the moment I started reading book one I was hooked.  Fifty Shades basically puts you in a fantasy land that you may only think about in certain situations and it's an awesome love story.  I can't wait for the movie to come out and additional books by E.L. James!  I may even start to re-read Fifty Shades.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I recently purchased the entire Harry Potter book collection for my grandkids, so I thought I should get the movie collection to go along with the books.  I was very happy to find that Amazon had the entire collection available in one set and I did not have to search for individual movies.  As usual, I found exactly what I wanted on Amazon, for a great price and they arrived sooner than I expected.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Fantastic flash! Recommended so much! Fast and powerful! Fits perfectly with my Nikon D3100!<br />Needs 4 AA batteries and came with a few (and useful) accessories!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've only been doing the level 1 and level 2 videos for a week and a half and I'm already seeing results!  I'm losing inches faster than pounds, but that's fine with me.  Several people at work have come up to me and asked what I was doing because they can tell I'm visibly losing weight.  I won't lie, this workout is tough.  I sweat more during these 20 minute videos than I do running a 5K.  The workout moves are relatively basic (basic not easy) but the combination of strength, cardio, and abs appears to be extremely effective.  I highly recommend this video for people who have already been incorporating exercise into their routine.  I'd say it's a bit too advanced for beginners.
B007NFRPSA|5.0|I cannot remember being able to watch a real TV SHOW, not all this reality tv for so long. I only buy TV EPISODES now that are worth watching. I don't subscribe to cable or satellite tv. I have a ROKU player and between Netflix and Amazon they do an outstanding job suppling me with what I WANT TO WATCH!
1612130283|5.0|I don't read books very often, just because books don't usually get me interested from the beginning and keep me interested.  This book got me from the very beginning.  I love the dynamics of their relationship.  I like that the author doesn't trail off with too many details about insignificant things. She gets right to the point.  Love love love this book.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|My family loved this movie! The kids were excited to see Mumble all grown up. We rented it, but now I need to buy it!
B006VR65OQ|4.0|A movie young people should see before they interview for their first job. Moneyball tells it like it is in today's corporate workplace, for better or worse. The acting is terrific and the fact that the story revolves around baseball makes it even better, for me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game!  Easy to play; Yet challenging.  if you enjoy playing solitaire you will enjoy this app. I highly recommend it.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I love the Irish lilt in their singing.  This CD had great singing and I love the sound of all the instruments -<br />you could hear them all.  Some of the songs are sad love songs and if you're not coming from a relationship gone<br />bad you can still appreciate the music overall.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun... Glad it is free app of the day. ;) 3 levels deep and can sense that the game progresses in difficulty nicely. Simple, yet beautiful graphics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Not gonna waste your time. This is fun, challenging, and the controls are slick. My favorite puzzle game on the market.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game...moves very fast and doesn't drag on..great job making this app!!!  wish their was a tutorial to help.  the fast pace makes me fotget what is what.
B0055SWM08|4.0|how is this any different than quell reflect? I see they are both for sale, and now that I own them both I don't see any difference.<br /><br />it runs just as well as quell reflect so I'm not going to knock it, I just don't understand why they are both for sale.

B004289ZW0|1.0|I'm sorry to have to give this product a single star because everything works great, except the finger slide on/off switch.  It's almost impossible to turn off and worst of all, it will turn itself on EVERY TIME you touch it, move it, put it in your pocket, throw it in your backpack, place it in your drawer or even so much as look at it funny.  So just about every time I've REALLY NEEDED to use it, the battery was dead (or low) because the unit was already on from the last time I touched it.  Oh, what I would give for a hack to convert it to a plain-old physical on-off slide switch.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Not the most original game (Zelda did some of these puzzles years ago) but otherwise an awesome game - challenging yet fun.  Musical score might be the best part.
B006ISJQ3K|2.0|When I heard the 1976 self-titled Ross lp was next in line to be given the \\"Special Edition\\" treatment, I was very excited.  And after reading a few message boards (not always a wise decision), my anticipation grew even more -- there were rumors a 30 minute version of \\"Love Hangover\\" would be included on this Special Edition, as well as Diana's version of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\", so I quickly pre-ordered the 2-CD set.  When the Special Edition arrived, I was very disappointed to see there was no 30 minute version of \\"Love Hangover\\" and no version of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way.\\"<br /><br />I'm a Diana Ross fan so I already have the 1976 lp on CD when it was originally released.  I also have the Special Edition/Extended CDs of \\"Surrender\\", \\"Everything Is Everything\\" and the first self-titled Ross lp (containing \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\") so I already knew that the \\"alternate versions\\" would hold no interest for me.  Unfortunately, the 1976 Special Edition CD contains alternate versions of every track!<br /><br />What I'm most interested in when new Ross product hits the market are the bonus tracks, tracks that have never been released before.  This Special Edition contains 3 bonus tracks (on Disc 2) \\"Harmony\\", \\"Le Lo Li\\" and \\"Go Where Your Mind Is\\" and honestly, I don't like any of them.  \\"Go Where Your Mind Is\\" doesn't even sound like Ross to me.  The bonus tracks on \\"Surrender\\" (Baby I'll Come) and \\"Everything Is Everything\\" (Wish I Knew, What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life, and Something) were more exciting and I listen to those tracks constantly.  Perhaps my favorite Ross period is the early 70s?<br /><br />The final disappointment is the last track (track 15) on Disc 2: a 15 minute and 50 second interview with Ross.  I doubt even the hard core fans will listen to that more than once.  I would have rather had 2 extra bonus tracks and no interview.<br /><br />I've played this Special Edition only twice and filed it away.  Final Grade: C.  (The next time Hip-OSelect releases Ross product, I'll wait to hear clips first; I won't pre-order).  1976 Special Edition is strictly for hard-core fans and completeists (those who have to have everything).Hip-OSelect releases Ross product, I'll wait to hear clips first; I won't pre-order).  1976 Special Edition is strictly for hard-core fans and completeists (those who have to have everything).

B0002KZAKS|4.0|My church is a church plant so money is not in excess. We currently have 6 Sure mics which are aging. I needed to have a backup or another mic for larger worship events. I read a bunch of reviews on this mic on the web from several different music sources and they all gave this a favorable review. I put the mic into action and gave it to one of the ladies with a higher pitch voice. I remember reading that this mic tends to bring down the highs and mids a bit. Sure enough it did just that. For this singer I was able to put the mixer to the same settings as some of the other singers because this mic was giving what I use to have to adjust for. If you have a male singer or speaker that uses this mic, then you will have to turn up the high gain and mid gain a bit. After adjusting the gain a bit you cannot tell the difference between the Sure SM58 and SM57 beta mics we have. Mic feels very solid in your hand. The true test will be to see how it holds up to being used (singing and the occasional visit to the floor) over time. I would recommend this mic.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is amazing. how its just like Mario jumping,  throwing stuff its great I highly recommend this game for people. with kindle fire
1401310672|5.0|. . . because you'll totally get busted by your laughter.  I purchased the book to cheer up a good friend who is going through a tough time, but couldn't resist reading it myself first.  I tried to finish the last few pages at work before passing the book off to my co-worker/friend, but I really struggled not to laugh out inappropriately in the workplace.  I purchased several similarly funny books lately, but this is one of the best!  If you are looking for something to make you (or a friend) laugh, this one is pure gold!<br /><br />I tried to pick out a few of my favorites to share here, such as:<br /><br />\\"I broke my penis and it exploded all over my pants.\\"  (*pen)<br /><br />\\"Please tell her I have herpes.\\"  (*her pies)<br /><br />\\". . . stop leaving the bloody tampon!\\"  (*bloody lamp on)<br /><br />If you enjoy immature humor as much as I do, I highly recommend you purchase this book.  You will definitely LOL!  Literally!

B004OR1X6A|4.0|I have most of Rory's work and it is hard to come across anything new. But, this is a great addition to my collection of work with some of his finest playing.<br />He was always good live and this album does not disappoint. If you know him, you will probably already have this. If you don't, then you are missing out on one of the finest blues/rock guitarists ever. Buy this album and then get the rest of his catalogue.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|There is now gravity involved. It is a great new feature that makes this game even more fun. I can spend loads of time on just playing this game. The only complaint I have about this new game is that there aren't enough worlds yet! I got through the game pretty fast, but am just waiting for new worlds to come out. This game uses more physics and makes it a little bit more difficult. It, however, makes everything much more fun! Overall, I would recommend downloading this app!

0439023513|3.0|The final book in the trilogy makes us immediately wonder if those who escaped to District 13 were better off before they escaped.  For a District to remain hidden, there are implied hidden motives and agendas, and those exciting undercurrents exist immediately.  However, I was surprised that Katniss, for the most part, seemed unable to rise to the occasion of rebellion leader, nor could she choose between the men in her life.<br />I also didn't buy Katniss' regard of Peeta when his first statement is given.  Even with all that's come before, Katniss deceiving Peeta for the Games, and witnessing his own ease with deception, her initial disbelief and doubt of him when he gave his Capitol interview was uncharacteristic.  Still, maybe it was a plot device to harden her heart, to get her closer to the cause.  I just wish her motivations for doing so were focused more on him, and not a complete disregard of everything that had come before.<br /><br />Gale and Peeta became more of the stars of this book, and I didn't feel that Katniss flourished.  She faded into the background, where I would have thought she'd emerge and step up to the plate.  If Katniss was really as torn and reluctant as she seemed, her motivations for doing so were not skillfully revealed.  This last novel is also the only one in the trilogy where the tone of the novel reflected its target audience.  I know they're adolescents, I know there is a typical dramatic love triangle, but I never felt like they had acted immature until this book.  When one has gone through so much, and lived such a hard life, I felt the tone of the first two books reflected that more.  Heroes grow up quick, they do not revert back to childishness.<br /><br />Still, it was great to see Katniss come into her own in the third act, and I really thought about one of the messages of the book:  When forced to survive and kill, what happens to parts of you?  What do you sacrifice inside of you to commit those acts, and to justify them?  It really made me think of our American soldiers, and hope that they are able to rise above wartime, and hopefully live full and well-adjusted lives after the \\"Games\\" are over.
0525423281|5.0|Lola Nolan is the girl I wish I had been at 16. She is fun, quirky, smart, and interesting. I wish that I had been myself as much as she is. I love that her Dads are such interesting guys. They each have great characteristics that make them unique. I love the family dynamics throughout the story. Cricket is just adorable. He is for sure the crush worthy type of guy you want to find when you are a teenager like Lola.<br /><br />What I love about this story as well as her other novel, Anna and the French Kiss, is just how adorable everything is. It manages to walk a fine line between modern fairytale and being completely realistic. I loved that Anna and Etienne make appearances in this one! This is not a book that I would be drawn to on my own as it just seems to \\"girly\\" for me. I am glad that I listened to the other bloggers and gave it a chance because I really ended up loving Lola and Anna!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Believe the hype, Lola is Fabulous!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good options, great layout. I appreciate the ability to listen to the audio versions too as well as share verses easily.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Five stars are too few for this book. I will open another Amazon account just so I can rate it with another five stars.
B002O320TA|5.0|My family and I have watched this movie perhaps a dozen times and it never gets old.  Atkinson's humor is heavily reliant on facial expressions and subtleties and it has a way of getting better with each viewing.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Excellent follow-up to the first book. If it were possible, I would rate both books with ten stars each. Pat, you are an amazing storyteller!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not for the faint hearted. It is an erotic novel but boy is it a fun read. I love Christian and Ana and all they go through getting to know each other. It is a great guilty pleasure read. But be prepared to shell out another 20.00 because if you like this one you HAVE to buy the next two!
B002SSBD6W|4.0|The state of factory farms in the US is fairly well-known.  But Foer really brings the point home in his book.  Made me think twice about eating meat!
B006OFN0BQ|4.0|Just when you thought that Clint Eastwood could do no wrong as a director, here we're given a film about one of the most fascinating figures in U.S. history, yet the majority of critics and audience alike just didn't go for it which was a real shame.  As a history buff I wanted to know more about the mystery man and his abuses of power... I'm happy to say that I left the theater getting more or less what I had hoped for.  Perhaps in time this picture will get the respect it deserves, just as DiCaprio eventually earned respect from the male audience by consistently demonstrating his talents in a lot of good films.<br /><br />I'd definitely say watch it if you're into U.S. history or period films.

B000FC13MM|2.0|As far as I can tell, the only time I had any fun while reading this book, were the rare moments when Nix managed to knock a good joke into the narrative when I least expected him to.<br /><br />I'm at a loss to explain the popularity of this book. Most everything I've read this year has been leagues better than this... tale. The lead character is, at best, boring. And there are only two other characters (noteworthy) in the story - yeah, a grand total of three main characters. The cat was interesting for a while, but then it was made obvious that his story wouldn't be told in this book, and he / it became a decoration, for the most part. The third guy is the obligatory romantic interest for our just-out-of-school heroine - another flat and uninteresting character whose story never really gets explored.<br /><br />And then there's the weird, and frankly senseless magic system. Charter magic which... er... comes from these huge stones (??? never really explained) and is somehow seen as wriggling glyphs once they're in place. Oh, and ringing bells, and whistling that controls another form of magic (??? again, never explained) Or are they both the same thing? I wondered at one point why, if the basis of their magic system was that elementary, more people in the story didn't know it (at least a little). Sabriel's world has the most quixotic magic system I've encountered in (my short-term) memory.<br /><br />In other words, skip this one, go re-read [[ASIN:059035342X Harry Potter]]. Or delve into [[ASIN:1423136829 Bartimaeus's tales]]. Heck, even [[ASIN:1423136802 Percy Jackson and his merry band of demigods]] is a better bet.

0375931007|5.0|I've never written a review on here before, and I've been buying and selling on Amazon for at least the last five years.  But if any book deserves one from me, it's this one.  One of the best books I ever read!  I highly recommend it.  I even recommended it to my 11-year-old nephew because I know he's smart enough and mature enough to handle it, and he's read a couple of other fiction books about the holocaust.  I'll never forget this book and, though sad, I would definitely read it again, which is, for me, the mark of a really amazing book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is nicely put together and has a silky smooth feel. Not too challenging but enjoyable and a little addictive. Try enjoying on your commute.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the best and most fun game app I've come across yet. It is a lot like Mario brothers. I don't know how anyone could possibly give it less than 5 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is great! I waited for so long to get to play this as it is one of the highest rated games on every market, but I never saw it as a FAotD, so I bought both Quell and its sequel Quell Reflections from the Play Store when they were on sale for a quarter, weeks ago. Seems that I am glad that I did--no nag screens in those versions.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|There's not much to say that hasn't been said before, but I love this book and wanted to share that with others. Great characters. A lot going on but it all kept my attention. The show is fantastic too!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game and so does my two year old. Its entertaining, fun,  addictive, and passes the time. I really don't want to put it down.
B003EYVXV4|2.0|When I pay to see a movie, I expect to be able to actually see the movie. This is a case where \\"shaky cam\\" does not work. The camera was shaking during parts where people are only talking. I get the technique. It can help to create tension, but come on film makers, don't over abuse it. Are you trying to give people motion sickness?<br /><br />Rant over.<br /><br />All in all the story is great. The actors are good but many characters are not developed enough. As much as I like looking at Jennifer Lawrence, watching her sit in a tree for half the movie is not very entertaining. They should have showed Peeta's experience during the Games while she was hiding. (Yes I read the book.)<br /><br />Let's hope the sequels are done better.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|WOW! Loved this book, can't wait for the next one in the Trilogy!  Well written, excellent story line, I learned things in this book.  The characters are very interesting and although we know the outcome of the \\"main event\\", there is an intrigue in this book I enjoyed very much.  I liked the pace of the novel, I truly enjoyed the historical events and learned quite a few things. In my opinion, this is the Ken Follett I enjoy and the reason why I buy his books. I didn't read many of the posted reviews because I was told by someone who knows me quite well that I would enjoy this book.  Since I have a Kindle, I don't really know nor do I care how many pages there are but the reading went by so fast!  Couldn't wait to pick it up again and see what else would happen.  I don't want to give anything away but I must say that the ending surprised me.  I cannot say enough about this story intertwined with actual facts. I knew things were just horrible at the beginning of the century but never realized how so divided and out of touch the aristocracy was .... although, in hindsight, I shouldn't be surprised.  This book was well researched, well written and found that  I got attached to the characters in the book.  This is the type of work I expect from Mr Follett and I must say, I was not disappointed.  Bravo!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing as rain.<br />Enjoy the graphics and the progression of difficulty in the levels. It was a nice find. I think it will give me a lot of enjoyment.  Worth the download. Game works fine!
0525478817|3.0|It was sad, very sad. Tear-worthy sad, honest, and realistic in its own sense. It might make you feel depressed about life and you would very much appreciate the existence of the Make A Wish foundation.<br /><br />The way these two unique individuals talk is so not very common and it might confuse some, as it surely did to me, although you get their general gist. I think. I don't know. I just know that it was very sad for them to go through what they did and think just how unfair life really is. We get the perfect lives that we are in now and complain about everything, and these two are just brilliant and amazing and they know how to see all the pain in the world, and they still go on. We, as humans, are just so strong - if you can see how these people in the story cope with everything that hits them. The strength is endearing.<br /><br />While I am only giving it 3 stars (to indicate that I liked it), the overall depressive mood it put me in really sucks. It's reality, but still, it just depresses me. I did cry at the part that everybody would be crying at, and I appreciate the honesty and everything that encompasses it. I especially appreciate how the two protagonists think and just their entire unique way of communicating. That sort of dialogue is not something you would experience in real life. At this point, I don't think I'm making sense to myself anymore. And I did feel like that throughout the book, but it wasn't important enough to linger over.<br /><br />That is all.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Very entertaining. Ending was a little goofy. Definitely a keeper and worth the. 99. Good job Alawar!!! I look forward to more quality games from Alawar : )
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cant wait to read the third book. Goes very fast. Keeps my attention, and can hardly put my Kindle down. Highly recommend the book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved all three books.  I have been reading every free moment that I can for the last couple of weeks.  I have read lots of romance sort of novels before but nothing like this one.  Erotic, steamy and hearts and flowers romance.
B005F6NA56|5.0|Remember Kate Bush - the groundbreaking Kate Bush who made albums like The Dreaming and Hounds of Love? This is what she would be doing now if she had not turned so boring in her late career. This is an album that rewards repeated listenings. After having discovered Feist with this album, I have gone back and listened to some of her earlier work. Frankly that earlier stuff just doesn't do to much for me. I think Metals is a big turning point for her and I very much look forward to where she goes from here.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app has been the no. 1 app for a long time. I was wondering when it would be free. the question is: will tomorrows free app be quell reflect?
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love a game that can challenge me, at the same time, if the degree of difficulty stops me completely, all the fun goes away. I have a choice here to purchase hints with coins I earn during the game, so that I am able to move forward at any time that I feel I'm getting near that frustrated point in a game. I like that option, and I like this game!

0553582038|5.0|After reading the reviews here for \\"A Feast for Crows\\" I almost didn't read it.  Glad I ignored the reviews. I read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" in 1999 and was hooked immediately. It was out in paperback and \\"A Clash of Kings\\" was out in hardback. Devoured it, but had to wait a bit for \\"A Storm of Swords.\\"  Unfortunately \\"A Feast for Crows\\" didn't come out till 2005 (while I was checking GRRM's web site almost daily).  Started to read it but I had forgotten all of the characters and plot lines, and I didn't finish it. Then last year \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" was published and the HBO series came out and I decided to start over.  The second time around the initial trilogy was even better climaxing in a major character (and sometimes two) being killed off in almost every chapter.  Heart pounding excitement.  Now that I'm well into \\"A Feast for Crows\\" I view it as an interlude.  Sure there's not nearly the excitement, but GRRM's imagination runs rampant. His use of language (\\"...but what Wat was really wanting was a woman.), creation of new worlds, and allusion to other works (Arya as Sweet Molly Mallone selling mussels and cockles) is nothing short of amazing.  Who else would come up with Canker Jeyne (who is really a man) as a name for a prostitute.  Cersei finally gets to run the whole show (or thinks she does) in Westeros.  Jaime develops a soul. Sure, I miss Danarys, and most of all Tyrion, but they'll be back.  Meanwhile we get to follow Arya as she crosses paths with Samwell in Braavos, and follow Brienne as she finally learns the fate of the Dog from the Elder Brother on the Quiet Isle during her travels with the wonderful Septon Meribald and his Dog. And what about the story lines developing in Dorne and the Iron Islands.  Another great book from GRRM.  Can't wait to read \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\"

1612130283|4.0|I had to read this hyped book that had sold out in every book store and was a hard catch, and YES I paid extra to get it....<br />The start of the book is catchy and it's a page turner, you get caught up in it and want to read more, it's exciting!<br />After a while it fades a bit as you can only blush so many times and describe a beautiful man in so many ways, and also a sexual experience high has it's limits.<br />All in all it's a good read and it takes you to some interesting ventures in the S&D's world of wishes and demands. The dark secrets that lie behind this behavior is also explored.<br />Every chapter is full of tension and suspension.

B004XDYJRU|1.0|Great app, but how come now updates for coming up to a year, yet several updates on the Google Play store.  Regret buying this app via Amazon now.<br /><br />Just want to add, contacted Tunein Support and they claimed the following: \\"The updated app goes to Google first and then to the other app stores. This is to ensure when the app is released across all vendors, it is bug free. Its generally no more than a week's difference between the releases.\\"<br /><br />Nothing true about that.  I replied asking for clarification, still haven't heard back from their support team.  The app on Google Play is now on version 6.1 and was last updated on 13 April 2012.  The app on the Amazon app store was last updated on 20 April 2011 (i.e. when it was released and is version 5.4).  Very poor support.

I think this book is a great guide for women who don't always get the signals and behaviors men exhibit when \\"He's Just Not That Into You.\\" My motto is, don't sleep with the guy until after you've walked down the aisle.  I dated a guy for several months and told him in the very beginning about my beliefs...he seemed kind, genuine, attentive...but after quite some time he said to me during our last date, \\"You mean you're really never going to sleep with me??!!\\"  Like it was coming as a total surpise or something.  When I told him \\"No.\\" His exact words were, \\"Oh no, I can't have that.\\"  That was the last time I saw him! Good Riddance! Guess that told me what he \\"really\\" wanted. But at least he wasn't walking away with my heart!  And that was awesome!  He walked away the loser in many respects.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun app for free. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone! The little guy runs pretty fast.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I find that this game does a great job of showing the process necessary to begin a civilization after traveling to the west.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Interesting to read and compare to the TV version.  Also interesting to observe how Dickens could use language and convey feelings and subtle humour.  A worthwhile exercise for anyone interested in literature and language.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is probably one of the most fun/addicting games I have on my kindle fire. But it does sometimes get annoying with having to save up energy but other than that, it's awesome!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|TeamLava games have a COIN BUG.  They cannot add your earnings correctly.  Check the TeamLava forums to read the MANY complains about earnings not being added it.  This game also hosts many \\"GemTraps\\".  For those who don't mind paying real money for \\"gem items\\" TL does not always allow you to use the gems that YOU PAID for things you want.  They STEAL them from you in sneaky ways.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All I can say right now is WOW! I got way more than I expected from book 2 in the series. I literally stayed up all night to finish this book because I couldn't put it down. Right when I got to the end of one chapter thinking I could put it down for the night, another surprising twist gripped me and I was pulled in for another chapter or two.<br /><br />Even though this book has us going back into the Hunger Games arena, there is nothing stale about it! The arena feels new...new setting, new terrors to be faced, and one amazing twist...this years tribute, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games, are all made up of past victors. This adds a new element to the story that didn't exist in book one. Alliances are stronger, as most of the tributes already know each other. Your heart is broken for those you KNOW won't survive the fight because they're so old or messed from their previous time in the arena. Underlying this is all of the tension building up in the districts because of talk of rebellion. Katniss' stunt in last year's hunger games have literally caught Panem on fire...I love how the title of the book fits into the theme so perfectly.<br /><br />I also love how we get to see how the Games have changed everyone...Katniss, a reluctant killer in the first book goes back into the arena swinging. She has no qualms about doing what's necessary. She's grown more calculating and precise, a very real side effect of what she's been through. Peeta is an even more noble hero than he was portrayed in book one, and he has firmly become my choice for Katniss. At the risk of sounding like one of those Twilight fangirls...Team Peeta!<br /><br />I REALLY loved how Rue is not lost in all of this. Even though she died in book one, she is a constant reminder to Katniss...the injustices committed by the Capitol are tied into her death, making the cause of the rebellion feel even stronger to me as I remember the picture of her body in my mind surrounded by flowers.<br /><br />The rebellion is at its climax by the end, and for now things are still a bit unclear. But I don't mind one bit the abrupt ending. I know I have much to look forward to in book 2. I can't wait to have my questions answered!/>The rebellion is at its climax by the end, and for now things are still a bit unclear. But I don't mind one bit the abrupt ending.

B000W9DSVW|4.0|I saw all of these movies when they came out in the theater the first time and loved them then. So needless to say that when I received them as a gift I was more than excited because I remember enjoying the movies when I was younger. The quality of my movies were fine, I didn't see any scratches on the disc or any sign that they were not new. Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to any fan of the Ocean's movies.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome game! I would recommend to anyone. I love building my own towns and seeing them flourish. I love all g5 games.

B000Q7Q2WM|5.0|I looked around for these for a while and was lucky to find a two pack for a great price. Their selection was good, and I plan to pick up a few more gems I haven't seen for a while.
B0052N3ERQ|3.0|I have an HP48 so I know whet the buttons should do. Many buttons don't do anything. For example,  the mode button should give you the opportunity to switch between scientific,  engineering,  and standard display formats. This mode button only allows you to switch between rpn and algebraic, and angle formats. Many, many more missing functions. Disappointing selection from the Amazon marketplace. Love my Kindle, though.
030716327X|5.0|I sought this out when I saw one at Barnes & Nobel for $20. This was less expensive and it was even more convenient to have it shipped instead of dragging my kids to the store. Box is a nice set up with an adorable stuffed bunny and the classic book that I remember from my own childhood.<br /><br />The only thing I wish that was different is the binding. My other child, now 6, ripped it apart in record time. My now 1 year old is watched closely while exploring this book so it does not have the same fate as book 1 :)
044024367X|1.0|Not really.  I didn't finish the book.  Why?  This isn't an action book.  This isn't a mystery book.  This isn't a thriller either. This is a \\"Move on.org\\" propaganda piece.  Now, for some of you, that may be your thing.  But consider this-the point of the story is not to entertain but to preach.  And to do so, Child wasts your time because he sets you up to believe that there is something mysterious going on that you just can't figure out as you breathlessly turn every page.  But what does he give you?  A lame political message. Child is neither clever enough nor astute enough to pull this off (Harper Lee he is not!).  I have lost a lot of respect for Child.
B002Z8IWMS|4.0|I found nothing new in Jobs's methodology, but much that was useful as reminders that preparation is everything. He was an obsessive, but on the right side inasmuch as his was a positive obsession aimed at being first class.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is much more enjoyable than others of its kind simply because you don't have yo spend any more than a couple of minutes at a time on it. Also, it is manageable to play the game without. buying anything.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I read this on my kindle and the first 30% was a bit slow but after that it picked right up and was a great read. Had all the characters we love and was a great story.

1469984202|5.0|The writer skillfully painted a picture in my mind of every character, place, plot, and grabbed me from the beginning.  I couldn't put it down and never wanted it to end.  It was very well written and an extremely creative story.  LOVED it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. easy to understand, glitch free, graphics does not hurt an eye, sounds are nice. Developers did a great job
B00701QVVY|5.0|The thrash revival, or more accurately, the second generation of thrashers that have risen in the shadows of greats like Slayer, Metallica (at least the first three albums) and Exodus features lots of hot young bands full of energy and chops, like Evile and Havok, for example.  But it's also interesting to note that the original generation of thrashers in many cases are putting out the strongest albums of their careers, as if to show the youngsters just who exactly pioneered this form of metal in the first place, and who can still blow those whippersnappers off the stage.<br />  No band embodies that description better than the mighty Overkill, who have released great thrash albums for three decades plus and if anything are getting more brutal with each new release.<br />  \\"The Electric Age\\" follows on the footsteps of their fantastic \\"Ironbound\\" album, an overlooked and under appreciated masterpiece from these NJ-NY titans.  Overkill fans and smart critics knew two things:  how good \\"Ironbound\\" was, and how there was little doubt these guys could follow up with an equally rocking new album.  Unlike some bands who have trouble following up legendary albums, it's no sweat for these guys on their 16th album.<br />  Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth remains a great thrash singer, full of chops and a fine lyricist to boot.  D.D. Verni, his long time partner in crime on bass, composes the music and as always, comes up with the goods.  \\"Electric Rattlesnake\\" is a fine heavy hitter of a single.  \\"Black Daze\\" recalls some of the bluesy rhythms of earlier times without sounding one bit wimpy and \\"Save Yourself\\" follows in the vein of \\"Bring On The Night\\" from \\"Ironbound\\".<br />  Guitarists Derek Tailor and Dave Linsk are punishing riff masters, with Linsk providing his usual killer lead work.  Verni locks in with Ron Lipnicki's furious drumming, and the overall result is thrash that demands your attention and respect.  The production shines and Overkill show once again why they should have been one of the Big Four instead of a few other bands.  They've certainly put out great consistent albums without the long dry spells, millions of personnel changes and strange forays into \\"Lulu\\" land.  \\"The Electric Age\\" may not get the attention it deserves, but you can rectify that by picking it up or ordering it and help Overkill take its rightful place as thrash titans in the minds of all metal fans, not just their die hard fans.have been one of the Big Four instead of a few other bands.

The last book was a little let down given the ending, but it left me wanting more! Where are the characters now? What are they up to?

B000PMLFRA|3.0|(UPDATE of May 30, 2013: I updated this review to correct an error or two and to further emphasize some of my thoughts. Original review was April 10, 2012.)<br /><br />Although I was not a fan of this saga in the beginning - and it's still not in my top ten - I have these episodes in my VHS collection so I thought I knew the story, although I obviously haven't watched them in a while. After I got through *this* series (on Blu-ray), I seemed to be a bit disoriented and - yes - disappointed. To paraphrase a GWB Secretary of Defense, there were things I knew I knew, things I thought I knew, things I didn't know I knew, things I knew I didn't know, and things I absolutely didn't know. It made me appreciate the *Star Trek* series even more than I already did. Then again, maybe all the progress in video production and display, e.g., Blu-ray, flat-screen TV's, etc., has magnified the pimples and pockmarks of past portrayals.<br /><br />Just a few things I remembered differently, perhaps incorrectly due to the passage of time: the portrayal of the time Luke Skywalker spent with his aunt and uncle (didn't remember it like this); the light saber duel between Luke and Darth Vader (it seemed strange); Luke's introduction to Yoda; the bar scene with all the alien creatures (not as fascinating).<br /><br />I could be wrong; my mind may have meshed and melded these scenes with those from other episodes. However, I cannot escape from the idea that I may have been hoodwinked and lured (perhaps not by Amazon, but by 20th Century Fox or Lucasfilm or George Lucas himself) into a purchase of something that is, like many purported antiques found to be fakes, an unreasonable facsimile of the original.<br /><br />On the other hand, I enjoyed getting reacquainted with all the fascinating, unique, timeless, and humorous characters, including R2-D2, C-3PO, Chewbacca, Yoda, the Ewoks, and Darth Vader (you've got to admit that sometimes you laughed at some of the things Vader said and did).<br/><br />All in all this trilogy is a less-than-satisfying regurgitation of a self-proclaimed classic. It made the recent Star Trek prequel all the more satisfying to me, as well as my recent TV series acquisitions, Battlestar Galactica, and Firefly.<br /><br />Although I had not seen even one episode until I purchased it recently, Battlestar Galactica has become one of my favorite TV series (alongside Stargate SG-1). Even so, like Stargate, it got a bit convoluted and plodding in its later episodes. Paraphrasing a now-deceased friend of mine, they finished those series a long time before they quit.<br /><br />Firefly has also earned a spot in my list of favorites. Though a bit off-beat and short (having been abruptly and inexplicably terminated by its parent company, to the utter consternation of its fans), it has a captivating premise and intriguing character development, and the roles couldn't have been cast better.<br /><br />Check these series out, especially if, like me, you were disillusioned by Star Wars Episodes IV-VI.

B005Y423ZC|4.0|We don't realize it, but everything we see, touch, and hear; we criticize. We all have a certain criteria in our heads telling us what we think of something. When it comes to watching a concert on DVD, there are things we all want to see. The singer should have good eye contact and body language with the audience. Don't want the singer looking and giving off bad vibes. Also they shouldn't just sing the entire time. Yes, that's what they are there for and what you paid for, but there should be some interaction with the crowd, and having the singer trying to make some jokes, if possible. Lastly, the performance should be worth it, not something you feel like walking out on. Adele Live at the Royal Albert Hall is an amazing concert DVD.<br /> She is constantly looking at the crowd. There isn't one moment when she is looking down or away. Even to the people who were on the balcony, she would look and wave so happily. Constantly seeing her emotions and seeing how she was really feeling. Whether she said how she was feeling or not, you could see it all in her body. Pure happiness and adrenaline in her body and voice, but still presented herself so amazingly.<br /> In the beginning of Adele's show, she came out and instantly sang, but every two to three songs, she would stop, and just talk and laugh with the crowd. Cracking jokes and explaining her songs. Cameron Adams and Allison Stewart agreed about how talkative and loveable Adele really is. She explains where almost every song came from and how she felt about it. Adele said in the DVD that she doesn't really know how she's feeling until she listens to her songs. The jokes she made were just utterly great. In many parts she is dropping F bombs and saying she wasn't the complete victim, but rather a B. Cameron Adams said in an article that she is quite the potty mouth. If you watch the DVD you will truly see that. However, it's also what made her so funny with the way she talked and that she was completely herself. I feel it really makes everyone feel better when they can all laugh and talk together. Barry Walters also comments in his articles about her jokes.<br /> Of course though, we have finally made it to the last thing....HER PERFORMACE!! We all don't want to spend money on something we don't like, end up not liking, etc. This DVD was definitely worth spending money on. The power behind her voice is tremendous. People and Rolling Stone have especially ranted and raved about how her voice sounds, even in person. Many amateur reviewers agreed as well. Her singing and overall performance is great. You don't really get any better than her voice. She started a few songs over as well, because she didn't like the way it sounded. She actually made the effort to improve her voice in front of a live audience.<br /> This concert DVD meets these three for sure requirements I have, plus many more. Completely astounded and taken away with her performance in this show. I couldn't have spent my money on anything better. Definitely recommending this not just to Adele fans, but to someone who is trying to experience or watch something new. You won't regret buying the DVD. It really is great, even from anyone's overall standards.
B0055SWM08|5.0|game is just worth it if you plan and just chilling out or if you randomly have your big kindle handy while waiting somewhere.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple game, yet it makes you think.<br />Just fun and addictive.<br />High quality graphics and many levels.<br />It was free, but would have been worth paying.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. this is so awesome.  I reccomend this game to people who like this type of game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|makes you think.  the music is calming, controls are smooth.  no bugs and the touch is very responsive.  this app is a perfect score in my book
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I love this movie it is one of my all time favorites!  Great love story and Hugh Jackman is gorgeous!!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I would have given this book in general 6 stars! I was really shocked to see how many 1-2 stars this book had gotten. I was also disappointed with all the excuses. Some just didn't make any sense. My absolute favorite part in the book though, was the beginning of the chapter 'Long Night'. It was the night before the wedding. I loved the wedding too though. I read one review where she didn't like the wedding because she felt Bella should have been pissed that it was all about Edward. That Bella should have participated in the planning more. First off, that's the point. The whole wedding was planned around Edward! Why? Because Bella hates being the center of attention, and because she really didn't care. As long as she ended up with him, she was happy. I was kinda pissed at Jacob when he got made at Bella though. It kinda ruined the night. I had already heard what was gonna happen on the honeymoon b4 it happened, so technically it wasn't that big of a surprise. I was shocked how helpful and pushy and protective Rose was. I knew how badly she wanted children, but I guess what shocked me was how far she was willing to go to get Bella's baby. She didn't car whether she lived ir died, like Jacob had said. I loved the 'Part 2', the one from Jacob's point of view. I love how she made him this.k and talk like most people these days do, with slang and not such big words like Edward and Bella. I also found it interesting to hear the other pack members and to get to know them better. Also it was Coll to hear about the confrontations and secret conversation him and Edward had. Everybody thinks the name Renesemee is stupid. I love it! It was very creative, and kike Edward said, was uniquie quite like the situation its self. Carlie was interesting for the middle name.<br /><br />Overall I loved the book, and would recommend the entire series to anybody.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This Angry Birds is one of my favorites.  Some of it is really a challange. Would love to see more of this type.  Maybe Hawaii!!

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have had my kindle for about 3 years now and have the App on my cell phone for just as long.In the past I would have rated this a 5 star app, but my review is based on the newest version.  I have always loved the fact that I could have a book with me anywhere I went, but with this newest upgrade to the Andriod App,, thats just not the case.  Ever since I have upgraded to the newest version I can't access the program at all.  I try to open it on my phone and it just sits in the first window. I can't even force a close.  I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice, with the same results. This leads me to believe it is the app.  I don't have any problems with any other apps on my phone.  I hope they do a newer version soon so i can get my Kindle back on my cell phone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|can b a challenge but 5 star all the way one of my favorites.  played yesterday... had to use a hint though.... grrrrr ;)

B0046MOV9Y|5.0|The tour it self is outstanding, Leona sings more perfect live than in recording, the special effects are great, there's a lot of entertainment. One thing I didn't like is that when i got the DVD it was slightly torn, I think it was a used one but I bought it at the price of a new one.
B007OUFESC|2.0|I was quite underwhelmed by \\"A Dangerous Method\\".  I am firmly of the view that the fame attaching to the film has preceded it.  I expected more and came away disappointed.<br /><br />The movie covers the overlapping in the lives of the two of the 20th century's great minds, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  The cause of their meeting was, ostensibly, one of Jung's patients, a wealthy Russian Jewess, Sabrina Spielrein.  She comes to Jung in an extremely distressed state after having been institutionalised.  It is here that the acting is first rate.  Keira Knightly plays Spielrein and is extremely plausible.  It is not an easy task to convince the audience of madness.  Knightly succeeds totally.<br /><br />In the course of her sessions with Jung, the two become sexually involved.  This is, of course, contrary to accepted protocols.  Jung is aware of this and is deeply conflicted. The fact that his wife is pregnant at the time only serves to heighten the emotional conflict that is running through Jung.  Freud is also unhappy with his behaviour.<br /><br />The essence of the film is the interplay of these three main characters.  Unfortunately, the drama comes to no great heights.  It seems to end abruptly and the viewer is left feeling somewhat cheated.  This is a pity.  The film had more to offer.  It had an excellent cast with a fascinating subject to explore.
B0055SWM08|4.0|A fun little game.  Calm logical steps are the best way around the levels.  if you're looking for fast paced action,this is not the game for you
B007PTJOV0|4.0|a ton of fun. a lot like Mario brothers. I always read reviews before I get a game..even if it is a free game. love the game so far!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Where do I begin....I really don't know how to put my feelings about Wool into words. The Wool series is simply a masterpiece. A refreshingly original masterpiece. I think that the best way to describe Wool is to call it a roller-coaster ride. The book's biggest strength is how unpredictable the story is. You will NOT see Hugh Howey's literary thunderbolts coming. Absolutely EVERY single Wool (parts 1-5) has a shocking twist and ending. At one point, EVERY single chapter blew my mind, shattered it into a million pieces and left me questioning my existence. The Wool series is THAT good. It is amazing how consistently Hugh Howey manages to turn the story upside down without it getting tiresome. The book was impossible to put down because this. After a while, you simply know that the more you read, the better the story gets. Hugh Howey simply does not lift his foot of the pedal for a single second. The Wool series is a refreshingly original, intriguing, amazing and mind blowing story.    I can't wait for more Wool books, I will be one of the first to buy them for sure! Also, I simply can't wait for the inevitable movie release of Wool. The story would translate extremely well onto the big screen and if done right, it will surely become a classic just as the books surely will.    P.S You can go to Hugh Howey's website [...] and order SIGNED copies of the books! Just imagine yourself a few years from now. Hugh Howey is an award-winning author, the Wool series is a worldwide sensation heralded by literary critics and labelled as a classic, the movie adaptation has just won an Oscar for Best Picture. And you will be there, holding a signed copy of Wool, by the man himself, Hugh Howey.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Enjoying this app very much! I like the challenge! It starts out simple, then becomes pretty challenging!! Worth the money!
B0055SWM08|2.0|How? This is a clone of one of the oldest mobile games. Not quite Snake, but old. Yes, it looks great and has been given a nice atmosphere, but that should not be all that you're getting with an upgrade in hardware.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is fun. I would recommend for the person that likes fun free games. its just like Mario but with lepercons.
0802798225|5.0|Loved this book. This author is easily one of my faves. No boring \\"fluff\\" romance here. Great, unique story line and characters with depth.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great Mario like game. You have no reason to pass on this game. Unless you just hats fun games.
B00000JBFW|5.0|This come back by the classic PURPLE on 84, PERFECT STRANGERS is a great album! I like all the songs, especially the title track, UNDER THE GUN, MEAN STREAK and GYPSY´S KISS!!!If you like the HEAVY ROCK from DEEP PURPLE you probably will like this one!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Lacks a large amount of levels and I could've gotten the free version... If it was available on the app store! How come itunes gets more privileges on the game (heard they offer more levels while we have to pay .99 for them)
B0055SWM08|4.0|great way to kill some time between classes. However I always find it annoying that an app nags me to review.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I rate this a five ! I was crazy about Mario as a teenager and this brought back many good memories. Keep up the good work!
0385523394|5.0|The writer describes her experiences during her 13 month stay in Danbury prison for women. It was engrossing, funny and moving.  Her account comes across as very honest, as she relates dealing with prison life and her relationships with fellow prisoners.  Many parts of her story are incredibly moving, particularly the stories about her relationships.  I'm not sure why some of the reviewers gave such low ratings,  seemingly taking issue with her background (white, middle class, Ivy League educated) as if that invalidates her experience and makes it less legitimate.  The author acknowledges that in some cases she was treated differently than her non-white inmates.  I was impressed that she came through the experience with a different perspective on how class and race affects ones lot in life, made the best of her situation and gave back to others as they gave to her.  (Also, in the book, she mentions in passing that her father is a school teacher, so it does NOT seem like she is Paris Hilton as one reviewer snidely commented).  Heck, is it her fault that she has the stereotypical characteristics of the all-american girl and had a semi privileged background?  It seems like some reviewers have a reverse prejudice here--they should try to be as open to this author and her story as the inmates were.  She IS pretty and she IS smart and she IS well educated, but to me it didn't feel like she was tooting that horn so much as acknowledging that she was aware of the differences between her and many of her friends in prison.  If anything, having the background she did probably made it harder for her to be accepted by her inmates, who fortunately saw her for the person she was, and did.  Over and over throughout the story I got the impression she thought she was fortunate AND that she WAS repentant.  A follow up version would be nice with some word on how she is doing now and how some of her prison friends are doing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it has fun artistic games and its arcade and really cool and super super awsome
B0055SWM08|5.0|love it on my kindle fire. nice graphics, makes you think. would definitely buy other products from Fallen Tree Games.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The graphics are stunning - not so much that an adult with ADHD is overwhelmed but not boring which leads to boredom - the music is soothing, colors are in perfect balance. Works great on my kf. The only things I don't like is that after only 10 minutes I'm already addicted and the &quot;hint&quot; option. I can either use earned coins to gain access to it or get the solution from fb. That wouldn't be a problem if the solution was actually there. Apart from that issue, it's one of the best apps I've found.
0316098329|2.0|I didn't get it. I so wanted to like it, all the accolades and great reviews. Maybe it's me. Am I just a high maintenance reader? Anyhow, I found it slow moving, boring and not too believable. I too was irritated with the little kid narrative. I gave up after about 50 pages...
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun and challenging game with a lot of levels and great graphics. Best original puzzle game I have played in a while.
1401937519|2.0|I borrowed this book. The synopsis sounded interesting and hopeful. Having lost my mother and BIL to cancer in the last few years, I am no stranger to fear, anger, and a host of other negative emotions. Cancer, has become my biggest fear. It's the new boogeyman in my life. First of all, I take great exception for the claim in the synopsis, that she \\"Knows' what caused her cancer. I enjoyed some of the book, in the beginning when she speaks of growing up in Hong Kong, the various schools she attended, all the times she felt like she didn't fit in.. how she railed against the pressure of arranged marriage, and her father's unwillingness to allow her to study abroad. She is diag. with lymphoma , looks into alternative therapies. She does have some traditional treatment. she glosses over that. Chemotherapy, blood transfusions etc. She really wants us to believe that she's cured because of the great epiphany she had after her NDE and the flow and release of all those negative emotions she kept bottled inside of her. Well maybe that is the case, I don't think so. It's not a long book but I found it slow moving, repetitive at times . This is a short story stretched into a novel. I wish her well though.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|The Cog does it again with this one from start to finish. Real instruments on a CD are rare these days. Buy this CD you will love it!!!

B0001I561E|5.0|Product & price were great ! My grandkids were happy Birthday & so was I. I recommend this dvd as a great gift & as an wonderful start to or an addition to a Disney collection .
B0055SWM08|5.0|reminds me of pokemon when you have to slide across ice to advance in the caves. my only complaint is that I bought it before it became free app of the day. totally worth the money though. simple and challenging and even has some replay value if you want to get each level perfect.
B000063DI9|5.0|Their last great album.  Everything that is good about Maiden is here.  Amazing song structure with strong hooks, awesome solos, Harris' masterful command of the bass and Dickerson's soaring vocals.  After this...it was never the same.
B0055SWM08|1.0|it's stupid unless your a mother trying to find something to help your kid get smarter. if it's not that your just a nerd doing a tiny lame maze.
0767812387|5.0|I had a lot of expectations on this film because I enjoyed much when I was little and it didn't let me down. Amazing movie!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. There are lots of mini quests and you get a decent amount of energy. I'm really enjoying it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a pretty fun game. not a bad way to kill some time.<br /><br />I remember playing the original in school.
B007Q476KU|1.0|I have to agree with the other one star raters, this film profiles abuse of horses and very little else. I would not want my kids to watch this and I turned it off halfway through - no point or enjoyment in watching further. I was wondering why it was out of the theaters so quick and available on demand - now, I know!
6305784116|5.0|Aristocats is a delightful family cartoon that has been enjoyed for decades. I Owned it when it was first released on VHS, and am glad I could finally find a copy on dvd...not an easy task. Cute characters, great voice-overs, and adorable music :)
B006C1DH92|4.0|it's a great game but it downloaded so slowly on my kindle fire. this is still a great game to play for all you kids out there.
B006ZCWTV0|3.0|A little disappointed in the latest from Bruce and the Band. Outside of Wrecking Ball, which is not new, the other track worth listening to is Jack of all Trades. The rest were okay, but not really memorable. Still love Bruce!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|My young daughter and I stumbled onto an online version of the movie/video one day and that led to me purchasing the CD and now the DVD.  She has watched the movie/video 3-4 times already and can't seem to get enough.  The songs are pretty catchy and the movie/video itself tells a pretty interesting story.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I beat this knife up 3 days in a row while on a camping trip.batoning alot of wood with a 3 in. thick piece of wood. i had no problems at all.will be buying another one
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really fun puzzle game with no glitches and great music! So glad to see that it's the Amazon free App of the day!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game works great on my gtablet. Tutorial is very helpful. The puzzles are simple at first and then increase in difficulty. Smooth action - great control.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Saw this at theaters and loved it so much I just had to buy the Blu-Ray. It made me cry at the theaters and  it  made me cry at home. It's a great, for family. Gruff and loner Charlie is in debt and tries to sell his child he never met.after his wife dies. The story alone is great. A must see!
B007SK8WJ6|5.0|Violence seemed to lay over this entire episode so that one got the increasingly unsettling feeling that a much more violent age was coming.  And indeed it was.<br /><br />For one, we open the episode with the Speck killing of the 8 student nurses in Chicago.  A man killing eight women is no longer an unprecedented event.  We recall that we didn't even seem to have serial killers in the sixties.  That was to come.  The people of the time are fascinated by it but they don't even want a girl like Sally to know about it.  She, of course, digs it out of the trash, when no one will let her read the paper.<br /><br />Then there is this dark fairytale version of CINDERELLA by the new copywriter.  The client is so fascinated by it that he buys it on the spot. Our new guy has a dark imagination, just what is needed for the times ahead.<br /><br />Then there is Don Draper himself who goes home sick only to in his fevered state commit a violent act in a vivid hallucination. Don seems to have a lot of repressed violence inside of him which also seems ominous for the future.<br /><br />And we come into contact with the Vietnam War, where some people love it and find themselves, like Joan's husband, who has always been merely inept stateside.  But most, of course, are coming to hate it, and bloody demonstrations are going to spread from civil rights to anti war.<br /><br />Some start taking Seconal, a sedative, so they won't feel any of it.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Ordered this item whilst in Australia to be sent to Australia<br />it said it would take up to six weeks for delivery, arrived in less than three<br />It was a present for my daughter, who loved it<br />even with postage the whole thing worked out cheaper than buying it from a store in Australia
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is sooooo good! I absoloutly love it. awesome levels. it is the best game ever. just buy it you won't regret it!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read a few reviews before I purchased the book, so I knew there was going to be some bdsm not a problem. I read the Twilight series and am really confused as to why this was said to be an adult version. I see no similarities except the male and female leads are indecisive. I agree with everyone about how annoying the inner goddess and lip bitting references were. Also I have read better sex scenes in the $.99 short stories offered on Amazon. I mean we are talking about bdsm and you cant even use the word ass,even butt would have been better than my behind. Some very Vanilla language. Then the red room of pain doesnt make her run for the door but her getting spanked does.?. I read the whole trilogy thinking it would get better, and I was wrong. Oh well lesson learned.  Also considering that all three books are about 70% sex scenes how could this be made into a movie?
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It is a pretty cool se-Quell I guess you can call it. I also reccomend Quell X! The newest Quell game. Quell X is a futuristic based Quell game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|truly one of the best games I have ever played. very beautiful and visually appealing! I recommend it to anyone of any age. truly inspiring.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is what you could call beast due to its awesomeness. Its sequel, Quell Reflect is marvelous as well. Quell X however, could be better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I play this game it help pass the time at work. when you first start playing the games are simple and quick but as you play you gain points and get the longer more challenging games. great fun game
B0055SWM08|4.0|it involves alot of problem solving, thinking, and logic. I  love it so much it is really good it is also really cool and fun
B0062NAX1U|1.0|This movie is such a disaster, I don't even know where to begin. It has no focus, it's slow, there's no main character, the acting is wooden, the plot just sort of dissolves, the production looks and feels cheap. Even the spiritual messages are all over the map. Worst of all, it's really really boring.<br /><br />It starts ok. A new cop joins a small town police force and for a while he's the de facto protagonist. I figured we the audience would get to follow and learn with him as he struggled to adjust to his new environment and job, but the movie quickly loses track. There's a surprisingly well done chase scene, the other cops  get a cursory  introduction and the writer sort of hints that a local gang chapter will become the antagonist. Then the movie  forgets  all about the rookie cop for a while and  just sort of meanders around  as it explains all the different officers' troubled family dynamics. It's a little unevenly paced, but so far it's not too far off from regular Katheryn Bigelow-style cop drama. There's some Christian messages worked into the script fairly organically. The police chief overtly stating the movie's main thesis was kind of clumsy, but it wasn't too offensive. It's a pretty dry sequence though, (a hint of things to come)  so they throw in another chase to pick up the movie's energy but this one doesn't work as well. The \\"slingshot maneuver\\", wherein a speeding police car whips the tail around so the officer sitting in the back seat can leap out the door ,taking advantage of the cars centrifugal forge, made my eyes involuntarily roll. I don't care if that's a real thing police officers do. The way they shot it was cheesy and it looks stupid. It's made worse by the fact that it's the last boost of energy the movie gives us before spiraling into melancholy.<br /><br />Around this time we are introduced to Javier, a Mexican day laborer. He is poor and desperate and out of work. He can only afford a tortilla for lunch. But he is a good Christianand he trusts that the lord will find him some work. At the same time he's out looking for work, one of the officers mentions to his colleagues that he's building a shed and needs a worker. One of the officers recommends someone also named Javier, but not the Javier we have been introduced to. By lucky coincidence/divine intervention, Javier 2 doesn't show up and the first Javier happens to be walking by, praying for help. The officer, mistaking him for Javier 2, calls him by name to help build a shed. This leads to the stupidest, laziest \\"Who's on First\\" ripoff I've ever seen.  I'm paraphrasing but it's something like \\"My friend just told me Javier couldn't make it. Who are you?\\" \\"I'm Javier\\" \\"No Javier couldn't make it! Who are you?\\" \\"I'm Javier\\"  Its just painful. It's like watching wit itself die before your eyes.<br /><br />I guess around here the writer noticed that nothing was happening and he needed something to kick the movie into gear so in comes the 9-11 moment where a horrible incident galvanizes the cops into action. I thought maybe the wise old chief would be killed by the gang members so the cops would have to step up and lead themselves. Maybe they could rehabilitate the bad guys with their christian message or something? No,the film makers instead go the opposite direction. A character we have only seen once before is killed off camera in a car accident. At this point the movie comes to such an abrupt stop it felt like getting flung through a windshield. The movie loses all pretenses of storytelling and falls into a solid hour or so of grief counceling.  It's characters crying, people assuring them that God has a plan and soft piano music for what feels like forever. I don't know why they thought this would make for good popcorn entertainment. I guess one of the film makers wandered into a funeral home and said to himself \\"Now THIS is entertainment! This is what audiences want\\".<br /><br />The worst part is that they cap it with a joke.  Seriously.I've been sitting there for an hour trying to let the filmmakers establish a tone that manipulates me into feeling sad but they end it by having the grieving father do a call back joke wherein he accidentally ends a phone conversation to his boss with \\"I love you\\". The movie is completely tone deaf. We go from crying about a dead child to wacky sitcom fare in under a minute. It's jarring and confusing and symptomatic of the biggest problem this movie faces: it has no idea what it wants to be. The tone and the pacing are in such a wild flux it feels like four or five movies stitched together like Frankenstein. Theres a cop movie sewn to an ABC Family drama stitched to a \\"Coping with Loss\\" self help tape, combined with a \\"purity ring\\" sermon, the worst sitcoms you've ever seen and just a dash of \\"The Shield\\"<br /><br />So the upshot of the extended grief sequence is that the grieving father ( who's suddenly  the main character for the rest of the film) comes up with a radical pledge that he will be a good Christian leader for  his family. All the other cops and Javier take the pledge too.  This leads to a strange purity ring segment that feels completely out of context.  The scene where the rookie cop takes his daughter to a fancy restaurant and proposes to keep her virginity until the lord shows him a man worth giving her away to is bizarre. If you're going to shoehorn in that sort of message you have to be careful with how you handle it, and they completely drop the ball.  It feels out of place and creepy.<br /><br />Next up comes the ending from a completely different movie. The film makers cut back to the gang members here and there throughout the movie to remind you that they still exist. They'll show them hanging out in abandoned warehouses or beating up a kid to initiate him into the gang but nothing ever really comes of it. Theres no comeuppance or confrontation. They're just sort of set aside in favor of a new bad guy.  It's never been mentioned before the last half hour of the movie but someone has been stealing evidence. The cops do some sleuthing and figure out its one of their close cop friends. The movie tries to express a conflict, because turning in the cop will tarnish the reputation of their precinct but they don't really seem to struggle with it at all and the fallout of their decision is never shown. Instead they agree to watch after the disgraced cops family for him and send him to a federal prison, which may as well be a death sentence for a cop, but there's no follow up so who cares? Afterwards they have a picnic and the grieving father holds a toast challenging the officers to be moral Christian leaders.  He's not looking at the camera but he's talking directly to the audience like Ferris Bueller. I get that theyr'e trying to leave the audience with some sort of message but the dialogue is so stilted it just rips you out of what's left of the story right before credits roll. May as well have smacked him over the head with a boom mic.<br /><br />I really want to like this movie but I can't.  A straightforward movie about cop drama laced in Christian allegory couldve been really good but this movie is too pretentious, lazy and bloated. The movie treats you like you're an idiot, and leaves nothing for you to figure out or interpret. Everything is painted in broad strokes. The messages are tenuously tied to what can laughingly be called the plot and treated with such heavy handedness it felt at times like it was scolding me. There's no subtlety. The humor is stale, uncomfortable and  stingily doled out.  Looking at it from an objective storytelling point of view, it's a complete failure. It's like the story was an afterthought. There are so many incomplete arcs and unresolved issues it makes me wonder if they even had a script when they started filming. If you want a strong Christian message and nothing else, this is your film. If you care about things like plot or story or character development stay far faraway. This movie is not for you.

0439023491|2.0|The end of The Hunger Games was promising, leaving a love triangle, with Katniss at its center, and a brewing revolution among the districts unresolved. Catching Fire took these finely woven threads and tied them into an incoherent, ponderous knot.<br /><br />Due to the book's limited, first-person perspective, large-scale events, like the revolution, can only be hinted at, talked about, and related third hand. Imagine a book about the Iraq War told by the Washington Post Pentagon reporter. Wouldn't you rather hear the story from the reporter embedded with expeditionary forces?<br /><br />The victory tour temporarily resolves this problem, as Katniss and Peeta get to see the oppressive living conditions in the other districts and gauge the revolutionary mood of the people. Afterwards, whispers of discontent and fleeting news reports become gossip fodder for whole chapters. District 12's submission to a Capitol crackdown brings the situation to a simmer, but author Suzanne Collins shies away from showing us the flashpoint, the \\"catching fire,\\" if you will. Whatever happens, it is always happening somewhere else.<br /><br />Katniss spends much of the book in hysterics over her presumptuous commitment to protect everyone in her close-knit circle, keeping up pretenses for the Capitol, juggling two fake romances, and helping along the revolution, all at the same time. When she is--yawn--summoned back to the arena for the second year in a row, her mind is always on something other than the arena action, which might be this book's saving grace.<br /><br />The arena action is so rushed and cartoonish that the reader quickly becomes desensitized. Collins throws in everything but the kitchen sink: seizure-inducing fog, flesh-eating monkeys, tsunamis, etc. Pharaoh had it easy compared to these tributes. The arena in The Hunger Games, by contrast, had depth and felt real. As the reader you absorbed it, marinated in it, rather than had it forced on you.<br /><br />All of Katniss' juvenile babblings, preoccupations, and forced logical deductions are for naught. Because she is such a small fish and an emotional tumble dryer, the people in the know don't entrust her with any information until the last chapter, wherein a nauseating bit of exposition explains everything neither she nor the reader could have possibly figured out on his own.<br /><br />The end result is a book in which the stakes couldn't be higher, but the shots are being called elsewhere, while the \\"heroine\\" stumbles around thinking she has an effect on the outcome. What a waste of time.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the development of Peeta as a character. We see he has other emotions than caring for Katniss. He reacts angrily when Katniss and Haymitch reveal a secret they were keeping from him (one of several Collins engineered to artificially maintain the tension). It's good to know he's not the complete sissy the first book made him out to be. Gale by contrast is as duplicitous as Katniss. One minute he wants to flee into the forest, the next he wants to fight the good fight. Count me in Peeta's corner, if you must, but I won`t be reading the third book to see who Katniss finally choses.' juvenile babblings, preoccupations, and forced logical deductions are for naught.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|very good item, so nice, perfect and elegant. I enjoy it so much. I receved it before the normal time, from usa to mexique.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Had this on LP in another lifetime, which has long since disappeared. When I heard Beck was writing new new, decided to buy the disc. This is just great stuff!
0596007124|5.0|I am college student who has done a lot with java. I know java very well and can code with no problem but I often encountered problems when designing and creating large applications in my spare time. This is definitely my answer. I am about half way through the book, and I gotta say I get so excited when I am reading it! lol. It is really good to learn new design patterns. I have not read any other books like this though so I cannot compare it to anything. I definitely feel like I am learning something. I have not had time to apply any of the patterns yet since I work a lot and go to school.<br /><br />Coding with design patterns makes your life so much easier. Sure you can come up with your own but like me you might end up crossing your code back and forth into an un-extensible, messy coded program.<br /><br />This book is based on Java.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|ive really enjoyed this game. its like cityville in the frontier. I can recommend this game for the price paid
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Another person commented that Emma stones character is someone you would want to be friends with. This person was right on. This movie has got great witty dialogue, scenes that are original, and lol hilarious. This is Emma stones best film in my opinion. If you have got time to spare and want to laugh it up check it out.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. made it even better when I figured out the hints option. one of the better games for kindle fire.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I just finished Defending Jacob.  I found the structure quite different with two court proceedings inersperced.  I found the character development very good.  I found the story compelling but quite disturbing.  I guess I still like happy endings and this was far from it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is well written and seems to be geared towards a young teen audience.  I did enjoy it, but had to ignore some obvious and unimaginative plot points and background story.  The characters are interesting and enjoyable, if a little shallow.  With a little more story and plot development, and some more work getting the audience to believe that these kids would jump into a battle to the death, the book could have went higher.
0439023483|5.0|I got this book for my son but ended up reading it first. I couldn't put it down. Then I couldn't wait to see the movie so I took him the next night. I cannot get the characters out of my head. There is so much to this book. Some parents are saying it is a scary death book but they know nothing about it then. It is very much a love story and a book about triumph. I want to see the movie again and read the book again.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Very excited to start reading these books and completely thrilled that I was able to get them on my kindle AND as a bundle (save some money)!  But as they are four separate books, I really wish they had made it four separate files on my kindle. Yes, you can always flip to table of contents to quickly jump between books, but I still find myself wishing they were separate files. It's not worth the additional cost to buy separately, it's just more of an inconvenience to keep in mind!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I'm not sure how I felt about this book.  It was entertaining, but wasn't nearly as amazing as everyone thought.  That's just my opinion.  I did like Katniss' character.  I don't think this book needed to go any further than 1 book though.
B00532A8JI|5.0|SymphonyX does it again. This album rocks. Great vocals, great musicianship. It is heavy, melodic, and powerful. It has that perfect blend of heavy. If you are into progressive metal than I  strongly recommend adding this one to your collection. Buy it already
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. Really easy to follow a reading plan. would highly recommend this app. Very easy to navigate thru.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Excellent movie-I praise God for this \\"wake up call\\" for His church. May men resolve to lead their families as never before, and His people come to the truth that our greatest need is for Him to work in our family life for His glory and honor alone!
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Love Lady Antebellum!! Their new album, \\"Own the Night\\" is great, and who can beat $.25 for the whole thing?!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Got it for free and was pleasantly surprised at how well made it is. It is so relaxing and fun and still gives a good challenge. A nice well balanced game for the casual gamer.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very pleased with the game.  Downloaded to my kindle fire really quickly, has crisp graphics and multiple options in play.  Addictive :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is just like Mario although it is a lepracon but the controls are harder when you stop pushing the control it keeps walking for like 2 seconds. the only reason I gave 5 stars is bcuz the NER Brothers told me to so we can get more free updates.
0679809015|5.0|This was a gift for my 16month old daughter. she loved it on site.<br /><br />Open the Barn Door is a very tiny little book. However, my daughter loved flipping each page and making the animal noises then guessing which animal would be uncovered. The Flaps aren't easy to find, but this only added to the delight.<br /><br />Other then the size, my only dislike was the duck page. The flap on this page seemed to be glued shut and we were unable to get it open. I was able to open a small corner of the flap and bend it back a bit, but any further attempt would result in a torn duck and no flap.<br /><br />I assume this is an issue with my personal book and mention it because it IS our experience with the book. I haven't heard of anyone else having this issue. Other then this one flap, the rest of the flaps were in perfect condition and appeared to be brand new (never been used) condition.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I saw that it required an update. I looked and saw it wanted the permission to make phone calls, and they removed maps. I don't want it making calls or using my camera OR removing maps. Uninstalled. It was slow, and even requires GPS on to work. I warn buyers- even if It's free, it may do random things, and even spy on you. DO NOT, buy this app.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie.  It is an AWESOME movie, it show how you can take the easy way.  Also it shows how to cope with a family tragedy and how not to take anything for granted.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|its so fun! u can do so many levels and all the bricks r so colorful! its a great game!
B0055SWM08|5.0|they have a good system going where certain people are just happy they finished a challanging puzzle while others can take a more challanging route of trying to finish the fastest way.  well designed
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I love this app downloads are easy everything is self explanatory the only thing i dont like is its hard sometime to find what you want. Other then that i highly recommend this app!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|READ THIS BOOK!!!! It is life-changing! You look at everything different after you read this book! I fell in love with Jacob and the peculiar children. I found myself wishing I was there when I finished the book. I plan on re-reading this book a few more times before the end of this year. I take it with me every where. Worth the money, time and review! It deserves way more recognition. There is going to be a second and a movie. I loved this book so much!!! I look at this book at least once a day.<br />Rating: 9/10<br />Parental Rating: 12-13+
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game.  better then old one.  great way to kill time.  would like to see the other characters work too tho.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app will enable me to bring all of my study material w/me when I'm on the go! I will always love pages but this is a great alternative to carrying my Bible, devotional and notebook.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a marvelous game!  It is challenging and fun to play with many levels of varying mazes. I also like how the different tools come into the game like the rings and switches. Your strategy always has to be thought out in order to get the best score. This game is a fast moving puzzle game with pleasant background music to create a calming effect. You lose yourself in the game and lose track of time.  I hate the use of the word Zen because it is so overly used but in the case of describing this it is appropriate.<br /><br />The game is fun and challenging and does not require one permission to be loaded and played. My congratulations to the creators for a fantastic job in developing this app. I love it!
1582701709|5.0|An excellent book to read, makes you think about so much things and how you handle it in your life. That speech this make about thinking in positive is so true, and if you try to apply what's in this you'll see you'll get somethings you really need like happiness and good luck in every aspect of your life. Full recommended!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game gave me the farts. but in a good way. fart are smelly good times. fartimes. yeah. I like them.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Some have written that the Verso cover doesn't close all the way once the Fire is installed. What impatient people! Give it a few days to break in. The spine is stiff and just needs time to soften up and it WILL close properly and lay flat like it is supposed to. This is an awesome cover. I bought the red one and I am VERY happy with it.
0439023521|2.0|Anyone who sits down to write a book has my admiration. Also, I fully believe that Collins is a talented writer who is bringing to light stories and topics that need our attention. I appreciate her work and vision and perseverance.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"The Hunger Games\\" series leave me unnourished.<br /><br />The first book in the series was promising, especially as it carried a trenchant critique of our making a circus of death/survival. In an interview I read Collins expressed being concerned about sending our young people - teenagers - to war and what that does to them and also wondering why people enjoyed the \\"Survivor\\" TV show. However the book quickly lost focus and the narrative devolved into something formulaic, violence oriented and without a sense of having learned something. The story was stretched thin (probably so it could last three volumes), became increasingly violent and, worse of all, eviscerated all agency and personality from the initially promising female protagonist whose focus came down to decide between two male love interests. All in all, one of the most disappointing book experiences of my life. Mainly because it started with enormous promise (which was lost even before the first book ended). I'm happy to know that a writer has experienced fame and fortune, but it's at the price of the story that could have been told, a story that we need.<br /><br />Interestingly, I had a similar experience with her \\"Gregor the Overlander\\" series. An utterly fascinating premise and a strong first book. Even the subsequent books in the series have moments of brilliance. However, yet again, she opted for the easy road - increased battles (instead of finding other, more nuanced, ways to evolve relationships/solve conflicts), the assignment of villainy (troublingly, mainly to the women characters) and the outcome in which no growth or much insight was achieved.<br /><br />At the end of the series (I only skimmed the last book - just as I only skimmed thelast two books in the \\"Hunger Games\\" series) I was disappointed that all that obvious intellect and storytelling talent ended with very little to show. Then again, I thought, perhaps that's Collins' point. Namely, you have a war and think it'll be the answer when in fact, at the end, there really isn't anything grand at all - no answer or improvement just damage and sadness. So, even though I wasn't happy with it I had to acknowledge that it was a viable choice. By \\"viable\\" I mean I could see it as emerging from/organic to the story she told.<br /><br />However when she did it again in the \\"Hunger Games\\" series I was annoyed. After all, it's easy to criticize a society, it's easy to depict conflict and battle (after all, we have generations of stories and books and movies doing that). But unless we find ways to make interesting stories about peace, nonviolent conflict and less-than-perfect-but-workable solutions; unless we make those stories as compelling as the old good vs. evil narrative we'll never be able to imagine, much less live out, a different way of being. I consider it a failure of imagination and narrative laziness to not push oneself beyond the script of battle-victory/hero(ine)-end of story.<br /><br />Our young people need new stories - the human race needs new stories.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie is an excellent movie, for small children and adults.  We purchased this for my son as an infant and now two years later, he still loves watching it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|for four long days i sat and read fifty shades of gray all three books bravo to u EL james wonderful books very sad when i finished the books i wanted them to just keep going. They are must read books gray is now my favorite color cant wait to see what she writes next.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is simple to play, visually appealing, and easy to come back to. The levels get more and more challenging. An excellent puzzle game.
B005MSD6QU|4.0|It was disappointing that AJ & Prentiss were taken off the show.  I wasn't sure about getting Season 7 but I did and I still enjoy watching the show.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Amazing, amazingly amazing. I cant believe how awesomly awesome this game is. Everyone should play. cool cool cool. just like the old school Mario brothers game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very fun and addicting game.  It kept me busy for quite awhile.  Worth paying for, but an excellent deal for free!
B00002DE4E|4.0|The only thing that bothered me was that if you play the CD in your Car stereo the titles do not show as on many of my CDs. This must be due to the low quality of the copy or the fact that the copy wasn't done through licensed partner.<br /><br />For the rest the sound and songs are great.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved this book. This was my follow up to Fifty Shades, which something good was sorely needed to move me on from that yumminess (so I could read it again..LOL)
B00321SMI6|5.0|My family enjoys looking at this movie, when we just want to relax and have family time.  It's educational value is supreme as are all the Planet Earth documentaries.
B002WJI65S|5.0|I bought this for my brother (who just turned 20) and he loves it. Granted, he's probably gonna put it in his car, however, he loves it all the same since we grew up on the Super Nintendo and we love all things Mario. However, it's not as big as I'd hope for it to be. I don't even know how they measured it to say it's 5\\", but whatever.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The ambience of this game is just beautiful. If you want adventurous, explosions, and chaos and confusion, you won't find it here - but if you're looking for diverging, relaxing, and quiet but creative puzzles, this is definitely a game to get. The visuals in this game are beautifully rendered, the music peaceful and relaxing... This is a beautifully wrapped game with hours of gameplay to enjoy.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I absolutely loved the complexity of the main characters Christian and Anastasia and was immediately drawn into this book. I was a little disappointed with some of the writing the amount of repetition was exhausting, I didn't really care for Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" or the eye-rolling. Reading it within two days it was frustrating as to how much was repeated each chapter. With that said I loved it and really did connect with the characters and would read it again, perhaps before the movie release
B007PTJOV0|5.0|nice game but gets a litle lame after a while but I still like it alott and it is a goodgake to play if you are in to Mario
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I was so intrigued by the first book that I had to get the second. I really wanted Ana to save Christian and wanted to read the next installment. I loved the book as much as the first as I could feel how the characters were connected and addicted each other and to what extremes they would go to for each other. I wish that some scenes were played out a little longer, but overall loved how different Christian was in this installment, actually made me love him, as I was not impressed with him to much in the first novel.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love it. The game is amazing. You can even buy a cat or a dog! I absulutily love it I mean love it. Lllooovvveee iiittt.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I loved the third installment just as much as the last two...it was totally addictive and it certainly did not disappoint. I loved that there was enough to make the third book just as thrilling and nail biting as the last two. The introduction of Hyde was brilliant. I was so in love with the characters and felt like they both deserved a happy ending. I loved that even up until the last chapter you didn't really know how the book was going.<br /><br />Once again the repetition on the sex scenes was frustrating, but then if I had read this in the space of a couple of week I probably would have needed the repetition to remind me, but getting through the book within a day it was extremely tiring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|keeps me busy....great time killer. not too fond of the Romeo game though.  Would like a better version of the darts game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|simple premise, easy to play but very addicting to play at work. worth every cent, espcially as a free app of the day
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Great movie that proves that you do not have to use illiterate language (profanity) to get your point across, loved it.
044024630X|4.0|The Affair by Lee Child is another in the Jack Reacher series and it is just different enough from all the others I've read to keep it familiar, but fresh.  In this story Reacher is still in the military and sent as a sort of a shadow investigator to check out the town next to a secret Army base.  Another top MP is investigating the murder of a woman known to date service men from the base.  The town's female sheriff is an ex marine who sees through Reacher's attempt at disguising himself as a civilian and partners up with him to work through the investigation.  The ensuing relationship illustrates many of the contrasts between military and civilian law enforcement, Army and Marine politics and how the perception of white murder victims verses black murder victims can drive an investigation in the wrong direction.<br />Sheriff Deveraux is fairly close to being a female version of Reacher himself.  What really ads to the male/female dynamic is how much alike at their core the two are as military police, while being so different as a man and woman.<br />The story twists and curls and casts suspicion everywhere with little evidence to hone motives or opportunity, but enough political fog to show there are important people who will do anything to keep the murder unsolved including murder.<br />The one thing to know about all the Jack Reacher books is that the suspense ties them together so tightly that they are very hard to put down once you've started reading, so be prepared to lose some sleep.  When life becomes a grinding sameness day after day there is nothing  like a Jack Reacher story to carry you away.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I appreciate how the difficulty builds in this game. It is challenging, but not impossible, and hints are readily available.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This is one special book. Once you got into it, it was absolutely spell-binding.  It was very well written. The reader experiences great empathy for the characters.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Download to Cloud player very pleased with the music would recommend listening to snippets and then purchase to cloud player.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|this was very good a little bit more gorey then the orginal one but a good movie i think everyone will enjoy it
B0055SWM08|5.0|endlessly challenging; good for all ages ; requires forward thinking and planning<br />more words are not necessary but they require 20 so here they are
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|if you like johhny depp this is another good movie of his all of his movies were good he is a good actor
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series left me wanting to read and read. I could not put it down. Luckily, I was traveling and I was home before I was done with the book.
0385504225|5.0|The book The Lost Symbol by Dan brown is about how this professor from Harvard is called to help solve this case by finding out what a series of clues mean. In many of Dan Browns book he often will start out the book in a different place then move to Washington D.C.  and then call in Professor Robert Langdon to help solve the case. Then towards the end of the book all of the pieces of the puzzle fit together and the person is caught.<br />  When I first read the book I noticed that The Lost Symbol is very similar to his previous books, in that it has the same formulaic plot, structure, and theme, only this time it takes place in Washington, D.C. and involves the Freemasons instead of the Knights Templar. Just like in the Da Vinci Code, Langdon is called to Washington at a friend's request, only to find him missing, and spends the rest of the book chasing clues throughout the city and trying to outwit a new villain who is seemingly as smart as he is.<br />  Also when reading the book I found that it was sometimes hard to comprehend that situation and fully understand the religious references that Dan Brown made throughout the book. I would most definitely recommend this book to a friend who is interested in reading this kind of material. i think that it would be very hard for him to put it down just as it was for me.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author breaks down the key components of a habit and makes it very clear how someone could impact their own habits. In my opinion, this is not meant to be a \\"how to book\\" but instead provides the background information regarding habits and allows you to form your own ideas about how to successfully change or start your own habits. I enjoyed the use of examples from advertising and found them very helpful in understanding the key steps and how they are dependent upon each other for success. This book is an easy read and very helpful in understanding habits.
1612130283|1.0|This was one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. It was so cliche, flat, uni dimensional and actually boring. There was no true character development or escalation of the plot and the author repeated similar sequences over and over again. Nothing was believable and there were numerous flaws. The sexual scenes were predictable, and lacked any subtlety or sensuality: I literally flipped the pages through many of them. I was very surprised to see that so many women would find this book erotically stimulating or really enjoyable in any way.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|like the game so far. wish the energy refilled faster. hope it stay fun as I go along deeper in
B005K17RU0|5.0|love the 15 day outlook, it's pretty accurate! But i do prefer the WBRC (Fox 6 Birmingham, AL) app for multi city, state forecasts. I'm in PA with family and friends in MI &amp;AL and can see all easily.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|My daughter really loves this movie and this version was very good, the quality of the stream was clear and kept her entertained
0374105235|1.0|What sort of a soldier spends two years in the army and thinks that a machinegun is semi-automatic? He refers to a semiautomatic machinegun on more than one occasion which can only lead to the conclusion that he doesn't know what he is talking about because he's never been in the army and certainly never seen a machinegun being fired which is fully automatic by definition otherwise it's not a machinegun.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I think this is probably one of the 10 most underrated Movies ever to exist, \\"Pure Truth\\" In a much Simpler time this movie tells us just how things were and how they were handled!
B0055SWM08|4.0|its been a while since the faotd was worth bothering with. this one is and is accutally well made. sadly the aneroid world is awash in ugly crap apps. this is not one of them however.<br />well done
B0077JK9QM|5.0|I love Amazon video, I just wish it wasn't 1.99 per show!  The picture quality is good, but the streaming can be kind of rough.  My internet generally runs between 40-50mbps, and it would still sometimes spend time buffering midshow.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|The British PM's office helps a wealthy oil sheik begin a salmon fishing operation in Yemen. The two people assisting him begin a romance, and things get complicated. This is a smart and funny romantic-comedy that will keep you laughing. The role of the British PM's communication director is particularly good as she brings quite a few comedic moments to the film while trying to get people on board with the project. As for the project assistants, two people who are at first colleagues and friends develop feelings for each other and the viewer is interested to see if they will end up together. This was a clever film that is quite funny and is one of the better efforts in its genre in recent years.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Lots of fun and very addicting!  I love the elegant simplicity of the game.  Only reason it isn't 5 stars is because I wish there were more varieties to the obstacles you have to work around.  Hope they update soon with more content
B007OUFESC|4.0|A young woman with mental health issues comes under the care of Dr. Jung, a psychiatrist and a friend of Sigmund Freud.  Dr. Jung is married, but has an affair with his new patient. The affair becomes public, damaging the doctor's reputation. The woman eventually becomes a mental health practitioner in her own right. This one was interesting, with a look at how a doctor can put his family life and professional reputation in peril by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a patient. The film is well paced, and the acting is solid. If you are seeking a movie that is not the usual holiday fluff, this is a good one to check out.
B0055SWM08|5.0|just hard enough. This is beautifully done. I already bought quell reflect so to find this the faotd is great!
B005LAIH9A|4.0|The whole gang is back for a high school reunion and they must deal with adult problems of marital difficulties, career stagnation, and culture change since 1999. They attempt to deal with all this while trying to have a blast at their reunion get-together. There is a little raunchy humor and some nudity in this one, but I found it quite funny and entertaining. It was good to see the old faces from a 90's comedy classic all together again, and up to some of their old tricks. Their lives have changed since high school, but they still know how to have a good time. This is a film series that has a pretty funny current installment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|daughter wants to play the game.<br /><br />This is a fun game. like the Mario bros game. my daughter. wants to play it afterwatching me
B005LAIH4A|3.0|An animated film based on a Dr. Suess story that tells of a young man who is looking for a live tree to impress a girl that he likes. All the live trees were cut down and the businessman running the town sells fresh air, so he doesn't want the boy to find a tree. It's a little more interesting when you see the movie. Anyhow, this is an average animated effort, with songs that are unspectacular, few funny characters, and a plotline that clearly embraces an agenda of environmentalism. There are a few laughs to be had, and the storyline of promoting the virtues of live greenery certainly has its redeeming values. Overall, this one just does not measure up to some of the fine efforts we have seen in animated films of late.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great. it is just like mario brothers with leprechans. I highly recommend this game. get it now.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|An 1800's man finds himself on another planet, around alien beings. The planet is in the midst of a civil war, with one group of beings planning on taking over the territory of others. John Carter befriends them, and aids them in their fight, while also falling for a beautiful princess who is part of a local human-like species. All the while, one wonders if he will be able to return to earth. The visuals in this film are amazing, and the characters created are actually likeable. When John Carter first meets a local being it is actually quite funny, and the viewer can see the beginning of a camaraderie forming. At times the details of who are the aggressors and who is being threatened could have been more clearly delineated, as this genre does not lend itself will to a storyline that has a gray area in its portrayal of good and evil. Taken as a whole, the movie is a visually stunning film that does enough to keep the viewer entertained.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|The first time I listened to this was a few days before it was released, and I wasn't exactly impressed.  After all this hype, I went to check it out again (particularly Somebody I Used To Know), and I'm still not at all impressed.  I listen to quite a few similiar artists, so technically, I should love this album just as much (but I don't).  I do think it's pretty good, but bands/artists (which I love) like Neon Indian, M83, Burial, David Guetta etc are way better overall.  While I honestly can't get myself to love it, if you love Gotye's new album, by all means get it.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|In a futuristic world, much of the population of the U S. is divided up into zones, where they are each required to send two of their children to compete In a survival contest where only one survives. The contest is a reality show that is televised for all to see. The participants are manipulated by the people running the game in order to maximize entertainment value for the masses watching at home. This was a riveting and realistic movie that features young people fighting for their survival and the instincts of them to either be ruthless or cooperative dictate how they will behave during the games. The handheld camera work may be nausea inducing for some, but otherwise this is a terrific story of a bond developing and of the efforts of young people to survive.
B00753MBHA|5.0|so far i'm not disappointed this is gonna get several months of rotation.so far i've been grinning it's music you'd expect from a top notch Accept band this late in their careers and all i can say is THANKS  and not missing UDO from ACCEPT but UDO rocks also on his solo stuff
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Youthful looking police officers are placed undercover in local high schools. In this case, two misfit cops are trying to break up a drug ring. This rehash of the old TV series is pretty well done, with a strong pairing in the lead roles and a story that is fun to follow. There are some laughs to be had and an interesting role reversal for the former high school jock and the other guy who was a misfit. The film contains an exciting car chase and also has a couple of good cameos by stars of the original show. Overall, this was a just a fun film that you will laugh at and have a good time watching.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzle game.  Not super easy but not too hard.  Gets you to think more moves aheah.
B005LAII0I|3.0|A re-telling of the classic Disney tale of Snow White receives a modern-day make over. The cast of characters is still largely the same, but this time Snow White is a little more independent and able to fend for herself against the evil god-mother. A valiant attempt at updating this tale works well at times, not so well at others. The film certainly looks terrific, with costumes and colorful sets that really bring a magical feel to the film. The humor in it sometimes falls flat as the attempt to be hip does not always work. The best movie's best asset is Lily Collins, who is absolutely delightful as Snow White. I would say that this is a movie that the kids will certainly enjoy and the adults who take them will find it entertaining enough.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The Oregon Trail was the first computer game I ever played. They did a great job of recreating the game without losing its originality.
0545403359|5.0|A boy raises a horse that turns out to be quite a spectacular creature. The horse is sold off during WWI and embarks on a journey through several owners, making an impact on everyone who encounters him. The question in everyone's mind is \\"will the horse be reunited with his original owner?\\" I will let the viewer discover the answer to that burning question while seeing the movie. As for the film itself, it is classic Spielberg; a heartwarming storyline, visually spectacular, and a well-told tale. The Schmaltz is turned on a bit here, but the movie's strengths, particularly the realistic war scenes, far outweigh its weaknesses. This is another fine effort from Hollywood's greatest director.
B000URSMDA|5.0|This CD is excellent, it really shows just how talented and great Richard Marx really is. He just keeps getting better and better.Thank you Amazon.
B006Z7Z3R2|3.0|An old hotel is closing and it may be haunted. The final two staffers are overseeing the departing guests and trying to make contact with the spirits that may be inhabiting the place. The film has its instants of creepiness, but it often relies on the old horror film gimmick of cheap frights, and doesn't provide enough truly scary moments. Moreover, I found the finale unsatisfying, not providing enough of an explanation for what I had just seen. The makings of a good horror movie are present; I just don't think the execution is adequate. This is another low-budget horror effort from Ti West, and this time he disappoints.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|I was driving down the street and saw a Huge Roman Reloaded Poster on top of Queens Center Mall in Queens, NY.<br />I went home to listen to the album online before purchasing it and I must say it has to be the worse album in the history of RAP.<br />I do not dislike Nicki and wish her the best in all of her endeavors but this album was POP.<br />Fortunately for the Katy Perry fans, there are two albums they can buy this year. lmao<br />Good Luck and god bless.
B006H5120E|5.0|A massive cruise liner thought to be unsinkable (spoiler alert!) hits an iceberg and does just that. The film focuses on a fictional couple who fall in love and pursue a relationship despite their differences, and the unfortunate circumstance of being on a sinking ship. This 1997 film became a box-office smash and a cultural phenomenon. It is enhanced by the 3D experience, and is well-worth investing your time and movie dollars. What made the film so good was the combination of the riveting sequence of the ship going under, the love story that captured hearts everywhere, and an easy to hate villain. A return trip to Titanic is an experience we should all undertake.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I became interested in Wool from reading Hugh Howey's posts on Kindleboards and vicariously enjoying his incredible success with the series. I launched into the first book with gusto. Howey's prose is clear, smooth and evocative. Anyone worried that Wool is less than professional in writing or presentation needn't be. I've read plenty of traditionally published books that aren't as well written or formatted.<br /><br />The first book presents us with a world in which the last survivors of some kind of holocaust live in a 134-floor silo, protected from a natural environment that has become wildly toxic. The concept is great and Howey makes the most of it, providing a number of twists that regularly notch up the suspense.<br /><br />Howey's main strength, though, is in his ability to create well-rounded characters whom we care about deeply and immediately. In this regard, I think he's actually better than some of the s-f giants of the past, such as (because someone else made the comparison) Isaac Asimov, whose work I positively devoured in my youth but whose characters were rarely more than two-dimensional cutouts moved around to serve the plot. (And if there is anything more cringe-worthy than a \\"classic\\" s-f writer's attempt at flirtatious dialogue, I don't know what it would be, unless it's listening to an elementary school orchestra. But I digress.) Howey writes real people who would be at home in any \\"literary\\" novel, which is a particularly high achievement in the s-f world.<br /><br />So, why just four stars, aside from the fact that I'm a tough grader?<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Some things about the concept I just didn't buy. I'll take a few \\"givens\\" in s-f, of course, but ultimately s-f requires a willing suspension of disbelief that I never quite achieved with Wool.<br /><br />For instance, the physical action hinges on the central stairwell that characters must travel...laboriously. I'm sorry, but I didn't buy that there were no elevators. I get that electrical power is limited, and I get that the overlords (my corny term, not Howey's!) don't really want people socializing and communicating, but...no 134-floor structure is going to function without elevators. You need a freight elevator. NEED it. Absolutely no one would design and build a 134-floor silo without an elevator for moving heavy stuff.<br /><br />And there will always be executives who demand an elevator. The aged mayor having to hike down 130 floors, and back up again? Nope, didn't buy it. The evil, powerful guy would have had a secret elevator. There would have been an elevator for emergencies, if only a crude people-mover that people stand on. The mechanics would have worked up something for themselves, maybe disguising it as something else.<br /><br />The cleaning bothered me, too. Keeping the lenses clean really isn't that big a deal. There would be a way to remove them from inside to clean them, or send someone out briefly and bring them back in, or something. Again, I get the sociological imperative of the cleaning ritual/punishment, but I didn't entirely buy it as a method anyone would come up with to keep a populace in check.<br /><br />So, these are pretty big pills that I just didn't swallow. Still, I gave them to Howey as the price of admission to his world. There were a couple of other problems, though.<br /><br />MORE SPOILERS<br /><br />I really had a problem with the poisoning. Poison is slipped into someone's canteen (an important person), and there is virtually no investigation into the incident. The poisoning could only happen in one place, and a limited number of people had access to the canteen at this time. This crime wouldn't have kept a real-world cop busy for a full day, but Howey's sheriff doesn't, apparently, launch even the most basic inquiry.<br /><br />I can understand if Howey didn't want to sidetrack his story with a murder investigation, but I felt that he really gave it short shrift.<br /><br />The main problem Ihad with Wool, though, came with the last two books, when the pacing ground to a snail's pace.<br /><br />Jack London wrote a killer short story called \\"To Build a Fire,\\" detailing a man's effort to build a fire in the wilderness to keep away wolves. What works brilliantly in a short story gets really tiresome in a novel. With Wool 4 and 5, the minutia began gathering underfoot until this exciting read became a slog. I'll admit, I started speed-reading. Normally I like to savor a book, and Howey's writing is worth savoring, but Wool 5 in particular became tedious, as did the back-and-forth between our main character's story and the story of a secondary character who was far less fascinating.<br /><br />So, ultimately, I have to give the Wool Omnibus a four-star rating for a great start and a less stellar finish.<br /><br />I have every confidence that Hugh Howey will continue to make a name for himself and look forward to his future works!had with Wool, though, came with the last two books, when the pacing ground to a snail's pace.<br /><br />Jack London wrote a killer short story called \\"To Build a Fire,\\" detailing a man's effort to build a fire in the wilderness to keep away wolves.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|This movie is about a mother who has a lot of difficulty raising her son. The beginning intercuts between scenes of her pregnancy, dealing with the boy, getting a new job, and dealing with harassment by neighbors. The film then begins to utilize more of a linear storyline to tell the story of a child who terrorizes his mother while manipulating the father. This behavior culminates in a violent outburst that causes the mother to be targeted by other neighborhood parents, who hold her responsible. This is a very powerful film that realistically portrays the difficulty she has with dealing with a boy that she truly loves, but who only cares about himself. This was one of the best movies of the year.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a pretty good app but it has it's downsides.  For one, it's too easy to click on things you don't mean to click on.  Most of the type is small.  Another thing is it's always trying to have you buy more apps which is annoying.  I was much too generous with the star rating but I can't get 3&frac12; stars so 4 will have to do.

B006R1T40I|4.0|\\"Slipstream\\" is first and foremost the story of an artist returning to her realm after a long dry spell, rediscovering her fountain of inspiration and acquiring the drive to once again practice her craft. Since that artist happens to be Bonnie Raitt, one of America's most iconic and important musicians, it comes as no surprise that it is an enlightening, hearty listen with a feels-like-home comfortability.<br /><br />The seven-year gap between \\"Slipstream\\" and 2005's terrific \\"Souls Alike\\" is the longest Raitt has taken between studio efforts, understandable since her life in the interim  has been fraught with loss - of parents, of brother, of best friend. While that certainly can be read as informing her soul-searching take on Bob Dylan's masterpiece \\"Standing in the Doorway\\" and the aching piano/vocal \\"God Only Knows,\\" the album only occasionally dips its toe into the deep end of introspection. In fact, the only tune Raitt co-writes here is the rambunctious, sing-songy \\"Down to You.\\"<br /><br />This is music with a joyful edge, crafted for the simple pleasure of craft (an artist of Raitt's stature taking such a long gap between records indicates a lack of prioritizing sales or hits) and therefore of great interest to her longtime devotees. It doesn't have the radio-friendly edge of earlier recordings, and it need not. A few songs have a similar bite, especially at the core of the LP, but listeners on the market for a new Raitt album - and there are more than a few of them - will certainly be pleased.<br /><br />Randall Bramlett's \\"Used to Rule the World\\" kicks off the album with funky, slamming, kinetic instrumentation. Raitt's playing is prominent, large and boisterous, firmly establishing that time has not frayed her resolve. Similar can be said of Paul Brady and Michael O'Keefe's witty, biting \\"Marriage Made in Hollywood,\\" which Raitt wraps her voice around with cool, supple assurance, as well as \\"Right Down the Line\\" with its Caribbean flourishes and sure-footed percussion.<br /><br />The meditative, silky \\"Take My Love With You\\" and \\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\" showcase Raitt's elegant, quiet passion as a vocalist. The intimate, unobtrusive nature of the recording allows the songs to furrow into the mind and summon repeated listens. This is music that breathes, as the lady behind it surely intended.<br /><br />With \\"Slipstream\\" Raitt resurfaces in radiant, surefooted fashion, confident in her abilities, hungry to record new tunes and hit the road to play them for audiences. After 40 years in the business she retains a disproportionate amount of soul, vigor and longing. Listeners are blessed to have her.ed percussion.<br /><br />The meditative, silky \\"Take My Love With You\\" and \\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\" showcase Raitt's elegant, quiet passion as a vocalist.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I needed a good flash for my first digital SLR that wouldn't break the bank and the Nikon SB-400 is it.  I can slip it on the D5100 and just shoot, the flash and camera work together.  I like the tilting front that lets me use it for bounce flash.  I'm not into bouncing light off walls yet so don't miss that it doesn't twist on the mount.  Coupled with a snap-on diffuser it gives soft, even lighting.  I don't expect to light a room with it, but so far I'm impressed with the power it has. Battery consumption seems pretty good.  It goes to sleep to conserve battery, but wakens when I press the shutter release halfway. I've had it a month using it every other day and I'm still using the first two alkaline cells I put in.  It is small enough to stick in my pocket and I can put the camera in the bag with it still mounted if I need to.  It locks onto the accessory shoe so it won't slide off.  Maybe later on I'll buy one of its big brothers, but for now The SB-400 does everything I need a speedlight to do.

030788743X|5.0|So a friend recommended this book to me and being a good fried I decided to humor her. I'm incredibly glad I did. This book is a must read for anyone who was a kid/adolescent/young adult in the 80's. It has an incredible amount of trivia from that decade (and some interesting tidbits from others) which is fun to find and *maybe* remember. Past that, even those who didn't live through that time at the \\"right\\" age will still find this a great read. The world that the author creates is quite believable and the future history also makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />The main character is a down on his luck loser who is almost instantly likable. You will be rooting for him to survive, win, and get the girl.

0439023513|2.0|A woman friend of mine suggested a month ago I read the Hunger Games books. Not my usual type of reading material but I plunged away and found the first two books excellent and got me hooked...surprisingly. I didn't think these were actually Y/A material, but whatever. Naturally I had to finish the series and read the last book...Mockingjay. Oops, this one wasn't as good and was much darker.<br /><br />As I am an adult male and have read my fair share of darker, more psychological themed novels I shouldn't have been too shocked by Miss Collins book, but I kinda was. I didn't care for it that much and I tried to reason out why. It wasn't as though the first two books were Wizard of Oz stuff..they were pretty grim in their own right. But Katniss and the other characters were so well developed and the story was gripping, and definitely holds you attention.<br /><br />So what went wrong?<br /><br />First: The first person narrative that had worked well in the first two books, didn't serve this last book and the story as well. Too many things were happening away from Katniss that needed more development. Her presence being required to relate the action wasn't always needed or desirable as much as before.<br /><br />Second: Katniss seemed to be a situational lover which became very noticable in MJ. She starts out as a best friend with Gale, but not romantically. She loves him, but more as a companion, confident, and perhaps a substitute for her recently passed father. When she volunteers to be the tribute from District 12 she and Haymitch play up a romance/lovers situation with an unsuspecting, but very nice guy, Peeta. He learns about the strategy after the two escaped as winners. He finds out that it was 'not real.' However, readers can ask themselves a question, was Katniss pretending by the end of Hunger Games or not? It wasn't quite clear as the girl frequently questions her romantic feelings...she can be very contradictory. When they eventually return home she turnsmore of her attention to Gale Hawthorne and shows her deep feelings for him after his whipping. Peeta now realizes that maybe she loves Gale. Okay, that's possible...but I don't think so. The major story arc is the developing resistance movement against the Capitol. But the romance between Peeta and Katniss is the catalyst for the potential revolution...hence its importance. The romance and the revolution have become intertwined. By the end of Catching Fire, Collins leaves no doubt that Katniss is indeed in love with Peeta....even Snow is convinced.<br /><br />And now we get to MJ. Here is Peeta being tortured and enduring severe chemical and physical mind alteration techniques linking Katniss and the Muttations, so that when he see's one he sees the other. In the meantime, Gale is stalking her all over her newly situated housing in District 13. He is using this opportunity to win her back, or just win her. In almost every scene Gale is sitting next to her and being helpful. They grow close again. They hunt together again...while Peeta screams. Coin asks Katniss if she wants Gale to be announced as her new lover. She is shocked. When Peeta is \\"rescued\\" (he was really allowed to escape by Snow) he now becomes the Manchurian Candidate...programmed to kill Mockingjay...which he attempts. She becomes angry, confused, shocked and despairing, and now attaches herself even more to Gale. She begins to be more affectionate and intimate with him. So Collins has now reversed what was known before and restarted the triangle. When she sees Peeta the next time he confronts her with the Gale rumors about them, and she gets offended and she throws her hugging and Kissing of Gale back in Peeta's face, which unleashes his one and only nasty remark about her loyalty. Things are getting messy. I think coin may be enjoying Katniss's reputational fallout a bit. Prim then tells her that Peeta has been through alot, and Haymitch basically says what if the situation were reversed, what would he be doing for you? So now we have the great heroine from the first two books seemingly falling in love with the one available guy. This diminishes her in the heads of the readers and IMO somewhat weakens her character. If this Was Collins intent...it worked.<br /><br />Third: The commando raid to kill Snow was unnecessary as the rebels were already preparing an invasion. And why would they risk good soldiers for an almost suicide mission? Having Katniss train for combat seemed more like her attempt to forget about Peeta...and then he comes along for the ride anyway....handcuffed most of time and asking to be killed for the rest of it. Finnick is killed so quickly and off screen, you're not sure at first it happened. A bit too fast and anti-climactic for a great character. Prim is sent in as a medic to the combat area and is killed by a cluster bomb, built by Beetee from a design suggestion from Gale. He was blamed by Katniss for complicity in Prim's death and lets him go...another weak part of the story. He was no more to blame for her death than an auto engineer for someone's car accident...but Collins needed a way to dispose of Gale's involvement in Katniss because she HAS to eventually be with Peeta at the end or the whole story from the very begining would collapse. But this was a cheap way for Katniss to end her relationship with him. He at least deserved to be told that she really loved Peeta. Katniss later votes for a Capitol kids Hunger Game, why is not clear. Snow tells her that it wasn't he that ordered that fatal attack on Prim and other women and children. She goes to ask Haymitch and all he can do is ask her how her love life is going. She stalks out without asking. All this has long passed intense drama and become more melodrama...sad to say.<br /><br />Fourth\\" Katniss kills Coin instead of Snow...1000 pages she's been talking about killing him but then kills someone else instead...but Coin did deserve it. Katniss has a complete mental breakdown,found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity, and sent to Botany Bay, aka District 12. War is hell. All alone in her house tended to only by Greasy, Katniss, acting very much like her mother after her father died, is just marking time. She asks Greasy if she heard anything about Gale, and was informed of where he was. She has a moment of reflection for the years they were friends and then lets it go. Peeta then quietly shows up planting primrose, they start spending more time together, then sleeping together again, kissing again, and they fall in love again...or just finally remembered they already were. But Peeta's reuniting with Katniss takes only about two or three paragraphs...now that's economizing. It was out of proper perspective. Collins devotes a great deal more time to Katniss's state of depression at home than on any recovery. We have already experienced the many times throughout the book that she has been severely hurt and traumatized. Now at the very end, this seems like Miss Collins is just piling it on without any real purpose. Not everyone expected a fairy tale ending...just an ending that was justified. It seemed a little more bitter than sweet.<br /><br />Fifth: Despite everything that happened to Katniss and Peeta, and they both suffered terribly, and despite her finding some brief moments of comfort with Gale, this was always about her and Peeta. Gale's romantic involvement in Mockingjay only added unsatisfactory melodrama to the story. Collins played the triangle game once too often and too long...it was getting tiresome. The open ended victory of the revolution and what form it took is not necessarily a critical failure of the novel...it does leave sufficient doubt and provoke some interesting discussion. But there were still too many plot contrivances and dead spots to propel the story forward...it just felt awkward and unrealistic.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|The unmistakable presence of giant musical ghosts from the past haunt this record. The echoes are everywhere and they suggest the finest of pedigrees. Yet the Alabama Shakes have that extra dimension which is a key feature of all the contenders for the bands that somehow define the moment. They are hot, they are talked about in hushed tones and while there is nothing essentially new to be found on their debut \\"Boys and Girls\\" they have taken the familiar and infused it with the brilliant musical feat of making it sound new and original. Anyone listening to the superb debut single \\"Hold on\\" will be immediately struck by the homage to the soulful southern stew once concocted in that legendary studio Muscle Shoals in a small northwest corner of the bands home state. Here Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Percy Sledge and Bobby Womack created a distinct sound that famous bands like the Rolling Stones and more latterly the Black Keys have sought to replicate. This mix of rock and soul is all over \\"Boys and Girls\\" like a rash and the names Otis Redding and Janis Joplin are equally obvious influences. Add to this potent force that the Alabama Shakes have a primary weapon, a sort of musical nuclear option in the form of vocalist Brittany Howard a veritable force of nature and star in the making. Stop what your doing and check out the band on the Net at their now legendary Boston Arms gig in London in February 2012 and above all else seek out their cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"How many more times\\". You will be left speechless at the brazen energy which doesn't so much light up the stage as completely own it.<br /><br />Indeed if your reviewer has one complaint about this great debut album it doesn't quite press into the vinyl grooves the primal quality of the bands on stage presence and the sheer level of raucousness they summon up. Equally its an album that starts so strong that they set themselves an impossible standard to sustain over these eleven songs although to give them credit they try their damnedest. Inevitably you are drawn to the first two songs not least the superb single \\"Hold on\\". It is an instant classic, a song, which someone should have, written before and a performance by a band so tight you couldn't prize them apart. It is a rock 'n' soul standard in the making with its brilliant dirty sluggish riff and Howards sassily delivered opening line \\"Bless my heart, and bless my soul, didn't think I would make it, to twenty two years old\\". It is as if the Drive by Truckers have invited Otis Redding on stage for a jam and recorded it. The second song \\"I found you\\" is far more soulful and echoes the sort of Motown inspired laments that the late Amy Winehouse took to stratospheric levels on \\"Black to black\\". The song has a hook that could have carried on well beyond its meagre three minutes but the sign of a great band is to recognise the right level of economy and no song on this album tips over into the 5-minute territory. Further into the album you will also find a brilliant soul ballad \\"You ain't alone\\" which proves that Howard has a talent which should be celebrated and nurtured. If she is this good now what the future holds could be remarkable. Sadly the rest of the album doesn't quite reach the heights of these three songs. The short \\"Going to a party\\" is slightly pointless bearing in mind the songs the band has in their extensive live armoury. The penultimate song \\"I ain't the same\\" is fine but has been done many times before. Yet you can forgive them these missteps when you hear the fine conclusion to this album the much rockier \\"On your way\\" which is a splendid way to finish.<br /><br />Bearing in mind the sheer level of outlandish hyperbole around the Alabama Shakes in the US it may be the case that Boys and Girls was destined never to meet this weight of expectation. Nevertheless whilst this is no rock masterpiece it is a great debut. You also feel that once they are able to capture the sheer power of their live concerts in the recording studio then the Alabama Shakes will just about blow anything else off the stage. The enticing prospect they conjure up is truly delicious.s in the recording studio then the Alabama Shakes will just about blow anything else off the stage.

B006YMM64G|4.0|This is the best quality film that these brothers have released.  The script/acting is good. This is not, as the other films they have released, a Hollywood Blockbuster, but it is entertaining and definitely thought provoking.  Based on the Christian faith, this movie shows what a difference the man of the family can make when raising kids.  It is not easy, but oh so important.  I think that all parents should watch this movie. You may think that you are doing a good job at raising your family, but when you watch this, you see things in a different light.  I laughed and cried in this movie and have purchased it for our adult children who are beginning their families.
