B0002U1SFE|5|We took our 5 1/2 month old son to BRU to try out exersaucers and see which he liked best.  We put him in the Jumperoo and he was just kind of hanging out.  We put him in this one and I don't think I've ever seen him get so excited about something so quickly!  We knew we had a winner.  I'm watching him play in it right now and he is just so happy.  He smiles and laughs and grabs for everything.  It's probably the best purchase we've made for him toy-wise yet.  I highly recommend it! <br /> <br />
B00NE0U6Y8|5|Great
B00008439C|3|My son is now 15 months old, and we have been using this sound machine since he was 3 weeks old.  The womb sound was a huge help when he was a newborn, and helped him to sleep longer. Before we bought this, we had been using the womb sounds bear and were going through batteries like crazy.  This is a much better investment.    As he has gotten older, I continue to use it as white noise.  That being said, it is not loud enough to block out all background noise.  Some of the settings (brook, in particular) sound a little cheesy.  But it is great to use when we are travelling, and the battery option is wonderful when you just want to throw it in a suitcase.  The random and 2 noise options are great too.  I think, for what you pay, it is an excellent option.  Just remember that you get what you pay for.
B005J5RWGG|5|Although I should probably wait until our grandson has actually used this, so far we've been really impressed with this crib.  Beautiful, and hubby assembled it easily enough.  Looks very solid!
B003LLO8J4|5|I have a three months  old doughter and I'm very happy with this stroller.<br />It drives EXCEPTIONALY easy and smooth... I can literely push it with two fingers to stroll the city.<br />This stroller offers comfort, ease, practicality and style ... All in one.<br />I receive compliments for my stroller almost every time I take it out for a stroll... The colors (I have it in red) are very beautiful.<br />Last but not least, having my baby at eye level allows us to interact while exploring the world, which makes our trips much more fun...
B00P7OM2EQ|4|I received this product in exchange for a review, my review is 100% my honest opinion:  As other reviews stated, these are VERY soft. They aren't too thick or thin, just right and they do as they are advertised to do- stop embarrassing leaks. I love that the companies products are Organic and if you have never felt or owned any mommy-baby products that are Bamboo fabric, then you are missing out! Softer than Cotton. The reason for my rating of 4 stars is because while they do as advertised; I don't feel that they are universal... They fit awkwardly in my bra (in different bras) and bunch up at the top making them slightly uncomfortable. The size is very big, while it should be a good size due to it not having any adhesive and needing to fit all over, they are too big for my 34B bras. They cover the inside well but i have a lot of excess out which is noticeable under smooth shirts. I feel that there should be different sizes, because being a one size fits all &#34;Universal&#34; doesn't work for someone of my size (unless I wear ONLY a sports bra or Full Coverage bra with them). Even for moms of a bigger bust in &#34;D&#34; I don't think they would suit because they would be too small. If they were for sizes ( S,M,L )  vs one size fits all then this product would definitely be a 5 out of 5!  May fit perfect for a mother who is a cup size up or band size bigger as you won't have excess out (or that always wears full coverage).  *My smaller bust isn't the products fault, felt the need to still rate it 4 out of 5 due to quality and it getting the job done and being still usable nonetheless with looser shirts, but sizing is definitely needed in order to get that comfortable fit for mothers- because after all we're different sizes!
B00A0FGN8I|5|Bought this for my first grandchild who lives in CA.  I was able to test it out when I visited her last week from NC.<br />The car seat is sturdy, stable and made to last! Plus it is easy to use.  Being older, the weight was an issue<br />if I had to carry it more than a block.  In that regard,  I would keep it in the car when possible.  Since my daughter was<br />Recovering from a C-Section, she needed my help.  Even thought it was heavy, I would not hesitate to buy because I<br />felt the safety factor and ease of use Was far more important.
B001FT19IW|5|It matches perfectly!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am so exited for my baby boy to be in his new room
B002VOJUPY|1|The whole purpose of a diaper pail is to be air sealed. This one has huge wholes around the pails top. In anther word it just make more complicated to dispose a diaper, but did not serve its purpose. I send this Item back, seller charged me 20% restacking fee  + $8 shipping fee. I highly advise not to purchase this item.
B00U0DCTVU|5|A friend of my let me test her city select out & I loved it instantly. Easy to push even with one hand. Love that this can become a double stroller without being too bulky. It's very easy to use too. Under stroller storage is a a great bonus since! This was an excellent deal!
B00OY9JYRS|5|Great car seat for the price! Very easy to put together (the backside connects with the booster seat). The booster seat is narrow especially if you need the space in your car. Great price for a narrow car seat, trust me I have done my research for hours.
B005NPMYOW|4|After having our baby in August, I ordered the Babybjorn Miracle Organic Cotton Carrier, the Cybex 2 Go baby carrier and the Infantino Sync Comfort Wrap. This is after trying the Moby wrap as well as a general sling (which will probably be great once baby is bigger). Out of all 5-6 carriers/wraps that I've tried, the Babybjorn is my favorite. In the beginning I was a bit intimidated by it as at first glance all you see are numerous straps. It looked confusing and complicated and I was hoping that the simplicity of the Cybex would win me over (it didn't). Once you experiment with the Babybjorn, after reading the directions a few times, it loses it's intimidation factor and you are left with a secure, comfortable, baby carrier. To simplify, here are my personal pros and cons with the Babybjorn miracle:<br /><br />PROS<br />- works well for a newborn (baby is currently 8 weeks old and 9 pounds, have used it for about 4 weeks)<br />- it adjusts to your babies length<br />- easy to get baby in and out as you can have an entire side open for baby install<br />- comfortable for the wearer (both me and my husband find that it fits us and he is 6 inches taller than me)<br />- doesn't dig into the babies legs, seems to keep his hips in the right position with the weight just on his bottom<br />- secure with numerous buckles, I don't feel like my little one is going anywhere<br /><br />CONS<br />- like most carriers, it gets pretty toasty when you're wearing it (so not a huge con, just a fact of having an additional 98 degrees on your chest)<br />- the weight limit (which mean a new carrier in the future)<br /><br />That's about it! I would definitely buy this again and I look forward to seeing how it fits us as little one grows. It is a miracle worker for having a small baby and making it easier to do normal things again like go to the store and wash dishes.
B00FXOYGMQ|5|These are good quality towels for little money. The colors are nice but subdued as my daughter wanted. I believe she will be using these if she has another child.
B001CW7CVK|4|My two year old loves this product. There isnt much to it besides the changing colors, but works as a great nightlight for him to snuggle.
B00UK5Z4EM|5|I always like the old-fashioned weighted sippy cups for little ones, but Avent really has a great design.  They seem to have incorporated everything we need in this cup.  What’s really unusual is the 360° floating top that’s activated, if you can call it that, when used.  The dual handles are easy to grasp and there’s no leaking when it’s being used.  The slightly concave bottom balances nicely and it fits in a stroller cup holder easily.<br /><br />The measurements are on the side, 200 ml / 7 ounces, making it easy to gauge what a toddler is drinking.  I used to have to keep track of what my son was drinking for a while and I find the extra touch handy.  It’s a no spill design, something I find ultra-handy.  Even the other sippy cup I have can be quite messy.  It’s really cool to find a cup of any sort that can even withstand a toss and not create a mess.<br /><br />The Advents can be tossed in a diaper bag if you add the extra cap and not leak.  Can’t get much better than that.  There are step-by-step visuals for assembly.  The smaller pieces can be put in a sterilizer easily.  If you don’t like assembly, take a pass.  The curved double handles are easy to hold.  There are two cups, which is perfect for siblings.  We have the big sister little brother combo on one side of the family and are hoping for another one in time.  They are solid enough to be used and handed down several time.
B004EPYS5K|4|I received this table as a gift (already used) and it lasted me almost three years. It was always pretty wobbly and I did eventually get a better changing pad. My now 35-month-old just broke it by standing up and doing one little hop on it. It turns out the shelves, even he one hat supports the child, were made from some sort of paperboard, probably not more than 1/4&#34; thick. I'm surprised but glad that it lasted as long as it did, especially since I was the second owner!
B000A7JLB2|4|We just bought a swing for my 3mos. old daughter. What a useful item to have!! We chose this swing because of the versatility...you get a swing, infant seat and toddler rocker. We figured you get more for the money. The other swings took up far too much space. It's also easy to move around.  The seat removes easily so I can take it off with my daughter in it, move the base, which is collapsable, into another room, and then just put her back on without taking her out of the seat. There are only two speeds, but I've only used the 1st. My only complaint is the music...there are 5 songs but they are so short it becomes too repetitive...at least for me. Don't think she notices the difference! She also doesn't seem to like the hanging toys. They hang too low and I think make her dizzy, crying every time I put them on. The hanging bar with velcro tabs allows me to hang other stuffed toys from her play mat, or I remove it altogether and attach her toys to the seat bars, which she likes much better. The design allows for many options for toys.
B000F1QV1Q|3|Walker is too tall for my 6-month old baby who is willing to start to walk. The lowest setting for this walker is too tall yet.My baby is already 26 inches tall.
B00CXVKGXU|1|I'm on my third machine.  The first two had a defective heat sensor and the current machine just stopped powering up.  So disappointed in this product and absolutely do not recommended it.  Too bad because when it did work, it made bottle making a lot more simple at 3am!!  Thank goodness Amazon has an easy return policy.
B0036EFA8E|3|One day shipping is not explained properly, expect a week still and save your money.
B00MW9TS1Y|4|My son loves it. The print and the design are great for any kid who likes trains. Since it is hard to find a toddler bed set at any store this was a great find for the price.
B00004D3EU|1|I have read the instructions.  It still leaks.  Don't buy it.
B00MYE40CO|5|What a great product!!I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.It is super easy to maintain.I am happy this kind of product is made in the USA😊!Happy cooking for our little ones!!
B000B4SVM4|5|the seller didnt clean it up very well, so i had to. but it was exactly what i wanted. so overall i was satisfied. Baby loves it:)
B0006HBS1M|5|I didn't end up breastfeeding for very long, but this worked great for while I did, and I'm keeping it for kid #2.
B00CMJ226M|5|I love this! I got it for my beauty blenders to throw in the washer. Works great, amazing price. The only downside is it took a month to ship! It's coming from China.
B00MSGKMF2|5|My 9 mo old easily adapted to the Pouch Buddy instantly. She hates eating purees from a spoon but has no problem with purees from a pouch. No mess + independent feeding = happy momma!
B000I2MRLK|3|I bought this because my little boy ( now 7 months old ) really loved Freddy the Fire Fly. Jacques is much smaller, but still a nice size for the baby to play with. He was fascinated enough to play with him for a few hours when I first have it to him but he doesn't really even want to play with him now. On an occasion I can get him to play with him for a few mins, but he's basically bored with him quickly! I put him on the floor as an option for him to play with. I rate this as an, \\" OK toy. \\"
B0064QLRTW|5|Arrived on expected date, works great!
B003UTUEOU|3|This item was good the first night I used it. After that the fluff inside separated and was not comfortable. I should've spent the extra twenty bucks for the snoodle thing.
B00E8KJYNC|2|I purchased the Formula Pro one Step food maker to help me out as I was expecting twins.  After a month of use, I can say that I am completely disappointed.  The formula spout is messy and formula gets all over the machine.  The spout is constantly needing to be washed, often more than once a day as recommended.  Washing all the components and waiting for them to completely dry often takes most of the day.  The water reservoir is hard to remove to wash and fill.  **The most important aspect is that it dispenses overly diluted formula even when using the proper &#34;number insert&#34;**  My poor boys were constantly famished because the formula/water ratio is off.  I am now mixing formula by hand and my boys are doing well.  I wish I could return this product, but I suppose I am stuck with it.
B000056JB8|1|We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.     Wrong!!     The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.     The woman who answered at \\"Customer Service\\" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!     Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.     I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??     However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.     So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was \\"just ducky\\" but your service was DOA!     Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.    Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!     [[ASIN:B000056OV0 PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White]]
B0015W2SNY|4|Today, I took apart my baby's Lovin' Hug Swing by Graco. You can use the swing up until 30 lbs and Put Pie has at least 9lbs to go, but she's made it loud and clear that she no longer enjoys the ride. No big deal, I went and bought a big plastic tub to put the swing in and store. It was easier to take apart than it was to put together. Except that I started getting all teary when I was putting the swing in the coffin-like box. This swing has been so good to me. Really, I had to take a moment and thank the swing for holding my baby and soothing her and helping her sleep.    When I got the swing, I was at my wits' end. My baby was tiny and I could not put her down without her crying. She is my first child and letting her cry just wasn't an option. Daddy had a very bad cold and couldn't help out. I was taking care of him and her, going crazy and shaking from exhaustion. Someone suggested I get the swing and I immediately got in the car with Put Pie and went to buy it. I didn't care how much it cost and usually I'm pretty frugal.     When I got home, Put Pie took one of her very short power naps and I put the swing together as quickly as I could. She woke up and I put her in it. She only stayed in it for about 20 minutes that day, but I thought the swing was worth every penny. That was 20 minutes I wouldn't have had otherwise. Later she spent hours in it playing and sleeping.  Today, as I put the swing away, I just felt grateful that someone made something that helped me through those challenging early moments of motherhood. I know it's just a swing, but I don't know what I would have done without it.    Thank you Lovin' Hug for being Mami's little helper.    [...]
B005WHQKG4|2|The car seat came in on time.  However it is not what we expected.<br />Cons:<br />It doesn't recline nearly far enough for a rear facing child.  My 3 month old was unable to sit in it without his head dropping forward.  He was unable to lift his head to keep his chin off his chest and his airways open.  We had to roll up a towel  and put it under the front of the base in order to get it to recline far enough for our childs head to stay back. The material isn't the greatest and the infant insert doesn't seem to work properly.  The insert doesn't meet the back head rest and the childs shoulders end up sinking a little further than his lower back and head.  The head piece for the insert also falls down and you have to put it back in place every time you place the child in the seat.  My child is not 4 months old and cries each and every time we place him in this car seat.  We have two different car seats, one for each vehicle.  He loves his other car seat and is very content, but cries in this one.  Also, the car seat buckles both latch on to one hook in the back instead of the traditional way of a T shaped hook to allow one strap per hook. However, we have had no problems with it unlatching.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The car seat buckles connect very easily.  There are no problems with the chest buckle or the leg buckles.  The release button is very easy to release. The detachable cup holder is a nice feature. The instructions were easy to follow.<br /><br />Overall I would not purchase this car seat again.  In fact we are considering buying another car seat based on how much our child cries when placed in this one.
B00158DS0U|4|it is a good accessory. Helps a lot to carry the baggage, but should be careful to not drop the stroller.
B0029F1KOO|5|Love this bodysuit.  Baby stays cool and dry in it. A word on sizing, though, it's definitely a trimmer fit than others, and runs a tad small. My little one is 9 weeks, 12 pounds, 23 inches and the 3-6 fits him just fine with a little room to spare. There's probably little chance he'll be fitting into it past about 4 months. Overall, I love it and will be buying more!
B002OOWAHG|5|I like the pattern a lot.  The pillow is perfect because it's not too fluffy.  It's more upright than my old bouncy, which I like.  The hanging toys are super cute.  The vibrate is gentle and my baby loves it.
B005UV0UCM|5|got this for my grandson and his mother is very happy and pleased with the crib, breaks down easily and has a carry bag for travel.  I purchased this brand cause we had use Graco product with my children and was very pleased with the quality.  She did mention the little portable changer that comes with the crib and adjustable height of the floor was very nice.  The price was right as well.
B000SN69S6|5|Fits great on our MacLaren twin techno.  Bought before out trip to Disney.  Very useful product.  As mentioned by other reviewers, may not be the best for a cup of coffee.  But water bottles, sport bottles, sippy cups, drinks with a good lid it is fine. Overall, very happy with purchase.
B006R3KBYO|5|Everything you need for breast milk storage in one convenient box. Great addition to any medela pump purchase. Having the two sizes in bottles allows for greater flexibility to portion control. The freezer bags are great to save space and the fridge organiser tray keeps everything neat with a design specifically to aid easy milk date rotation (I.e. first in first out so you're not left with spoilt milk accidentally).
B00005QI1G|5|This is a great bouncer!!  We used it for our son from birth until about 6 months, when he was no longer interested in bouncing and more interested in moving.  In fact, I didn't realize how great it was until I tried two others that my mom and sister had bought.  They were way too short and didn't really allow him to bounce himself.  The kick 'n play is long enough for even the longest babies (mine was 22\\" at birth)and is very easy for them to bounce.  The toy bar is close enough for them to kick at and play with and the lights and music are entertaining.  Also, neither the toy bar nor the vibration use a lot of battery power, so you're not having to replace the batteries all the time.  I would reccommend this for anyone looking for a toy that will provide lots of entertainment for a reasonable price.
B001FQY8SS|2|poor design
B000YDDF6O|5|my daughter loves this!
B000070IW3|1|I regret not taking the advice of the other reviews.  Even with NEW batteries this swing has to be on the highest setting to swing and then still sometimes does not swing just clicks like it wants to.  The music sometimes does not play or it is distorted.  I am so happy Target returned this swing and now I have bought the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing.  My recommendation is to not buy this swing you will be wasting your money!!!
B000H1MRJO|5|My granddaughters stayed with me while their parents were in Hawaii and I bought these cots for them to use while they were at my house.  They loved them and couldn't wait to use them each night.  I loved them and bought two more for my grandsons.  They are very easy to use and I highly recommend them.
B00AP95R04|2|My son inadvertently ended up chewing on the clasp area once or twice, which caused the black connector to fall apart.  Now it's useless and I had to throw it away.
9729375011|5|I am so glad that I bought this book before my baby was born. I was able to use it in the hospital to record all of the feedings / diaper changes and it made the nurses happy that I had everything written down. I continue to use it daily. Now able to find a pattern in my baby's feeding / eating / pooping / sleeping. Truly useful from day one!
B002WZ2RE8|4|Got this for my daughter, who is 3. Little bro is teething, she was jealous and seems to need an oral fix still...this works great and has stopped her chewing on all the other things that are not for chewing, like toys, hands, clothes....
B00AJFHG8A|5|These pouches have been lifesavers. I purchased them before my youngest baby was ready to eat solids, but since I could not imagine going without. I make homemade baby food and bottle it myself, so it's a perfect addition to my supply of baby food. It saves me money on the store bought pouches and I know exactly what my baby is eating this way. It freezes well and I have not had any leakage problems. As long as you clean the zipper out well, there is no problems. I am very happy with my purchase. Both my baby and toddler love to use them and they make perfect snacks for travel or outings. I just love knowing I am providing fresh food to my kids and I don't have to worry about preservatives or how long they have been on the shelf.
B0033B9CZ2|5|works great! great price!
B00SRU8HEG|5|My baby is exclusively breast fed and was refusing the bottle.  She still didn't like the bottle, but this was one that she didn't hate.  We still have a long way to go before she'll drink from a bottle (our just call it quits and go straight to a sippy cup), but this one and the comotomo bottles are the only ones she'll take.  My only gripe is that there are so many parts to clean, but if you have the dishwasher top rack container, it makes it a bit easier.
B00020L79Q|5|My mini-schnauzer had double knee reconstructive surgery and has to be confined for three months.  I took off 2 panels from the original Superyard and made a square pen for her.  I bought 2 extra panels to make a four-panel square pen for another room.  It's PERFECT!!
B00B6JNY8E|5|Shipped fast, perfect size for diaper bag. A couple reviews have mentioned not containing stink, I haven't had this issue because I use a wet pail for my diapers rather than using a wet bag for every day use. This wet bag literally will not fit more than five or six diapers, so I doubt it was intended to be used as a full time diaper storage system anyway.
B006SFUCT0|4|Bought this for scalding milk. I have used this for about 7 months, it still works.
B002VSAPHC|4|I had the older one-piece carseat harness where one strap was fed through two slots and the other strap slid on and off an arm. To get the harness undone you simply slid the strap to the side and off the arm. Well, my little stink-bug figured that out quickly so I needed an updated replacement. I bought the sunshine clip because it was marketed as being universal and it was an actual clip that she wouldn't have the hand strength to unbuckle. It fit but my little stink-bug figured out that she could slide it down in order to put the straps under her arms. I did some online research on some mom-boards and found some helpful advice. I bought some buttons about 1.5 inches across and hand sewed them onto the straps right under the harness. They prevent her from sliding the harness down and can easily be removed and placed in a different position as she grows. That is why I gave only four stars. The harness IS universal and DOES clip tightly but could be improved by making the strap slots more snug. However, since the mom-inspired improvement was cheap and simple I don't feel like I need to give the product less than four stars.
B00TUI4NZ6|1|These bags are terrible. I bought one box to try them out and thought they were great so I ordered 4 more boxes. The second set of bags I received were nothing like the first box. These are made from thinner, cheaper plastic. The logo is different. They leak terribly. More than half of the bags I've used have leaked at the seam near the top where the closure meets the edge of the bag. I never put more than 5 ounces in a bag so it's not an overfilling issue. The bags are closed properly. It's an issue with the seams. I've lost at least 40 ounces of milk because of these bags.
B004DKMKHY|5|I cant tell you how much I love this bag. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it on the Ju Ju Be website. However, I didnt even entertain the thought of buying it when I looked at the price.     After looking at every diaper bag on the market, I ended up ordering a BeTween in Marvelous Mums from Amazon. I have to say, I do really like that bag. Its very practical, designed very well (could use a few adjustments though) and its a great size for shorter trips. That being said, carrying the BeTween for a few weeks, I decided it was just too small for full day outings. I couldnt fit my BeRich wallet into the mommy pocket, it had to go into the main part of the bag which limited the amount of space I had for other essentials. I knew I had to get a bigger bag so I broke down and bought the one I really wanted to begin with - The brown/Teal.    I was expecting the earth leather to feel like that horrible pleather from the 80s but it doesnt at all. The space inside the main bag is perfect for extra clothes, medicine/1st aid bag, paci wipes, my meds and anything else you can throw in there. The Teal lining has an embossed pattern that is very subtle. From the pictures it looks like flat fabric so I was very happily surprised to see that small touch.     The back pocket houses the diaper pad as well as diapers and wipes.    My only issue with this bag is the mommy pocket. I really like the double zipper pull on the BeTween and wish the BeFabulous had it as well. I also wish the mommy pocket was a tad bigger and had gusseted sides as well as insulated bottle pockets. I still have to put my wallet in the main pocket, but I have the room with this one and then some left over. The best part is, its fully loaded and its not heavy at all. I can also machine wash it!!    No diaper bag will be 100% what a person wants. This bag however, comes pretty darn close. LOVE IT!!
B00318CQQY|3|You only get two colors and they don't look like this. False advertisement. They have animals not the best designed animals on them. They do work which was needed for a growing 6 mos baby. If you use Nuks these are similar but if you use the round pacifiers do not recommend. I ordered that for an older baby will not take round pacifier
B002HU43GI|5|These nipples, unlike others, are made of a thicker silicone and therefore hold up to little ones nibbling!  I went through a dozen of the other brands Y-cut nipples (Dr. Browns) and consistently dealt with the nipples tearing.  Not these.  I have owned 4 of them for months now and have not had to replace them yet!  They are less expensive and of higher quality....I highly recommend them!  Don't waste your time or money with any of the others!!
B00LO7IQ22|5|What can I say other than this is a great carseat. I already own another Advocate G4 that I paid more money for and this one even comes with a cupholder. The seat itself is very sturdy and I can rest assured that my little one is safe. The material cleans up well and I wash mine in the washer. I do hang it to dry though. Very easy to install. I recommend having more than one if you have more than one vehicle as it is bulky to try to switch one. Very easy to adjust the headrest as your child grows too. This is a great universal color for either a boy or girl.
B008BGNT4O|5|This is an awesome walker, easy in and out. Supports body well and can adjust height. Large tray for holding toys
B006QSDLNS|5|Bought 2 for my boys (7 and 5) and they fit perfect in the Suburban.  They are a bit wide which is what most complain about if they do not have a bench seat.  The padding looked thin in the pictures but is surprisingly soft and no complaints from the kids.
B000IDSLOG|5|My daughter is 8 months now and still loves her \\"Sophie\\".  We got this for her when she was three months and, now that the teeth are coming in full force, Sophie offers her some relief. Even as the baby gets more \\"play\\" oriented Sophie seems to be a top \\"go to\\" toy--well worth the price.
B00S9IZPAK|5|This stroller organizer is incredibly adorable!  It easily fits on both our infant snap and go and our larger double stroller and it is so easy to put on and off the strollers.  Even though it comes off easily, it does stay in place extremely well.  It is a great add on because it can easily store so many essential items close at hand.  Water bottle for mom, snacks for the baby, car keys etc.  Anything you might want quick access to.<br />The organizer is very well constructed.  The details of the whale are sewn on instead of just glued and the stitching is firm and strong.  Both the inside and outside are made of materials that are easy to wipe down and clean which is extremely important for anything baby related.<br />The inside of the organizer has two compartments on the sides and one pocket with a Velcro closure in the middle that provide plenty of space to keep a variety of items easily accessible.<br />Perhaps most importantly, it is incredibly adorable!  The colors of the whale are bright and vibrant and I love the polka dots on the whale.  It is also gender neutral enough to use for either a boy or a girl. I love this organizer and am excited to use it on our stroller!<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.
B001I481LM|5|this is a great way to make your formula
B004LUQQGC|4|Love the bib, but disappointed that it was smaller than our other bibs made by the same company. These are the only bibs that can catch my kids' messes and hold up through several washes.
B004S2G244|5|These are great! My toddler loves having more grown up looking bowls and I don't have to worry about them breaking or harmful chemicals.
B00RHMGMMO|5|In all honesty I got these teethers as part of a promotion. I wasn't expecting much of them. Especially since my son (10 mos old) hasn't liked a single teething product we have bought him. Boy was I wrong!! These are fabulous! They are thin so fit well in baby's mouth, flexible and softer than other teethers so aren't hard on gums, handles make I easy to clip onto things with a pacifier clip and baby can hold the fruit end and put the handle in his mouth over his existing teeth just getting the sore gums!! It is great this is a 3 pack cause little man likes them so much he crawls off with them and then we can't find them! It is also nice for having one in the diaper bag, one in the house, and one for if the others get dirty. I'm extremely impressed and truly do recommend these!
B000FGFX8I|5|I was going to return the musical mobile because I thought it was pricey. Once I received it, I fell in love with it at first site. It was easy to assemble, and my 3 week old grandbaby loves it! I believe in quality and not quantity. This was a great purchase. I'm glad I decided to keep it.
B006I1QTYQ|5|Does just as promised. Easy to &#34;install&#34; and definitely saved a few inches so that the seat in front of this one could have more room. Great product.
B001O5GINS|5|This sheet is very plush and soft. and fits the co-sleeper perfectly. It was a good value for the money.
B00BUBNZC8|4|I find this cover really helpfull but it could be a little bit wider... the little one tends to pull on it sometimes and if it was wider then I wouldnt be so worried ;-)<br />Other than that GREAT!
B000O3PFVW|5|I bought this sippy cup to replace my son's plastic ones, to avoid the increasing concerns of leeching chemicals. (like BPA, the current newsmaker).  I had read some reviews that said it leaks.  We own two and they never leak, as long as you reassemble them correctly after putting them through the dishwasher.  The double-walled Foogo makes for a much  nicer product than the Klean Kanteen noninsulated one (which we also own).  It keeps the kids' hands from getting cold with ice drinks and, more importantly, can keep a drink cool for 6 hours out of the refrigerator!  Very handy for roadtrips and forgetting in a play room.    No downsides.  Highly recommend for all children instead of the plastic sippy cups.!
B00UVMEY5O|4|Love the style of this bag, however, it's smaller than I anticipated and the stripes are navy and a dark cream/off-white. I didn't anticipate the cream being so dark but overall it's still a good bag. I use it to carry my pump and supplies but after all that, there's not much room left to use it as a diaper bag.
B0042D69V0|5|I bought this for my granddaughter, which is 4 1/2 months old and weighs 12 1/2 lbs. I have to place a pillow under her because she is only 25 1/4 inches tall but she loves it. She sits in it  bounces and plays for hours. Best buy I have made!!!
B0043D28B4|5|It was a gift for a baby. It's hard to say how much she liked it, but her mother sure did!
B000G4LU0Y|3|I bought the Munchkin Dora 2 packs and my 1 year old loves the images and easily can drink from them, but they leak too much. Also, the stopper inside comes out easily and you only realize it once the water is allover the floor and you baby is crying because she slipped in the water. The images also fade very quickly. I bought them because they were similar to drinking from a regular cup and now need to research what other cups I can buy.
B00200LOSK|5|description of product is just what I was looking for.
B006PASHMW|4|We got the Clevamama Pacifier Microwave Steriliser to use when our granddaughter visits. Her parents don't use a microwave at home, so it stays here.<br /><br />The pacifiers are easy to mount (they include two with the kit), and with just a little bit of water and a minute in the microwave, the pacifiers come out looking and feeling clean. Sorry, but we can't certify that the pacifiers are indeed sterilized!<br /><br />We wish we had something like this when we were raising children! Good product.
B00KLE1CYS|3|Too big
B000LSL5ZK|5|Nice first spoons. Bright vibrant colors and an excellent price.
B004XASRHQ|5|I did like it alot. My Son did have fun with it. Thank you so much. I will probably come back for more.
B00I6IGF4I|4|The ERGObaby 360 is a great carrier. It is light weight and does not cause me back pain or discomfort. I have used the ERGObaby 360 facing inwards and facing front outwards with my 5 month old son who weighs 19 pounds. I have yet to be able to try it with him on my hip or back since he needs to be 6 months old. I received this after he was heavier than 12 lbs, so he was past needing the infant insert. The infant insert needs to be purchased separately.<br /><br />The ERGObaby 360 carrier, has a narrower shape so I am able to fold it up to fit in my diaper bag. The ERGObaby has a Velcro strap that goes around your waist with an additional buckle for safety. This allows people of different sizes to use the carrier comfortably. I have used it, my wife has used it, and even my 5 ft tall mother has used it. My mother said it was more comfortable to use the ERGObaby than carrying my son in her arms because of his size. This carrier does not cause me back pain. It took me some time and repeated use to familiarize myself with the different setting and to feel at ease putting my son securely in this carrier.<br /><br />Some people have had trouble with the instruction manual.  The ERGObaby website has videos that link to YouTube on how to use the carrier. I found these videos to be very helpful. I had previously never used an ERGObaby carrier and the videos helped me to understand the button positioning for inward facing vs outward facing. The hip wearing video was especially useful. Since the straps need be connected in a specific way to make the carrier safe to use on your hip. What the instruction manual didn't mention was the sleeping hood.  The extendable back panel (the fabric in front that folds up for neck support when facing inwards) has a zipper compartment. When you unzip it, unrolls a thin piece of fabric with snaps on the side. When your child is facing inwards you can put this over their head to protect them from the sun or for privacy when they are sleeping orbreastfeeding. The snaps attach to the snaps on your shoulder straps. It is a great feature that we have used many times.<br /><br />I also have a Babybjorn One carrier. The ERGObaby requires an infant insert that is sold separately in order to use it with a baby under four months. The Babybjorn One carrier has a zipper that allowed us to use it when our son was an infant. It was nice that the Babybjorn goes from infant to 33lbs without any additional accessories. I really like both carriers and use them both frequently.  For both carriers, you need to hold the carrier with one arm and place the baby in with the other arm.  When inserting the baby into the carrier, I feel the Babybjorn is more secure with the extra buckles. But once the baby is properly in, both carriers feel secure. I highly recommend both.<br /><br />If you are looking at getting an ERGObaby carrier, get the 360 carrier. I like that the ERGObaby has the bucket shape for the baby's hips and spine. Being able to carrier your baby in so many different positions makes it worth the money. It is comfortable and easy to use. The sleeping hood shields my son when sleeping from prying eyes and the sun. It is lightweight and when used properly securely holds my son.  I highly recommend it.
B002WGI5NO|5|This &#34;pillow&#34; is amazing!!!! I own the foam one and this one, and trust me this is as travel friendly as you can get. You fold it and put it in its little pouch. I take it everywhere. It is the same size as the traditional one. I got the boppy travel but exchanged it for this one. I take it with me everywhere and inflate it with my lungs. Takes 30 seconds. Some reviewers say that you need an air pump to inflate it. NOT TRUE, you can inflate it with your mouth where the pump will go.<br />The only recommendation I give is that once you open it let it air for a few days because it comes with that plastic smell. It goes away. The cover is similar to the one in the traditional pillow.<br />Definitely a must have if you like to travel and enjoy the convenience of these type of pillows.
B0001XDOQ8|4|This is a great value for the set. While the thread count could be a little higher, after washing with fabric softener, all and all, the set was really nice and I have no qualms about having my very first grandchild sleeping on this set! It looks very nice nad since the set is also going to be used as the cover for the convertible crib when it changes into a daybed when my grandson isn't at the house, the set is nice enough to be used as an everyday daybed set. So, all and all I would say it's a pretty good buy.
B00JBYNNB4|4|My Grandson loves anything to do with Thomas the Train items...and this  porta-potty is perfect for his potty training.!
B00AO08044|5|Perfect for my wall decor project.  It's big and well painted.  Happy with the product
B00GXVDM1Y|1|Granted I have not tried other manual breast pumps but this just seemed terrible. It was insanely hard to pump, one or two handed and I couldn't get anything maybe maybe a drop or two unless I was insanely engorged. I could get more my manual expression. Insert that came with pump said they have full money back refund but in my postpartum haze I threw away box and insert. Out the money and don't have a manual pump for on the go. :(
B004FNVBCY|5|Love this thing it's a great price and keeps my little guy warm without over heating him.
B00AHVR6T0|5|It took me a while to decide on which highchair to buy for our grandchild.  We already bought a Graco playpen earlier.  And after looking at a number of styles of baby highchairs, we decided on the Graco one because it looks like a good to serve its purpose. We did not regret buying it.
B0081C9UO6|5|My son loves filling the cups and dumping the water out during his baths. They are colorful, have different shapes and sizes, easy to clean and easy to store. I wish they were not made in China but, like most toys, I could not find cups for this price that were made elsewhere. Simple design but hours of fun.
B00R0QRFDC|5|I love this jogger! Graco's other jogger is huge with a really high handlebar, so I was happy to discover this new more compact model that is compatible with my click connect car seat. I'm 5'4&#34; and don't feel like a child when I go out with this stroller. The ride is smooth for my kids, so no complaints there!<br /><br />The one gripe I do have is that the tires were not fully inflated when the stroller arrived, and it's kind of a pain to fill them.
B000QWA9F8|4|Good protection for strollers. After a long haul flight including two stops, the bag was a little torn but my stroller in great shape. I think I can use this bag for a few more flights.
B00006S3RX|5|Before I purchased this item, I read almost all of the reviews.  I had to say that some of the bad reviews scared me and initially I was not going to buy this model.  My husband and I were in a Baby R Us and decided to try out the floor model.  Our son, then 4  months old, loved it immediately so we brought one home.    <br /> <br />I was shocked when I saw how many pieces were in the box, but it only took me a half an hour to assemble the toy.   I'm not sure if I have a newer version of this toy, but all the things people said about sharp or hard plastic toys doesn't seem to apply.  The \\"jester\\" rattle is very rounded on ours and has never gotten stuck in his mouth.  We also haven't had any problems with toys falling off. <br /> <br />I'm also not sure if my son is a brute, but the \\"king and queen\\" play music easily and some of the songs are quite long.  The sound quality is not great, but it's clear enough for me to recognize all but one song and it makes my baby smile.  I haven't had trouble with flaking paint, but we've only had ours for 3  months so I will definitely be on the look out for that problem. <br /> <br />Collapsing the toy is difficult, but I would be worried if it were easier.  I wouldn't want it to fall while my son was in the toy.  I don't think it's particularly heavy, but it is a large even when collapsed.   <br /> <br />As for educational value, I am a teacher and had many classes in early childhood development.  The toys are different shapes, textures, colors, and can be manipulated in different ways.  For an adult, this has no value; however for a baby who is still figuring out how things work it is educational.  He or she is learning that \\"If I hit this, it makes sound.\\" <br /> <br />If I let him, my son would stay in this toy all day.  My only complaint is that he has almost out grown the exersaucer.  He is tall for his age and will soon be too tall for the highest level.    <br />
B007OOW7RO|5|We did hours and hours of research on Pram-strollers for our baby and found this Roan Kortina Pram. We really love this Kortina Pram.<br />The bassinet is very roomy; chassis gives very smooth ride. This Pram is the only type that allows you to go out and literally walk with baby; all other strollers do not have good (big) enough wheels to ride on sidewalk.  You also can rock the Pram even when you do not walk and its great option if you want to rock your baby to sleep.<br />The seat is very nice and very well made as well. The nice part you can change position of the back, so when/if baby falls asleep during the ride, just adjust the back of the seat and baby will continue sleep on flat surface.<br />Excellent choice if you want your baby to feel comfortable and sleep with straight spine (as it should be!!!) first few months. Well worth every penny we paid.
B0036MEL2W|5|After receiving the Green Toys Tea Set for my daughter's second birthday, I saw these plates, bowls and spoons and ordered them.  They are a great size for a young toddler, not too big but big enough.  This is a wonderful company, making safe plastics from recycled material. Unlike other plastic dishes, these are dishwasher safe (they don't emit poisons when heated).  They are not recommended for the microwave, but we use a glass dish to heat in the microwave and transfer over anyway.  Even their packaging is great.  The price also can't be beat. This would make an excellent gift for a new eater, but is great for any child who likes to eat :-)
B000GECMZ6|5|My husband and I just had our first baby, a boy, a month ago.  We chose not to know the sex of the baby ahead of time so shopping for a room decor was difficult.  When I saw the Park Ave set, I fell in love with the simple, classic design.  The product didn't disappoint.  Don't let the frilly picture (with all the ruffled accessories) fool you. . . the bedding is perfect for a boy or a girl.
B007A2ZSZ8|3|One didn't last 5 minutes before coming off permanently, the other only exists today because my toddlers don't mess with it at all.
B00GEQ6R88|4|It is a nice bag that matches the stroller but I cannot fit everything that I need in to it.
B00851W5JA|3|When we purchased this for our son, he was still being spoon-fed and if I had written a review back then, I would have given 5 stars and a rave review. He loved being at the table with us and we wanted him to feel like part of the family at meal times. I loved the 360 feature of being able to swivel him around to wherever I was feeding him from and this chair beats most on looks.<br /><br />Everything changed when he began to self-feed. Food would get smashed into the fabric to the point that a wet rag wasn't up to the task of removing it. Taking the fabric part of the chair off, washing it in the washer on delicate and air drying it over night soon became part of my nightly routine. Shortly after that, the food would be smashed in the crevices required for the chair to spin 360 so bad that I would have to remove the chair from the table, take off the arms, use a screw driver to completely disassemble it, wash it, re-assemble, screw, and then attach it back to the table. It got to the point I was doing this nightly as well.<br /><br />We replaced it with a much cheaper all plastic booster-type seat that is MUCH easier to clean.
B000067K0L|4|Baby girl loves this mat!  She especially loves staring up at the giraffe.  She's 2 months now and is grabbing at the parrot and monkey!  She plays on this everyday and is always entertained!!  We bought a little kick piano and tied it to the post of her crib, so she lays on this mat and kicks the piano.  She hasn't discovered that the little flowers on the mat make noise.  I'm giving this mat 4 stars because it's huge when folded!  It goes back into the plastic container it came in, but is still the size of a poster board.  I'm looking into one that folds up a little smaller to bring in her stroller with me!  We still love this mat, just not traveling with it!
B00994N8N4|5|Bought this for my son. Totally worth it will be buying more.
B009W4KC8A|5|These were perfect!  My son is a year old and between sizes.  12 month pants are just a tiny bit short for him and 18 months are too long and the waist is too big for him. He literally slid out of his 18 month pants while crawling!  I finally decided to try these suspenders.  He wore them for the first time yesterday, Thanksgiving Day.  Not only did his pants stay on all day (even with all of his excessive crawling and playing), but he looked so adorable in them.  He got so many compliments!  I am gong to get them in other colors as well to match his other outfits.  These were the perfect solution!
B0032Z81M4|5|I loved this pillow. I didn't find the back support to be very useful but other than that, great pillow. After having two babies in one day, I never plan on having more children so I was more than happy to pass this pillow along.
B00LZKC20U|5|The first toy I purchased myself for baby. I really like it. Great colors! Makes nice crunchy noise. I wish it wasn't made in China...but almost everything like this is sadly.
B00VWBY7SC|4|Exactly what we needed.
B007NG5UF4|5|My wife and I ordered this for our 4 year old, since his room is clear across the house, and sometimes it's difficult to hear him calling across the house. We have had it or a few weeks now, and it has great sound, and I love that the parent unit comes with a battery pack that charges while it is plugged in, so no more fumbling with batteries if you want to take it with you! I also love the talk back feature, we can give a few comforting words to him in the night without having to get up and stumble over his Legos in the dark. It really helps him feel secure, knowing that mommy is right at the other end of his 'walkie talkie' in case he should need anything :)
B004044LD4|5|Perfect mattress and even better price.
B00H796G6O|5|Arrived quickly and in perfect condition, I bought all the matching accessories and everything is great. My daughter is going to be very excited to open this on her birthday.
B000O3GCFU|5|My kids have been using it for one month. It keeps warm/cold for several hours as expected. Hope the size is little bigger.
B000XT30G4|2|If you want this gate for any length of time I would not recommend it.  I thought it was fabulous at first but after about 2 months it started falling apart.  I have a daycare and used it to keep the kids out of the kitchen, so I was constantly opening and closing it to go into the kitchen.<br />Maybe it would last longer if you were to use it somewhere where you are not constantly opening and closing it.<br /><br />We ended up throwing it away.
B0083IY0R0|5|Super cute and well made.  This cuddly little doll was every bit as nice as I hoped for.  Great price too.  My little 1 year old niece will love her!
B000XT30G4|5|Absolutely worth every penny! I love it. I am not the slimmest and fit easily through the gate. It is solid, strong and beautiful! I use it on a wider staircase to keep the dogs from going upstairs.
B000B57XZO|5|I bought it in my recent trip to the US (car rental want to charge me $90 for 10 days child seat rental). I bring it back to my home country, and I have to switch it over cars because my daugther always want to ride in her \\"adult, special\\" seat.  <br /> <br />BTW, the cops here praise this booster design. A plus.
B001OC62VY|4|I bought this elsewhere, but had been using our eddie bauer shopping cart cover as a high chair cover. I didn't like using the shopping cart cover b/c it was large and bulky and didnt fit the highchairs well. the fisher price cover is sized perfectly and fits restaurant high chairs like a glove. However a few things I'm not crazy about is that although the fabric is the type you can \\"wipe clean\\" this makes it pretty slick and my baby slides around on it and slides forward. I'm always having to sit him back up. Also the \\"slots\\" in the cover for the straps to come through are way too small. I will have to cut them to make larger. And the velcro loops to tether toys easily come undone with a little tug. I wish they were sewed closed as most toys attach with easy to remove links. this does fit great in the diaper bag and folds neatly into itself. not a bad product, but with a few minor improvements it could be excellent.
B002UD65ZE|3|These are more like large washcloths. They're soft but so small that they're not highly useful for real life. They'd be better if either smaller or larger but seem kind of inadequate as they are. They ARE moisture resistant, not sure if they're really moisture PROOF as we didn't use so much due to their size.
B0078LRJVM|3|While I really like everything else about this backpack, the makers opted for a cheap short cut by putting the straps on an existing part of the infrastructure, leaving them too far apart.  If I didn't sew and couldn't move the straps to where they belong, I would send the pack back.  Until I moved them, my big tall two year old spent most of her time pulling the straps up off her arms where they constantly slid.  It's a deal breaker.
B00AWLZFSO|4|These are great, but I think there should be three ice packs instead of just one since there are three cups!
B003CN0V7Y|1|this may work for newborn nails; but I did not purchase until my twins were 9 months old. It's not strong enough to file their nails at this point and we had to go back to the nail file.
B0038JE1WS|4|This booster seat is adorable and very well made for the price. My grandson loves it. It is very colorful and durable!
B00920Y2LM|1|Not handled correctly on your end, arrived with decals off and is unusable<br />Will not be able to use it :(
B001J2HW4K|5|One of the easiest decorations I have ever purchased!  Love how easy it was to apply to the walls and they have held up!  Adds extra fun to our daughters room.
B00007DWBH|5|i have this base and the compatible graco car seat, and i couldn't love it more. i had a hard time getting my base and seat properly installed...car seats just aren't easy to maneuver! but my local fire station had a &quot;car seat expert&quot; who helped me adjust the base so it's not going anywhere! i feel confident that my car seat is installed properly now, and i'm sure i know the best way to secure my baby in it. (we didn't need to purchase any extra clips - we used the locking clip that came with the seat to prevent the seat from moving.) my understanding is that many fire departments across the country are willing to help...it's worth the half hour! all parents should be sure to do this!
B000VNLHGW|5|the product fit our mattress perfect and is helping to protect it from our 2 small children.  It does not have any crinkly sound which I was glad for. Great product for a great price.
B00B7XUVOE|3|It doesn't fit in my diaper bag made by skip hop, I have to take one part off to get it to fit.
B00GU2WAIW|4|Purchased this for my daughters room, she has alot of stuffed animals..It's a bit smaller then what i wanted but overall it was a good purchase and holds quit a bit of stuffed animals...
B00X3ZPWRA|5|This is such a great product!  After making the mistake of not buying one of these with my first child, I knew I had to get one for my second.  It definitely prevents any diaper leaks from making it to the mattress and when washing it, it doesn't ruin the liner.  If you have a wetter like me, than you feel like you wash bed sheets how many times in one week so knowing that it doesn't get ruined after multiple washes is a definite plus.  I would definitely recommend this item!
B00GTVD2TA|5|Great sponge for baby
B004WP8QKA|4|I love these. Really, love. It makes me sad to only give them 4 stars because they're so soft and comfortable. I haven't had any problems with slipping or bunching, which is awesome. My only problem with them is size. They're on the small side, which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but I wasn't. I have regulars in other brands that are significantly longer. I may try the supers and see if they're a better size, but these do make the perfect backup for my divacup. Unfortunately, I just don't trust them by themselves.
B002UD65XQ|3|Really doesn't hold up well to multiple washings and our first one did not take well to being sanitized which with kiddo's reflux, we often have to do. So while I like it, it's not my favorite. We do use it below the sheet on kiddo's side for cosleeping backup.
B00FLV7R4U|5|Absolutely love these. Easy to use and easy to remove.
B00BBKLMUA|4|Great monitor! The picture is great, even in the dark. I love the rotating and zoom features. One complaint I have is the battery pack only lasts a few hours. This is not good if you're needing to use the monitor on the battery pack overnight. Also it would be good if the parent piece would give you a signal when the battery dies on the battery pack. If the battery dies you have no way of knowing, and if you're asleep that's not good.
B00295MQLU|5|I would highly recommend this bra for anyone who is pumping! It's so nice to not have to hold the bottles while pumping. It is great that it adjusts to your size.
B005PK1C7U|5|super easy and quick to install
B0000E5XHH|5|When I was preganant, I looked at all the strollers at Babies R Us and was going to get the Graco Clarion because it was the whole travel system for about $180.  When I really looked at, it looked uncomfortable and you had to take a course to learn how to open and close the stroller.  Besides that, it was really heavy.  Also, I noticed that at the mall everyone and their mothers had the same stroller.<BR>One customer then showed me the Peg Perego Pliko P3 and she said it was the best, so of course, like all new moms that want the best for their babies, I bought it. The stroller is $270 but the price is worth it.  I can open and close the stroller in less than 10 seconds.  My daughter enjoys her stroller because it is cushioned and comfortable.  I am in love with the stroller. <BR>This is the best stroller out there!
B0044VUXGW|1|Too easy to open my 3 year old daughter had it open within an hour.
B00AHVR4KG|5|Bought it for our new gret-granddaughter...her mom  nd dad just love it...so far Piper (aged 2 mos) has not commened, but she hasn't compained either......<br /><br />Proud Great-grandma
B000UCCATW|2|I bought this highchair from a friend, who loved it. I had been considering it because Chicco products overall are very good and decided to buy hers after she raved about how great it was. So far I don't like it very much. The tray is hard to get on and off, especially when trying to hold your baby at the same time. It slides on over the arms but you have to depress a button at the same time. The clear tray cover snaps on so tight it's nearly impossible to remove. I almost tore off a fingernail trying to remove it so I could clean underneath. Now I don't use the cover at all and my baby just eats off the tray. Another thing I hate is the indentation that goes all the way around the tray. Food is constantly getting stuck in there and it's very hard to get out. And I can't for the life of me figure out why it's there! It serves no purpose except to trap food apparently. I also think this chair might be better for a toddler. My average size 10-month-old looks so tiny in it and sits so low it's hard for her to pick up food from the tray.      That said, there are a few things I like about it. The seat cover is plastic-y and therefore very easy to wipe clean. I didn't want a fabric seat cover that I'd have to wash all the time. It has a 5 pt harness so my wiggly baby is very secure. It is also sturdy and has held up well.
B001EQ66WK|5|This new updated shrunks toddler bed, can accommodate a crib mattress which is awesome because the older one we own has no sheet that fits it.
B000HK6BCE|1|We have to use these on our pull out coach. They were barely an inch over our other mattresses. Since most mattresses are now big, they really need to rethink this item.
B006QBI81K|3|Top Outside of Shoulder to Opposite Bottom of Hip Measurement<br />Regular: 23-26 inches<br />Large: 27 to 30 inches<br /><br />Tip:  If you are currently pregnant, have someone take these measurements from your back side and add two inches for your post belly.  This will get you in the correct range.<br /><br />As you can see, these slings do not fit plus size mamas, so be careful!
B0042D69UQ|4|I like<br />...
B005J04B60|5|This works great. Keeps baby safe and not a hard install if you can run a drill and simple hand tools.<br />Also you dont need storage like the fold up gates when not in use as this just retracks and rolls up just like the picture.
B009EDSWJA|5|Quality and cheap product.NO chemical smell.
B00F9OQ1CI|1|The pearls on the bow were loose. Some had fallen off in transit and some fell off when my daughter wore it! She is a baby so little beads that fall off are a choking hazard! Do NOT buy this item - it is NOT safe.
B000HVDZIG|5|If you are a NoJo Jungle lovers, this border set is for you!<br />Don't afraid to cut in any pieces, because  you will never find a stick borders.<br />Easy to apply, come to pre-paste. Just use little roller and apply to your wall.<br />30 minutes and your room will have extra addition.
B00LPAFQ26|4|Great size, fits in our midsize SUV nicely. Jiggled while car was in motion at first but after readjusting it is more secure.
B00AO081BG|5|Exactly what I was looking for in quality and size. I did paint it because I do not like that sanded edge look it came in. Made easy for hanging with the keyhole cuts in the back.
B00H882WGC|5|Easy to install, seems to stay in place well. Not terribly unattractive - sometimes I don't even notice it. Will be purchasing for other tables in our home.
B00A72MXLU|4|This stroller is not high-tech and is not luxury. It serves an occasional (or short-term, as most snap-n-gos are) purpose. Doesn't turn super smoothly, but walks well. We use it with the Maxi Cosi carseat that doesn't fit in some of the other snap-n-go seats. You have to strap this one in with the included red strap, but that's easy. Great storage capacity underneath, and well worth the price.
B004GHN2D0|1|Let's see - the screw/bolt that hold the front wheels in place fell off, the sun shade is flimsy and though it *looks* big, it barely covered my one-year old.  DO NOT waste your money on this stroller...and don't expect Peg Perego to care, as I just got off the phone with them and the customer service rep. couldn't care less about the hunk of junk they have on the market.  I wouldn't even sell this stroller to someone else.
B00VR0ORUQ|5|Amazing product! Definitely works... I attached in on my medela pump and after 5min I have pumped about 3oz or so.... Wish it came with the hands free breastpump tie. It gets expensive buying baby product and mama product.
B002GZ68UI|5|BUENO
B004LE8TG8|5|I bought this to go with the baby book that matches. It's super cute, and I can't wait to fill it up with memories!
B000058CC7|4|I enjoy having hands free to get through the gate.  I use it to keep my dogs from going into certain areas of the house.  It is doing the job.
B007LKFW7I|5|I really is what I expected
B00KHR829M|5|Love this!  I wish I had this for our first son. We used a pack-n-play when we traveled but this is so much easier and convenient. Works great as his crib next to our bed while he is tiny.  It's extremely easy to put up and take down.
B0056Z2BTM|4|Loved this gift for my sister!
B00GJG9XUW|4|Item works very well. Would be better it it had a larger reservoir.
B0028IDXDS|5|so cute
B00KD5YQVG|3|Did not work for my daughter. Too large and poofy. I bought a clevamomma instead. Much flatter.
B000F78UAU|4|Easy to put together and works great - very comfortable and fantastic quality for the price
B000TVLYOQ|4|I have not really used this to much because my daughter is a month old. It seems like a good product I use it in the middle seat of my car and it is very large. I have not used the storage container yet so I have no idea wether it is good or bad. It does seem kind of flimsy due to the fact that it does not have hard sides.
B003D7N1YE|1|The first time I had this out was for a short run with my running stroller. The bottom velcro strap tore right off the plastic. It's very cheaply made and I'm really disappointed with this purchase. Put the $13 towards a better quality rain cover.
B000H1MRJO|5|I've watched my grandson since he was born 15 months ago.  Until 3 months ago I lived in an apartment where I had no room for a crib so I laid him on my bed for nap time.  The apartment was on one floor, had open floor space and was small so I could keep an eye on him while in the other areas (dining and kitchen).  In December I moved into the 2 story, 7 room home I bought.  I also bought a new bed which is so high even I almost need a stepping stool to get in it.  Temporarily I laid him on my couch which meant the possibility of him falling off if he rolled over while asleep.  So I had a problem.  But not for long.  I ordered the Regalo My Cot and I love it.<br /><br />It folds and unfolds (in less than a minute) and is so lightweight I can move and set it up anywhere--upstairs or downstairs--in my house with ease.  He can sleep in proximity to where I am working or relaxing--kitchen, living room, bedroom--so I don't have to check on him as often or put off a task I want to do.  And if he rolls over and falls off the cot (which he hasn't) the most he can do is scare himself awake.  From the floor, the cot is about the height of a basketball.  I'm 67 years old so all these features are pluses.  Before I lay my little one down, I place a folded blanket on the cot to cushion it.  He sleeps comfortably and his nap time averages 1 1/2 hours.  Believe me, you can't go wrong if you purchase this cot.
B00020V5A2|1|After reading all the mixed reviews, I decided that the only way we were going to be able to decide was to try it out for ourselves.  Needless to say, the monitor was sent back the very same week.  We could only be in the next room and get a clear picture, and even that was 'iffy'.  We were sorely disappointed!
B00AJSIVWW|5|Packaging was great! Delivery time was great! Super easy to put together and take apart. My 5 year old is small for her age and she loves this chair!
B000G1YW98|3|These are bulky and hard to unfold.  They can also be knocked over fairly easily if they are not locked into a circle or placed against something.  For crawlers it works good but for babies who can stand / walk / climb, I do not recommend this gate.
B0090WXRJA|3|installation nightmare
B004G8QSYO|4|My grandbaby loved these blocks. She played with them on Christmas day. Soft, and safe for a 8 month old.
B004V903RG|5|I have nothing but good things to say about these bags.  No issues thus far.  They freeze well, they defrost fine, no leaks, and pour out easily.  They appear thin but are strong.  I would recommend them as they end up being cheaper in the long run with this bulk 300 bag purchase for $44.99
B000GK5XY2|4|Sent a review of this product, but not sure if you received it so will write it again. I like this product very much....my grandchildren use theirs all time. However I was very disappointed when the order arrived. This was a baby BOY registry and eventhough it said that colors may vary I received a pink one! Not wanting to give a pink one I decided to send that one to my granddaughter and purchase another one to give as a gift. I went to Wal-Mart and they had them for $2.88 each.<br />I purchased them for $11.00 a pair from the website. Needless to say again the cost was very pricey for this item!!
B000I2MRLK|5|My daughter loves this toy, keeps her occupied, especially in the car.  Sometimes she gets \\"mad\\" at it, but it overall is great.  Love that it has two sides, very nice to break up the monotony or if it falls she isnt screaming to have it put back the other way. We got it when she was 3 months old, now she is 5 months and still likes it a lot.
B00004DS9S|3|This tub was a blessing to have for a newborn baby.  The sling held our son safe and secure while I bathed him.  Our son was a large baby, so the pillow worked fine for us.  We discovered he loved the water at an early age, and so we removed the sling after 3mos.  He loves splashing and playing in the water, but we quickly discovered the foam pad DOES NOT hold an active infant.  He slides down in the water as soon as he starts playing.  He's already able to sit up, so it's not lack of muscle control... the pad just doesn't grip his bottom!
B00M74DGEE|5|My son loves this seat!! The included harness straps get twisted & are hard to unbuckle, so we just use it a a booster with the regular seatbelt.
B003BX05YY|4|Very cute, I bought it thinking it was organic, but when I washed it (before initial use) the water turned green :(  I just washed the cloth really well, a lot of times, before giving it to my baby.
B0064NA7Z0|4|Fast shipping suuuuper small should be priced at 29$
B001579YRM|5|Every family with a baby should own this. The light is a lifesaver- not only for clipping nails in the dark, but for splinters, boo boos, and just the ability to see clearly what you're clipping.
B005RQGT1Q|4|good product
B00CSKMEHC|2|Did not fit on my babies crib. Had to return
B00005N9X5|2|I bought this for my 1.5 year old son and found that it simply isn't tall enough to allow him to sit comfortably at the table. It really only added a few inches to the height of the chair. We've never had a highchair at home; we've always used a Fisher Price Healthy Care booster (which we LOVE). That seat works great at local restaurants and friend's houses. We were looking for a light-weight alternative for international travel and found the First Years booster to just be too short for our son to actually feed himself. Might work well for a child at 2 years OR if you mostly feed your child (instead of having him/her self-feed with utensils or hands). Too bad because it is a nice little compact product.
B005AM5K3A|2|I was expecting this to be more like a pacifier clip but it is more like a toy clip. I wish they hadn't advertised it as being both. It is fairly short for a pacifier clip and bulky. It's made well and looks nice but just wasn't what I expected.
B000J0F0J2|1|I bought this for my daughter and husband's first baby, a boy.  They are avid Vikings fans, but when they opened it up, the football which hangs in the center of the mobile was missing, very disappointed!  The football was a major figure in this mobile too.  I'm not sure if I'll order another.   It was very cute, but a major part missing!
B006XJ94V8|5|Great and my little loves Dr. B bottles!
B002VX3RCW|5|I bought this toy when my grandson was less than a year old and he loved it. It is very colorful and well made.  Enough said.
B00HXZYCAE|5|So cute and soft
B00003TL7P|5|This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in. It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie. It is also very user friendly in that you only need one hand, just drop in the diaper flip the handle over and you're done.
B0013NB70A|3|Initially I was very pleased with these spoons. They do turn white when food is too warm (it doesn't even have to be hot), which is a nice feature, but as reviewed elsewhere, I always test the food myself anyway, just to be sure I don't burn my baby's mouth.<br />The tips are soft and have a great \\"pointy\\" tip, which is nice for digging into avocado or scraping food off cheeks.<br />However, the reason I only gave 3 stars is becuse the handle of the spoon is stainless steel/metal, and my baby continually tries to grab the spoon to feed himself. What happens is that he grips the metal and then getting him to let go is a little tug-o-war...and I think the metal is more likely to hurt his hand. I never pull hard, but basically, end up either waiting for him to release the spoon, or opening each finger individually.<br />I have a plastic handle spoon and feel more comfortable tugging on that for him to release, as it won't cut into his hand anywhere.<br />The colors in the 4-pack are not gender specific, which I actually don't mind, however, they are not as depicted in the image on Amazon. The colors are less saturated in real life. Also, the two pink-ish spoons are very similar in color. I use those two for orange colored food, as the staining, which does happen, is less apparent. Eventually, I'll probably have an orange spoon, instead of pink...fine by me.
B0057NCI3W|1|While it did keep the rain off, it should be noted that this item does not make your infant carrier float.
B004LD6VLO|2|I didn't care for this. Was smaller then I would have liked. The tones and colors were cool.
B007R9S9K0|5|This luggage is great. The patches are real patches and not printed. My son loves these and uses the back pack for school every day.
B004TA93AU|5|I am very pleased with this crib/changer combo.  It took my husband and I a little less than two hours to assemble.  I like that there are drawers and have already stocked the drawers with diapers and bedding...I think this will be so convenient once we are actually using the crib in a few weeks.  The size of the crib is perfect for our nursery.
B002CN5E22|3|The thins is amazing my daughter loves it.  However, the little box with the batteries and buttons stops working or uses up the battiers a lot, especially if you use the 45 min time or leave it on as a soother. Thats why i am giving it a three star.
B0016ZX7AI|2|If your child doesn't want to stop sucking his/her thumb, all he/she needs to do is rip the thing off.  I guess, in principle, this is a good idea, but doesn't really work without the cooperation of your kid.  I'm using a kind of liquid now, that I &#34;paint&#34; on to my son's finger.  Works like a charm.
B00660U4M2|5|We had purchased another glider previously for around the same price as this one but it just wasn't comfortable so we returned it for this chair instead and we absolutely LOVE this one!! It glides so nicely and it is beyond comfortable. We will spend many hours in this chair with our new baby in comfort. The price that Amazon is selling this chair for is the cheapest anywhere, I promise!! I looked everywhere to compare pricing before purchasing. Happy Gliding!!
B0056ZJMR6|4|Just wish the back reclined further
B004UDWFCE|2|I now own this monitor for almost 4 months as a replacement for a previous Summer Infant. We decided to upgrade the older monitor mainly because of the multi-camera capability. After these first months of experience my impressions are:  PROS  - Multi-camera capability: it really works. We have one camera in our daughters room and another one in our little son's. It works perfectly  - Crisp picture (althought the screen is a bit too small)  - Portability  - 2-way audio: perfect with our little daughter. I can ask her to lay down without having to enter in her bedroom.  - Infrared led: it does have a good range and you can see the whole bedroom even in complete darkness  WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED  - Range: it´s amazing I did not see too many reviews putting it as a CON. Our unit fails at only 15ft of distance between the camera and monitor! The product description says the range is 150 feet indoor (clear line of sight required), however 15ft is a joke! This is mainly the reason why I´m giving it 2 stars only. One thing that may explain the difference between my (bad) experience and the average of the other reviews could be brick walls versus dry walls... My apartment has brick (thicker) walls and it may be the reason why the coverage is a disapointment for me...   - Vox: does not really work as expected. The screen and sounds blinks intermittently, regardless of the sound level  - Battery life: cameras and monitor need to be charging if you want them running all night. Battery lasts for about 3 hours only.  Bottom line: if the range were at least twice wider I´d give it a 4 star. With such a low range, all the nice features become pretty useless, since I cannot use it from my bedroom. If you have dry walls, give it a try.
B0098SZ3JS|1|Terrible. Stroller is way to long. Nearly impossible to take into stores and move around.
B00CKSU82K|5|I have put them on my baby jogger city select, and I love them for everything to hold purse/lunchbox to its easier to get to hold groceries!
B001AG0YL8|5|Great color and love that I can attach this to all kinds of towels and blankets.  We never loose the pacifier now
B00HLVV7OO|5|I use these cute critters all the time. Perfect for holding doors open or making sure little fingers don't get closed on doors
B005BWXJKK|5|When my daughter started standing in her crib and her teeth were coming out, she started chewing on the crib rail and tearing parts off it. I started searching for a solution and ran into the Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover. This is a great solution and I would recommend buying a set along with the bed in order to protect your little one from eating wood and paint from nibbling on the rails. It's made out of great quality, easy to wash and ties easily. Most importantly, it does the job and looks nice on the crib.<br />Make sure you buy enough covers for all four rails (two long, two short).
B0001GE2M0|4|We have used this monitor for almost 1 month and haven't had any issues with it.  It is expensive compared to others, but is the only one I know of that allows multiple locations to be heard.  The walkie-talkie feature is also great.  The only annoying thing I have come across is that when you set the receiver to Scan the monitors, you do not have a choice of which ones to listen to.  So, even though I really only need 2 rooms to be scanned I have to set up the 3rd unit so that when it listens to that one you don't just hear static.  It really isn't a big deal and actually I set the 3rd one up in the living room so that I can hear what is going on in there when I am not in there.
B005UND06I|5|works great next to the tub to save our knees when giving our daughter a bath.<br />Coordinates well with other Skip Hop accessories.
B00CLO8RPI|5|We were on our way to church and the kids were in the back seat.  My wife had purchased two bibs after seeing them on Shark Tank.  Our car has one of those cup holders located at the back of the console.  Generally this is out of reach of our children but apparently not their feet.  After swinging through the gas station to grab a couple of 64 oz. Cokes and we decided to head the last mile for church.  The two children started fighting over who had the best braid...now they can't touch each other because the car seats are far enough apart.  The mini tantrums ensued and the kicking started...still they couldn't get to each other.  Apparently the oldest child's toes could reach the cup though and a huge rocket of coke shot for the opposite window of the car where it proceeded to burst in a brown bomb destined for the youngest daughter's dress.  The inside of the car was drenched, the back of my wife's hair was drenched, and my youngest daughter's socks and shoes were drenched...BUT not her dress.  Over her beautiful pink and white \\"Easter dress\\" (worn every Sunday since she decided it was her favorite) lay the Bibbitec Bib in all of it's coffee shedding glory.  Like Excalibur of old it sliced through the coffee sending it directly to the floor of the car...not a single drop.  We were able to wipe off her arms, change her socks (...always carry a spare in the diaper bag), and head into church.<br /><br />What an amazing product.  The only way I could be happier is if you made car interiors.
B004769M70|3|My 2 yr old son enjoys brushing with the rubber banana brush.  It's a nice alternative to the traditional toothbrush.  My gripe is with the toothpaste.  Although the taste is good, it gets this rubbery gross residue near the cover so every time I open it, the residue stretches like a rubber band.  I prefer Earth's Best toothpaste to this one - it has a pleasant flavor without the rubbery goop.
B00CXJ94KS|4|I like this nightlight and it was affordable! The volume is loud enough and the projection is bright enough!
B000058DQJ|5|These shells are awesome! I'm so thrilled I found something to capture the breast milk which would otherwise be wasted each time I &#34;let down&#34;. This is a great way to save all of the healthy milk that you can for your baby. I have not used the vented pair in my bra as they do make your breasts appear to be odd shaped but they're perfect for slipping in your bra on the side you aren't feeding from. Highly recommend!
B00K5SPR6O|5|Very nice sleeper!!!
B002SG7JSK|1|Double sided tape does not work (only one side sticky).  Will have to buy replacement tape.  What a hassle.
B0012E4FV8|5|Considering that airplanes do not offer safety belts for children, this is a great alternative. Easy to store in a pouch and easy to wrap around an airplane seat.
B001OC5UNA|4|It took me about 10 minutes to install in a doorway. Recommend you use the cups for the top pressure fittings as it is far more stable and secure than without them. Fast service from Amazon. Very pleased with purchase. Highly recommend.
B00EHKCH78|5|This is a awesome diaper bag. It was priced perfectly. We love this.
B0013JVSO4|2|These are listed as liners or inserts. They really are more like doublers. These can really only effectively be used when using a quality diaper liner.    If you plan on using just these alone, they will not work. I've tried using two and even three of these super thin liners in my cloth diapers and they have leaked almost each and every time.    These liners are not very thick nor are they absorbent. They bunch up easily which is probably half the problem. And they are not very soft like the other liners I've used.    They seem to 'pill' up after just a few washings and take a considerable amount of time to dry (whether it be in the dryer or on the line). It's comparable to time it takes my thick inserts to dry, which really makes no sense to me.    These liners clean up well although some have a few poo stains these days. I can't say that they stain any more or any less than any other liner we've used. So that's one good thing.    I would skip these. I just wish I'd known how worthless these were before buying two packs of them (you have to wash and dry them before using or they will not be very absorbent).
B000GK7AMU|5|My daughter LOVES to take her bath with these toys!! So cute and colorful
B00EY7PN98|5|Excellent!
B00CWN3JQ0|5|Thrilled with purchase. This swing is a nice small size for putting next to my bed cuz 1mo old baby has stuffy nose & needs to sleep in it. It is nice & deep with high sides so I feel he will not fall out. It has the perfect buckle for me...nice small strap by his crotch so it does not force his legs apart like a hard plastic would. You can put on the the shoulder straps or just the waist ones (I use all at night, but just waist during the day.) He likes to look at the vibrant colors. I like the handles to carry on each side. One side has D battery for vibration (we don't use it) Other side uses C batteries & has the different swinging speeds & music. My baby sits in it with no movement a lot an really seems to be comfortable in it. LOVE this purchase
B003YHUVBE|5|They were jus what I wanted & I got them in jus a few days.
B0034G4MCE|4|We purchased this bag to gate check our stroller in.  Since we have the second seat kit, it doesn't really fold on it's own and needs some sort of bag to contain everything.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that everything fit, a bit tight, but it fit.    Unfortunately after our first use there was already a small tear in the fabric but I blame that more on the airline than poor construction of the bag.  The bag is very heavy with everything in it, especially with both seats.  It sure would be nice if they added some small wheels to the end!
B001TV027U|1|product was declared shipped and never received item...company guaranteed APO shipment and now goes back on their word for a second try at shipping product...will not EVER work with
B00F5QTESS|1|I bought this devise to track my baby on my iPad, as advertised, but try as I may, including over an hour on the phone (after a lot of waiting) with their customer care, there was. no way to get it or the second monitor I bought to connect.<br /><br />I just had to return both.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
B006JV4HFS|5|I had an older version of a Chicco table chair before buying this item.  While we liked the idea of a table chair for our baby, the older seat had very long arms that would not fit under every table and was cumbersome to install.  This one is much easier to use since it only requires a few inches under the table to clamp down.  The fabric is thick and cushioned and it can be removed for cleaning.  I love that feature!  The pocket in the back is generous and the attached bag keeps everything clean so that we can just keep the seat stored in the back of the minivan with the stroller. To top it all off, this seat is much more affordably priced than other brands.  I could not be happier with this choice.
B000LL1624|4|My daughter has enjoyed playing in her PeaPod-we have not yet tested it overnight.  It is well made, the zippers run smoothly I have no complaints.  The packaging was pretty badly damaged from shipping, so had this been a gift, I would not have felt comfortable with the condition of the packaging.  The product box should be packed inside a shipping box.    *******UPDATE******    We've now had the pea pod for 6+months and it has been a life saver!  We used it on vacation when our daughter learned to climb out of the playpen.  She slept in it nightly and it was a huge relief!  We were in so many different cities and houses visiting family, but no matter what, she had the same \\"bedroom\\" and even when upset was safe in her little tent.    Now we use this at grandma's instead of the crib, since now she tries to climb out of that too!  She goes right in her tent to sleep at nap time no arguments.    I have seriously considered buying another for home too!    This would be an awesome shower gift and will outlast a playpen by years!
B0017S0O8W|1|Although this product seems to work alright, it is not the product pictured and does not quite fit, but it is close. Also I only received one despite their \\"convenient two pack\\" description.... I am only keeping this because I can not find the filters anywhere else.
B00F3JZY1S|5|Net is just as described.  Easy to install.
B002UD65OU|5|This is a basic crib sheet. It is just as the picture shows. It fits the crib mattress we have just fine.  No complaints.
B001QCIG16|2|quit working shortly after purchase. water on the batteries?? I don't know
B00005BXEY|5|I love my Madella pump in style, but I dislike that it doesn't support our Avent bottles.  I'm so glad Avent made a solution and doesn't force their pumps on their bottle users.  Sturdy plastic conversion screws right on.  Don't forget the sealing ring from the bottle, but if you do, just be careful not to tip the bottle as it will spill.  So glad I purchased these.
B004WA8VD2|5|Background is White not off white as the picture shows.
B006J9TW5A|5|My friend love it!
B007FRJQ5G|4|This is a very nice crib/toddler mattress.  The infant side is very firm, which is recommended for safety reasons. Other crib mattresses my babies have used always bowed where the baby slept, I had my youngest son lay down on the mattress and it did not. I think it's genius to make a mattress that will extend the use. When my baby gets big enough I will be able to just flip it over for a much softer feel. I recommend a mattress protector since the material seems like it would easily absorb fluids..
B00067TAA8|4|I love the shade, it's exactly what I was looking for..however the shade in the picture isn't what I received. I ended up getting a yellow shade with multiple characters from Winnie the Pooh on it..which is fine, I love it but still..
B0013FVL5O|2|I was disappointed after receiving my purchase. There is not enough overhang of fabric at the top. Any kind of weight placed in the basket completely pulls the material off. The picture shown of the overhang is no where near what I received. I can only image what this is going to be like once washed and dried.
B00C051XU4|3|Once assembled this is a very nice walker/rocker/push stroller. Assembly is the problem. Instructions are vague (probably due to poor translation from Chinese). Illustrations included in the instructions are virtually useless.<br /><br />The worst problem we ran into was with the rear wheels. The front wheels are swivel and the mounting point for the round posts were located easily.<br /><br />The rear wheels are directionaly fixed and attach with a hollow rectangular plastic block that is approx. 1&#34; X 1.5&#34; X 1.5&#34;. The first problem was finding the proper mounting pocket for the rear wheels on the underside of the rear of the frame. Again, vague instructions and useless illustration (lack of detail.)<br /><br />We finally, through the process of elimination, located the pockets that worked for the wheels.  One set went in and the friction only (no snap-in like the front wheel posts) attachment held. However, the second set of wheels/pockets did not hold. They fell out  as the unit was turned over much less not staying in when the unit was rolled. (Yes, I did try switching the wheel units between the pockets. Neither held in the right side pocket.)<br /><br />Being rather handy and having tools; I solved the problem by attaching the mounting blocks to the frame by drilling holes and putting in 3 screws. To be safe, I screwed the blocks in on both side. I am guessing they could also be epoxied in. However, that is not the point. The point is that the rear wheel situation was poorly engineered and/or suffers from abdominal quality control. Not a good situation for a product to be used for infants/toddlers.
B00SVYBITY|5|Perfect!
B005NPFRPU|5|I got this stroller three years ago. It has great room in the bottom. Super convenient for nap time and it is compatible with Graco car seat. I really like this stroller. Good quality. I'm expecting my second baby and I'm planning on using the same stroller, it is in perfect conditions after 3 years.
B003M56PA4|5|My 14 month old daughter has the zebra blankie, zebra napping blanket [[ASIN:B004U97KVY Angel Dear Napping Blanket, Pink Zebra]] (birthday present), and pink giraffe [[[ASIN:B0023UOKLA Angel Dear Blankies - Collection]]. I can say that this was on of the best purchases I ever made. I introduced the pink giraffe blankie to my daughter when she was about 5 months old and started to resist going to bed. At that age, she loved having the softness of the blankie against the side of her face and it would help drift off to sleep. I can say that this blankie is of thin enough material that I was not too concerned of her suffocating if it ended up over her face, although at that age she was very mobile in the crib and did not stay in one place too long while sleeping. Besides the softness of the blanket, my daughter has always loved the three corners that are sewn into little bunches. This is very important. Other blankies don't have this. She loves, loves, loves chewing on just those three corners and likes rubbing the corners in her closed eyes when she is sleepy (a tell-tale sign she is ready for bed). The material is such that it drapes very well, which is important for when I drape one over her for a little extra warmth while she is sleeping. I have given her two other blankies of differing brands (one before I bought the first angel dear blankie and another one as a backup when I was washing the angel dear blanket). She did not like either one - they were not as soft, were stiffer material, and did not have the sewn corners that she loves. We got her the napping blanket for her first birthday because she loved the blankies so much, and now she loves to sleep on top of the blanket while hugging both blankies. There is no doubt in my mind that the blankies have helped comfort her in the middle of the night when I am not there as she asks for her blankies now when she is getting tired, then lies on the floor saying \\"night, night\\".
B001EH4W6G|4|These little gadgets make cloth diapering with prefolds or flats so much easier. Changing a diaper using one of these is just as quick as changing a disposable once you get the hang of it. I use BabyKicks hemp pre-folds and these grip the material very well. Just a few things I'll point out, first emphasizing these are minor issues and I do recommend these to mamas who can't afford fancy pocket diapers but still want ease of use.  1. They are sharper than you would expect. They always seemed so soft and benign, until one day I caught the teeth on my finger during a diaper change- Ouch! It bled. However, this is much less likely to happen than with pins.  2. I do not recommend these for toddlers. My daughter is exceptionally bright for her age, and could unfasten a disposable or velcro pocket diaper by 4 months old. At 7 months old, she can easily unfasten a Snappi, as well as the velcro diaper covers, so we just have a rule in the house that she must ALWAYS have shorts or bloomers over her diaper. I don't believe this is at all a flaw in the product, I just have a very mischievous, bright little girl. But once your child gets to that diaper-removing stage, whenever that may be, these don't stand a chance against those wandering fingers.   Other than that, we love our Snappis. They are easy to wash, easy to use and take the hard work out of cloth diapering.
B000HZD1QI|5|My son loves soft fluffy material, and when I breastfeed him on this he falls asleep quite quickly. I've washed it several times and haven't had a problem with shrinkage at all or pilling. Still soft after a couple washes. I also like the velcro so you can adjust as needed.
B007OQP6A2|4|Started using carseat when my daughter was around 6 months 20lbs. She does great in it. Not as fussy as when she is in a carrier carseat style. Design is typical. Not impressed but girly enough. Directions are simple easy up follow. Have only used as a rear facing carseat thus far.
B005IV0CRM|4|These are infinitely easier and safer than baby nail clippers, but are very sharp and must be used carefully.  On a calm or sleeping baby, they make fast work of cutting baby claws and with the curved blade, you hardly have to file afterward.
B0010J9768|5|Absolutely LOVE the Cloud B Constellation Lights.  The ladybug one is perfect for girls and the turtle one for boys.  It's also educational teaching little ones about constellations.  They stare at the lights until their eyes can't stay open anymore and then they fall fast asleep.  Very soft lighting for anyone who has a fear of the dark.  It looks cute too and compliments a child's bedroom.  My grown son even joked and asked me to buy one for his room!
B004FN11KQ|4|We bought this to go onto the bib stroller, it fits well easy to put on.  It does make the stopper harder to steer when the carrier is on but we expected that.
B005LXO9TE|5|I had a difficult time finding batteries for my Graco baby monitors, these fit worked perfectly. I did have to charge them for longer than recomended, so charge them a little longer before you get discouraged :)
B0012E4FV8|5|This was the best investment I have ever made regarding travel!
B001GQ2P96|5|This was a great deal on this Pack 'n Play. Was not too difficult to set up, is a good size, appears to be good quality. Will not be using it as my only bassinet as it is too large to move from room to room easily. I expect to get A LOT of use out of this when my daughter is born in 2 weeks!
B00HURF2KE|5|I love this bath tub and I can't even call this a bath tub because it's more like a bath tub with a portable shower. My nephew loves this system and it's very convient to bathe your baby and get them completely clean. I can't get over how well this works and makes cleaning your baby fun for everyone.<br /><br />The Summer Bath and Shower Center is perfect for everyone because you can get the task of bathing your child done perfectly while having some nice enjoyable playtime as well. This Shower System is more than perfect it's awesome and we love it.
B003IP8RRM|5|perfect for protecting our our bearded dragon from our 18month old.. kinda bulky though, not sleek or fashionable in any way
B00LSOXBOE|5|I have a special needs child who prefers this specific pacifier.  In our experience,  these are durable and last longer than competitive brands.
B00B5OBV4E|1|I thought maybe the other review was a mistake, but he was correct.  It costs less to buy another set of brushes rather than the replacement sponge.  The picture and description is deceptive because you think you're getting 2 set, which would be an ok deal, but you only get 1 set for more money than buying the brush set.
B000CNOIQ2|1|Nice idea, but doesn't keep the wipes warm enough. By the time I wrangle them from the warmer and get them unfolded, they're back to room temperature before I can use them on baby! Not recommended.
B009YSYDMK|5|Great trainer cup! This one works best for my 7 month old.
B00284AHRM|4|My son loves this toy.  It's a bit awkward in size, not easy for him to hold onto yet.  Overall though, he plays with it daily and really likes to look at himself in the mirror.  The colors are not the same as in the picture, they are less vibrant.
B00B7M7BKW|5|These are the way to go if you are serious about caring for your vehicle! The kick covers are also a best buy.
B0010P5Q7Q|5|Traing time is here....so you put this on the toilet seat..place grandson on it...he makes one and two...neatly..so well made..easy to clean...and the front guard keeps my floor dru
B003JHYDIQ|5|We are big believers in Swaddling.  We have swaddled our baby every day since the hospital (he's now 1 month old).  These are by far the most perfect and easy thing to use for swaddling.  The Velcro is genius!  I highly recommend to every new mom I meet!!!
B008ZGSF9Y|5|Live these blanket, they are soft and thick just perfect for the Canadian winter and soft natural color. I really love them!
B0032YV1T0|4|I purchased california baby calming shampoo and body wash for my son last night because it was sulfate free. He's 3 months. I tried it tonight and he loved it. He loves baths but hates his hair washed. He loved it tonight. He hasn't had a reaction so far. The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because I don't like how strong the scent is even after you wash it all out.
B00A67C4I8|5|My grandkids love their new booster car seats. They seem sturdy and well built and are easy to put together. The seat belt just goes under the two arm rests and into the seat belt buckle. My favorite feature is the two cup holders. The kids love to keep their drinks and snacks and toys in them. Would definitely purchase again.
B005EHNL3M|1|A very important thing to note is that this rail will only fit if your mattress is on a box spring foundation. It will not properly fit nor will the swing down function work on a mattress that is on a platform or slatted type of bed furniture.
B000ML74WO|5|I can't say enough good things about the gr8x brand swaddling blankets.  First and foremost, they're stretchy so you can make the swaddle as loose or as tight as you need to.  And because of the stretch, it allows for some movement so as not to be too restrictive for your little one.  They wash and dry up well.  And the colors stay nice and bright.  When your little one outgrows swaddling, we discovered that they make great light blankets for the crib, stroller, naps at home, car, traveling, etc.  The blanket stores well in the diaper bag (not bulky).  Even though it isn't flannel or fleece like many on the market, we found that it kept our little one warm when swaddled with a warm footed sleeper in the middle of winter.  I recommend getting two so you always have a clean one on hand.  I have been buying for all of my friends' baby showers.
B00H2ZR4GO|5|Cute, adorable and inexpensive. What else could a baby and her parents ask for. :)<br /><br />All I can add is that my baby is addicted to it and wouldn't go to sleep without it. I had to get another one, just in case!
B000K53UEI|5|It's a drying rack.  It stores your items, upside-down, so they can air dry.  It does what it's supposed to do!  There's not much else to say about it.
B00NAXHQ60|3|I love them but my son hates them. Sad...
B001OC5UNA|5|I absolutely love this gate, it is so tall and built well.  I have bought other gates that were so overpriced,  definitely worth the price!!!
B0002U1SFE|5|This is a great activity center for babies 3 months and older.  We got it as a gift for my baby shower and put it together last month.  Evan loves to sit in it and grabs at the toys.  He can't quite reach the bottom yet, but that doesn't stop his enjoyment.  We had no problems putting it together, and have had no problem with the top coming off the legs.  As for the 3 stack toy, I will watch closely to see if there is any fraying at the sewn edges.  I recommend this toy to keep baby occupied and happy.
B003XMWF28|5|I bought this set for my 1 yr old Niece for Valentine's Day. I read some other reviews and thought for the $12 price it couldn't be a total waste. I am so happy that I got these, I got the call from my sister this morning that my niece absolutely LOVED them! She wouldn't put down the fork/spoon and when she finally put it down she stared at Elmo, waved to him, and said \\"hi\\"! So cute! I was told the bowl and plate are really nice and seem to be of very good quality. Super deal!
B0088N4CUA|5|It`s really cute but a bit big for my kid. I really like this character of course need to wait a little more to use my kids though.
B002ACCC52|5|Great changing table, its beautiful and I love that there are shelves for storage.  I wish it were a bit taller, but I'm thinking they're all probably about that height.
B0052G4LUM|5|this is my daughter all the way..<br />we are redoing the painting in all the bedrooms.. this will definatly<br />look amazing !! thanks.
B008K4U5C6|5|Very nice heavy and soft love it
B003OA1YR6|1|The package is cute, but very small and really overpriced. I am returning it as I am embarrassed to give it as a gift.
B0038JDUYI|5|These are by far my FAVORITE baby spoons!  The silicone coating helps scrape the bowl like a spatula, and it soft on baby's teeth and gums.  Although the shape looks a little odd, it works really well at scooping up food and holding it on the spoon until it reaches baby's mouth (without dropping food everywhere).  This is the ONLY spoon I use for feeding baby, and it's well worth the money!
B004C43JJ4|5|Great price my daughter loves it feels like a big girl. It was exactly what i ordered. Thanks so much
B002WN2ASI|5|My son is just under a month old, and loves this toy. The black and white toys are really the only things that get his attention at this point. I imagine he'll probably enjoy the other side once he is a little older, but for now the black and white side really keeps his attention.
B00005BSM0|5|My daughter loves this tub. The cushion is much more comfortable than those plastic tubs. This is easy to use if you read the directions. Use the incline at the opposite end of the plug so when you need to drain you won't have to move baby. The plug is a little hard to get in but just use a little of the liquid soap around the plug and it will go in much easier. I hang it in my stall shower to dry and it dries fine. I also wash it in the washing machine after a few uses then dry in the dryer. We both love this tub!!
B00KD5O26K|5|Love this carrier! Compared to the ergo, there isn't much difference and it is so much more affordable! I trust the strength of the carrier and has held my newborn and 17 month old in it without any issues. Easy to adjust.
B000U9UZ1U|1|I  bought this stroller after a lot of research, but there were some things I couldn't have predicted.<br /><br />Good things:  It's good for tall people (my husband is 6'4\\" tall, and can easily push it) and the steering is nice.  It's also pretty light, but let's face it, once a kid is in there, it's going to be heavy anyways.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1.  Don't buy this stroller unless you have lots of experience fixing flat tires.  My tires went flat over and over, multiple flats in each wheel, each one requiring my husband to take apart the tire, remove the innertube, hold it underwater to find the hole, and patch it with a kit.  Obviously, this didn't work on the road.<br /><br />2.  Don't even think about putting this in the trunk of your car unless it's the only thing in there.  We don't own a car, and when we travel, we rent.  Often, this stroller didn't come along, because it is HUGE, even when folded.  Oh, it's huge at home as well, and we have to keep in in the spare bedroom (away from the children) because it tips easily when folded.<br /><br />3.  Don't even think about bringing this beast along if you take public transport.  We brought it to Paris.  Only once we were there did we realize that all the locals have MacLarens and other lightweight strollers for a reason-it is so wide that it doesn't fit through the Metro gates.  It also TIPPED OVER on the bus once with the bassinet attachment (thankfully no baby was in it) when the bus went around a tight turn.  Not very safe.<br /><br />4.  The zipper sides for adjusting the angle of the seat is okay, if you've got two free hands and a second person to make sure your child's head doesn't smack the back of the diaper bag or whatever else on the way down.  Also, there's not a firm back panel behind the head, so my daughter, at 25 pounds (way below the weight limit) and 37 inches was far too tall-she couldn't rest her head because it would bob backwards.<br /><br />5.  Don't buy it if you like good customer service, or actually any customer service at all.  I tried twice to contact them about the tires and an accessory, the easyboard (for older kids to stand on)  they never even acknowledged receiving my email, let alone having any suggestions.<br /><br />Basically, for this amount of money, you can get a much better stroller.
B00AHVR6T0|5|I read all of the reviews, as I usually do, before purchasing this high hair. At that time the reviews were highly positive- all 4s & 5s. Add me to the list of 5s- an outstanding piece of baby gear with 2 reclining positions; wide table; washable seat covers; moves easily despite the lack of wheels.
B004GBSHLI|1|If I could give this zero stars I would! Application was simple, but they didn't stick to the wall well. They just kept felling away from the wall. If I didn't check on them they would have ended up on the floor. Though I threw parts of the decal out, I did cut it into pieces and made a few custom binders for school. The decals stick great to plastic...just don't try to hang them on the wall.
B00012FGA6|5|Works great for daughter very happy with it!
B00AEFVV3G|5|Love the bedding. However it smelled really bad when it arrived. I was able to wash it and now it smells fine
B009SFJ7SE|5|a must have to keep kids and adults from coughing all over your baby!  highly recommended!!!  we tried other brands and bought 2 of these because they were just that much better!
B00MH2ZRLQ|5|we love it...
B005PWVIZE|3|this is just OK does not look as nice as in picture. string length is very short.<br />I would suggest to buy something else for that price
B00FFKXW5A|5|Love, love, love this diaper bag! So adorable and the perfect size, lots of room. Great quality!
B007NG5UEU|3|We keep the baby unit in the barn and the parent units in the house. It worked great for about six months, much better than other brands, but it started losing connectivity in one of the units, we thought it was that unit, but when we lost power in the barn yesterday neither parent unit will connect now so it must be the baby unit that it losing it's transmitting strength. So, if you don't plan to use it for a long time or don't have to keep the units very far apart it is fine. Additionally both parent units screen displays don't display everything anymore so it is hard to read.
B0006HBS1M|5|I already have Medela Pump-In-Style Advanced, so I've purchased this item for travelling. Easy to assamble, easy to use, light weight, takes little space. Plus I got 2 extra bottles. The feeling while pumping is a little different than with pump-in-style though, but i'm still very pleased with the purchase
B003I5X2YU|1|I bought these because I couldn't stand how bulky the Lansinoh pads were and despite the negative reviews, wanted to give these a try. I don't leak a lot and have smaller breasts so I thought they'd be fine. Well, after using them for only 2 days I am compelled to write my first negative review on Amazon. These pads, in addition to being even lumpier than Lansinoh because they're flat vs. contoured, barely made it through one feeding before becoming saturated. Breastmilk leaked all over me, ugh. Kept trying them and they're just totally useless. Now I'm stuck with a ton of these things because of the 2-pack...maybe I can use them as coasters...
B000H1MRJO|5|For the price this is great for nap times...similar to ones @ day care just not as $$.
B000056OWC|1|We bought this seat because of its advertised versatility, but after just a few uses with our new born we had to go purchase a new one. It takes both hands to keep an infant postioned in the seat, which doesn't leave a free hand to wash with. It may work fine as seat when she gets older but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as tub for a newborn.
B000JVZWS0|3|This too is same as earlier brushes, I have purchased. Within few weeks sponge just falls apart and breaks in to two pieces from middle. I guess they want us to replace brush every month.
B00WFH08EE|5|Great product--even came with extra suction cups just in case! My 18 month old pulls on it and it stays put; I love the organization!
B00EHKCH78|5|Lots of great space and pockets. Great construction. Really like having a diaper backpack instead of a bag. So much easier to carry around when my arms are full. . . which is most of the time.  :)
B009K8NFG4|5|This soft seat is great for boys. The opening is longer than any of the others I tried with my son. I have a 23 months old who looks like a 4 year old and it works for him.
B00846PCXM|5|This thing works great.  You will be amazed at what you get out of your child's nose.  No mechanical parts to break.
B004XYT1HC|4|I love this purse. I even have the cell phone case that matches the purse. The only reason why didn't give it five stars was the zippers sticks a tiny bit
B000COY136|5|When my daughter was an infant in the drooling phase, we had 25 of these bibs in constant rotation. They're the most effective and softest waterproof bibs I found. The fabric is absorbent and her clothes stayed dry. The instructions say to hang dry after washing, so that was inconvenient; some of the bibs did find their way into the dryer at times, and while the texture of the waterproof layer seemed to change, I didn't notice any impact on the performance. I've bought multiple packs of these for baby shower gifts.
B00M1Y5FCQ|3|Everything is awsome about this car seat exept that once you install it facefoward you can not adjust the carseat in anyway if you want to adjust it so your toddler is in a laydown position or upright  you must remove all the straps and reinstall what a drag!! but is very save and feels very secure and thats why im giving 3 stars
B004JU0H6O|5|I love the density of this foam mattress for my son's play yard.  For the price, I have not found a better quality play yard mattress, and I even bought another one for use at Grandma and Grandpa's!
B00HT6E6GW|5|A genie in every room- in case...all Mommys and Daddies so appreciate this this! There is no product to compare! Simply fantastic!
B005JKI2QK|2|This works as described and is a well built functioning product but is longer than most and it is too long.
B00A0ID90A|5|Excellent
B00R6M3BEW|5|These are so much better than those awful bed rails.  They are firm to keep my son from rolling over them off the bed, and soft enough that he uses that to cuddle up against.  Plus there is no odor to these!  I would order these again in a hearbeat!
B002WGI5UM|4|I love that this is stainless steel. It keeps its contents cold or warm for a while. I don't like that it is heavy. I still can't get my baby to hold it up to drink on her own at 8 months. Wish I had purchased the smaller size.
B00007DWBH|5|excelent!!
B002W5RT9Q|5|This is the safest gate we have owned. We have used several brands/types in the past with mixed reviews. Our previous top of stairs gate was not sturdy and my daughter broke the latch and fell down the stairs at 2 yrs. This is the safest gate i have found and I have searched all the options thoroughly! The only issue is with the attachment of this gate if you have moldings. This was easily fixed using an extra piece of wood against the wall. Bottom line: There isn't a better or safer gate out there for top of stairs use. I just bought my second one to use on the deck stairs outside since the gate is easily removable to store inside on rainy days.
B005XTKHF6|5|Great easy to open
B0009EXN10|1|This product is terrible. I had the previous model, which I could put together without leaks even when deeply sleep deprived. This one is very difficult to assemble without leaking.
B002QYW8LW|5|My baby loves it and that makes me love it too :) Unlike other teething products that we’ve tried (and we’ve tried quite a few until we gave up on teethers altogether), she seems to really enjoy “chewing” on this brush and it doesn’t make her cry (we had some teethers that were a bit tough on my angel’s tender gums).  Would definitely recommend purchasing this product.  FYI: my precious angel is 6 months old.
B0048SOBGO|5|Ordered these labels after I got tired of labeling bottles with a Sharpie.  The labels were easy to write on, and easy to &#34;self-laminate.&#34; I even managed to write small enough that I could cut each label in half and use both halves. When I put them on the bottles, I worried a little because they didn't lay flat on the bottles (Philips Avent).  However, two months later and they're sticking strong. No additional bubbling or peeling whatsoever.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B00CP86TVY|4|Excellent reception from everywhere we've tested it so far: across the house, in the back yard, even across the street!<br />...and while the image is pretty grainy it's clear enough to show us what's going on. I honestly didn't expect better from a 2.4ghz device. Sound is great in both directions.<br /><br />Update after using for 11 months: the picture and sound are still of high quality, BUT our monitor component that stays with us has not held up. The antenna piece is plastic and can be pointed up... It has popped out of its joint and is loose. The stand that props it up and allows it to stand has broken TWICE!  The first time, the company sent a new one for free, but it broke.  :(
B00NLJAU5C|5|I will admit I was skeptical buying a travel system from amazon. However I was extremely surprised at the quality of the product. Before I purchased it I did some research and other reviews talked about how cheap it was. Maybe they got a bad product because this doesn't seem to be a cheap old travel system. The material in the car seat can cleaned with just a warm damp towel and air dried. So convenient for a mother whose child spits up a lot no need to take the cover off and just wipe and go. It's also a lot more padded than most car seats which makes it comfortable for my little one. The print looks way better in person its so beautiful and different than most designs out here. The stroller was easy to put together ( seeing I did it myself 9 months pregnant) and its lightweight. Though its a full functioning stroller it doesn't weigh a ton and its easy to open close with one hand once you get use to operating the handle. I just used the stroller yesterday while at the mall. Man it was so was to maneuver through the stores. I'm glad I purchased this product not to mention I got it for $99.99.
B00GJVLNO6|3|I love that this stroller blanket has ties at the side so the blanket doesn’t slip down or fall out and get lost. However, I think about a blanket as something that I would like to snuggle up in, and that will feel warm. The fabric on this is sort of a rough cotton, and while it has some padding in there, it does not feel comfortable or snugly in any way.<br /><br />While I like the design, which feels sleek and modern, it also faded after its first wash. I was disappointed in the quality of this, because I’ve liked other items from this brand that I’ve tried, such as a crib skirt and a diaper change pad cover. However, I would not recommend this blanket in cooler climates where you actually need something to keep the baby warm, because all it does is keep the wind off of the baby; I don’t think it really keeps much heat in or feels comforting in any way.
B000B7QM4U|5|I got this as a gift on my baby shower & was so happy to receive it! This playpen is so wonderful, very colorful & sooo easy to  set it up. I'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it. I received great reviews on this gear also so don't be dissapointed to grab one like it!!! awesome playpen!!!
B009V9BHNA|5|Although I can't afford to set up home cameras yet, this is something I was hoping would be developed. It is an affordable way of keeping a watch on the baby, as well as making sure no one is in your baby room (do I watch too many horrible stories on the news?). The intercom is also a fantastic addition. Although my children are grown, I now have grandchildren and feel it's important to do everything possible to keep them safe. Once the child is grown, I see no reason to not have this set up in a front room/porch, etc. Fantastic and thoughtful product that will give any parent or grandparent that extra feeling of security.
B00DUKR8D4|5|Darling! Just right to dress up some pigtails, and they fasten in the hair easily.  I love them!
B00674S1Y0|5|Excellent product.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Except my two year old grandson won't sit on it because he's afraid he'll fall in.
B000VZKGYY|5|We just bought the ladybug for our 16 month old daughter for Christmas, and we couldn't be happier. We were able to catch it on sale for under $20 as well, which is even better. I love how the shell glows, it's really cute to look at, and my daughter LOVES the moon and the stars projected all over her ceiling and walls in her room at night. I realize it is recommended for 3 years and up, but we don't put this in her crib with her, and we don't let her play with it as a toy. I set it in the middle of her room on her floor after putting her to bed so she can look at the stars around her room while she falls asleep. I pick it up and put it away after she falls asleep. When we opened it and tried it out Christmas morning, my folks kept commenting on how they want one for their room at night, too! My mom kept saying it would be better if the stars rotated somehow, but we are happy with them being stationary. This is a perfect nightlight for kids of all ages (just don't let the younger ones play with it). We are expecting a son in May and we plan on getting him the turtle for his room as well. This will be our go-to kids gift for birthdays and Christmases from now on! I can't imagine any child who wouldn't want to have stars all over their room at night. Not to mention it isn't age-specific, so kids will be able to use it for many years. It's a really great gift!
B0090HH4SA|5|Awesome product! I use it every week for a piece of mind
B005IWM742|3|My 2month old sleeps in this on and off but never for too long. He does however sit in the rocker for a  long amount of time. He's comfortable in it. I wish it had a button you could press so that it could rock on its on though
B00SULXDKU|1|It was very difficult to hang with the transfer paper and it sticks like glue and is not easily removable or adjustable.  The transfer paper was very sticky and after all was done I hung it upside down.  I will never buy anything again with transfer paper.  Now I have the United Kingdom hanging upside down.  It costs a lot of money to be a throw out.
B002L3T9ZG|5|My 5 month old loves these simple rattles! They are very light weight so he can hold and shake them. The rattle itself is loud so he pays complete attention. There's also a little mirror inside that he really likes :)
B0048BP5RU|5|Bought this as a gift. My friend said it has been a blessing, it doesn't sink in and she isn't hunched over while feeding.
B007SQATYG|5|It came well packed and exactly as advertised. I did notice the security blanket to be a bit small, however. Otherwise, I really like this set. The colors are true to picture, so I was able to decorate my nursery with the blues and greens before the product even came.
B002HRFO3M|5|I have an almost 4 year old and love this mirror.  I am pregant with number 2 and my husband now needs a mirror as well.  We have tried ton's of others and they are all like fun house mirrors, distorting images and making it hard to see your child.  This mirror is far superior to any other out there!
B00F6TZ8QG|5|Kids love it and I love that it's natural!
B005WF7HVI|4|The diaper is great for all sizes of babies, never had any leaks in the few months I've used it, but I'm not in love with the snap inserts.  They aren't very soft and all over felt rather cheap and rough on my babies skin.  I also don't feel as though it wicked away enough moisture from my babies skin.  But for an inexpensive cloth diaper, it isn't a bad investment, just not in my top 3 for favorites!
B0076LAGQ4|5|I received one of each, a blue puzzle piece, a red elephant, and a green penguin. I love it :D :D :D
B0000E262S|2|First of all, the movement pad WOULD NOT be accurate. First it wouldn't beep, even if nothing was on it. Then I messed with the sensitivity and then it beeped for my son sleeping 3 times during one nap, and he was totally fine. So I just turned the stupid movement sensor off, which of course is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MONITOR.<br /><br />Also, the sound portion (just using it as a normal monitor) is REALLY static-y. For no reason at all. A few times I had to turn it down SO much so I could sleep through the static that I couldn't hear my baby.<br /><br />Buy a different monitor. Seriously.
B001DWG32S|5|I really like this receiving blanket. The only thing that boggled me was how much it shrunk after the second wash. I can still use it, but not for the purpose of snuggling my newborn (he's quite long). Other than that, good product.
B00B7RWWFG|5|it is beautiful, good quality and safe for baby
B001FSZH4A|5|This is too cute & is a must have with the bedding set. I have mine in the glider rocker for decoration.
B00005NBE5|5|I absolutely love this product and it was well worth every dollar spent on it (although I did purchase the version without the sound because I already had a sound monitor).  At first I felt silly telling people that I use it, but after many nights of good sleep (in between feedings ofcourse) I was proud.<br />The sensor is absoluely wonderful and very accurate.  I had a few false alarms, but using a masonite board with the product helped dramatically.  My daughter slept in a full size bassinet that snaps into her pack in play but decided after a few weeks of life that she didnt like it.  I faught with her for weeks to try and get her to sleep in this bed with no success.  Her pediatrician said that it would be okay for her to sleep in her infant car seat if that is where she felt most comfortable.  I struggled with this decision because I was not ready to give up the security of this monitor.  Finally, someone said \\"Why dont you just put the car seat in the bassinet?\\" So I tried it, and it worked.  AMAZING!!!!!!! Now my daughter is safe (because the pack n play is very sturdy), I get sleep due to the monitor, and she is comfortable as well.<br />I do still find myself waking in the middle of the night to check on her.  But instead of getting out of bed to see if she is breathing, I simply look for the flashing green light and Im back to sleep.  A truly wonderful product.
B003OH0W90|5|I just received the adapter last night and had the car seat securely attached to stroller within a couple minutes.    The only assembly required is looping the straps around the metal base.  Literally takes 20 seconds.      The adapter snaps right into the slots that the seat attaches to.  Completely fool proof.  Just make sure both sides snap in, this will let you know the base is secure.    I have a Chicco Keyfit 30.  All you have to do is place the carseat in and press down each side.  Make sure the grey \\"hooks\\" snap into the adapter.  If you don't snap in both sides, the seat will not be secured.  I didn't push down to snap in each side, so at first it seems unsecure, once everything is snapped in, the car seat barely moves.  The straps from the adapter connect above the car seat to give it extra security.    To remove the car seat press down on the handle that removes the car seat from the car seat base.  This handle releases those grey \\"hooks\\", which snap into the base and adapter.  It helps to push down a little bit on the car seat to release it from the adapter.    After testing it out last night, I am completely happy with the purchase.  Everything works as advertised.
B00KX7Q4G4|1|I've never written a review on Amazon yet but I feel I need to for this terrible product. I made the mistake of buying 2 of these gates with extensions. The gates alone probably work very well but the extensions make them flimsy and they bend back and forth with the plastic male-to-male adapter that is needed to join the gate to the extensions.<br /><br />My photo highlights the bend in red. Because of the bend the latch doesn't seat properly all the time either.<br /><br />The 2nd one had a broken screw head in the handle/latch causing it to come apart. See additional pictures. On the one picture, you can see the bottom piece sliding down because of the screw being broken. I wasn't even able to use pliers to unscrew the broken screw to try and replace it. I now have to call them to request a new piece.<br /><br />The cheap wrench that comes with the set to tighten the nuts is just terrible. It's small, making it hard to get any leverage on it to turn the final few turns needed and the nuts even started to strip the wrench which I never thought would be possible. I then tried my Craftsmen wrenches but God forbid they give you a nut that is standard or metric size. The only wrench that fits is the one they give you which is only a cheap thin piece of metal that weakens before you can even tighten the torque all the way.<br /><br />If I wasn't in a bind and need these gates right now, I would return and never buy again!<br /><br />Please save yourself the hassle and AVOID buying this product at all costs!
B00NLJAU8E|5|Perfect for my boy, he loves purple! Not girly. Functionality exactly what I expected. Light weight and easy to move, the headrests are awesome!!! I know they're for protection, but this is the first time in a long time that he's slept in the car :)
B00F18FMZ4|4|This mattress is perfect for the price but it is definitely better for a toddler bed. It is was too soft for an infant. You will want something firm for a baby. When I had my third son I had to buy another mattress for his crib but after buying this decided to use my sons original firm baby mattress for his crib and this one for my two year old toddler bed. It is thin and bendable and more appropriate for a toddler bed.
B002GWW238|1|We bought these because of the unique venting feature, made in the USA, BPA free and convertible into sippy cup.  Within a month or so, we noticed small cracks developing on the outside of the bottom of the bottle.  We thought it might be from putting them in the bottle warmer (although we did not read anything about not putting them into the warmer) so we started putting water in them the night before so that the water was room temperature.  Recently, we sent them to the sitter's and found the whole diaper bag soaking - the small cracks turned into one large crack rendering it completely unusable.  All in all, disappointed with what we thought was a good product.
B0000E3BTH|2|We found that the range and clarity were excellent, but the parent unit experienced interference causing sleep depriving clicks. Also - the loud BEEP BEEP BEEP alarm that emits from the parent unit for no discernable reason between 2:30 and 3:30 am will have your heart racing, and you searching for another product. (Strangely this is the exact time that others have found the alarm sounds)
B00ECL5N0K|5|Super soft, washes well, and beautiful design. I would happily buy another cover from this company.
B00FOL7RWY|5|strong and  durable and a good place to separate and give time outs to two young and rambunctious pups. The price was right as well
B0072BHJ36|3|This worked well to protect our car seats, but it is a bit too fragile for sustained use. We *only* used it to gate check, and the handles still tore the bag a bit. We will get more trips with it, but probably not many. Considering the price and how light it is, that's fine.
B001ANVUUU|5|I highly recommend if you have a teething baby. I love that I always have it on and so it's always available to my baby. He loves chewing on it and since I'm wearing it it won't fall on the floor when he drops it like everything else. I get a lot of compliments on it to from people who don't realize its a teether.
B003YVHXAW|5|i really like this cover. using it on two outlets in my house- one for my computer cord and the other on my deep freezer- last thing i need is for my kid to unplug the freezer and all that food go bad. it goes on easy and my one year old leaves it alone after he figured out he can't take it off.
B00328JYZY|5|The Orbit Baby Stroller seat and frame is definitely a conversational peice and will turn heads. My husband and I fight over who gets to push her first and we love offering her different views...and she is only 3 months but she is so alert that when she is able to see everything in the side position she smiles and is content for our long walks. a definite must have for moms and dads!
B00AM5NTIS|2|These are a great idea but the seal did not last long at all. Also hard to keep clean along the seal.
B001AVNK6E|1|Not worth the money.
B001OC5UMQ|5|I currently have one super energetic American Pitbull Terrier that loves to run around. Sadly with the winter temps, she can't play in our yard as she does in the summer. I bought this gate so I can set her up in our den. I had my doubts at first if this gate could actually stop my pitbull from just knocking it flat. So far she has tried and failed to each time. It's a wonderful gate for keeping the smaller house pets from running all around the house. Great construction and simple system for installation.
B00140BE3W|4|Bottels are good, work as expected, however you get sent any combination of colors. I ended up with 2 pink screw top parts.....and I have a boy!!!!! So I swapped out the screw on portion with some from evenflo bottles
B0010PW3A4|4|I have tried a number of different backpack/ carriers and I love this one! It keeps the child right against you so they stay closer to your center of balance.  Even with my [...], my back doesn't really ache.  I don't recommend it for tiny infants though, it is a little awkward.
B0027A5FUQ|4|This is a great little pacifier box. It fits well on a diaper bag shoulder strap, or my handbag. It snaps shut tightly so there is no fear of the pacifier falling out. Some people say it holds two pacifiers, but I guess it depends on the pacifier size. It would hold two tiny ones, but I have the playtex ones with the little handle, and fitting two inside this box is a real tight squeeze. One of them fit perfectly though. Overall, its a great pacifier carry box and does the job!
B00CYRXU4A|4|Love it overall<br /><br />Dislike:<br />I have four of these stacked in our freezer and they are not very sturdy. Almost always when I reach in for one of the jars, one of the layers fumbles and slides back and forth.
B008JFUJ7W|4|This is the only diaper bag I've owned. I think it's pretty nice, but probably over-priced. I like the magnetic closure feature on the front, with the optional closures. The changing pad of course is nice to have. There is lots of room on the inside for your various baby needs, and it's pretty chic looking overall. I am not disappointed.
B002MZZMUY|5|I love these sleep sacks !   They have laundered well, they are soft & fluffy, and they are so cute.  Babies seem to love them too.
B0011MQLM2|5|After reviewing tons of different high chairs, including high-end Peg Perego chairs, I was lucky to come across a review in Baby Bargains, which gave the zen collection high marks. I also read all the reviews on Amazon and decided this was the chair for me. I'm absolutely thrilled with my choice. I love the look of the chair. The colors are so nice and it's great to not have the typical plastic/primary colors choices that are so common in chairs. It functions so well! I think it is very easy to clean (so don't listen to the reviews that complain about this). The extra tray does come off easily but it's not really an issue. My baby fits so well in the chair. He's small and he was supported so well at the age of 9 months and continues to fit very comfortably in the seat at 16 months. The tray is so easy to take on and off and the chair is easy to move around and doesn't take up a ton of space. My mother has a Peg Perego high chair and it's much bigger, harder to move, has a tray that is very hard to work with and there's just a huge space between the closest tray setting and the baby. (it seems dangerous if he's not propped up with a pillow behind his back). I also love the price for a very well designed, aesthetically pleasing, highly functional product from Fisher Price. They have really done an amazing job with this collection. (We also have the Zen Collection swing and it was such a great product for our son when he was a newborn. We used it well into his 6 month.)
B0010SGZDC|4|I love this organizer. It keeps everything in it's place and has plenty of space. My only complaint is that when I refill the diaper area I usually end up knocking off the top of the organizer and it drives me nuts.
B002WB2G9I|5|Great stroller. Exactly what we were looking for around this price. Only bad thing it doesn't recline very far but everything else is good.
B00HZY7TY4|4|This product is exactly as described! I am very happy with the quality but just wish it was priced more like a lot of the other knock offs in the 10 dollar range.
B001H0GGMS|5|I bought these booster seats for my girls while we are at my parents.  They are comfy, easy to move and have great safety ratings.  I really like the cup holders - instead of rotating out, they are part of the seat and a stretchy band holds the cup in.  Great design.
B00DNBA82S|3|Update at the end (Buy this monitor if you only need it for a year, or you won't be using it very often because it doesn't hold up well) We've had the monitor for 5 months now. Installation was easy. I like the simple useful features. I like the big video screen that takes up the whole monitor. It doesn't beep loudly when the screen sleep comes off when my LO simply wiggles at night, so I am only woken up if there is a need to be. The camera works well and I like the zoom in feature. I have never had a connection problem. CONS:  Within 2 months the leg that props up the monitor broke off and so now it only lays flat. After about a month the camera began to make a crude grinding noise when its moved. I can hear it through the wall that it's attached to. After 5 months the charger connection has began to work sporadically. It has to be jiggled and adjusted just right so that it will charge. The monitor will die in the middle of the night because unbeknownst to me it hasn't been charging even though it was plugged in. I addressed the problem with amazon and they sent me the return labels to return the product, however they won't replace it. There was a reason, I don't recall what it was.  I searched around for another monitor that had the features I liked and I didn't find one that was as affordable as this one. And this one had gone up in price a bit, so I decided to keep my broke down monitor for now, and if anything else goes wrong I will try to send it back again. Bottom Line: All in all for the money this is a decent monitor and Amazon will back it if it fails you. I would recommend it. I would buy it again and roll the dice on the next one holding up a little better. --------UPDATE This monitor did in fact become unchangeable within a year of purchase. Since we already had the camera, which appeared to be functional, we bought another system and synced it to the camera. We now have a Monitor piece and two cameras. As with the first one, cheap plastic leg broke off of the monitor within a month, and the charger has now begun to charge intermittently. I will wake up in the middle of the night to find that the monitor has died. Since we recently had another child, and have transitioned our older child into a toddler bed, the camera is important, as we want to know if our toddler is getting up and ransacking the house in the middle of the night (why do they go to the pantry first?!) I will not buy this monitor again, as it will probably last a year again, meaning that we would have to buy 3 more. We will be buying a more expensive and have expectations of buying a better product.
B00342UFNS|5|It definitely addressed the look of elegance that I was seeking.  My daugher is now a month old and has loved it since day 1.
B004KV6UH2|3|My girls love these, but they do leak.  We only put water in them or else we'd have a sticky mess.
B0011UH78G|5|These are the perfect addition to use the Playtex Drop-In system with the Medela PISA.  I use this daily to pump milk for my son while I'm at work. Make sure you get 2 sets for the pump adaptors attachments.
B000BXHPEU|3|It does exactly what it's supposed to, but it's pretty flimsy
B00E9RMHD8|5|This is my 2nd monitor and I love it.  Build quality is good, performance is excellent.  I love that you can set temperature ranges which trigger alarms on the handset when those ranges are exceeded.  The talk function is clear and crisp with excellent range through multiple walls and doors in the house.<br /><br />I have 2 basic complaints that should not influence your decision:  1. There is no base station.  Yes the hand unit is flat on 2 sides and can lay down or stand up, but its easily tipped over by the charging cord as a dangles down to the floor.  My first monitor had a base station and it felt very secure.<br /><br />2. The hand unit is very smooth and thus very slick.  It would be great to have a rubberized texture.  It feels like it just wants to slide out of you hand, but I have yet to drop it.  Again, rubber would be great.
B00I90HZ2E|5|Very sweet!
B00CMCQQ9I|5|Love this unique converted couch. My Nieces and Nephews love this to play and sleep on.
B004PBJNLW|3|This is a cute container, but there are opening on the side that if you have anything wet - even fruit, it may leak. Also, one of the lids of the two that I ordered did not fit true to the bottom.
B004K4RYW4|5|The softest 'lovie' I've ever found. Have bought them for both my babies and they love them!
B0081ZOWC8|5|Loooove the soothie in yellow! My daughter is Obsessed with her binkies and I loved being able to add this to the collection instead with the typical green, pink and purple
B000KW786W|1|If you are looking for a soft material this one is not for you.  I know some reviewers state it feels softer after washing it but if I still didn't like it then I would not have been able to return it.
B000067BIZ|5|This is an essential baby must!!  I don't know what I would do without a Boppy pillow!  My newborn and I love it. I use it with every feeding and it's fun to prop my baby up so she can see me. It provides a great snug feeling during feedings and gives my arms a nice rest.  It's a must have!!
B003G2YUUA|2|The idea is great but one of the speakers are blown. You can barely hear the music. I was going to return it but we had family stuff going on & I didn't get a chance. I am sure my little boy would have loved it since he loves music but he can't hear it. This was a waste of 20.00.
B004FN11BK|5|beautiful in nursery
B00PTL3TSU|5|Excellent, perfect in size, great for trips or at home
B001V9KPBI|4|A friend gave me a set for my baby shower.  I began using it when my baby was 4 months old.  We use it for traveling and when we are out and about.  It does tend to leak when the nipple portion is put down witjout keeping the nipple right side up.
B001QC77W0|5|Got this for my new grandson (DOB 09/23/14) so we haven't had the opportunity to use it yet. The colors are perfect to match with my restored wooden highchair. Found this 1950's highchair but it didn't come with the tray; thought this would be the perfect way for him to use before he could sit in it without a tray. Fits perfectly on the chair - look forward to using it when he comes to visit.
B00HQKHKHI|5|Spray bottle has made my on the go cloth wipe experience 100% better. The actual baby bit wipe solution has been great on my son's bottom and diaper area.
B0052QYLUM|4|Excellent monitor with clear picture, however audio is a little soft. We had to put the monitor pretty close to the crib to hear the cries because the receiving monitor's speakers are pretty weak with the volume all the way up.
B003TSDMH8|5|This review is from my wife since I obviously cannot use this product. This really helps with breastfeeding a newborn.  It helps position baby comfortably and effectively. All of the popular or recommended feeding positions can be achieved with this.
B0013FGWD0|5|READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!!<br /><br />I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out by myself just being stubborn. I finally read the instructions and got it on in 3 minutes.<br /><br />Works like a charm. a couple minutes after I put baby in the crib he'd already turned himself and was kicking it but didnt get tangled and I can sleep a little easier knowing he can breathe through it.
B004FTQ8N0|5|I have my 19 month old every other weekend so I thought instead of buying the more expensive hard sided bath tub I would try this out and my son loves it. Also plan to use it in the pool.
B008JFWA2O|4|Very pretty but you can't find anything in this bag
B001L6JB52|5|it fits every need i have for it. i don't use many bottles for me to get a double pump but for the few times...it's great
B00G6H89FO|5|The Lorex BB1811 Wireless Baby monitor is a great monitor for the price if you are looking for a video picture.<br /><br />Installation is easy right out of the box and the unit is surprisingly small but it works.  The controls and options are intuitive and you will be able to use this monitor right out of the box. The video screen has a night vision mode which is helpful for a darker nursery but the screen is quite small.  The audio is clear enough to hear when baby is stirring and the range of the unit worked all throughout our condo.<br /><br />We also have the Levana Astra 3.5 which we like better for the more flexible camera and better screen but this is a pretty comparable monitor for less.
B00BLTHW6E|5|This was a gift!
B0000DBHJK|4|My son is 2 1/2 and this bag is still holding on.  I bought it after trying a few others that just seemed too big for everyday use.  It's the perfect size to use as a diaper bag/purse combo without feeling like you're on an expedition every time you leave the house. I've had no trouble fitting everything I've needed during each of my son's stages from newborn on up.  Now that he's older the outside pockets are great for a water bottle and quick access to snacks. I'm expecting twins soon and I'm seriously considering getting the same bag. <br /> <br />The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the front velcro pocket.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that the velcro gives out eventually.  Another zipper or type of clip would be better.  Having said that, it's pretty durable.  I've removed the cardboard/stiff board in the bottom and thrown it in the wash several times and it comes out looking great. <br /> <br />Overall a really great basic bag!
B00IIRY2RE|5|Stores milk, what more can I say, it does it's job. :)<br /><br />No issues with shipping.
B004LWZZ76|5|These are so cute!
B00BGF4JY6|4|My cousin lover this baby shower gift.
B00I2OBMA8|5|Well hello, lovely. Are you sure you're a diaper bag? Because you look like you're ready for a night on the town! Just saying...<br /><br />I must first say how funny it was to receive this \\"diaper bag\\" from Amazon. I've gotten broken and poorly packaged items before, but THIS hard-to-break \\"vegan leather\\" bag was packed in a HUGE box with about 3 feet of bubble wrap on top. Haha! Nicely done, Amazon. I'm happy to report that my BAG arrived in one piece.<br /><br />So here's the truth about this \\"diaper bag\\" (I'll explain the quotations in a brief moment). I've never heard of Timi & Leslie before, though I wish I'd had one when I had my first baby. Folks, I'm on baby #3 now, he's about a year old, and so I know NOW that you don't need the ridiculous Mary Poppins bag--what, with diapers and changes of clothes and spare lamps packed inside, because, HEY, you might need EVERYTHING they sell in a Babies r Us while you're out on a brief errand with your child.<br /><br />Might I remind you real quick, I'm on baby #3. This ain't mama's first rodeo. I've owned SEVERAL diaper bags at this point, including a handmade, a Petunia Picklebottom, and a basic Carter's bag. I eventually ditched all of those for one big giant momma tote bag which holds anything and everything--though I've been growing tired of it. This Timi & Leslie deal was a nice breath of fresh air. I feel like I own my first ever cute handbag...but it's not a handbag at all, is it?! Nope! It's a stinkin' diaper bag! Get out!<br /><br />This is a MOM BAG, let's just put it that way. Nothing about it's appearance says \\"diaper bag\\", which is why I'm \\"  \\" the words DIAPER and BAG because this bag really doesn't feel like that at all. Yet, it functions as one. Yes Sireee, I was blown away by the accessories this diaper bag comes with. Look, I'm used to the changing pad and little elastic-sinched bottle holding sections in your typical diaper bag. But THIS bag from Timi & Leslie comes with just about everything.<br /><br />- So first, there's the changing pad. It's thin, it's not bulky, it's just enough. Trust me--remember, I'm on baby #3--you won't use this as often as you might think. But they include it so, hey.<br /><br />- Then, they included a dirty clothes zippered pouch. Now THIS, you will sadly use more often than you expect. Hello blowouts, I've got a matching dirty clothes pouch now...so go ahead...make. my. day.<br /><br />- Stroller straps!? They're included?! I mean, I'd hope so at this price, but that is a REALLY nice touch on Timi & Leslie's part to include the stroller straps. Because yes, you will use them. I always wanted them with my older diaper bags but was too cheap to pay the extra $15 for a couple of straps when I was paying an arm and a leg already for diapers and things my baby actually NEEDED.<br /><br />- An extra, longer strap. I prefer the two shoulder straps so I can just tuck this baby under my arm and go. But the longer strap is super for those who prefer a messenger bag style.<br /><br />- The insulated bottle bag. Zippered and lined with that thermo stuff that is supposed to help retain temperature. Plus, the diaper bag has two inner pouches designed for holding bottles upright, you can slip the bottle bag into those easily. I used the insulated bottle bag on day one during a family outing, and I'm pleased to inform you that it kept my one-year-old's bottle of whole milk nice and cold! This is a great added touch. I don't use it daily, but I keep the pouch in the freezer and ready to go when I need it. As for the bottle-holding compartments inside the bag itself, I find those to be perfect spots for: sunscreen on one side and hand sanitizer on the other.<br /><br />- Last but not least, this diaper bag/purse comes with a matching, smaller PURSE. Or, \\"pouchette\\" as they call it. But hello! This is just a perfect idea. This one makes this diaper bag TOPS over the others, they include a smaller clutch-like bag for you to grab quickly on the go. It's a cute \\"vegan leather\\" bag that holds just what YOU need. For those too-few and precious moments when you're relieved of your mommy duties for a moment and you get to go out on the town or what-not. What a great feature! I love it.<br /><br />So that's what I think about the bag and it's accessories. I do have a few minor notations, if you will...<br /><br />- The stitch quality and overall quality of this bag is very nice. The stitches are great. This bag is made from \\"vegan leather\\". Okay, haha, Timi & Leslie. That's a nice way of putting it and it's great to be vegan and all, but let's just be real: it's fake leather. Still, it's soft and pliable and LOOKS SO PRETTY. If you're vegan, it's guilt free. We all win.<br /><br />- The zippers are metal, and maybe not the BEST quality of metal zippers. So, as a few other reviewers have pointed out, I have had them catch a time or two. But you know what? It hasn't been that bad. The main zipper up top has worked perfectly. As for the smaller zippers, I've had to two-hand them a couple times to get them to keep sliding. Not a big deal.<br /><br />- The inner fabric is what I would call mom-friendly. I've seen some criticism here about the \\"cheap\\" fabric inside. And yes, it's not like velour or satin. It's just a thinner, easy-to-clean type of fabric. Nothing to write home about. It's fine. Doesn't bother me at all. And honestly, considering what is tossed in the mom bag these days...I'm just fine with a cheaper fabric.<br /><br />I really have no real complaints with this bag. It's SO attractive for a diaper bag. The irony is that it looks nothing like a diaper bag, and yet it's the most well-featured diaper bags I've had. If you have any questions that I did not answer here, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer! I definitely, obviously, recommend this diaper bag! Even if you don't have a baby...it makes for a nice purse too!t's a cute \\"vegan leather\\" bag that holds just what YOU need.

B0029LH222|4|Horrible directions to put this together. In the end, though, we both love it. It is simple yet bold. I would HIGHLY recommend two people doing this. Some parts are easily done by one person, but on other parts the second person is very helpful.
B003UERREA|5|I just got this bag today, but I can already tell I LOVE THIS BAG!  I love the pattern (Drip Drops), I love all the pockets, I love that the whole front of the bag opens.  The side pockets are plenty big enough to fit sippy cups.  I bought this bag primarily to use for traveling.  We only have one child, so it's a little big for day to day.  I know it will be great for traveling though and we'll have no problem fitting in everything we need.  I also really like the \\"mommy pocket\\" in the front.  This will make it so much easier to find my wallet and keys! I also really like the metal feet on the bottom. I really like the backpack straps too - I love that it can be a completely hands-free bag.<br /><br />On the negative side - the bag itself is a little heavier than I was expecting, but that doesn't bother me very much since it's obviously a good quality bag.  As some other reviewers noted, there's no place to store the straps when you're not using them, but the bag is big enough that you could just store them in the main pocket.<br /><br />Also, just as a side note - my bag was the 2nd generation style, so the new style is available in the Drop Drops pattern.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this bag and can't wait to use it.  I did a lot of research looking for diaper bags, and I'm so glad I decided on this one.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Am now using this as my every-day diaper bag.  It has plenty of room to store everything for my two kids.  I use it mostly with the Be Connected stroller clips.  It's still an awesome bag and it's held up amazingly well.  It still looks brand new after almost 2 years of use.
B000YFW2SE|5|Love them!
B0028IDXDS|5|The only pacifier my daughter will take. And I love it because it doesn't roll out of her crib, so when she wakes up in the middle of the night there is no more search.
B000066665|4|Nice transition tub once baby is too big for an infant tub, not quite ready for the big bath.  We only needed to use it for a month or two but for the money, it's great.  The one we used for our first two children had a duck sound when you squeezed the bill, this one didn't which was sad but still a great tub!
B00H07AZ42|5|I'm new to cloth diapering and in comparison to the off-white colored 4-layer Hemp inserts, I find the 5-layer Charcoal Bamboo inserts work better in regards to absorbing and fitting well in the pocket diapers... and they don't stain as easily.<br />I would totally recommend this to anyone interested in cloth diapering - new or expert.
B00BEVF1XU|5|This is the update to the Britax Frontier 85 and earlier models. I own an assortment of Marathon, Frontier 85 and Frontier 90 due to two children, two cars, and one car accident. Many small changes make for a huge improvement!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Britax tests to European standards--front, rear and side impact (US standards do not test side impact, and I'm not sure they test both front and rear).<br />-The seat cover can now be removed without undoing the harness straps. Strategically-placed notches in the cover allow you to work it around the straps, and intelligently-situated clips and hooks make it easy to remove from the frame.  Since this seat is sized for the potty-training years this is an essential feature.<br />-The height can be adjusted without uninstalling the car seat (the 85 had an adjustment that was buried between the booster and the car's seat, requiring you to uninstall before adjusting).<br />-The ClickTight installation system actually makes it easier to install with the car's seat belt than with the LATCH system.  This is a HUGE improvement!<br />-More room in the cup holders for toys, juice box, etc.<br />-Higher height and weight limits than the 85 (90 pounds in harness mode, 120 pounds in booster mode, I can't remember the height limits).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The fabric is a bit coarse.  It doesn't bother me, it just feels rugged, but some friends have commented on it.<br />-I wish there were better colors to choose from.<br /><br />Really, the worst thing I have to say about this seat is that my daughter was disappointed it didn't come in blue or green.  With newer rules requiring that 65 lbs total weight (child and seat) be installed with the car's seat belt rather than the LATCH system, this booster combo couldn't have come at a better time.  With the 85 (and with every other seat I have used) I have had to climb into the seat and wrestle with it in order to get it installed tight enough that it wouldn't move more than an inch (which Iwas advised to do by two different Safe Kids inspectors).  With this seat I simply opened the Click Tight hatch, threaded the seat belt through, and closed the hatch.  Levers in the Click Tight hatch take up the slack and offer a perfect installation.  I was floored!<br /><br />I bought this seat after a car accident.  My son was in a Britax Marathon when I was rear-ended.  I had mild whiplash and some pretty big repairs to the back end of my car, but my son was unharmed.  My best friend is a Safe Kids-trained safety inspector and she recommends Britax above all other brands because they offer the best testing and the best record.
B0073JD2VU|2|It was hard, even after reading the reviews and looking at the pictures, to see if this would work on my lazy susan cabinet.  It did not.  I have the style where the folded door opens separately from the lazy susan, and then you can reach inside and access the turntable.  This latch would not work on it.  Hope this helps someone else out there!
B005FFHRQK|5|Bought this for our daughter and she said it was a very nice crib, easy to put together, well made, seemed safe for the baby and I thought the price was good and seemed to ship fast.
B000BZ6BG6|5|We've had our MacLaren Quest since my son was 7 months old.  It's lightweight, compact and durable.  My son rides very comfortably and it's been a godsend on our vacations.  It's easy to put through the metal detector at the airport and has withstood many travel adventures as well as shopping trips.  The handles are tall enough to be comfortable for my 6 foot tall husband to push.  The only drawback is that it has no cupholders.  I bought the accessory for this reason, but other than that, I have no complaints.
B00081MHIE|5|My 15 month old, LOVES LOVES LOVES to shut the door behind him. This door stopper is awesome - it stops the little bugger from closing the door and causing trouble :o). Fits on any door. We love it!
B009MA5VS0|5|Great product!
B0057N9BLO|4|The Blanket is soft, twin sized, and colors are bright, BUT it is not the picture print shown! It is Thomas but not the scene shown and a disappointing picture.
B00278WA4W|5|These cups really are spill-proof.  I like the shape because they are easy for my son's little hands to hold.  They are also much easier to clean and put back together than the straw-type cups.
B00ARU2ID0|5|Love these bottles.
B0038JDVCE|3|I use a few different types of bottles and this brush doesn't work with many of them because it's so large and rigid. Wide mouth bottles are fine, but otherwise you're flinging soap everywhere when you try and yank the brush back out. I also can't clean the rings and adapters very well. It's a nice brush, but it's not universally useable... if that makes sense.
B004D46IFA|1|Maybe I got a crummy cup, but it doesn't work at ALL!  It only barely works as a sippy cup, and nit a single drop of medicine comes through.
B00QV4EM6M|5|I use these to wrap (cuddle?) my camera gear when packing it up!  Yes, I have a padded care and back pack, but sometimes I need to stack stuff, or want a little extra protection - I love microfiber for that! These are thicker than your average microfiber cloth, and a heck of lot larger.<br /><br />Yes, they work for delicate cleaning, but they are so large they're the ideal traveling companion when packing up delicate items and things you don't want scratched!<br /><br />Well made, no fuzzies.
B0052QYLUM|5|One downside with this monitor is that you have to manually change the angle and you can't zoom.<br />Having said that the picture is clear and I have dropped the monitor unit so many times on hard floors and you'd think it would break or shatter such wad the but it still is worKing exactly as when I bought it over a year ago.<br />I think it's a better deal overall. My Samsung before this was good but I never dropped that one and it lost audio in less than 2  months and thankfully i was able to return it.
B004HO5866|5|We have gone through several Strollers as we travel a Lot, the reason we kill our strollers is that we want strollers that are light, easy to fold and small. Our Jeep stroller died on our last day in Paris and remains in the city. We had the stroller for about a year and it traveled extensively throughout, Russia (poor streets and roads), Europe (on cobble stone streets!), New Zealand, Australia and the United States.<br /><br />It probably went in 50 planes and covered hundreds of thousands of miles. We are pretty adventurous and probably walk anywhere between 5 and 15 miles a day. The stroller handled it all including snow, cobble stones, buses, trains and planes. The cobble stones were finally the strollers undoing but it lasted until the last day of our Europe adventure.<br /><br />Our child is now 4 and we often loaded the stroller up with him and many shopping bags. By the time we left it in Paris there was NO tread left on any of the wheels.<br /><br />So we have just received our new one. Hope it lasts as well.
B00I8PGV7K|4|lovely soft fabric. only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is personal taste, aesthetically looked better on the computer, however i am happy with it.
B0031VLRYI|5|My daughter has had this for two montha she absolutely loves it. We dont leave the house or go to daycare without it. We even bought an extra for just in case<br /><br />Update: My daughter is now almost 18 months old and we don't go anywhere without her &#34;bug&#34; as she calls him we have gone through two. Not because of her but our dog decided to give it a try also. She loves him so much that before she pops him in her mouth for bed she gives his face a kiss. Best pacifier ever!! I will buy them for all my future kids and friends kids.
B00RP0GHBO|5|I love this. I recommend that every mother has one of these.
B0073C6T76|4|I have been a daycare provider for many years and used this product.  I has proven to be excellent.  The adhesive needs to sit undisturbed at least over night to withstand normal use.  When removing this product, it can remove paint.  The product makes it incredibly easy to install safety locks with out permenantly damaging expensive cabinet doors.
B000WGYI5K|5|With all the carseats and large variation in prices, I was not sure what to purchase.  I had always trusted the Graco brand, but I wanted my grandchild to have safety and comfort at the least amount of dollars out of my pocket.  So many reviews and I was still confused. My sensibility side told me just because it cost 300 dollars does not mean it is the best.  In the end I ordered this with the thought if it does not work I will send it back. It is great, beautiful (prettier than the pic)soft and my grandbaby loves it.  Thank you Graco for always being the best price with quality.
B0053V397M|1|Pictures not clear. Night time horrible. Did not like this camera at all. We were disappointed in this purchase. Never again
B00O3GVSZI|5|We love it when we give him pieces of food or fruits. It catches pieces he throws in. It's like his treasure box!!! We like the flexibility too.
B0034ISZF2|4|At first, I didn't like the product.  It was probably me because my milk was fluctuating when it arrived.  My milk production is diminishing, but I still love this product.  It changed my life.  I can't pump without it.  I ordered a medium and was a 36DD.  I lost some more weight and am about a 34, so now it's a little big.  It still gets the job done.  There are bras out there that have a built in holder, but I like this band.
B003ZUXNRO|5|This is the second set of shoulder straps but I have purchased. I originally purchased these for my older son who is now two and still has them on his car seat.  When I had my second son I decided to purchase another set because I was very pleased with the quality of these. Like any parent has probably experience they have needed to be washed and they have held up wonderfully!
B004Q9SFWG|5|Perfect product!
B00SRK5FCI|5|I have a 3 yr old and 4 yr old that are both training right now so this has become a lifesaver!!!! We tried the cute little potty chair and both hated it!! But this they love!!! I love that it came with the hanger, after I had ordered I was wondering where we would put it when not in use, so huge bonus!!!!
B00SE4PK72|5|My daughter started showing signs of painful teething at 4 months old. We bought her her first necklace from a different company that broke after a short period, so we decided to try Raw Honey from Little Willard instead. My angel is back again, without the drooling and fever. The amber is a wonderful quality and this company stands behind their product.
B005SPZG5Q|4|I'm not a Mom and didn't order this for use on a stroller. I'm actually using it on a bicycle and for my kayak, or anything else that I might be able to hook it onto. What sold me was the swivel mount.
B00762Y5EW|2|this item is exceptionally hard to attach to the stroller.  In fact, mine is still not attached.  I will take it to the maintenance man to see if he has the strength and or tools to do it.  Crazy to have it be so much work.  Very frustrating!
B00CL2H1U2|5|Makes a good toy
B001BWT5IE|2|I've had the diaper champ for my fist two kids and I really am not happy with it. I don't know if there is a perfect diaper pail but this one just isn't it. It doesn't keep the stink out. I don't want to change it every other day which I guess you have to do to keep the poo smell from taking over the room.     What I do like is that you can use your own bags.
B0057EEBE0|5|it's great.
B005SBX8E6|1|This is way smaller than you'd think.  It is not a real wheelie bin: rather it's a toy.
B00L49LTO2|2|Not very comfortable, hard to make work for the pump.  Way over priced, disapoined I bought 2 instead of trying it first.
B005LKQCHY|5|We spent a week babysitting our grandchildren ages 6, 4 and 22 months.  Their 87 yr. old great grandmother came to help.  My two older granddaughters share a bedroom with sleep buddy.  The first morning they woke up at 7:00 a.m.  They were used to waking up and then romping in their room for about an hour until the sleep buddy light went off.  I had  alot of anxiety about them waking their  baby brother in the room next to them.  Great grandmother was sleeping in the room under theirs downstairs and we were sleeping across the hall from them.  When their tiny feet touched the ground the whole household was awake.  I got them set up the night before  to pick books to look at and to stay in their beds until the sleep buddy light went off at 8:00 a.m. When Mum mum went in to greet them they were so excited about getting their sticker reward to put on their chart. It was wonderful!  Mum mum and Pop Pop got to sleep an extra hour and we had no anxiety during the night worrying about the toddlers waking up the household. We could count on a good night's sleep so we were refreshed and energetic in the morning ready to face our day and enjoy our grandchildren!  Sleep buddy became the babysitters' and grandparents best friend!  I would recommend it to everybody who cherishes a good night's sleep.  Either you train your children or they train you!  Thank you so much sleep buddy!
B00MOLD16I|5|I'm in LOVE with these baby headbands so adorable. Made very well no stones missing. Beautiful as pictured.
B00004TFLB|5|Beautiful sounds and easy for a little one to use! We have since passed ours on to a child with cerebral palsy who is also blind. She loves it!
B009F98SQU|3|For the most part I thoroughly enjoy this product. I got it because I liked the idea of being able to clip the item on to my diaper bag so I wouldn't have to dig for it when changing a smelly diaper but rather have it handy so I could make the change from start to finish without any delay. I like the case for the item, as well as the scent the bags have. It's a lavender scent and quite noticeable, it does a nice job of masking the odor.<br /><br />A few cons about the product are:<br />When looking at the product the image displays a blue and green set of dispensers. However, I received a set of blue and purple, which is unfortunate because I have a boy. The other product images display the blue and purple set, so it appears that there's no where to select which set you get, you just get a surprise (or this is how it was when I purchased the item). Another issue I ran into as the clip itself. I clipped the dispenser onto the handle of my diaper bag and it fell off, which was the main purpose of getting the item, so I was quite disappointed about that. Another downfall to the item would be the ease of actually getting a bag out. I've ran into the item &#34;catching&#34; or getting stuck if I try to pull the bag out too fast or don't position the item in just the right way.<br /><br />The reasons I kept the item when I ran into these issues were:<br />-I still received a blue dispenser.<br />-I like the scent of these bags better than the other scented bags I've tried.<br />AND<br />-I still liked having a dispenser for the item rather than having random bags stuffed all around my diaper bag.<br /><br />If you can look past these shortcomings, I would recommend the product.
B001OC5UMQ|4|I recently got a puppy and I needed to keep near me and out of trouble.  I didn't want to close the door to my office because it gets hot plus I wanted to be able to hear my other dogs at least.  With that in mind I bought this baby gate.  I was a little worried because as we all know you get what you pay for and this gate is much cheaper than most.  My fears were unwarranted.  It is working out well.  Setup was no problem.  I barely even needed the directions.  It attaches securely to the wall.  The door is also secure.  I have no trouble with the latch but I only use the first &#34;stage.&#34;  That is to say there is a while lever to lift plus a red latch to keep the white lever secure.  I never use the red latch.  All in all it does a great job.
B000F1O8T8|5|The best portable potty seat!! My son carried this in his own little backpack when we were out and about and was not afraid of it at all!! He did great potty training in public because he had confidence that he was able to with this seat!
B00HVCMAJO|5|Perfect.
B004LWZZ5S|5|I have two sets so there are fewer gaps between dots where small feet can slip.
B003X3R6TO|4|My daughter says these are handy and work well for small spitups and cleaning my grandsons face after feeding. Gets the job done.
B004C43JJ4|4|Works wonderfully but quite a bit smaller (seat-wise) than I thought.
B008XMVBAA|3|My 4 year old was so happy to receive her tutu that she wore it right away but in less than an hour the chiffon ruffle on the zebra pattern started to tear and the the rest came apart as it got caught on her bedroom door.  I contacted the seller to address the situation.  I was impressed by the prompt reply.  I may not order this item again but the fact the problem was rectified, I will be shopping again on similar items from this company.
B000LZFZVS|5|My son is 16 months and it is still useful. I purchased this when I was still pregnant. It has all you needs in a cute little case. Everything is still in great condition.
B000056J6T|1|Got it as a shower gift thinking it was a great idea but it doesn't adjust enough to fit our crib railings.  I think it was made for very thin out of fashion cribs cause I don't see how this can fit any crib that I am aware of.  Our is a convertible crib.
B006JINB5S|5|Great product would highly recommend it
B000069BB2|4|I purchased this seat on the day it was released due to the open slide for &quot;belt positioning&quot; mode.  This is the best seat for this use.  I love all the features.  The harness adjustment is a snap by simply sliding up a bar in the back (no rethreading harnesses).  The reclining feature is a must for preschoolers who still nap on car trips, but it does make the seat slide forward due to the VERY BROAD base.  If you have narrow seats, this car seat is not for you.  I have a Chevy Venture Minivan and it does extend over the edge of the captains chair by about 1/2-3/4&quot;, so I purchased a grippy pad for under it.<br />NOW, for the DISLIKE part...my daughter is 41&quot; and 34#!!!  I just measured last night (after attending a car seat inspection) and this &quot;technically&quot; places her out of the height range for this seat.  But, her shoulders are still about 3/4&quot; below the topmost slots, so it is still safe to use...FOR NOW!!  If you have a tall and skinny kid, you will be in LIMBO for another seat option way before the 40# weight limit as we are.  NHTSA recommends that children not be moved to belt positioning mode until BOTH 40# and 40&quot;...so, I am now in the market for another harnessed seat, with higher height limits!  The other drawbacks we have encountered are the harness straps can be kind of difficult to adjust and the cup holder (in the base) is WAY too low for any kid to reach.  (Maybe they could in booster mode, but we haven't made it that far!)<br />Try this seat out in your car before you commit!  And, keep in mind your tall, skinny kiddo!
B00E0HHK3E|5|I had a spongebob theme pirate party.  They worked great in my goody bucket.
B00HAZSOFG|5|Cutest door on the baby floor!
B009KE6UXS|1|The shapes are way too small for small children!  It looks like a choking hazard!  If this gift is opened, I will be taking away the shapes right away!  My children could still use the ball to fill it with other things & still use the button to make Mickey talk.  However, the plastic hinge is not very durable, so I am sure this toy will soon be in two pieces!<br />Disney could & should make this toy great because it is so cute & educational![[ASIN:B009KE6UXS Mickey Mouse Shape Sorter -]]
B00HR8UBAW|5|I love this car seat for my son I had to buy a new one because the one I had from my older son was expired (yes car seats expire due to upgrades in safety requirements) and I used Gracco before so I was a little apprehensive about switching brands. I loved it so much I also bought the matching stroller! And I does come with the base and the feet cover which was great since we were stationed in Germany and he was born in the winter. It kept him warm and toasty.
B00065H55W|4|I like the pump in style a lot! It's incredibly portable and easy to use! I also purchased the car adapter and have pumped in the car when I wasn't able to nurse. It's lightweight, sleek looking, and discreet. I recommend it for working moms or moms who have also have a life outside being a busy mom!
B000FDCW8U|3|I had been looking for a growth tracking chart that could be put in the baby's room that would coordinate with the rest of the room. When I found this I thought it would be PERFECT! It arrived this morning and it is cute BUT I thought it was light blue and white in color. The white is actually more of an off white so I repainted the wooden frame with some white enamel paint. It looks a lot better to me now, but I was expecting it to be white when it arrived. Also, the blue star background is a separate piece of wood that is attached to the back of the wooden frame with staples from a staplegun. I do not know if something was sat on top of the shipping box but the one end was coming off so I had to use a hammer to knock the staples back in place. A little bit of paint and a few taps of the hammer and this chart looks a lot better then it did when it arrived. It is very cute, I took stars off only because it was not white (which is what is shown in the picture) and because the backing was coming off (either happened in shipping or it could be due to a staple actually missing in the corner)
B00AJSJ4PU|5|Great light weight carrier for front or back.  Easy straps and buckles to get in and out of while baby is sleeping. Wish I would have found this carrier earlier instead of the multiple we had when toddler was younger.
B0044R7HYC|5|I just received this today, so we will see if the chair withstands the test of time, but so far I'm extremely pleased. This is exactly what I wanted for my 4yr old who's outgrown her high chair but can't comfortably sit in a regular chair and still reach the table. It seems to be quality. No scratches, all parts present in box, instructions easy to follow, and although I'm almost 6mos pregnant and big already and could put this together and adjust it with ease! I also bought the seat cushions (not infant) and they fit well and seem to be quality also. My daughter loves it and told me she would &#34;sit here forever!&#34; when she first got in. My only complaint is the price, but it seems like you just can't find good wooden furniture cheap. I tried to find this used, but either it's not popular yet or else no one wants to get rid of it since it adjusts from infant to adult (250lb!). Good product. I recommend it if you can bear to part with so much money for a chair!
B002MK4DAE|5|bastangte spacious diaper bag with many compartments, the fashionable design, portfolio appears, vivid colors, perfect for busy moms and dads, responsible supplier recommended by 100%
B000YDDF6O|5|Our 10 month old great-grandson opened this for Christmas and wasn't interested in anything else after that.  The handle makes a nice teething ring.
B0085CBA90|5|Much more comfortable than the flanges that came with my Hygeia pump. After 45 minutes I feel great instead of raw and seriously dreading the next time I have to pump. It does seem to take a little longer with these than the other flanges. But 45 minutes of feeling fine versus a half hour of agony is no contest. One warning-These don't seem to fit as tight onto the bottles as the original flanges. I use a pumping bra and I stood up after pumping with the bottles still on me and they fell off the flanges. Now I make sure they are VERY secure so I don't lose any more milk.
B009IVKY7Q|5|These homemade baby food pouches are wonderful! At first, I bought the refill pack only and used a piping tip and ziploc bag to fill them. It was doable, but kind of a pain. It takes long enough to make baby food, especially when you're taking care of a baby at the same time. I don't want to spend extra time trying to figure out how to pipe it into the tiny spout just to save a few bucks. I did that once and went back to buy the squeeze station - totally worth it!<br /><br />I had been doing the ice cube tray method for storing my batches of homemade baby food, but they take too long to defrost on the go. Even then, the baby food containers kept exploding in my diaper bag (fun!). These are awesome on the go - I just grab one from the freezer, pop it into my diaper bag, and it's generally defrosted by the time I need it. If not, I can run it under a hot tap or ask for a cup of hot water.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Easy to assemble/use<br />- Easy to clean (take the top and bottom off the Squeeze station, wipe it clean; pop the tubes in the dishwasher)<br />- Not too terribly expensive (refill bags are 50 for $17; less if you have Babies R Us coupons, which I usually do)<br /><br />CONS<br />- Can be messy (the baby food squeezes out of the top when you're filling the bags sometimes, and the plunger gets suctioned down at the bottom pulling the food out of the bag when you try to extract the plunger)<br />- Bags are not reusable<br /><br />In regards to REUSING THE BAGS, the manufacturer says not to. They are so sturdy looking and while not necessarily expensive, it seems like a waste to just toss them. I am experimenting with reusing them. I rinse them clean immediately after use, and soak them in hot soapy water. I think the biggest issue with reusing them is that it is not sanitary to let them air dry - they are not a well-ventilated and I could see them being a breeding ground for nasties. My plan is to clean them and refill them immediately, as I think that's the only way to avoid that problem.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been successfully reusing the food pouches. I rinse them until they run clear with hot water, then shake hot soapy water inside of them. I rinse them clean again, and dry them upside down on a drying rack, puffed up so the water can get out. So far, so good!<br /><br />**Definitely purchase these at Babies R Us or Target for half the price shown here. I believe these are a Babies R Us and Target exclusive at the time of my review.y way to avoid that problem.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been successfully reusing the food pouches.

B00ER96YZ0|5|Package arrived undamaged with round sticker seals on the both ends. This is an awesome shower gift, that everyone with use at some point. It my signature gift to give. Extremely pleased! Will reorder again. Thanks
B007GBT6B0|5|My granddaughter loved it.  Small but right size for a toddler.  Seems to be well made and should last for a while.
B006Z6D61I|5|Great product, functional and whimsical. The best thing is it holds all sizes of toothbrushes and it is easy to clean.
B002UXQRHU|5|I've tried many with this similar nipple shape, and this one has worked best for our baby.  It's great for small mouths, our daughter would gag on many.  This has a shorter \\"stem\\".  Cleans fine.  It will get water inside but it squeezes out.  I have bought many.
B001WAJVZM|5|I bought this because we have three young grandchildren and it has been perfect! It's totally worth it to have the peace of mind-- just in case. We can take it off when they're not here, and it's very easy to put back on when we need it.  Definitely recommend this for grandparents and parents. I'm planning to purchase another for a friend who is expecting her first child.
B008VWEO3S|5|Perfect for toddler and has nice non-slip bottom
B000F1SCJK|5|I recommend this changer diaper bag. It is practical, easy to carry, has space to keep diapers and it looks nice too.
B00BLY1M6A|5|Very nice and fits the play yard perfectly ! It is so much nicer than others I looked at. Great price, great quality and fast ship.
B00AA7O4CS|5|Good product.  Has been very convenient for us.
B00BEIOK8U|5|great value. only bad thing is i am a cubs fan...so it killed me to purchase a sox stroller  lol
B000GIBZEG|3|The quality of the cushion is great, it lasts and provides great protection on sharp/hard edges but the velcro doesn't hold up, at least not on a stone fireplace, so some stronger adhesive will be needed for some surfaces.
B0047O2C3S|5|These are very soft and hold up well after many washes. My daughter has not had any diaper rashes since changing to these wipes.
B0006FHB5Q|5|Very cool product! Works just as they say! Even though it's very strong when first applied \\"Correctly\\"! It should be checked every so often (Just for safety reasons)! And, it is not intended to support your \\"Total\\" weight! If you wind up needing a permanent support bar installed?.... This is a great precursor for the EXACT position that works best for YOU! If you wind up needing a support bar for your entire weight at some point. THIS product will direct you to where it should be installed perfectly for YOU! This is a great, and strong balance item.... And can be used in several different ways!
B004HEMXXM|1|This product is terrible:<br /><br />- In order to install it high up on the door you need to drill holes in the door.<br /><br />- If you don't put it high enough or your child pushes a chair to the door and climbs up they can actually lock you out of the house because the latch is really easy to shut.
B000V8VAYQ|5|My son is 9 weeks old and exclusively breastfed. He was constantly nursing to fulfill the need to suck. I tried every pacifier they had at local department stores. He gagged on them and refused to take any of them. I was literally his pacifier and extremely exhausted. I ordered this when he was about 4 weeks old. It arrived before the expected date which was a huge plus. 15 minutes after introducing this pacifier to him he was able to suck this pacifier and fell asleep. He took about a 2.5 hour nap which was much better than the short catnaps he usually did! Now that he's 9 weeks he has started sucking his hand more, but still takes this pacifier. I feel like this pacifier showed him that he is able to soothe himself. I highly recommend this preemie pacifier even for full term babies who have a major gag reflex!
B00ESWACP4|5|Very soft and nice.
B00D2VMUCU|5|I love Medela products. It was just what I needed
B004AHMCL4|2|I bought these for a 3 month old baby and they do not stay on the wrist and he is not even that active. They are cute and colorful and the rattle is not obnoxious but the design could be so much better.
B00FFJ3BEI|5|fit perfect and look good
B00PL8SN7S|1|The design isn't even going I the right direction.<br /><br />This was a design on Threadless before. Hopefully the creator is getting something from it.
B00FNJ7FSI|1|My son sinks in it... Curving his back... I got a graco swing instead.. It's harder but there's cushion and it keeps his back straight
B00821FLT4|1|There is a lock that keeps the little for from sliding open, which I thought was awesome until I realized how ridiculously easy it was to just lift the whole top open. After reading all of these great reviews we didn't think we'd be throwing ours away after 4 months because even after cleaning it several times it smells so bad that we have to hold our breath every time we quickly shove a diaper in there. Looking for another solution tonight.
B00005C8C4|5|We gave my stepson a choice of 5 different bedding sets for his &quot;big boy bed&quot; and he immediately chose this one.  I wanted another one and kept asking which one he liked better and this one was the winner every time.  He loves Elmo with a passion.  My only complaint is that the backside of the comforter doesn't seem that soft almost scratchy along the lines of a hotel comforter.  I haven't washed it yet but I hope that will solve the problem.  Over all he loves it and sleeps well on it so thats all that matters!
B004VL2VRO|5|I love this monitor. It works perfect so we can keep our eyes on our little girl while she sleeps
B00D2JN87I|1|1) my child could not turn this on again 2) it is hard 3)it is hard
B000XT30G4|5|Nice gate... goes well with the rest of our house!
B00KQ6J400|5|Now I can go and enjoy a happy family time after work. The stress level of my work just got reduced thanks to my car.
B003SRF2NW|4|gift for baby shower, baby not born yet.  Product looks good and had good reviews.
B0000482FN|4|My husband yanked hard enough on the oven door to pop this off. I don't think a baby or toddler could have managed it, though.
B000I2ZFR8|5|I got these to go with my breast pump since my old stuff was no good. I really like the manual pump but not as much as the original ones they had about 5 years ago. This one is difficult to use because you have to hold the pump with both hands where as the other one, you only needed one hand on the pump and one on the bottle. Either way, it works efficiently and I would recommend to every breast feeding mother!
B0056JIZ5M|3|I thought for the price of the small infant quilt it would be nice and thick or at least fluffy.  It is not, rather thin, not much body to it.  I will keep it but not very pleased with the quality.  The color is pink but very mute and washed out looking, pattern is almost indistinct.
B009RP8LUA|1|This is the worst dresser ever. Its cheaply made and the drawers are so tiny. Dont waste your time and money.
B003EN6338|5|When I just opened the package and showed it to our baby, he touched it and I could see from his eyes how he enjoys the softness. After I washed it, it has become his friend to fall asleep everyday.  We even bought two so there's always one available while the other one is in the laundry.
B00DTY06SA|5|Very happy with product and delivery!
B005G4VUPO|4|I never had any leaks with these.  They worked well for me.  I did have some of my milk sour before it should have, but that may be from my own storage techniques rather than from the bags.
B003WE9IJA|5|After a few tries, we settled with this pacifier. My little girl loves it but I try not to give it too often
B00HWVTY6G|5|Love this!
B009F54KW0|5|This playard is the only biggest playard шт the whole of online stores. I made my own research and found this the only one we want to get. We have quite a big family room and even in the baby's room it doesn't take too much space. Of course, if you think you have enough space to place it. Because someone may not be agree with me. It's wide enough even for two kids, and high enough that my 8 months old son can't reach the edges, when he stands upright. In addition the whole construction is very sturdy. I'm glad to have it in our home.
B0096451FA|5|Love it
B000U00VHM|4|i like these just fine, they work well as actual diapers, but they are not as thick as i would have liked them to be (i use bumkins diapers normally).  but they still work great and are soft enough for the baby bum.
B004G8QN58|4|I have always loved Halo products.  Purchased this sleepsack with confidence and used it for one month.  Zipper split and rendered it useless after a month.  Called their customer service and they replaced it immediately.  Because of my positive experience with their company and previous history with their products (no defective items whatsoever), I will continue to use their products and recommend them.  These sleepsacks are so helpful for diapers changes during the night.  I dress her in a long sleeve onesie, socks and a sleepsack and we're good to go!
B00BPIXS5K|5|This is a beautifully crafted sleep sack -- it's extremely well made and the fabric feels so soft! There is plenty of room for my 8 month old son to grow -- he will be able to wear this sleep sack for a long time. It's a little heavy for summers in the south, so he'll wear it this winter to keep him warm at night. This sleep sack may be more expensive than others on the market, but because it's so well made it's worth every penny.
B004R9611W|5|This is perfect for a baby learning to grasp and track. The wooden rattle noise is pleasant unlike plastic shakers which just don't sound as nice. Wood is super smooth and all natural vegetable dyes make it even better than a lot of the other wooden toys out there. What's not to love?? I think for the price the quality is outstanding. And it's supposed to be small...otherwise it wouldn't be suitable for a young baby!
B001D4951C|5|I love HALO swaddle blankets. The fleece keeps my LO warm without presenting a suffocation hazard. My son doesn't like to have his arms pinned down so I like being able to use the swaddle with his arms out.
B0011URFRE|5|Great car seat! Easy to install, and my daughter loves it.
B000K53UEI|4|This rack is pretty compact and I love that it spins. The top rack is a little flimsy but it has no problems holding baby related items to dry. Things seem to dry out quickly, about 3X as fast on this rack than they do if I just set them on a dish towel.
B001I45F70|2|doesn't stay attached with a toddler who is apparently to strong for things like this.
B000E82WRM|5|Grandson loved this toy. He is 7 months old. Very cute, and the toy isn't bad either. ;)  good buy
B00NZ4ZAA8|4|work great
B00CYRYUXU|5|These were perfect for my needs!  They are sturdy and easy to put onto the stroller.  I have no complaints and would definitely recommend this product!
B002ZB82CU|4|We love this monitor! We bought this to replace one from another company that kept giving us false alarms. The two pads are great for when he moves around the crib. One with a video feed would be great, but we already had a video monitor.<br />We did have to adjust the sensitivity because the first few nights we were having false alarms. After some trial and error it's been great for the past month.
B002M4DI5G|5|I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months old and started using her exersaucer.  She is small, so before I discovered this product we had to use a rolled up blanket to support her in the seat.  When I started using this, WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MADE!  All I have to say is WOW.  Not only did it make her more secure in the seat, but it gave her head support, which was important since she would sometimes thrust herself backwards. The blanket certainly didn't provide that.    The HuggaBebe is very soft and thick.  I am confident when I have to walk away from her for a few minutes, knowing it is fully supporting her.  And I can tell she likes when I put her in it, too.  She always has this smile on her face when we put it on.  I think she likes the snug feeling it gives her.  Without this product, she would fall forward in the exersaucer seat.  That's no longer an issue.  It also lifts her up a bit, so she's able to reach the toys on the saucer.  Without it, she wouldn't be able to (she's a short baby).  I think every parent should have one of these.  It will extend the life of your baby products so that your baby can start using them earlier.  It's worth every penny!    Update 7/16/10--The other day I used the HuggaBebe in the baby swing at the park.  Yet another great use for it, and without it, my daughter would be too small for the swing.  In this, she was so comfortable and supported.  This is such a great invention!
B000BXHPEU|4|Small hole but it's great for when you're out and about.  It folds and tucks away easily. Outings are the only thing we use it for.
B000E82WRM|3|I think it's good perhaps he was too big for it but you fill it up with air or water and the little animals appear to be floating inside
B00526ICYI|5|For the first year we used the Sony Baby Call Baby Monitor - 900MHZ which worked well but decided to upgrade to a video monitor when we learned we were having our second baby. We've been using this Lorex video monitor for a couple of months now and we love it. It leaves nothing to the imagination. You know exactly how your child is sleeping. The video is very crisp in daytime and the night view is impressively detailed considering its subtle non-intrusive red lights. We use a cool mist humidifier as noise maker in our daughters room and it does not cause noticeable interference. The set up was pretty simple and everything connected without any hassles. We haven't tried connecting to the monitor via the internet yet. Overall I love this product after buying it the very first day it became available. I am planning on buying more cameras to take advantage of the 4 channel availability.<br /><br />UPDATE: Jan 2013<br />We have been using this for over a year now and we still love it. The battery is sufficient to carry around during the day and leave on the charger by our bed at night. We don't use the talk back feature hardly at all but it works well. The signal is strong enough to go outside and do yard work without any problem.
B0092NM7P2|5|These were exactly what I thought they were going to be an the shipping was really quick as well. They were cheaper than what I could find in store also you get more.
B0084DQFPE|4|The velcro is extremely strong and it feels really secure in our soon-to-be baby girl's closet. We are using it for baby clothes, blankets, sheets, etc. if you have plans to put heavier items on it then it might be a different story. So far, this has been an excellent storage unit and maximizes unused space in the closet.
B0055LV4HC|5|This is my favorite gate for the money.  We use several to keep our dogs from getting into different parts of the house and the taller height is necessary, because they can jump over the normal height.  I love that they can be easily removed and the mounting hardware is unobtrusive.  The price is right and the gates are easy enough to use.  They are not luxurious, but they are fine for adults and older kids once you are used to them.
B008O816S0|5|I used these on a week long cruise for my 11month old. These worked great! They are big enough to cover a good portion of her front and the pocket is great to get all dropped bits. It secures in the back with sticky tabs that are pretty sticky. I didn't have any problem catching her hair in it or lack of stickiness. I would definitly get these again!
B005VWO8F0|4|The kit is a nice size, the stuff in it is acceptable, the ding for 4 vs 5 stars is the tweezers are useless.  I'd move it to 5 stars if it had NO tweezers, but putting useless tweezers simply so it has the 'tweezers' listed is dishonest.<br /><br />If the manufacturer posted a video on Amazon showing the tweezers in action, successfully for their purpose, I'll change to 5 stars.<br />I'll consider it an instructional video to show me how to use something I find un-useable.
B008SCXC5M|4|excelente
B00NGL1XYC|5|I always prefer giving great quality blankets as shower gifts!  These swaddle blankets did NOT let me down!  Size (check) ... softness (check) ... I can't wait to order a set for myself!  Looking forward to additional fun prints and patterns!
B002V92XAS|5|Bought this since it was cheaper than Babies R Us and even Wal-Mart. Used it for months until we started to have a fly problem. I found maggots in the pail and that pretty much did me in. Now all the poopy diapers go in our large trashcan. I still would recommend this one to a new mom. :)
B00168BBAS|5|I bought these spell our daughters name on her wall above a bunch of butterflies, we like then and they work, I am happy with them.
B00IK6BI0M|5|This is the only diaper cream I use on my baby. It clears up his rash within a day - it's pretty amazing. To prevent diaper rash, I apply it in the evening for his overnight diaper. Plus, it's unscented and made with natural products - something I truly appreciate as a mother of children with sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product to any parent!
B00BH0RRFS|5|Matched my granddaughter's room perfectly.  Good quality.  My daughter was pleased with it as a gift for her and she'll use it for several years as she grows up.
B00CXNUOE4|5|Happy with this chair, hopefully it holds up for awhile!
B00PEJ9JC2|1|Doesn't work most of the time. Takes forever to reconnect. In the mean time I hear the baby wailing. At one point it even stopped sending me notifications. Will have to return it.
B0031KMAJK|4|1) product arrived earlier than expected. Tracking information was kept up.<br />2) product package was a little damaged but product was not damaged during shipping. It was protected well in the box.<br />3) product is as expected. In the bright light it does appear to be a dark cherry, but it is kind of like a chameleon....look at it from a different angle or lighting and it does look espresso. It is a good looking crib.<br />4) all pieces were there. There were a couple very minor flaws in th wood but not worth contacting delta for replacements.<br />) very very easy to put together...by far the easiest piece I've ever put together. I'd still recommend two people to put it together...it literally took 5 minutes.
B00LY31BPK|1|Excellent product but only one sent and not three as presented on the photo.
B0079GMRFY|5|we love this taggie blanket. my almost 18 month old has had it for almost a year now and she loves it! it is her &#34;blankie&#34;, for sure. it has held up well being washed repeatedly too!
B000IUQ46Q|4|I was disappointed when I received this cup holder because at first it didn't fit on my City Select stroller. (the handles were too thick). After reading a review on Amazon that it does fit.. I gave it another chance. I took a penny to the gray end and turned it so that the inner part was inside the black part (you can also turn it so that the inner piece eventually comes out, but that make it too loose). I than placed the pieces around the thinner part of the bar (on the side of the stroller). I took the screws and screwed the piece on. I than tightened the piece again with the penny on the gray end to get a secure/tight fit. It fits perfectly..with no movement! Haven't had a chance to try it out, but I was able to fit various cups in the holder. Happy that I was able to get it to work!! So if you have the Baby Jogger City Select, this cup holder DOES work!
B002X7VDHW|5|I also have the city mini and chose this model for a jogger over the competition because the car seat adapter and parent consoles are compatible.  It was the right move.  I love this stroller!  I was very surprised at how high the quality seemed compared to the city mini, which I was already more than impressed with!  I also love this model because I prefer to walk (you can't jog anyway until they are about 6 months old) and this one will do both walking and jogging comfortably.
B002OC32ZW|2|We bought this car seat on recommendation of friends who had 2 of them for their 2 children.  They liked it because it folded up and had a strap to carry it which is helpful if traveling by air.  We already owned the Britax Marathon and loved it but because of it's bulky nature we thought the SK would be a better choice since we have family all over the country and would need to travel with it. But let me tell you that this seat is a monster.  It is significantly heavier than the Britax Marathon and in the rear-facing position takes up more room.  Even in my Ford Escape, I have no other choice but to put it in the center of the back seat because I would be on top of the steering wheel if I put the seat behind me...and I'm only 5'-4\\"!   We have strongly considered returning it and getting another Britax Marathon but we figured that we only have another year of our child in rear-facing and once we can turn her around at 2yo, it won't be a problem.    Other than that, the seat seems like a good quality with excellent protection.  I will also say that the instructions are pretty poor.  I was tempted to have my 1yo read and explain to us since it seemed like a 1yo wrote them.  And I'm an engineer so...come on!  The Britax instructions were excellent.    Another annoyance with this seat was that all of the accessories are attached nearly permanently to the back of the seat.  So, for instance, we have the tether restraint that now hangs from the back and bangs around.  And this happens in the front seat of the vehicle since we have to have the seat in the center and that means that the back of the seat is practically in the front of the car!    So if you're buying this for the 'ease of travel' aspect.  Don't kid yourself.  We'll be traveling with the Britax on a little wheely cart next time we're going to the airport.
B007ZZCRJ0|2|I bought these hangers for my newborn baby.  They smell like mothballs, which causes the clothes to smell like mothballs.  I ended up throwing all them away.
B0042D69WY|4|Wife is happy that it helps put baby to sleep by soothing him. I wonder if it works by making the baby dizzy.<br />I stood in front of my 2 month old while he was in the swing; he could not recognize me until I shut off the swing.<br />Frankly, I prefer rocking and singing to him myself - baby loves my soothing better! But I am not available all the time :)<br />The swing goes too fast even at the slowest speed. Manufacturer should have added a gear. In the manual, they say to put a blanket on the seat and allow it to drag on the floor and slow it down. This is stupid advice - the blanket will pick up germs from the floor, also it will keep falling off!<br />My Tips:<br />1) get an old trouser belt and loop it around the metal rod that supports the seat. Use the farthest belt notch. The belt loop should be under the seat and at its lowest level. Let the belt drag on the floor.<br />2) When your baby is at pre-crawl stage, you *must* use the harness or she will fall out of the seat!<br /><br />At a deeper level, I suspect I am resentful of it - if it can rock and soothe your baby to sleep, then why would you need a family? Grandpa, Grandma, Daddy, Mummy, Uncle, Aunt... All we have left is to invent a robot that can feed, diaper and rock a baby to sleep. One more step towards the disintegration of the family.<br /><br />Update: I upgraded my review of it to 4 stars. Yes, this swing is necessary for a parent's sanity. However, it should have the gear to make it go slower for lighter babies.
B00S12CKCK|5|our one year old grandson is fasicinated by owls and this little guy was perfect for him. Different textures are great. Hopefully he will love him for years to come!
B00SS8X562|5|What a beautifully made Baltic Amber Teething Necklace! When this first arrived it looked like a dainty little thing but let me tel you it's not. Each bead is individually knotted for safety and comes with a screw clasp.<br /><br />The beads are raw which when they get heated up from your babies skin they release a oil that gets absorbed and helps with all sorts of things including, teething and pain.<br /><br />The raw cherry color is beautiful and is the prefect size for my son. He should be able to wear it for years before we need a larger size. I do recommend taking it off while your baby is in the bath and sleeping. I have wrapped the necklace around my son's ankle a couple times at night so he still gets to wear it while he sleeps.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with my purchase and will be buying another when we need to size up. I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
B003DEDTI0|5|These are amazing and god knew I was going to need these I was decorating my home with these when I found out my dad died, these are very special to me and I have them to read over and over to remind me of gods love, thank you so much!
B002SG7JY4|2|It didnt work for nither the new born nor older kid. It doesnt lean properly, the position is too vertical for younger kids. For older kids, the bucket is not deep enough to hold them comfortably. Some how it never worked, looked nice after assembling but it was a big miss. If you have hard wood floors, the vibrating metal frame could be a big annoyance. But should not have any issues in carpet. Wish they had put in a little bit more thought and field study before releasing the product. Going back to fisher price bouncers.
B00721E920|3|I really liked this in the box.  The colors are adorable and vibrant and I like the idea, but the string used to string the 3 pieces of wood together doesn't work.  They end of being to loose - more so on one side.  We've tried to re-tie them and still one side hangs lower than the other which doesn't give an accurate read and looks silly hanging on the wall.  Disappointing.
B006NTY1HK|5|We have a 10 month old little guy that is currently the size of an 18 month old... He learned to crawl a couple months ago and then quickly learned how to walk around while holding onto couches and coffee tables! Needless to say it is hard to keep up with him when he gets going. We bought this to use on a family vacation where there were kids a little older playing with little Legos etc... We dropped him in here and he was as happy as a clam. It provided enough space for him and an adult to sit and play and was strong enough for him to push on the wall and walk around the perimeter. We actually bought 2 6 panel fences but found 1 was enough. They will hook together though to make a huge play pen if you have the space! Also - storing this is a breeze, it folds up flat and hooks to itself with the included carrying handle (which makes moving easy too by the way).
B002SG773W|5|These bibs are great. They are easy to clean and dry very quickly. We have been very happy with the bibs.
B00PF83RAM|5|I bought these nipples and ended up needing to use them as soon as I got home from the hospital. I was sure glad they were already in my cabinet. The baby enjoys them, and they do not seem to have caused any nipple confusion, as I am breastfeeding as well. The baby still prefers me to the bottle, which I take as a good sign.
B004O6M4M8|5|quality baby matress!
B00H8MSLE0|5|Great product for a very good price. Easy to install.
B00CXVQZSU|1|box from Amazon was not dented but the container paper was in was quite damaged. The paper has NO LAVENDER FRAGRANCE. Highly disappointed. Did not return, my bad!
B005J5RWT8|5|Love this crib! It's beautiful and very sturdy. Bit of a pain to put together, but we are very pleased!
B00A7YR9VM|5|Works beautifully!  Keeps baby warm and out of wind.  Really like the zippers-makes getting baby in and out very easy.
B0038JDVCY|4|The brush is so soft and works great.  My only complaint is the nipple brush seems less effective than the $3 one that comes free in the bottle starter kits.
B003S3RBC6|4|As a new parent, it didn't occur to me that my daughter would use her crib as a teether until it was too late.  I have a Sorelle City Lights crib and the 52x6 fits the front rail perfectly.  I also ordered the short rail pieces, and the end ties are a little short to place the tie where I wanted, so they bunch up a bit.  But the crib is still adequately protected.  My daughter pulls herself up on these constantly, and they've stayed put.    The ends of these guards are velco, so you can pull the pad out and wash the covers only.    My biggest complaint are the strength of the ties.  One ripped in two as I was tying them in place, and I wasn't even pulling very hard.  Obviously, you want a tight tie to keep these in place.  I'm also not looking forward to untying this for cleaning, as the ties were too short to do anything other than a double knot.    But overall they do the job, look nice, and I would recommend them.  I wish I was a sewer, as it is a very simple design and should be easy to make at a fraction of the cost.
B001T7NWOE|5|This toy is so wonderful and every baby should have one. My 14-month-old still loves hers, still chews on it. It's her favorite!
B001WAJVZM|5|I was worried about this because I figured having a cutesy cover would only draw interest and cause more probkems. And it did make my baby more interested in spout but even with all the interest and chewing and pulling and poking...the whale is stuck on and my baby has no bumps from hitting metal. Love it!!
B00DQL6CI4|4|Four stars because I struggle to open the dispenser with one hand sometimes. However, that could be operator error...
B002M77N22|5|I bought this product based on reviews from people I know and the reviews here on Amazon, and I was not disappointed. My baby girl started sleeping through the night the second night home from the hospital. We didn't move her out of the Rock 'n Play til almost 9 months old. She is 11 months now and does wake up once a night several times per week, so I really do attribute the Rock 'n Play to her awesome sleep prior to the move to her crib.<br /><br />I did listen to other reviews about the spot where the head rests being hard, so I bought the Boppy Noggin Nest as some others had suggested and had no issues with flat spots on her head what-so-ever.
B0032G9E0G|3|Fits maybe 3 baby bottles and not much more. Also, the water/ moisture accumulates at the base of the grass and may breed bacteria and mildew.
B000JIHP88|4|My baby definitely likes it! He would watch it and laugh by himself for 20 minutes or even one hour.  While he pays no attention to other music box
B008K3YW1M|5|Extremely easy to assemble! Great quality, some of the other reviews had me a little worried. It is very nice for the price. Shipping was fast! It does not have a lock in place on the rocker. Overall I am very satisfied with this chair.
B00AK4CAJK|2|Not as pictured- Hard to peel- I didn't even finish the tree- After loosing  bird beaks-feet & parts of the tree- Not even worth the price- I gave it to my granddaughter for her card board box craft projects--The ship was prompt- & for safe travel- but the product is very cheap- & not as pictured!<br />I have bought some very good peel off, much more realistic & worth the monies- here on line- This was my first as a first to rate- I rate this product as poor-
B00JU965W4|1|This high chair is a torture! I don't know where to begin. Every single day I wake up & see this high chair & feel like it's waiting right there..waiting to torture me one more day. Who ever designed this had what exactly in mind I've no idea. If your baby never spills ANY food..then this chair is for you, I know such babies don't exist!!! The tray is so bulky & awkward to clean! It has this bulky divider that goes in between the legs which makes keeping the tray on a surface impossible. And cleaning..good lord...it's so annoying. Even a little spit up goes down through the creases & in between the pads just spreading the whole thing to places where you won't imagine. The material of the chair is so bulky and did I mention it's not even machine washable. It never cleans after wiping.. If you use more water to clean it gets wet and I've to dry it out in the sun..which means I've no high chair for that particular day!! The foot rest is also a torture..it is a wonderful place food to spits to get stuck forever unless you have the motivation to remove that foot rest every single time it happens..I'm so annoyed with this I'm buying another chair, please do some favor don't buy this horrible product!!
B00FOL7CF6|5|Very nice quality cradle.
B006I0R6ZI|4|Gave it as a gift.
B00LZKBP4Y|5|My baby usually fusses a lot when I place him in a carrier. He didn't seem to mind the infant insert when I tested it out. It's soft yet firm and has a nice seat for the baby to sit in. I purchased the mesh insert because I read reviews on how hot the regular insert can get. It definitely appears to be very breathable but still sturdy.  UPDATE: used it in an airport and it was great. Baby only got hot in the face pressed on to my chest - not because of the carrier.
B000FT9J3U|5|This crib was a great deal. We share a room with our baby so we needed something smaller but big enough to fit her. This is perfect. It looks great too everyone is surprised when I tell them how much we spent on it. I really like that it has adjustable heights also. When I was moving it into the room I did scratch the side but its a part no one sees...and between it was light enough for me to lift it on my own!
B000JOT2RO|5|My 15-month old is in there throwing-bowls-and-plates-off-the-highchair phase, and these are perfect for that. They stay put and she gives up on throwing it down because she can't get it to unstick from the tray!
B005555LKE|5|This was exactly what I wanted, I can hang it to easily put diapers into, and once there's a few in there, I can stand it on it's own as well. Great product. It also holds back smells amazingly well.
B000I1A7AO|2|Nice that it is not a solid mass so you can bend it and fit into a lunch bag easily.  However, I purchased two a couple months ago and one is already ruined due to two of the compartments leaking out all the fluid.
B000S8O9ME|5|chose this rating because it is so reliable, and very helpful for my daughter<br />who had a major back surgery and i needed some support for her to get in and out of the<br />shower.<br /><br />love it!
B006240OK4|5|Nice bedding set, works like a charm. Good padding for the sides to keep the baby protected from the wood sides.
B004P1ILC4|5|Love this product and so does my son!!!!!
B00008439C|5|Baby sleeps so much better when on vs without it.  Rain on highest volume works for us.
B00DF7JU9M|5|It was delivered on time and the item was as described.
B009RPH5U2|4|I had this going on two weeks now and<br />the mattress is comfortable for my 8 month old. She sleeps good through the night on this mattress. It soft but not so soft that its dangerous.
B000MXQGT4|5|I purchased this highchair over two years ago for my oldest daughter and am now using it for our youngest. It still looks like new.<br /><br />My favorite features:<br />-SUPER easy to wipe off<br />- The fabric cover is machine washable and does not stain (survived carrots and others)<br />- The tray comes apart and the top part is dishwasher safe<br />- it folds up very small and is easy to store<br />- The straps have multiple heights they can be set as<br /><br />This was definitely a great investment.
B002T44LZA|2|This thing is cute and all but just not well built. We aren't sure if it came with the stitching on the side already tore or if it tore from the first use. On the second use my 18 month old while wearing it tore the leg off and walked over and handed it to me. The only other problem that may not be a problem is with where the leash comes of the back pack. It comes off right between the legs. So when you are holding it, it Looks like this little sheep has about 3ft of bragging rights on all of the other sheep and your walking around holding it. Either way though we only needed it for one plane trip out of the country for the airports and it worked for that much.<br />It is soft and it does hold little things such as books or bottles and it does work as a decent harness, but don't count on it lasting long.
B006I0R3G0|5|I absolutely love this cup since there are no extra parts!  If you are looking into this cup then you know that most spill-proof cups have the extra piece on the inside, this one only has the lid and the cup and it is true to its description, it does not leak!  It is a bit smaller than I would like it to be, but for not having to put up with extra pieces, it's perfect! Both my one year old and 3 year old have no problems drinking from cup either.
B004EPYQI4|5|bought this stroller for a friend, she loves it.
B0036QV93C|5|They are slightly narrow so it is not 100 percent effective, however, they certainly make things a bit easier. Nice and soft and only the wet stuff finds its way through them!
B0001BUKA8|5|It makes cleaning so much easier. It's also smaller so it takes up less room, which is important to me since I store all my pump parts in my Medela Pump in Style Advanced Backpack. I love these breastshields and will continue to buy them since they are such a good price.
B00NFUJQFW|5|Was just as described, shipped quickly, no problems. Will order again.
B005WG27K8|5|Easy to use and does its job! Very happy with it. I use it when I have my little guy with me when I go pick my bigger guy up from school. We have a pricey carriage and this adds some added protection.
B0051TZ3EI|1|these did not stay on my daughters hands at all. When the opening was tight enough to stay on, her hands have already outgrown the mittens. I think they need to redesign these mittens. I bought them because I needed a filler to make the $35 free shipping purchase. Will not buy again
B005JHH1VK|5|This stroller was perfect for a trip my family and I took recently.  We were looking for something more durable than the cheap umbrella strollers.  This one was a little pricey, but well worth it.  It is not in our car at all times, very light, easy to carry and works great.
B00BLY1L84|4|We got this mattress after trying out two other mattresses for our Babyletto Grayson Mini-Crib. This was by far the best. It is very, very firm, which is what we were looking for. It fits the Babyletto Grayson perfectly -- it's really tight on the corners and sides.<br /><br />I really like this mattress, but I only gave it 4 stars because what is pictured is not what was delivered.<br /><br />First, the description of this mattress is not correct. It is not 55&#34;. I think that was meant to say 5&#34; thick. Even the tag on the mattress has the wrong dimensions. But it does fit snugly in the mini-crib, which is all I wanted.<br /><br />Also, the mattress I got was not green, it was white. And there were not different firmness levels on each side.  It was the same (super firm) on both sides.<br /><br />Also, the mattress does not come with any indication of what model number it is.<br /><br />So, I'm not really sure what got delivered to me. It's definitely not what I ordered. However, it is really great mattress for the Grayson.<br /><br />I am having sheet issues, however. The ABC Baby mini-crib sheets do not fit -- they are too short on the sides (i.e. not deep enough) although the ABC Baby fitted mattress pad fits perfectly.
B00BI2VZ80|5|This cup is amazing. It's the first cup my daughter would hold up herself (She's 13M). I suspect the flow is also a little faster, which she likes. It's easy to clean, which I love. Since starting with this cup, her milk intake at daycare went from 6oz to 12-14 oz per day. My only beef is that the lid only fits one way (need to line up the ridges), which means the silicone spout has to be adjusted so it will line up correctly, too. It's not a big deal, but seems like the lid could have been designed better.
B004OBZLUA|5|very handy and packs away nice.  Would be great if it came with its own bag
B00003TL7P|5|I bought this pail before my son was born. First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it. I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.<BR> I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy.
B00P4TO4F4|5|I received this wonderful product a day earlier than expected. Awesome. Upon opening it, I immediately could tell that this is a quality item. Very sturdy and beautiful. Customer service is top notch. Can't wait to see if it works for my little one when else starts teething. Will update.
B00005LLV5|4|My son loves watching the ball roll around this tower.  I'm glad there is a toy he likes that doesn't require batteries.  The only thing is that the tower seems to come apart easily (when my son picks the tower up from the top and tries to move it).  It is easy enough to put back together, though.
B004J4VY44|4|Lovely fits into my microwave conveniently...
B0050P2PC6|4|Well made but a little small. A standard size folder or standard size papers do not fit inside it without getting \\"dog eared.\\" It is good for carrying small toys or games but not for school.
B00009YP2Q|5|Although the store we bought this at did have the all white on display, we were not disappointed with this bassinet in any way... and I actually like the tan color in the cover! My daughter has been using this bassinet since we brought her home from the hospital. The bassinet is the perfect height next to our bed in order to take her in and out for middle of the night feedings. The sheets are easily taken off and put back on for cleaning. My husband said it was VERY easily assembled. And I love the little bag underneath to put extra blankets in. I'd highly reccomend this bassinet for anyone!
B0061RHFKE|5|It is a great product, the only one that works, every parent should buy it and the price is great too
B004HMUIN6|5|Nice!
B002UXQRES|5|A go-to. Thanks!
B00A2CR1AI|5|This was a great purchase. It's just what I was searching for. It works great in my 4 year Olds room. Major plus it comes assembled!  The quality is also great!  Update 2-22-16 The dresser drawers aren't opening smooth anymore and rails are grinding.
B00KBGTRAC|5|Great play yard. Sets up easily and stores just the same. Very well designed and constructed. Some folding items are tough to get back in the bag but this has no problems. It's designed to be portable but is sturdy enough for regular use. Some tips if you buy one. Flip the thing upside down when setting up and taking down. This is much easier than crawling around on your hands and knees to mess with the straps and the yard is light enough to flip over again for use. Once you get the leg straps adjusted just leave them snapped. The strap loop slides on and off the legs easily for storage. This is a full size yard with plenty of room and I like that it has a bottom to keep the little guy of the floor or carpet. Most hard yards don't.<br />Good luck and I hope you like it.
B004FN0Z8K|5|This is the 3rd First Years True Fit convertible carseat we have bought.  We have bought one for each of our grandchildren as they have outgrown their infant carriers.  Their parents love them and so do our grandkids.  They especially like the ease of adjusting the straps as the children grow.  Excellent product.
B00QD1K01E|5|Exactly what I hoped for! Soft and a perfect ft!
B0011MOVOW|5|Easy to assemble, just takes a few minutes. Comes with the tool needed to assemble. Quick delivery...beautiful bassinet :) love the wood that matches all the other furniture i have..the green makes it neutral in case my next baby is a boy.. plays music, glides, and womb sounds..AWESOME!!! Also, has wheels (although it weighs a little more than expected) on one side that makes it easier to move :) Canopy is beautiful and can be pushed back too..One of the major things i like about it is its pretty tall..so when my little baby arrives i wont have to bend over to put her in there...saves my back some stress :)LOVE IT!
B000JJK9EY|5|I can't remember when I first saw one of these but I know I saw them somewhere before I had kids.  So I put it in the back of my mind because I thought it was cool and figured that I would leave it at that.  Well few years down the road (On Thanksgiving day in 2009) I ended up having a little girl.  It just so happens that both of my sisters live with their significant others in Arizona.  I wanted to make a trip out to see them because my one sister just had a little girl herself and I didn't meet her in person yet.  So because my (at the time) 7 month old was so young, she flies for free for the first 2 years.  So I bought tickets and she was coming with me.  Then a week or so before I left I remembered seeing those little rolly cart things for the car seats.  I did a Google search and found that Amazon.com had them.  They are a little on the pricey side but I tell you, that is my only complaint about the product.  It easily hooked up with the car seat I was using and stayed on the whole time (except when we actually had to put her in the car).  It had to be the best money I had spent for the trip because I didn't have to check in a single thing!  I backed everything in a wheely backback that was considered carry on bag and then the car seat got turned into a stroller so that got stowed under that plan and I just had to wait for them to bring them up.  It was the best set up ever and I highly recomend getting one for your child if you are going to be making a lot of plane trips.  It's great and worked out perfectly for me.
B003ZWBV5S|4|This is adorable but unfortunately doesn't keep my daughters attention (she is 5 months)
B0033C4YMM|5|Served its purpose!
B0043C5XYY|5|Excellent product, incredibly soft!
B00SQ70NHY|5|The best, bar none, diaper rash cream.  Paladin is mfg in my hometown, Rockford, IL. Now we are in CA and mail order it for $33 for 6 - 2 oz jars. When my son was in the hospital for GI problems, we only allowed the hospital staff to use Paladin. It works immediately.  It was invented by the father of a high school friend back in the 70's.
B004IEBP30|5|Nice seat! It works very well. My son likes it!
B001EX81ZI|4|Great idea for storing milk or homemade baby food!
B00INGNYXS|5|Very easy to install and stays firmly mounted. Visibility is great.
B005HYGTYK|5|Great product, my daughter now looks for the hand in a parking lot!  Very helpful when having both kids with me and trying to get an infant in the car.
B004EQ8U8A|2|Super cute... miserable quality.<br />The snaps are some of the cheapest weakest snaps I've ever seen.  I had to take a hammer and a pair of pliers to them to tighten them up a bit.  There are also very few snaps.  I think there are 4 or 5 from neck to foot.
B00Y8ION80|5|These are cute and practical.  Gives the baby something cuddly to hold on to when using the pacifier.
B00CJ2OWUG|4|Love these covers. Only problem I came across was the microfiber inserts that come with them. My daughter needed more absorbance. Also had to wash the inserts about 5 times to finally absorb right. Covers are cute and worth it. Giving 4 stars just because of the inserts. But if you get other inserts or your lo isn't a big wetter then you will be fine.
B001PTGPTK|1|I bought this at Target - it's totally worthless with my elongated toilet seats because it's so slippery. I have to hold it with 2 hands while my son gets on and off. The other potty seat we have has rubber edges to prevent this.
B0000E0QA4|1|Whoever approved this finished product probably does not have children and needs to be fired!!  I have never heard noises come out of a machine like this one.  Its like it is possessed! I live in a house in the suburbs.  If you have neighbors with a foul mouth, your child will have a new found vocabulary via this monitor!  Just like another customer said, \\"The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because 0 is not available.\\" <br /> <br />This needs to be discontinued as soon as possible.
B000ROKDC4|3|Just use a little caution when ordering this.  I thought it was going to be a blue pacifier and a green pacifier, with a possible color variation.  Well, the blue one is really pink. Not quite the variation I expected.
B00BNEBL6E|5|I moved my daughter into using this bathtub when she got too big for plastic countertop tuba and could finally sit up. Makes for a nice inexpensive transition.
B00AHVR708|4|Decent chair. The metal rods are somewhat hard to install.
B00FRKAI9Q|5|These are great hats.  Work great for adults and kids. Lightweight. Not hot. Excellent sun protection. Very cute to boot!
B001134IK8|4|Pros:  This one goes together easily.  It folds up very simply and pops right back into place for using.  At 16 lbs. it rocks my daughter gently with two power options left for her growth.  The seat is angled nicely so that she sits up enough to see the toy bar but reclines enough to fall asleep.  The straps are engineered nicely to hold her in place.  The buckle is simple, easy on the fingers, and has a nice cloth cover.  The music is groovy, soothing, and just the right volume.  It is lightweight.  It is colorful and fun.      Cons:  When folded it is 23\\"x27\\"x9\\".  We use duffels when flying for extended periods.  At 27\\" on one side, this will not easily fit in a standard sized duffel and maintain the duffel's shape. For new parents: my experience is that if the swing is angled into a duffel so that the edges are the widest protrusion of the bag (even with clothing, etc. packed around it to fill the bag,) damage will occur to the protruding part of the swing during transport to, from, and within the plane.  Be aware of this if a swing is essential to your baby's sanity (and yours) during your trip.  Tip: We have a padded car seat backpack and it would fit in there pretty well if you're willing to pack your clothes in that.  Sure, its not chic and its not comfortable to carry, but it is an option.    It would be great for going to Grandmother's or Hilton Head in the SUV with only 4 seats up, but it will not fit in the trunk of a sedan with a full size stroller, luggage for four, and all the other stuff.  For a sedan, it will probably have to go behind the front seats.
B000QJX8G8|5|Purchased this for newborn.  After raising 4 sons I know the value of<br />a coverup. Was well received by the new mom.
B004VL2VRY|1|We registered for this product and got it as a gift.  Within 5 months we had to return it because the battery would no longer charge.  They do not make a replacement battery for this product.  It was under warranty, so Motorola did replace the entire monitor system.  Now, at 11 months, it will only charge if you rig the cord with tape.  It seems like there is a bad connection within the monitor.  They are replacing it again, but this product does not last.  You shouldn't have to replace it twice in one year!
B00MV41GWY|2|Very thin product. So you have to get a new one often. Not what I expected, but cheap.
B001BPZHQ0|5|I was a little hesitant to buy it since some reviewers said that you have to take it off to operate shower valve. I got it anyway because we are not using shower in that bathroom. To my surprise you CAN actually operate the shower without taking it off. It's a little tricky but you just need to grab the valve where bubbles are (between Elmo’s legs and head) and just pull it up, to close- just push down.
B000GE9XIA|5|My wife has been doing daycare at our house for over 20 years and we have tried every gate out there, so believe me when I say  that this is the best gate you will find. One handed operation and very easy to remove or attach. We remove them on the weekends. Their customer service is one of the best, We needed to replace one broken wall 'hinge' and when I called I got right through and they sent me 4 of them for free. We had had the gate for over three years at this point. If you want good quality and ease  of operation you found it.
B00L726M34|5|Baby loves playing with the beads, especially while nursing.
B00GSJRSSE|5|I love the jungle design combined with the letters and numbers. Plus, I like that this set does not come with a bumper, as they are not considered safe for a baby's crib...I would have felt like I was wasting money to buy a set with a bumper and then not be able to use it anyways. The color combination is great for a little girl's nursery, and all of the different animals give you a lot of options for accent colors (gray elephant, yellow giraffe, brown monkey, etc.) depending on what other nursery pieces you would like.<br /><br />One word of caution: The set is pretty durable and well-made overall, but when I dried the dust ruffle the mesh fabric (the part that goes under the mattress) fused together and ripped. I had set it on 'tumble dry low' as instructed, but because I have an older dryer it must have gotten too hot for the mesh material. Lambs & Ivy was great about sending me a replacement part when I contacted them about the defect -- but now I know to air-dry the piece in the future.
B003CUSQWE|5|Fit perfectly in the home made cradle that was made!!
B003Y732I8|5|I bought these utensils to go with the plate and bowl set I bought for my niece for her birthday. I didn't open the package, but when I received them they were super cute & bpa free, not to mention a great price for the 3 of them together! I recommend!
B005J9DEH8|5|after being disappointed from other uniform companies sizing inconsistencies I finally found a true to size shorts with quality workmanship.
B00G5K3CHM|2|I love this stroller. It was a gift in 2012 and the style looks the same as this 2014 model. It's looks really nice with the medal frame. Really easy to maneuver with one hand. The only downfall is I used it for my second child in 2015 and the buckle got stuck and we had to get my daughter out with the buckle still attached so now we can't use it because the buckle is stuck...so sad
B00EHWU5T8|5|I am loving these organizing bags!  I had heard of them awhile back, but I thought they were too expensive.  I ended up buying some clear plastic toiletry bags from the Container Store at $6 a pop.  I had one for snacks, one for toys, and one for first aid supplies.  That system worked well enough for me, but the downside was that I didn't know which bag was which without taking it out first.<br /><br />I decided to splurge and buy these as a shower gift for a friend and fill each bag with goodies.  After I received the bags for my friend, I had to get them for myself.  I'm so glad I did.  I transferred everything from the old toiletry bags into the Sugar Snap bags and my diaper bag is actually slimmer and lighter now!!  I love the tabs at the top, so I know which bag is which.  I like how, if I were to switch diaper bags, I could just take the Sugar Snap bags out of one bag and put it in the other.<br /><br />Even my husband loves it!  He told me he was showing them off to his friends who just had a baby.<br /><br />I've only had these for a week, so I can't speak to longevity.  I'll try to update once I've used them for awhile.
B0029WVSEE|4|The bra is so comfortable! I like to have some support but I've tried several other nursing bras that become very uncomfortable after several hours. This bra is comfy all day! My only complaints are that after several uses of the nursing or pumping snaps, the bra slowly loosens over the day and it runs slightly large. Overall, I would highly recommend this bra!
B0018JWAF0|5|These were the BEST bottles. When my daughter was born, I used some cheap, regular bottles. Then I was told to try these. They were AWESOME! A little more to clean, but WELL worth the extra time! Will be using these again!
B002UHJDFO|5|This travel seat is perfect for shopping carts or high chairs.  I just couldn't see myself buying the typical ones that are ENORMOUS.  I have enough things to carry!  This is a great price and easy to carry around.
B00HPQTAZS|5|Theses bibs are fantastic,they work well, are big enough and even the velcro is strong. I am surprised  that they have not tried to take them off like they do with their other bibs. I usually have to tie them and then fasten them. I am thinking that they want to wear them cause they love mickey and minnie mouse. They seem so content wearing them and they must be comfortable also, very happy with this purchase.
B00620UNEA|5|Delivery was fine and this product is something I use everyday because my kitty likes to lay on various pieces of furniture.
B00BGPHC9U|2|loved this so much and its super cute but takes batteries....  and theres no plug in adapter option. bummer. :(
B0016M0ZO2|5|I love this cover!  It adds some softness and warmth to the cold, plastic and waterproof changing pad.  I've washed it many times over the last year and it has held up well.  I love the little slits in the side to thread the safety belt through!  I didn't notice those until a few months ago and thought I'd mention it in case others hadn't noticed either!
B005GMCZ50|4|The pros - the art work. I believe it is screened on to the wood and it looks just as good as the picture.  The wood grain shows through giving it a nice texture.  I couldn't bring myself to buy a chart with a child's design. This chart is for me to keep after my boys have grown. I plan to hang it in some discreet corner of the house.  There will be a day when Thomas, Pooh and Tow Mater don't decorate my house and this will fit into that future house a lot better then a primary colored giraffe.  The cons - it's too short!  This is my bad for not reading the product dimensions which clearly say 44\\".  These are made from plywood sheets which are usually 4' x 8'. So I understand that to make it longer would mean getting 4 charts per sheet instead of 8. That said it would have been nice to have the option. If I'm planning to keep this forever then I don't mind paying more to get what I want. Now I'm faced with the dilemma of how to hang it.  I wanted to chart from birth but I sincerely hope my sons grow taller than 5.2!  So I will have to start at 2.5' instead and hope they don't grow taller than 6.2.  As I said this is made from a sheet of 1/2 inch Baltic birch plywood, which is very good quality.  However, when I first pulled it out it felt unfinished to me. The cuts have been sealed with a clear coat so the layers of plywood are clearly visible. I thought it wood be framed somehow.  Barring that the sides should be stained black so the plywood cuts aren't popping out at you. Also, I think a 1/4 inch would have been better. I was expecting something a little bendable. This is going on the wall it does need to be quite so sturdy.  I think there is room for improvement but given the choice of everything out there I would still buy this one. Their website has a few different options (some taller) that are not posted on Amazon.
B003Z6AO7U|5|In reply to Descrstn- how dare you use a review site to shame other parents! Has it ever occurred to you that maybe a very loving family, who holds and loves their baby, and even practices baby wearing might need this product occasionally? I just described my family- I wear my baby all day and hold him for every feeding possible, but our other son has special needs and we drive an hour or more each day to his therapy, and then drive back. Shame on you for judging me and anyone else who may need this product. You have NO IDEA what other parents are going through.
B005C9ODBQ|1|I agree with other reviewers, must have a cart cover! Bu this is not the one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just like another reviewer stated, the seam came apart with the first wash on the side. I used it again with the \\"rip\\". After the 2nd wash, the other side seam began to come undone.<br /><br />In addition, the cover appears to have cushioning in the picture. Just be aware it does not. It's just 2-ply cloth sown together.<br /><br />Very low quality cart cover.
B000RFCSMQ|5|I was sick and tired of sloshing water around in my son's bottle, desperately TRYING to get the fatty milk residue out. I tried the cheap $1 baby brushes (the ones that are all bristles and the nipple cleaning brush kept going in on itself) and all that did was make it ever more apparent that there was STILL milk residue in the bottle. I've let them soak in hot soap water, nothing. I've steamed clean them, again nothing. I was going bats*** crazy over the fact that the bottles that I pump my son's food into were NOT clean after 2 washes. Read online that the spongey bottle brush would help take care of that, so I bought it. THANK GOD I DID. Not even 3 seconds after using the brush, my bottles were SPOTLESS. I was SO happy over that fact that I did ALL the bottles (it was JUST THAT EASY!) Even when the sponge deteriorates, I will keep buying Munchkin bottle brush.<br /><br />As a side note: The detachable nipple brush isn't as impressive as the bottle cleaner. Then again, I didn't buy it to clean nipples as I already have a nipple brush I like.
B008X3WDM4|5|beutiful
B00113ALAO|4|i love that you can bounce this product ad well as vibrate it. my older son likes to help bounce his little brother. i can have it by the computer and use my foot to keep the little guy happy. i'm very pleased with it.
B003HS5JN0|4|We purchased this backpack for my 18 month sized 3 year old when she started pre-school. We have owned it about 5 months and it has held up great. It does get dirty because it is yellow, but I spray some de-greaser on and throw it in the washer and it comes out like new.<br />It is a bit too small to fit a full sized sheet of paper in without wrinkling the corners, but her teachers just fold her papers in half. It is perfect for what we needed because she could literally almost fit inside a full sized backpack, so there is no way she would be able to carry one.<br />The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had a clip on the straps. It is obviously made for little kids, so it seems like there should be a way to secure it on them.
B000BD6M1M|5|Only bib you'll need. Keeps food off the floor.
B000IDSLOG|5|I wasn't sure what the big deal about Sophie was, but all my mama friends told me I had to have one for my son, so I got one. And it's true! Sophie is loved instantly! My 6 month old son immediately grabbed onto her and started chewing everyone, drooling, and smiling. I don't know what it is (she is cute), but the hype is true: Sophie will quickly become one of your child's top favorite toys!
B001TWI81G|5|Great to throw in your lunch bag to keep things cold. Works great, no leaks.
B00CSAWIOQ|5|I have bought several of these chairs. They are lightweight, easy to install, and perfect for brining out for dinner. Would be excellent for a family with limited space for a highchair. This promotes the child being part of the family as they can sit right at the table with everybody else. I think everybody should have one of these! Also great for camping and at grandma's house!
B005P0KNZW|5|I bought the \\"Boob-ease\\" therapy pillows to use on my nipples for pain relief from Raynaud's disease of the nipple, which happens when your nipples get cold, white, loose blood circulation, and start burning with sharp pain. This can happen during pregnancy, and especially during breast feeding. After 40 seconds in the microwave, these pillows stay warm in my bra for at least a half hour and completely relieve the pain from Raynaud's, returning my nipple to its normal color. I would recommend this product to anyone with Raynaud's issues. These pillows are large (as round as a large grapefruit) and will fully cover up to a D cup breast size, though they might be a bit small for someone more well-endowed. They are expensive, but worth the money, and mine came with a free pair of Bamboobies heart shaped breast pads.
B004LKS0H0|1|This co-sleeper was great at first when our son just came home from the hospital.  But as soon as he was old enough to wiggle, we would wake up to find that he had wiggled completely off the co-sleeper and onto our bed.  More than once we found him  almost under a pillow or almost under me or my husband.  It was really scary.  We ended up making our own little home-made barrier near the foot of the sleeper so that he couldn't wiggle out.  That worked for a short time, but because the mattress of the sleeper is so short, he ended up growing out of the sleeper altogether very quickly.<br /><br />Our son is now in a toddler bed in his own room and we are expecting our 2nd little one. Since we loved the ease, closeness and security of a 'family bed', we are going to do it again.  This co-sleeper will not be making an encore appearance with us, however.  Our bedroom is very small- we don't have room for the type of co-sleeper that attaches to the side of the parents' bed, nor do we really even have room for a stand-alone bassinet, so I am looking at the Summer Infant Rest Assured Sleeper (which I found on the BRU website for almost half the price it is on here.)  The mattress appears to fit the entire length of that sleeper and it has a safety barrier that goes all the way around---- looks like that model addresses both of the problems we had with the Baby Delight Snuggle Nest.
B00NNLIAA0|4|Okay let me just start by saying I don't usually write reviews, but I'm sure ladies that an honest upfront one would be appreciated. At first I purchased these because I wanted to help the environment and I had seen some good reviews on youtube of similiar products. I washed these before use and put them on tumble dry I recommend that you DONT do that. It doesn't dry them well at all and I had to put them back on my normal high settings to get 'em dry. The first few days wearing them I thought I had made a mistake as I saw nothing really to differiante them from plastic pads. They were not more comfie. Then when I had my first months period while I had them already I threw them in the washing machine and let cold water fill up then left them there to soak for a bit before washing, which I recommend, and the utter CONVIENCE of them is worth it. My first reaction as I'm sure every woman's is is &#34;Do I have enough pads, and how much money do I need to go buy some and how SOON??&#34; But since I had my pads I was able to just throw them in the wash and there I was already to go, on the comfort level side it was waaay more comfy cause I guess my body got used to it but yea love these. The only thing is figuring out when I need to change them since the feel is different from reg pads. For me it was usually a smell, and a negative part is these can somewhat easily move around while sitting and scooting around. Some multiple button options for a tighter fit would be nice. All in all they are hella convient and super nice that I can have personalized pads just for me. Now I just need to buy a few more sets and I'll be good to go for a good while I'm sure until these need to be replaced since they're cloth. And last thing is you can't really get all the blood out, but most of it comes out so that's good. :)
B000LPZTQY|5|Very good!
B008ESTNVC|4|Got 2 of these clips. I like them to prevent losing the pacifier. Only thing I don't like is that after washing/baby drool the metal part is starting to rust (this is after only 5 month use). Hopefully they will last until she no longer wants a pacifier.
B004JU0H7I|1|This pad is hard as a rock. There's no way I would let my son sleep on this thing. Waste of money.
B0077M41Z4|5|I was looking for brushes for my smoothie straws, Starbucks cold cup straws  and my son’s various sippy/straw cups. I looked at a few sets and the various brushes they came with and this one seemed like it had a good variety and the price was great. Here’s how they work on our various straws and cups:<br /><br />-Sippy cup parts: I use all the brushes for sippy cups. My son prefers straw type cups. Nuby Flip It cups and Nuby Gator Grip cups are his two favorite. I was always hesitant to put milk in there because I was worried about cleaning all the straws, cracks, crevices and holes. I used easier the clean Tommee Tippee cups for milk even though he hates them. These brush set gets all the areas on his favorite cups easily. The brushes go through the straws and valves with ease, making me happy knowing they are scrubbed well. They also work great for my Medela breast pump valves and connectors.<br />-Starbucks venti straw: The straw brushes work great on these reusable straws. These aren't long enough to get the whole inside of the straw, there’s about a ½” area in the middle that they don’t touch, but that’s no big deal. I’m happy that I can finally clean them at all.<br />-Larger smoothie straws: I don’t know why I didn't think of looking online for straw/sippy cup brushes earlier. I drink about 4-5 smoothies a week and if I don’t rinse my straw out right after I’m done there’s fruit pulp residue that builds up. I have thrown away quite a few smoothie straws because of this. The straw brush in this set was actually too small of a diameter to clean my smooth straws, but the valve brush worked perfectly! I gave all my straws a thorough scrubbing and they look as good as new.<br /><br />The straw brushes are longer and the bristles are pretty firm. The valve brush is a wider diameter and has slightly softer bristles and the spout brush is the widest with softer bristles as well. I don’t adhere to what part the brush says it’s made for, I just use the best on for the job. It is handy how the bases are different colors, have the type of brush it is written on it and stands up. I initially wanted a set that was all attached by a ring, like the OXO, but then realized that might get annoying having to take the various brushes on and off or having them dangle around when trying to clean a part. The only improvement that could be made is more bristles on the end of the brushes. The price of about $4 and how well they function of these makes them a product “I love”.job.

B00171WXII|5|Best way to clear baby nose. I make it a little game so that baby laughs and that way I can use it without the baby being upset and crying.
B000056J6Q|4|I think this wedge is great especially since my babys nose gets stuffy during the night. If he wasn't so squirmy he probably wouldn't slip off of it. I put a blanket over it so it's not as slippery.
B000IDSLOG|4|As expected, but our daughter never really took to it like some parents say their kids do.
B00C3ERV30|5|I love them and my daughter does too.
B000O7WOEY|5|Ordered 2 of the sheets and both are good quality material and washes and dries up great.  Would recommend it
B008K47U06|5|Bought this tank to use at work.  I couldn't get my usual pumped amount when I returned to work because I felt so uncomfortable sitting in my office in just a pumping bra. This tank not only allows me to nurse my LO easily before I leave in the morning, but keeps me covered when I pump! I love the long coverage and full support of the tank - I'm not a small girl and my job entails running around after kids all day. This tank has enough support for my now F+ girls that I don't have to wear another bra along with if! Love!!!
B000I0VM7C|4|I used this diaper bag for the first several months after having my son. I soon realized that I needed a bag with a zipper top and now have a backpack type diaper bag. This bag is very well made, nice cushioning on the changing pad and loved the design. It has lots of pockets and is very handy.
B008TWGMDA|1|I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this. It is now just an expensive bath toy. It doesn't stay on the spout on its own, and even if it did, my baby just pulls it off as soon as she gets in the tub. Don't buy it!
B00AWLZDYU|5|Great milk storage bags. Seal easily and very well!
B003XMWF2S|4|These are great for kids under 2. They're metal so they don't bend or break but they're small enough for them to handle. The only reason I say &#34;under 2&#34; is because the fork is no more than a spork. Not pointy enough to really grab anything that one would need a fork for. It just frustrated my daughter. But I guess she was just ready for a real &#34;big girl&#34; set. Overall, though, awesome!
B0009PAN7Q|5|Favorite toilet training accessory. It's easier to put on and off, has a little handle to hang somewhere out of the way, wipes down easily, fits on every toilet we have tried it on, and is adjustable to be quite tight onto a seat if that is desired.
B000098XG2|5|I am suprised at how low a rating these covers are recieving because we have used ours now for almost 16 months without a spare or replacement and it's in fantastic shape!!  When I first purchased it, I only bought one because I wanted to see how it worked - now, 16 months later, I have never used another brand and never even needed to buy a second one because this one has been just perfect for our needs!  I wash it every two days and it still has great color and shape with no wear, fading or unraveling!  It's a very nice terry material that is absorbent and comfy, no other contoured cover beats this one!  I feel very proud of the way it compliments my daughter's nursery as it is beautiful in every way!  I give this cover 5 stars because it is extremely attractive and fantastic in quality.  If you are having trouble with yours, I would recommend either returning it or buying a second one.  After all, it is a *diaper* changing cover - if yours gets quite a beating, it's not a bad idea to replace it every once in awhile.  :)
B000RRH5GS|5|A very sturdy toddler swing, well made. Two sets of leg holes allow you to face the child in either direction. Swinging is a great way to get a fussy child that needs a nap to go to sleep!
B0090OM1F4|5|excellent product
B00005BYUR|5|My daughter is three weeks and I absolutely love this bottle. She doesn't get colic and she rarely spits up when useing this bottle. My husband and I have tried the evenflo bottles and she spits up more with them, then she does with the  Dr. Brown bottles. There priced high but well worth it.
B00B1F4FYA|1|What a hunk of junk. It's extremely flimsy and too hard to pry the mouth open. Ours is now in the bath tub as a toy. Do not buy this junky product.
B00A4K8FX0|5|We just brought our little guy home from the hospital so we haven't had a chance to use the monitor much yet. However, we've tested it out and the picture is much more clear than the other monitors we've seen. We are very pleased with our purchase. The only thing we were disappointed about is that if we mount it too high up, it seems like it may be inconvenient because I don't think you can turn the actual camera or night light on/off from the monitor. Maybe someone knows if this is possible?
B000GK5XY2|5|I put ice in these for teething. Great product.
B000I6MWRK|2|Just want to let everyone know that this system is not very useful. It does work, but the cameras are extremely hard to get pointed in exactly the right spot. I have a houseful of kids and these little and light cameras need to be very finely pointed in exactly the right spot in order to see baby. They can move very easily, and the cords are not long enough. They should really only be purchasd for people who always have baby sleeping in exactly the same spot. Also, the receiving monior (screen) goes black after about 30 seconds and keeps doing this to save battery power. This makes it so you can't simply get some work done while glancing at the screen every so often, because it is ALWAYS black until you hit the button. This renders the product almost pointless. I have gone back to using my cheapo sound monitor because it is so easy to set up, and so easy to deal with in general. At least I can get some stuff done while the baby is sleeping without waisting 2/3rds of the time setting up the camera just right and constantly hitting the monitor button to check on baby. That's enought to get someone really uptight!!
B00B98DUVI|5|It's wonderfull and also light
B00KGEO7MM|5|Thanks!
B0012LXZ4O|4|These are my second batch of bibs. I like the fact that these are very cheap, so they can be very well used and abused (i.e. containing baby spills, wash in washingg machine, endure baby's play). I like to change my daughter's bib at every meal, so these are great to keep her dry.
B008ED6TFU|5|After looking for a bumper sticker for my vehicle stating I have two sons, I am glad I found this sticker!
B000083GHY|5|We just bought a new SUV and didn't want the seats looking like the ones in our old SUV.  When I went to clean the car to be traded in, I about fell over.....and I just cleaned it not that long ago.  There were crumbs all over, spots on the seat, and the depressions that car seats leave on your interior are not very nice to look at.  We eat a lot on the run to extra curricular activities so not eating in the new vehicle is pretty much out of the question.  We installed this protector with no problems.  It fit perfectly and actually the booster seat does NOT slide as much as it did before we bought the protector.  The LATCH works great with it, so does a seatbelt.  I'm getting ready to buy another one when the baby arrives next month!!!
B0038KXMP4|5|Nice quality and colors - the blue color is a bit more dull than what we thought it would be but we really like the color combination.
B004S1YQNY|4|This is super cute and fits in my nursery great. I just think it is a little pricey-  but anything with the name Dr. Seuss on it always is.
B006WSLMTC|5|I wanted to keep the twin girls nursery simple and the letters are perfect! I wish they came with hardware though.
B003FGWA8G|5|No static. Love the night light. Good reception. Battery stays charged for at least eight hours. Very happy with this monitor.
B007AF1KRU|5|Great set
B00D8LSR8U|1|The only thing I like about this diaper is the print. It's really cute (except the logo is unnecessarily large). Other than that, the diaper is awful. For some reason it only came with one insert, but even with another added it still leaks. The outside fabric is stiff and looks big and lumpy under clothes. The snaps are very difficult. The inside is very soft, put pilled after about 10 washes.
B0038JDTTO|3|I like that the handles are removable.  I don't like that the &#34;no spill&#34; stopper in the lid comes off and is floating around inside the cup when my little one bangs the cup on his high chair or throws it on the ground.  Sometimes I don't realize it, and find a puddle of milk on the floor.
B009ZU3XYQ|5|These suckers have saved me a million times over! We had a 10lbs 23&#34; baby that couldn't be swaddled by standard sized receiving blankets so we got some of these in hope they could do the job. Not only are they soft, durable, and the perfect size?! But they're way affordable too!!! One of our best purchases yet!
B0014A0W9E|5|I put several Trend Lab fitted crib sheets on my baby registration. I haven't opened this one yet but cotton is cotton and I think it'll fit perfectly just like the Trend Lab Dr. Seuss one.  Love this pattern.
B005XMCBDY|1|I was looking forward to receiving this but unfortunately it was awful. It would not curl the way it does in the picture, rather it was flat. While it did protect the corners, the flat sides did not grip the table at all and just hung there loosely, blocking me from opening the drawers below. I have a rectangular table with a 174&#34; circumference so the medium should have fit perfectly.<br /><br />Not sure if this one was defective or not but I am not willing to try another.
B00D15NFYO|5|My daughter got this as an Easter present. She LOVES this bunny. It came seperate a from the blanket, but it's the perfect size for her to tote around. She is 15months old. I had to buy a new one off amazon after she lost it at the mall!
B005UV0UEA|5|We bought it for somebody else gift.<br />It looks cute but didn't have a chance to see when it's unpacked yet.<br />I used to have the Graco Play pen before.<br />It's very handy to have for baby.
B00190NAVG|5|[[VIDEOID:38297871]] After listening to several parents you learn that babies either love or hate swings. I am happy to say that our little girl \\"Loves\\" this swing! In terms of features I am not of anything that I would add - it seems to have everything that you would want!<br /><br />Things we like<br /><br />- 6 speed/heights for the automatic swing - the higher levels seem to be ideal for getting out baby to sleep while the lower settings help keep her asleep.<br />- Various sounds - nature sounds (which admittedly are not the greatest), the \\"heartbeat\\" sound, and our favorite a nice selection of classical music<br />- Seat has two vibration settings<br />- Nice little mobile for small eyes to stare at!<br />- The seat has multiple settings for reclining<br />- Nice weight rating so you can use thing for quite awhile.<br />- Built in timer<br />- Volume control for all music/sound features<br /><br />Areas for improvement -<br /><br />- Not the easiest thing to put together. In fact, ours still needs a bit of a brush-up to get perfect.<br />- Ideally, it would come with built in rechargeable batteries - granted that would add to the cost - however be prepared to go through batteries!<br />- Makes a bit of a clicking sound - not a big deal for us, but I am sure some people would find it annoying.<br /><br />Final Verdict - I was tempted to take off a 1/2 star for assembly, but as a whole we are very satisfied!<br /><br />5 Stars!
B00DQXOFFE|5|I bought this for my daughter before she was born, as her nursery is fox-themed.  I haven't used it yet (she's 3 weeks old and not too fond of pacifiers), however it is a good quality and very cute!!
B00AJSJE6O|5|Best exersaucer I've seen! So many activities that it holds my little one's attention for quite some time. Lots of colors and sounds. Sturdy.
B007NG5UEU|1|We bought these when my son was born last October and pretty much from the moment they were out of the box, they were the most annoying monitors ever. We followed the instructions as best as we could but they would NOT stop beeping! They beep incessantly, and have to constantly be plugged in (but if they're too close to each other they beep even more) and basically, are sitting collecting dust. I am extremely disappointed in them. I was hopeful that these monitors would work for us, as we didn't have the resources to spend hundreds on a monitoring system that included video and sound, etc. Luckily our son has a good set of lungs on him, but I would really love to be able to sit outside on the deck and feel secure that I could hear him if he wakes up instead of being closeted inside for his nap times.
B002ITOC7S|5|I purchased this item because by baby has reflux and I was afraid he would choke at night while I was sleeping. Halo provides peace of mind while doing chores around the house and allows me to sleep.
B0039Q9KYE|4|I anticipated this bag would be a bit small, and it is. Otherwise, it seems great. Still waiting for the baby to be able to really test it out, but upon first inspection it appears to meet all needs.
B004IM8PDU|5|These make life so much easier! !
B00005C5H4|5|My 8 month old son LOVES this toy. It's so simple yet it keeps him entertained. Especially useful to divert a potential meltdown.
B005TJ6DSA|5|very cute and easy to use for child.<br />good color
B00B924WGQ|5|We purchased one 4 years ago for our first baby and we are still using it now for our 3rd baby.  My wife absolutely loves the Baby Pak.  A great durable product.
B00A0ID90A|5|Good product--- my 16m old is a little too short to use this easily... but the price was great & the prime shipping = awesome!
B00NGE4I64|5|I love these food scissors. It is very easy to hold and use and does not hurt. Great and very effective at cutting up food for my toddler.
B0035JL912|5|I love them. I just started potty training my two year old, so I put regular underwear and these on top. They leak, but it's minimal. I just give them a quick wash by hand, air dry them, and we're good to go.
B004323NHS|5|It holds on to my LO's clothing well and is easy to clean and quick drying. I like that the colour isn't in your face and it doesn't distract from my LO's outfits. I got it mailed to Canada and it came quickly.
B000066CMV|4|this has been a great pump. I used it when my milk first came in and my breasts were too engorged for the baby to nurse. I also used it for light pumping to store breast milk for times when I was away from the baby.  <br /> <br />I found the pump and the massager to be very comfortable. Being able to pump directly into the avent bottles is also a plus.  <br /> <br />If you need to pump exclusively or for back to work purposes I would get an electric pump, but for light to moderate use, this is all you need.
B005C3K5ZU|1|We bought this for our recent vacation to help allow our 20-month old to walk or run around the airport but we could still keep her within arms reach.<br /><br />We used it, literally, for less than an hour before it fell apart at the seams. First the loop on the tail broke after just a few minutes. I figured I'd just stitch it up when we got to our destination, no biggie. Our flights were delayed several hours and by the time we boarded the first flight the whole pack had simply come apart. The stitching at the bottom came undone so that the legs, tail (leash), and body all separated.<br /><br />Perhaps it was from a bad batch. We ordered it months before the trip and just opened the package in the car on the way to the airport so she hadn't played with it or used it prior.<br /><br />We purchased another brand at a local store while on the trip and it has held together and been handy.
B00CYRYUXU|3|Velcro is great.... in the beginning but it loses it durability after the loop side gets frayed. I think the Mommy hook is better
B004GGQPRQ|5|We bought this seat based on excellent reviews, good price, and the hope that it would fit into our small car.<br /><br />The reasons I like this carseat:<br /><br />1. It fits extremely well in our little Scion XD. I have plenty of room in the passenger seat even with the seat rear-facing.<br /><br />2. My son fits in it very well and seems comfortable. There are several different slots for adjusting the shoulder straps to fit your child well. The seat itself has a comfy material. It feels like it will be easy to wash (but we bought it in black just in case!)<br /><br />3. This carseat is VERY easy to use. One can adjust the shoulder straps very easily without having to remove the top padding (like I've had to do with other seats). The instructions in the booklet are easy to follow, and you really only need to read them once and then you've got it figured out. Installation was easy for my husband. Took him a few minutes. He said the directions were so straightforward and the carseat was so intuitive that he didn't really need instructions to get it installed properly (although he used them!). We used the latch system for ours.<br /><br />4. This is more of a review of the seller, but we received it promptly and with no damage. I appreciated that as I was super excited about getting a bigger carseat for my ever-growing son!<br /><br />5. This seat will grow well with my son, so it makes it worth the money. I was actually surprised at the great quality of the seat for the price we paid. We have another one on the way that will use this seat, as well. I look forward to many years with this product.
B004AGJMZY|5|My granddaughter loves this lamb.  Someone gave it to her for a baby shower gift. Since then I have purchased 3 more. ( I have two<br />on reserve!) It's light weight and easy to carry around.
B00J3TVRO2|4|I wish they were softer and had Hello Kitty on all the wash cloths but they are still pretty nice.
B00CJO6W52|3|glows good in the dark.. but i didnt like the four star shape n the lozenge one..however it stick very good anywhere..<br />plus u can use some tools to cut it the way u want.
B0057ECYS0|3|does not fit Dr.Browns 8oz bottles. I have to lay them on the side. It also collects scale and rust very easily. it does the job quickly which is nice but leaves the bottles wet. they either have to air dry or dry them with a paper towel. but overall it gets the job done.
B003YHLM2G|3|This is a cute design and the terry fabric soaks up water well.  Unfortunately, the fabric seems to be lower quality, as it has not worn well.  After just a few washes it looked quite worn, and now it just looks old.
B00E8NGRN4|3|It falls off. We sent it back.
B001LQCOIS|2|At first I was so excited about the Beaba! I even called all my friends and raved about it. Now after 10 months of use, I don't like to use it anymore. Why? Well because food particles end up stuck in the handle. The handle is made hallow so that the water can travel to the container and \\"steam\\" the food. This is a great idea, however, the Beaba designers forgot one very important aspect: You can't remove the handle and take it apart to clean! Food particles get stuck in the handle and there is NO WAY to clean. I am a clean freak and I have tried everything to clean the handle. I even used toothpick to get into the small opening of the handle, but nothing worked.    I now use a mini food processor and even if I have to steam veggies or fruit separately, the mini food processor is much stronger, can puree faster and make the food smoother.    So yes, I loved it at first, but now I have fallen out of Love. I used my Beaba daily, so maybe if you won't use yours much, then, it might be a good choice, but if you plan to use it daily and plan to use it for a while, you will see what I mean about the little pieces of food stuck in the handle.
B003DRY1YI|5|I registered for this bedding set with Buy Buy Baby because I thought it was so cute.  Then BBB discontinued this design for some reason so I bought it on Amazon and I am so glad I did!      I was a little apprehensive because I had only seen the bedding in online photos, but the colors are beautiful and look great in the nursery.  One of the reasons I picked this set was because the colors are bright without being too girlie (we're having a boy).  But, I think it would be great for a girl too.  Our friends brought over their 3-year old daughter recently and she loved the nursery decor.  We couldn't get her out of there when it was time to go home!  :)  The pallet lends itself to accents of brown, gray, green, etc.  It washed up beautifully and I can't wait for the baby to be born so we can take photos of him in his super cute room.      I also bought the cute as can bee lamp, hamper and and an extra valence. They are all great pieces!
B00004YMZE|5|This is a very simple and sturdy gate. Very easy to use one handed. We put the second one at the door to our child's room. It's easy to be quiet shutting this gate.  I've recommended this gate to my friends already.
B005WWJ304|5|Ordered this bag to use for taking bottle parts to and from daycare. So far I have loved this bag. It comes in multiple cute prints and looks great in person. It does not leak at all and washes well. I have washed it three times in the washer and let it air dry and have washed it nightly by hand in the sink with air dry and so far it has held up well. In fact I love this bag so much I have order two more of the bigger size and the new wet/dry version, the reason for this is because it would be nice if this bag had a handle. It is hard to carry with a baby carrier and would be easier if I could put a strap on my wrist. But overall, I like this bag and would recommend it to anyone.
B0070WGV9K|5|Works well, does what it's supposed to. Other posters have mentioned difficulty with the release handles, but i haven't had any issues with it. Great buy for the price!
B000LPURQG|5|i havent bought these nipples from amazon but they are awesome best nipples for bottles ever good slow flow to reduce air in tummy so you have less belly achs and are easy to clean
B008PBOD4A|1|I was given one of these as a hand me down, and we loved it so much that we bought this, a second one. Unfortunately, the design process must have changed as this new mat has virtually no suction whatsoever. It's unfortunate as we love the first one so much. It doesn't stick to my clean table (and my other, identical mat works fine on it) and it turns into a flingable plate for my toddler to careen across the room. I'm sad to say it, but it has to go back.
B007Q4FX3C|2|Opened the package and it reeked of flame retardant material. After many washes this smell still won't come out of the sheets, they aren't soft in the least on top of it. I'd look elsewhere and buy something better for the same price.
B005BWXJ8W|5|I chose this product because of the price and the simplicity of the product.<br /><br />The cover looks exactly as it is pictured and it is easy to use. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that has a child that it teething on their crib railing. I will be purchasing the side rail covers since my little has decided to teeth on the other rails.
B001IXYOD2|5|The best.
B004HFQOLI|5|Excelent product.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|Works great. My toddler pulls at the safety lock/the doors it holds together on a daily and sometimes hourly basis. This lock stays put. Love it!
B000083GHY|5|We purchased this at Babies R Us instore on sale for $15.90 but before we purchased it we did look up the reviews online for it first. It had the most reviews and the best reviews, so it was a no brainer. The store only had one left in stock (color black). We have a 2013 Jeep Wrangler with half leather seats/half fabric. (Might be hard to visualize for non Wrangler owners). But so far, it hasn't slipped or caused any damages on either the leather part of the fabric part of the seat. I like that it has a high rim around it and that its a very sturdy rubber like material all around the top base. We got it for protection for our seat and also for easy clean up in case our 19 month old son spills his juice or grumbles on the seat. So far he hasn't made a mess, but I imagine that when he does, it'll be easy to wipe up or to just brush off because it's a rubbery material and not fabric like. The only negative I don't really like is that the back part is not very high and doesn't go all the way up the seat. Our convertible car seat (we have the Safety 1st convertible car seat) is tall and some of it is still resting on the leather, but overall it's not a big deal, the back part of the car seat isn't smashed against the seat all too hard, so I'm sure it won't leave any marks or indents. (like we mentioned we got it mainly for protection against indents and marks on the bottom part of the seat and to catch grumbles and spills, so it's doing that job without compromising my son's safety, so slipping and my husband is a firefighter so he's educated on how to install the car seat, we agree that it's safe for our son.) Definitely recommend this.
B00F2MQ7VM|4|Overall, this was a great buy as a highchair for grandma's house.  Our granddaughter seems to enjoy it.  My only observation is that she is unable to sit completely upright as the seat back is angled a little too far back ans she gets uncomfortable after a short time.
B001KZH69C|5|As a traveling nanny, I get a chance to see many infant care products but when I had my first grandchild--well, it was a whole new experience in looking at baby products. My daughter leans heavily towards organic so I begin to research products for her.  She had invested in a quality organic which means it had no \\"plastic\\" top.  I read the reviews on this product and thought it might be worth the price.  We have been very pleased with the quality and ability to protect the mattress.      I have felt confident about this product to recommend it to my clients.
B005EYRJ8I|5|Love these nursing pads!
B001IAEMPA|5|Use these for cleaning out straws. Work like a champ.
B001FGL9X0|3|Seems to be a bit of a gimmicky product.  I love the idea of it, but it hasn't been ideal for my now 6 month old.  It's possible that he's just not into a binky much anymore, but this product does not help him keep it in his mouth.  The puppy is so light weight that it doesn't hold the binky in place at all.  My son would have to hold it in his mouth, but he's much more interested in playing with a stuffed animal.
B0038JDVCE|5|Would someone please add a comment that tells the real length of this brush - without the stand?<br /><br />Also please post both the diameter of the brush and of the handle at its fattest point, and finally<br />please post an estimate of the minimum opening the brush head would fit into (when letting the bristles bend).<br /><br />I do not have this brush, so my rating is meaningless. It looks interesting, but I would like to know if it will fit my intended use (a somewhat tall thermos bottle).<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Tip: there are more pictures of the product if you click on the different colors available.
B007700SEO|1|i have my carseat behind the passenger seat.  There is NO possible way to attach this mirror to the headrest in the back so that it tilts in a way to see my baby.  It is useless and i do not recommend it to anyone.
B0009OLSY4|5|Sturdy. We use it daily. Your child will not slip, as it has a rubber base . My little one uses it when she washes her hands or brushes teeth. When she grows up, I will inherit it, I will use it in the kitchen as a step stool. Made of durable plastic that will not crack and it is easy to clean. Black and white color will look good everywhere unlike acid green or pink stools you see around. Gender and age neutral. A bit overpriced for a piece of plastic, but looks like I am gonna use this for years and years.
B000067EH7|1|Mine leaked from the bottom on the first use. Planning to return.
B000XBPGKK|5|This is so cute and fit my sons prints perfectly. Would make a great gift for new parents. We plan on passing this on when he has kids of his own. Well made and hangs beautifully.
B004GIKS7C|4|I gifted this to my sister-in-law when her second son was born, it was extremely well received by her and her two year old.  I cannot yet speak to it's appeal to the newborn as an actual teething toy but if my two yr old nephew's instant attachment is anything like the newborns, we'll have a constant accessory around the mom's neck.
B00295MQLU|5|This is a MUST for pumping. I was trying to pump without a Hands-free pump bra before and it was terrible! My husband bought this bra for me as a going back to work present and it truly is a great purchase!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It is completely adjustable. It has a Velcro back that you set to the size you are. Then, you use the zipper in front to put it on, take it off. It is pretty easy to put on once you have it adjusted.<br />2. It holds the breast shields in place. I've been using it for 3 months now and haven't had ANY problems with the breast shields slipping or leaking (like some unsatisfied reviewers mentioned).<br />3. It's made of durable material. The nursing bras I have are made of material that is too thin to &#34;make a slit&#34; as some reviewers suggested. I find this product to be much more useful, and I don't have to wreck one of my good nursing bras.<br />4. It's easy to put on. I do NOT take my shirt off (as it shows in the picture). I just pull my shirt up, put the bra on, and set up my pumping supplies. It works just fine that way.<br />5. I was able to increase the amount I pumped because I could relax. I didn't have to focus on keeping the breastpump in place. The bra did it all for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It was hard to do the initial size adjustment by myself. I had to take it off, adjust the Velcro, and put it back on to get it to the right size. However, that was such a minor inconvenience compared to how useful this product has been!
B000YDH4HA|5|My grandson loves carrying his family around with him. It makes long distance families feel closer.
B0016JQ2FQ|5|My daughter just had our 4th grandchild and she has decided to do his room in a Disney theme.  We acquired an older cradle, refinished it, and put Disney designs on the outside.  Then I began looking for bedding and luckily found this blanket.  When it arrived, I could not believe how good the artwork was, and how rich the colors are.  I have combined this with the same blanket but in a paler blue, pale blue sheets, and white bumpers and the entire cradle looks better than anything I've seen yet.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you are a Disney nut (as my daughter and her entire family are) you cannot beat the quality or price of this blanket.
B00PAUESJE|5|My daughter loved her new swing but it was defected when we put it together.
B0062OW6YG|4|It was smaller than i thought it would be :( but I do like how convenient the cards are to carry with you instead of a baby book! :)
B0013A1KM8|3|We have the Britax twin stroller (exactly like City Mini Double) and this will hold my keys, my cell phone, ear buds, and a pepper spray. But the cup holders are tight and can only really be used for baby bottles or water bottles with lids... I stupidly tried a can of soda... Big messy mistake. Looking back I think I should have gotten a sturdier option. Easily folds with stroller.
B000056IZE|5|This is the second time I have purchased this exact gate I had the fitst one for about six years before a dog chewed it up.  I like it because it does extend to cover a sizable opening or you can make it fit a single door opening.  Also, the fact that you can swing it out of the way totally when not in use is a good feature.  I would recommend this gate.
B0053HSL9C|5|Great baby book with lots of pages for info from birth to 5 years.  Love the direction it gives for ideas of info to document.  Well worth the price!
B002NUXHJQ|5|Saved my life! I'm pumping exclusively and this bra allows me to do other things (my make up, feed my baby his bottle) while I pump.
B00KCOJLL8|5|Perfect fit! My 16 month old loves eating puffs off the tray and keeping his sippy cup in the cup holder.
B009YSYCZI|4|The pump was ok. It's easy to use. If you are. Of going to be pumping much this is good for you. I needed a better faster pump so I don't use mine anymore. I had to buy a modela pump in style.
B0006M1B0K|5|I love this bear. I got one when my son was born because I heard good thibgs about &#34;womb bears.&#34; The concept made sense- womb noises are comforting because it's what they know, but I was still skeptical. After the first time my son cried and was instantly soothed, I was a believer it's awesomeness. My son just turned 2 and Prince Lionheart (what we call the bear)still stays on his bed and helps calm him. It's been such a sanity saver and comfort for the whole house. I get them for everyone I know as baby shower gifts.
B005XJ2VGE|4|Great chair overall!<br /><br />PROS:<br />-easy to assemble<br />-feels sturdy<br />-has 5 point harness and crotch bar for safety<br />-reclines, great for when baby smaller<br />-can be used for many years and 2 kids = good value for price<br />-moves well<br /><br />CONS (minor nit-picky things)<br />-5 point harness sometimes hard to do up with squirmy baby (baby seems secure when done up though)<br />-chair still moves a bit on hardwood floor even when wheels are locked<br />-wish chair height went up one more notch (have pub height table and is just a bit too low)<br />-wish the crotch bar was fixed to seat instead of tray so more flexibility to push tray closer without making uncomfortable for baby in crotch area<br />-chair doesn't fold up for storage<br />-infant insert not attached to chair at all, straps threaded through to keep in place but often slips down b/c not really attached<br />-have to store booster seat separately<br /><br />No chair seems perfect, but my baby seems happy and comfortable in this seat. I feel he is safe and secure, chair is sturdy. I leave tray in place and just recline seat to get baby in and out easier, so no complaints about tray falling or not being locked in place.
B003CJFED4|5|I have this in my office. it looks great . i recommend it to any one, it is a great buy
B007BEHSDU|4|My 3 month old has an average head size and they fit great. We bought them for a plane trip but our flight was canceled. So we have used them on our son for loud parties and church (it gets quite noisy)! He doesn't seem to mind them.
B00M6N9AHI|3|Honestly, this is a $33 wireless IP camera. You really cannot expect perfection, and I certainly didn't when I ordered it. It's primary use for me was two-fold: Connect via wi-fi to our network in an office. Upload still images at a specified interval to a specific directory on a server via FTP. Only one of the criteria were met.<br /><br />The camera has a decent build quality. Responds as expected. Setup was very simple, and if you have any experience with wireless IP cameras you'll have this camera connected to your network in 5 minutes - including the camera start-up time. Assign it an IP and you're done. I was unable to rename the camera - which I assume is a standard and basic function of most IP cameras. The video image in a moderately lite room is probably a 5 out of 10 for a camera that is 720p. The video image in a darkened room is probably a 3 out of 10.<br /><br />The big fail for me was that although the camera can upload via FTP, it uploads photos with a new image name each time. Because we upload an image every 60-seconds, that would mean that the camera would upload 1,418,349,375 images per day. Not good. I contacted support - which is in California - to inquire about a firmware or software update to fix this issue. Although their initial reply was quick, they made me jump through hoops to get an answer. I had to take photos of the camera, and provide my Amazon order information. It then took 6-business days for them to respond and tell me the function wasn't available.<br /><br />This camera will more than likely be returned.
B0000A1O7P|4|This is perfect to keep in the car for times when they do not have high chairs.
B0094RTEZW|5|Great fit and great quality.... Highly recommend it....<br /><br />Can't go wrong with a Avent Product...I have bought many of their products and always have something positive to say.
B001O9H5Y0|1|I bought and returned 4 of these strollers within 1 month.<br /><br />Why was I so crazy? I really wanted this stroller. I thought it was perfect for my needs. After weeks of internet searches, comparing strollers, and reading reviews, I went to Babies R Us 4 times in 2 weeks to test drive their floor model. I brought my 2yr old and 5 month old to test it out too. I loved how easy it was to push and steer it. It was a dream. I love the ratcheting canopy, the parent tray, the storage, individually reclining seats, etc. I just loved it. So, I bought one.<br /><br />After I put it together and was pushing it around my home, I noticed the wheel did not turn well at all. It was NOT locked, I checked. It would just skid sideways and not turn. This was a deal breaker. I already had a stroller that was difficult to steer. So, I exchanged it.<br /><br />The second stroller turned well and seemed wonderful. We took it to the mall for a test drive and when I went to put it in the car, I noticed that the trigger on the left side to collapse the stroller wouldn't pull. Then, I realized that it was because it was never locked! It was broken straight out of the box! So, I returned it. At this point, I took a moment and called the manufacturer. I told them about my difficulties with their strollers and that I was actually considering getting a third one. I wanted some kind of reassurance of good customer service in the event that I got a stroller that wasn't broken before I got to use it. What if something breaks after 3 mos? After 15 min of going through a looped recorded message, a rep finally answered the phone. The rep told me that these things happen and that there is a 6 mos warranty. They would send out a prepaid shipping label and have the stroller back to me in about 2 weeks. She had a very matter of fact tone. Just from that conversation, I got the impression that my business didn't matter. I didn't trust that I would be helped if I needed it.<br /><br />With that said, yes, I did go on to buy it again. I really wanted this stroller. I decided to change vendors and ordered 2 online through Target. I ordered 2 because I was no longer confident that I would get a stroller that wasn't defective. Yes, I did still want this stroller. The website said they would ship in 4-6 weeks but I got them both within a week. I was very excited. Unfortunately, my excitement was shortlived when I pulled them out of the box. Zip ties had been already cut off of them and thrown in the box, the tires were covered in a sticky grease, and the paint was all chipped away where the swivel wheel attaches... on BOTH strollers. I was going to overlook the fact that I was obviously getting someones returns. We took one to the mall for a test drive. It was great... until we left. As I stepped off of the sidewalk onto the parking lot, it began to violently shake. It shook so strongly that, if I had been actually jogging, it surely would have flipped upside down and my girls' faces would have hit the pavement.<br /><br />Most of these defects were more irritating than anything but the shaking and broken latch put my children at risk.<br /><br />So, 4 strollers later, I'm done. I wish this stroller wasn't such a poorly made piece of garbage.  I would not recommend anyone buy this stroller. I saw similar reviews but took a chance... I took 4 chances. Don't waste your time, gas, and money in shipping. Spend a little more and get a product you can trust.in. I really wanted this stroller.

B002UXQRNO|5|nice and easy to clean
B00474CUTO|5|Love my Boppy!  I bring it with me whenever I travel (which has been a lot) because it provides just the right amount of support without having to fill my bed with pillows.  I looked into the full-body pregnancy pillows, but decided it would take up too much room.  I need room to move around!  The sleep wedge was perfect for me!  :)
B002U7X9HW|5|As Advertised. Looks great, fits perfectly.
B003XMWFAU|4|I have triplets, and I have used a triplet stroller... but when I found about these links, they open the options for me!! Cause when it comes to stroller, the multiple stroller are way mooore expensive, but whit these links you can have your triplet (or quad) stroller with a lot of less money.<br /><br />So I bought a twin stroller and a single stroller... and its great because when Im with someone else, each one take one stroller, when Im alone, I convert insantly my 2 strollers in a triplet one!!! So I have always my links in the car, along with the strollers, this really makes you save a lot of money!!! And it gives you the plus (against buying a multiple stroller) that you have the option to use the strollers separated, or alltogether.
B00003TL7P|4|This diaper disposal system is, in my opinion, better than the diaper genie because you can use your own trash bags and not have to buy their refills. It's much easier to use and does what it's supposed to, keep the odor out.  The Diaper Champ is unbelievably easy to use (my 4 year old loves to flip the lid and &quot;help&quot; mom with diaper changes) and that is helpful when you have to keep a hand on the baby.  The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is because when you open it to pull out  a full trashbag, there is nothing stopping the odor from escaping at that point.  You should do it outside, not in the nursery.  But other than that, it's economical and works like a charm!
B00GXZRUAO|5|easy to assemble, It holds more toys than you would think!
B008KCR7VK|5|These are great!  We have one for each car and it makes life so easy.
B002A9IZ0Q|5|Shopped around several stores before making this purchase.  I found this crib to be the best buy for the money, moreover, Amazon had the best price and no shipping charges.  I am a senior citizen and found this crib to be one of the best I have seen, with a price I could afford.  Highly recommend this crib.
B00GN1RHYC|5|Great at bag very spacious.
B002FKAMLA|5|love it<br />fast shipping<br />would recommend
B004FN0Z44|5|I love this stroller. It is so light weight and easy to maneuver. I bought it for a flight to Puerto Rico and it was not only a life saver while traveling, once I got the hang of folding it, it was easy through security, and didn't take up much room in the trunk for sight seeing. I have since used it everywhere like shopping and jogging in the park. I am very happy with this purchase. The stroller is well worth the money.
B00KDKKD1I|5|Wonderful pillow - high quality, well made, just the right size, and wonderful owner (Chris) who personally makes sure that the customer is happy with their purchase. After I placed the order, I received an email from Chris thanking me for the purchase and inquiring about my satisfaction with the pillow. I later contacted her to see if I can purchase a custom fill pillow with less fluff, and she sent me one for free! My 21 months old daughter loves her pillow so much that I ordered a second one for her to use at day care. I highly recommend Little Sleepy Head Pillows and am glad to support a small family run business!
B0043IS18I|4|This fan is awesome and works well. I get so many comments on it when I'm out. It snaps onto the stroller easily and STAYS on (I have a Britax bagile and Bob duallie). It doesn't hurt either of kids when they try to mess with it and it keeps them cool when it's obnoxiously hot out.<br /><br />My main gripe with this is battery life. If you're planning on using it often throughout the day at an amusement park, fair, etc then I would recommend bringing additional batteries with you. Generally the batteries die in less than 4 hours with consistent use.
B001AVJ18U|5|I bought two of these for my daughter to use when her baby arrives.  I had seen these being used on my other grandchildren.  Babies like being changed on a nice warm cloth not a cold hard surface.
B004J1QNFW|5|I got these to help with some jaw pain I've been experiencing, but imagine my surprise when it helped me most with first a foot injury, and then an ankle injury. I typically wear them around my neck, but when I severely bruised my foot to the point that I could not put weight on it, these beads went around my ankle like an anklet, and served to be the only reason I was able to work until I healed. The second time was after I twisted my ankle, and I did the same thing, and it helped me through the healing process. And then again, last week, when I pulled a muscle in my neck. I love these, and am so glad I chose to get them!
B003ULP592|2|Bought this for our 2 1/2 year old so he wouldn't fall out of bed onto our hardwood floor at night.<br />Works well, except one of the pieces from the bars that goes under the bed keeps coming apart.<br />Also the bars are pretty thick, so the mattress looks lumpy when laid on top of it.<br />I would not recommend it to a friend.<br />If I had the box, I would return it.
B00GSP5D94|5|gotta love the swaddle. 6 weeks in and the velcorw still works.
B004TTPYMC|5|I looked at different Classic Pooh bedding sets for months when I was pregnant...This set is PERFECT. The colors are soft, the characters are sweet, and it arrived earlier than the expected date. Perfect for a boy or a girl!!!
B00AS693R2|4|I really love these clips, very easy to use.  I am glad they came in a 2 pack because the first one slid off when my baby was playing with it.
B000FOLJS8|5|We had no idea whether this was a good mattress when we bought it - the baby store recommended it and we went along. I guess they knew what they were talking about because this mattress is great. It has held up like new through multiples kiddos, remained firm and in great condition.  Kids sleep well on it, even as toddlers. It is a little heavy and can be hard to get out of the crib especially on the lower setting. Good quality product.
B00GQQVNP8|1|Well they have a big run in them I just got them in the mail...
B008QSVAIE|5|I was lucky enough to be gifted a Milk-It kit before I had my first baby.  Being new to pumping, I hadn't stored milk before.  I quickly found the Milk-It labels to be not only attractive, but completely functional.  They are easy to apply to bags or bottles and unlike some stickers, they peel smoothly and easily off the container as well.  You can even run them through the dishwasher, and the label will still peel off.  No hassle!  The handy note section allows for dating and comments for easy reference.  I applied the stickers to my otherwise nondescript black pump bag and cooler to identify it when traveling.  I haven't used the door hanger yet, but anticipate it will also come in handy when traveling or in an emergency situation. I plan to continue using the labels as long as I'm pumping and think this is a great gift idea for pregnant women and new moms.
B004EPDIT2|4|At first a little trouble to put it together, instructions are quite brief. But it does make sense so after a while got to fit everything together.
B00HX4SZW6|5|I am so pleased with this carseat canopy!! It was extremely easy to put on, and the instructions weren't a bunch of ready and steps.<br />strongly recommend!
B004LWZZ08|5|I use these to pack my child's (baby food based) lunch in it. I like that I can give three separate things and they won't mix. It's also great that the container is microwaveable and dishwasher safe. The lid seals tightly so it won't accidentally come undone. At the same time, it's not so tight that you can't remove it when you want.<br /><br />It can be a challenge to clean the nooks and crannies of each compartment, I use a bottle brush and lots of soap.
B00AHVR4OM|5|We ordered this for our newborn and love it. Lightweight, sturdy and love that baby can grow into it. The changing station is awesome. Only thing is that the volume to play the music is super low even on highest setting.
B003Z6Q3WU|5|My baby girl loves this carrier, and I don't feel tired after carring her for half an hour. Strongly recommend!
B001EX81ZI|5|Works with Avent natural bottles. I pump into my bottles and use these rings when storing or transporting the milk or putting the bottle in the freezer. I have never had any issues with leakage and would highly recommend these and the avent conversion kit for a pumping mom.
B00KDIIKVA|5|cute
B006T899QI|5|The best bottle for baby
B00003TL7P|4|I thought it was a great diaper pail... but beware when baby starts eating solids and poopy diapers REALLY stink!  I've found if I am able to empty the diaper in the toilet, then put it in the champ, it controls the odor WONDERFULLY!
B00NQ9FF3Y|5|#1 Pacifier & Baby Bottle Nipple UV<br />I never knew there was such a thing as this I wish I would of had one for my older kids but glad that I can now use this for my twins.<br />This is so easy to use all you have to do is first unscrew the very top where the battery compartment is and place two AAA batteries in which are not included, then put the top back on. Once you do that you are all set to start using it, you can simply place one pacifier in it or the nipple to a bottle and it takes about 4 minutes and they become sterile. It also does have an automatic shut off which is good in case you forget about it you wouldn't and anything to happen.<br />This would be great to carry with you when you are out cause I can't count on both hands how many times when my older kids were babies that they would end up dropping their pacifiers and then we would have to wait to get home and sterilize them before they could use them again.<br />I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
B00A2HUGYQ|2|The space is smaller than expected.The safty belt too  short to fit the baby of 12 years old. it is only for 9months - 4 years old child.
B0097GUCZ6|4|Works great! Very comfortable!
B008AYXHYY|5|I love this wastebasket it has great color, does not look faded or cheap. Good size and price was decent.
B009EDSWJA|4|Works well
B000KN2YOC|5|My 6 week old grandson LOVES the cards ~ would highly recommend!
B00XHZ89PI|5|I love the vital botanicals natural sponge.  It is the perfect size and lathers and rinses well. I recommend it to all my family and friends!
B003ZZZUTS|4|The only cup I could get my daughter to drink out of. We love it. I just wish they didn't leak. The 9oz drinking cups leak at times, and they're very easy for the little one to pour everything out so you have to keep a close watch.
B001QIJ83A|1|The plastic zig zag strip you pull wipes through cracked and failed after two days. It got brittle with the heat. The heat it's supposed to be designed for.<br /><br />Another two days later the heater failed.<br /><br />Now we just use it as a box. A box would have been cheaper.<br /><br />Avoid this cheap junk.
B007S10L62|5|I absolutely love these bottles. I love the fact that they also have the transition cups also so that it's the same shape but a Sippy cup nipple. My son used these and so did my daughter. I recommend these to everyone. I loved that there was different colors for the Sippy cups being that my kids are close in age and one has a dairy issue so it was awesome
B003JJX2IG|5|We love these.  They work, are easy, are cheap, and our daughters think they are great.  Covers the toilet, works perfectly with the child seat we use to prevent the girls from falling through the grown up sized potty hole, and helps everyone feel comfortable about using public facilities nearly anywhere regardless (or nearly regardless) of the condition of those facilities.  Update: we've been using these things for something like two years. The are such a part of our routine that, on the rare occasion Daddy takes the girls to the potty instead of Mommy, I get a thorough set of instructions from my 3 and 4 year olds on exactly how to unfold the covers, place them on the potty, wrap them up when I'm done, etc. They work for everyone; I continue to vote 5 stars with gusto!
B000H1IYXW|4|General comment about these items is they are kind of a pain to instal and get alighned right while putting the mattress on the bed.This is not unique to this particular item.<br /><br />That being said, specific to this item, if you don't read the directions when snapping it together it's very hard to take back apart. This is great for safety and stability of the final product, not so great if you rushed into snapping it together to fast.<br /><br />The roll away feature is an added bonus, especially if your child doesn't need the guard rail all the time.<br /><br />I WOULD recommend the product.
B005CL9VR0|5|I bought countless sippy cups in search of the perfect one and I finally found it. These are truly the only sippy cups I have found that do not leak. Others claim to be leak proof but their claims always proved to be false. My son has fallen asleep with his cup in his bed and not a drop leaked out. The only time these cups leak is if the top isn't screwed on correctly.<br /><br />This was also the perfect tool to get my son off the bottle. Highly recommend!
B00GR9FHNI|5|These are well worth the money! I put one on our fridge to stop out 3 year old from sneaking food. They work very well!
B0050O92GE|4|I got this lunchbox for the kids but my husband is actually using it for his lunches now. He doesn't use the water bottle, so the three compartments are perfect to fit for example a lunch dish, a side salad and a snack. The lid however is unfortunately not spill proof like I would have expected for the price. This makes it still great for sandwiches but not for leftovers like pasta with sauce. Otherwise this would have been a five star product.
B0015A4FO6|5|These swaddlers work great for getting my infant to sleep and stay asleep. I purchased this one as he had grown out of his newborn sizes. It's breathable for summer too- we usually just place him in it with just his diaper.
B000058DPM|1|These shells, although completely comfortable, simply don't have enough suction if you have large/extremely large breasts.  I wore them for several hours the day I got them - at least six hours - and my nipples were not even potruding right when I took them out of my bra.<br /><br />Also, as a word of warning, if you are pregnant and attempting use of this product, PLEASE consult your OB/GYN before purchasing.  I was unaware that stimulation of the nipples can cause uterine contractions, and in some cases, premature labor.  So, you want to be certain to clear it with your doctor first.  I spoke to a certified lactation consultant that said anything of the sort should only be used after 36 weeks, but even then, you must have your doctor's approval to ensure everything is safe.
B002V3IQVE|5|Love the bag! Stylish, functional, with lots of great extras! Only one downside, the main pocket zipper gets a little stuck sometimes.
B005UV0UEA|4|This thing is built tough!  It's also very heavy.  I'm hoping that means it will last, but I've only had it for a few weeks so far.
B00COADLI2|5|Work great for my grandbaby!
B004BSFOS0|5|This 'blanket' is a wonderful item for infants. Provides a variety of textures and even a crinkly sound from one of the tabs. A comforting and small blanket for the child to grasp in an unfamiliar situation or at nap/bedtime.
B007ZZCR7C|5|It's a very handy addition to my baby's nursery. I'm very pleased with this product. It works  well for me.
B000OY539A|5|I got this for a friend because I also had one when my daughter was born.  I loved how easy it was to hold her. It's very comfortable. I loved it more than the other baby carriers. I also like how close they are to you. It's easy to wash and easy to put on. The only time it's hard to put on is when you're out in public and you don't want the ends to touch the ground while you're wrapping it around yourself. That's the only con I have but if someone is with you, they can help out by holding the ends.
B00J2PA00O|5|Now TWO adorable options for girls - first, the ladybug and now the butterfly. I use it to transport bottles of formula. It's well-made and I think it will last for years to come.
B003AOKA8K|5|Easy to use. Tried another and not as good.
B003LQVZQ8|5|Has many areas to attach more toys. Very satisfied with it. Was easy to put together. Has many activities to entertain.
B0018MGRMY|5|My daughter received this blankie as a present and she really likes it. It's very soft even after putting it in the washing machine several times. The size is also great, not too big, not too small.
B0036TGYLQ|5|These upper case alphabet wall decals are great. They are big and stick great. I've had them up for about a month now, and I e had no issue!
B009Z4VXV2|3|For some reason, girl-colored version toys sold on Amazon are almost always more expensive than their boy or gender-neutral counterparts, eg. Fifi/Freddie, Vtech Roll and Learn Suitcase, Mega Bloks Big Building Bag (Pink) etc. Perhaps marketing targeted at mothers of little girls? Sadly, I fell for it and paid more for Fifi (and the Bloks), since many of her other toys are red, blue, green, and yellow.<br /><br />We bought this for our daughter for her one-year birthday, but I'm afraid she may have already outgrown toys of this nature (as with her Lamaze Classic Discovery Book). She has an Alien one in the car also from Lamaze that was given to us and it had worked well to keep her occupied and even lulled her to sleep during car rides before. So I thought I'll get her a similar toy for her cot to encourage her to go to sleep in her bed. Unfortunately, no such luck. She hasn't shown much interest in it, and for the price I paid, I'd say it wasn't worth it. Still a cute toy though, with many features to discover, touch, suck, and chew on, just probably more suited for younger babies.
B007PYU8WO|5|I am trying to find a posterboard or something to put this on so that I can frame it. I have always loved this saying and was happy to find it as a wall decal.
B00NFETJLY|4|Loved this swing initially. Now that we've owned it for about a month the motor is starting to get louder and the legs are creaking so it has gotten to be quite a noisy swing. We have used it a lot though (multiple times a day) as our child loves motion. It doesn't take up too much room and is aesthetically pleasing to have as part of the living room. Overall I would get this swing again.
B00FXHDYL2|1|The LED light that is in this item is hardly strong enough to project the light through the star sheet. If you want to see it all other lights must be turned off and it needs to be at least at counter height to get a dim projection on the ceiling. Waste of money.
B000I5UZ1Q|5|Number one reason we love this swing: AC ADAPTER. Baby loves it because its comfy.
B001OC5UMQ|5|I babysit my 16 month old grandson and wanted something to protect him from the stairs to our basement/familyroom. This is a great gate and very attractive as well. Now he can play without danger of falling.
B004HFQON6|4|Great pump!<br />Easy to use and painless (which is VERY important!). The massage cushion is made of a silicone-like material, so is quite comfortable. The hand grip of the pump is easy to manipulate and pumping is quiet.<br />Yes, there are lots of parts to clean (and please be sure to clean ALL parts)... but it is very easy to do so. I handwash the components well with ease.<br />There is minimal pooling of milk between the cup and your breast which I think occurs due to breast leakage.<br />I have ballooned to a DD/E since pregnancy and my size has not affected the effectiveness of the pump. I get good results each time I use it.
B005SASC9I|3|Unfortunately I didn't realize that the product pictured would not be the product sent. I wanted the pink duck design for my daughter but instead was sent some blue dinosaurs. But all in all it does the job
B00006G963|5|My baby loved this mobile.  The motion and the bright colors fascinated her.  I loved that the songs lasted so long. This is a must have item for new moms.
B000066665|5|We don't have a bathtub at our house, and this is perfect for our 8 month old son. I wouldn't use it for a baby who can't sit by himself, th. And it's super easy to inflate.
B00261BBUY|4|Seem to be good quality and they shipped fast, but I think these blocks are WAY overpriced considering what you get. All of these blocks could fit in a grocery bag. However, this is the cheapest set I've found.
B00029T4D8|4|This is a cute color, comfortable, stays on the chair-<br />and I have a crazy busy boy.. so unless he picks it up,<br />it stays. It does get dirty easy with food and dirt.. but it's super<br />easy to clean.
B005WHQKEG|5|the car seat was very beautiful,the colors are so perfect for a little girl to use til shes a lil lady
B006ZBIHVW|4|The stroller arrived and it's as expected.  The only concern I had was the stroller was manufactured in Feb 2012 (I bought in Dec 2012) and I wasn't sure if it's an refurbished item or what.  One would expect items made in Feb be sold by Dec.<br />Though the stroller seems to be in perfect working condition - except that the harness release is super tight (be prepared to break a few finger nails when trying to release it).
B00CDJH4XC|5|Loved this book.  It is very sturdy and has soft molded corners so it won't fray.  Very dturdy.
B001HKR2LW|2|I bought this less than a year ago and two wheels fell off. We have owned 3 different Holgate toys and all of them have fallen apart. I would not recommend this or any of their toys for the price you pay.
B002UD65XQ|5|This is a very nice mattress cover.  It fits great on my son's crib mattress.  It fits snug but at the same time it is not difficult to put on.  It washes very well.  It also feels wonderful. It is nice and soft and covers the entire top of mattress.  This is not a pricey mattress cover but you dont need to spend a lot to get something great.  I ended up purchasing a second one since I liked this one so much.  I definitely recommend it.
B000I5HBAE|5|I live in AZ and walk a lot with my baby, but I grew tired of fighting with blankets over the stroller. I found this product and just love it.  It has met my needs and exceeded my expectations!
B00B4E4BHO|5|I love 'Peter Pan' so i had to get this plush. Great item and shipping was very fast. Would recommend this to every 'Peter Pan' lover.
B000I5Q19Q|5|pretty, useful, and a great buy. The music is nice at lst & then can wear you down nerve-wise. We keep it off but the insect sounds are o.k.  Really a  good purchase baby item.
B002J4U8M0|5|This mirror is nice and light.  I am able to use it on the floor for tummy time and in the crib.  My baby loves to see herself in the mirror and recognizes her beautiful face
B00K1HCQ1I|5|good product
B00EM5CMJG|5|Works
B004FQ087U|2|The cup seems very cheap. Definitely not worth the $18! I suggest the Zoli Bot over this cup which also has a weighted straw but it's less expensive and the quality is better. Maybe spend less on fancy packaging and more on the material for product. If it wasn't a hassle to return I would return.
B002MJYM9M|4|I purchased this bag as a replacement after our first bag broke.  I needed a big bag as I have twins and there is no such thing as a quick outing.  I was hesitant about this bag because it didn't have as many pockets as our first bag did but this one has plenty of space such that I don't miss the extra pockets.  The outer side pockets are large enough and can easily fit my bottle of water on one side and their puff snacks on the other.  The inside elastic pockets can hold a bottle for each, I am able to stack plenty of diapers, changes of clothes, and bibs in the large center opening.  Wipes go in one of the inside pockets along with disinfecting wipes.  My keys, tablet, wallet, and snack for me go in the other.  The stroller straps easily pop out and hang on the back of our stroller keeping the bag within easy reach but out of the way.  As many other reviewers noted, this bag in HUGE but if you have more than one child or tend to carry a lot of stuff then this bag will certainly help.  The green isn't too bright and Hubby said he wouldn't hesitate to carry it. I have only had a few days so I can't speak on durability but give it 5 stars for functionality.
B0024HFYMQ|5|My young grandson loves his blankee...this particular one. I buy a new one as the old one dissolves<br />completely. Great blanket!
B0001ZNU7E|5|Ever since my daughter got this toy for Christmas she has absolutely LOVED it!  I've only had to change the batteries once in the past two months considering how much it plays.  I definitely recommend this toy for those whose children love to dance :)

B00BM9UHOM|5|This blanket is so cute I also purchase a plush Mickey Mouse and a book about Mickey. My nephew just loved it.
B002EEO68M|5|Mam nipples seemed to be the most comfortable and natural for my baby to use.  We loved the Mam bottles as well when she was smaller and gassy and she still uses the Mam pacifiers.  Really a great, well-designed line of products
B0022F6XQG|4|I've been searching high and low for the perfect teether. This one is great because it's small enough for my baby to put in his mouth, it's eco-friendly/safe and it's lightweight.  All the other ones were either too big for his mouth (which would frustrate him), or would be too heavy because there would be too many on a ring.  He loves it! It's worth every penny...
B002WN2C0E|5|WE LOVE this item! As an great aunt & adoptive grandmother, I am a SUPER NEAT FREAK & do not want baby / toddler's dropping their food all over my dining room or tv room, so as much as young parents want their children to EAT out of big people chairs, I'm NOT one to RUSH kids out of their booster chairs. The kids love it & yet they can STILL eat like big kids even when sitting in this soft & accomadating space saver chair! (VERY COST EFFECTIVE)
B00PTK9FDE|5|It works perfectly- everything I had wanted in a sun shade. I also really like how much they care about their customers and ratings, clearly they want to make a good product, they aren't some huge company that never listens!
B00FZGLKU8|5|This bag is a perfect size, and I love the handle. I also love that it has a separate compartment for wet and dry items.
B0006512GK|4|It is nice and the texture is soft but the size is a little smaller than the sheet that comes with the crib. It still fits though.
B003ZJPQAC|3|These are really cute picture frames and compliment the wall clock well but I am a little disappointed in the lazy way they were put together. I think this company lacks quality control... The ribbon hangers aren't the same length which looks odd when placed right next to each other (which is how I want them displayed). One of the ribbons is twisted and the other was put on backwards so the matte side shows rather than the glossy side. There was also a spot on the blue line that is missing paint. All these things aren't horribly noticeable but it is a little irritating and for the price I was expecting better quality.
B00A6A5A1I|4|seemed good quality - gave as a gift
B00QTTJSH2|5|I would consider this stroller to be between the bulky heavy duty strollers and the light, no frills strollers.  It isn't nearly as heavy or as large as the big strollers so it is far more portable.  This stroller can be put in the trunk of your car without taking up the entire trunk like the bulky strollers.<br /><br />The stroller has two pairs of wheels in the front so it is easy to control.  In the back, there are a single set of wheels.  I really like the way the canopy clicks in place and the fact the canopy is large.  The storage space below the seat is nice and large as well, which I consider important.  Overall,  this is a really nice stroller for a descent price.
B0006BAJIG|5|Love these so you don't have to drag the whole can for a day trip.
B004S8MGGQ|5|This is a must if you are using a breastpump. Love being hands free.  Works great.
B00EVLIHWM|5|My daughter LOVES this walker. For the price it is totally worth it! Very easy to set up. The tray opens up to add more toys for entertainment. It hasn't happened yet, but the only downside to this walker is that once the dinosaur runs out of batteries it won't work anymore. You can't replace the batteries.
B0043D28B4|5|Very cute book.  Great colors and pictures. The story is perfect for my 3 year old to &#34;read&#34; to his baby sister. They are both interested in it.
B000IG6I3Y|5|When i ordered this mattress I was in a hurry because I couldn't find one anywhere else and my son was coming home from the nicu in just a few days. I got the mattress a lot sooner than I expected and it was exactly what I was looking for.
B003IP2L38|2|They wouldn't stay on, and therefore didn't help me.  I would not purchase these again.
B00GRYG63I|4|Definitely function as promised, but my kiddos have an easier time using their food pouches w/o these.  I'm not writing them off though!  Will hold onto them until the girls get a bit older.  May be easier for them to use as they grow & the muscles in their cheeks/mouth develop more. Definitely love that the top also has a cap and carry feature!  Plus, the two colors made it easy to color-code for my twins.
B002M77N22|5|My daughter slept in this every night for the first 2 months. She did not have acid reflux; she was just very comfortable in it. She spent time in it during the day from birth to eight months (less at eight months).  We loved it and found it incredibly portable and convenient. We only stopped using it because she is beginning to be able to squirm out of it. She developed no flat spot and no weakness in her neck or shoulders as a small number of reviewers have stated.
B004C43JI0|5|This little glider has been amazing. When we had to come home from the hospital with a newborn and a bili blanket, this seat was great. It is low enough to the ground so the cords that had to be attached to our baby at all times were not being constantly pulled out (in the case of him  being in say, a swing, or something else). And now that he's off the bili blanket, it's the only place our baby will nap or sleep in at night. He doesn't like the swing, or anything stationary. He loves the sensation of being glided, and the handles that are on it make it easy to move from room to room. Would definitely buy another one or recommend it to anyone! i wish it wasn't so expensive, otherwise I would buy one for everyone I know who is having babies!
B004TS6RCO|5|Extremely smooth ride, easy to assemble and suprisingly easier to fold and transport in the SUV that we thought. This is a great buy. However, for people who need to travel on subways or crowded city streets with stairs, this may not be the best option.
B003XSEV2O|5|I've been using this item (in navy blue) with a Dekor Plus diaper pail for about 5 months, and find that it works great.  No issues w/odors, leaks, etc.  After countless washes, the bag is in like-new condition, but I always hang it to dry.  Based on other reviews, seems maybe this product doesn't hold up too well if thrown in the dryer.  If you have time/space to hang dry, I'd definitely recommend it.
B00073HJGI|4|Just like the one I had when I was a little kid, it keeps stuffed animals tucked away and out of the mouths of my pets who like to drag them away to lay on something soft.
B00KDKKD1I|5|Very cute little pillow
B00N2UB1D0|5|So adorable! Perfect for my Baby Bumblebee room!
B0001EM8I2|5|Great product!
B000ZX6XA8|5|This item arrived on time and in good condition.  I was hesitating to purchase this replacements, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it.
B00DDTXVJW|5|This set is adorable. I love it and my 3-year-old girl loves it. She is already picky and she is attached to this set.
B004QZBEFU|5|Perfect for heating and storing food. I haven't used it to freeze baby good yet. Easy to clean and put back together.
B0052IERHM|4|Great bag. It was bulky to carry, but did protect the seat, which was our main concern.
B0043D28B4|5|Bought this for my, then 9 month old grandson.  He's now a year old and still always wants me to read this to him over and over. Every time you flip open a peek-a-boo flap, he giggles like crazy.  When we are done with it, he hands it to me to read again.
B00A65YN8E|4|Bought this to spray off cloth diapers but felt that it wasn't really powerful enough to clean them to my liking.... It got the chinks off but the poo color remained, my garden hose got it all so that my washing machine didn't get as yucky.<br /><br />Love it for spraying out my daughters training potty.  Couldn't live without it for this reason.
B008MGZCKW|5|This thing is the best!  You will not regret getting it.  It is made much sturdier than I had originally thought - and it holds quite a bit.  You will not be sorry if you purchase it
B00IMN8SW4|5|My 1 year old daughter loves them!  She loves to put the letters and numbers on and off the side of the tub. She also likes to put them all away in the mesh bag after and put the suction cups on the tile. Great product and great price!
B00B7M7BN4|3|It's probably just my bad luck.  I imagine that these shades, by design, should fit most vehicles, but turned out they fit neither of my cars. Don't buy them if you have a compact sedan or hatchback, convertible, or Tesla.
B007VBYVVA|3|I bought these to use as dish towels and cleaning rags. They're pretty good but they do shrink a lot!
B00BNQEZXS|5|Works great !!!
B00E3RK9I4|5|My one year old loves this doll. We affectionately call it &#34;Taggie Baby.&#34; I bought it as her first doll because it's relatively small, soft, and has no pieces/clothing to break or get lost.
B0028OT7G4|5|excellent
B007UYBOM2|4|Just what we need for our grandson.  Didn't want to spend a ton of money on a car seat, but needed to transition into something different for a 4 year old.  he likes it!
B003KTLYHQ|5|This handlebar console is amazing! I bought it for my babyjogger city elite double stroller and it fits perfect. The cup holders are super deep, the storage pouch could be a little bigger but works great. When I fold up stroller it doesn't get in the way. I think this product is great and is a must have!
B000XT30G4|5|We received the gate in 4 days.  It fit to 44\\" opening perfectly.  It was very easy to install.  It's a solid gate and latches it self. We got some cheap sliding wood door from pet store for $55 and returned immediately. This is an excellent value for this price ($65).  I will give 10 stars.
B00A47VH2O|3|They work as intended, I suppose. My son certainly can't open doors with the covers on them; the problem is, neither can anyone else! I found some other covers that have grips to depress for adults to operate the doorknob more easily. They worked much better than these.
B0097D4ZMU|1|Great sound machine but broke the second day I got it
B008J3UD2U|3|It's fine, does what it's supposed to fo
B00DYOQMF6|4|They don't glow in the dark for long, but I love the MAM pacifiers.  My son prefers them over others.
B00167ZG1E|5|I got this for my little Chihuahua and she loves it.  It is so cute.  She sleeps with it every night.  Everyone has had a fit over it.  Thanks so much.  I really enjoy it.  Jamie Marler
B0070WGV9K|4|This product does just what it should, as we have an 'active sleeper' on our hands in our two-year old girl. However, note that the straps that wrap around the box spring are a bit tricky at times in how you loop them around and through. We found it to be quite frustrating and needed four hands to hold everything in place and run them through.<br /><br />Not a big deal, but just make sure you have an extra set of hands.
B000F8YDXC|4|This is a great sleep sack, but it is a bit dfficult to put on a sleeping baby.  I would probally buy it again, but woould also look into ones with a different cf closure
B0073X3DA6|1|I bought this nursing bra based on the good reviews it had, but I have to tell you this is the most uncomfortable nursing bra I have ever wore. The Wal-mart bras are much more comfortable than this one and a lot cheaper. Don't waste your money.
B001BMWABI|4|keeps 100% of the stink out!  the refills are expensive, but you can use an average garbage bag, just make sure you wrap the diaper tightly so no \\"nasty stuff\\" comes out the sides of the diaper onto pail when your tossing.
B004LJ0VQ4|5|Great cups! Only cups one of my 2yr old toddler will drink because of the 15oz. He's not a fan of eating for he'll polish off a giant cup of milk. Perfect for long walks in the jogging stroller and lots of water.
B004V8VQKK|3|Pros: The images are colorful and keeps the baby captivated.<br />The rhymes and music are soothing.<br /><br />Cons: Only 2 images shown per rhyme.<br />All the 8 images should be shown with the soothing music after the rhymes end.<br />Have to flip the pages for a different rhyme. There should have been an automated mode where all the rhymes play one after another with all the images.
B00QXGGYN2|5|I picked these up on a whim to see if they would help with keeping my car clean. I love my children but REALLY despise the little scuff marks their feet leave on my seat. The Baby Mushroom kick mat installed easy and stays in place. I have to recommend these for any parent with kids, big or small.
B002X9F5B0|5|Love this pillow, ordered one for my son and one for a friend's newborn.  You can personalize them on liddakoo's website...adorable!
B003I7ITS2|5|By far my favorite Convertible seat we have owned.  Great looking, easy to buckle (I've had problems with others), very soft cloth.  My only complaint is that it is not washable in the machine.  We have to scrub it with an upholstery cleaner which isn't the greatest but I honestly still love it.
B001BLCII4|5|I have searched many stores and the internet and finally found this stroller.  When it arrived I was excited. VERY EASY to put together.  My 9month old daughter loves it. Although it it heavy and a little bulky all the great things about this stroller outweigh this by far.  With it only having 3 wheels I was wondering about tipping, I take this stroller to all of my outings including but not limited to Softball games(rough areas), mall, camping trips and much more... I have had NO problems.  Easy to handle in all types of areas that you my go.  Hope this helps.  If you have been thinking about getting this stroller I Would with out a doubt. It is the best thing that I have found. Always asked where I got it.
B000067R64|2|I returned this carseat because the handle was hard to move up and down It was so hard to press the releise on the sides my hands hurt not to mention I have to wiggle the seat around I was afraid of hurting the baby in the process of moving the carrier arm up and down.also it was tricky putting the carseat in the base. I loved the style of the carseat the look is why I wanted it when I got it home boy what an error in judgment.I feal that this carseat is unsafe.and not mommy friendly
B00171WXII|5|Even though my baby hates this, I love the fact that I can get my baby's nose clean so she can breathe! It is not gross at all since that was one of my biggest concerns, just clean it with warm water after every use. Highly recommend it to anyone with babies even if your baby is not sick, you might as well get it just in case!
B000034DCJ|3|I ended up returning this product because I couldn't get it to support my baby very well...instead of his head being up near my shoulder like in the pictures, he kind of sagged down and didn't look very comfortable. Maybe I wasn't doing something right, but I found the front-carrier, snugli-types to be more useful, and once he got a little bigger they were better for letting him get a view of the world.
B00488TF38|2|Teeny tiny beads and necklace. I fear it's going break or choke my child.
B004JU0H7I|4|it's great bang for the buck, comfy, but load crackling from the plastic.
B00DQ3AFI0|5|I love it. Wear it daily.
B009EDSWJA|5|This changing pad fits perfect on our changing station.  No slipping or buckling like others I had in the past.
B0032YUSOO|5|These work so great at keeping grandson's pants up. Because of some special needs he only crawls at this time and we could not keep his pants up. He so wanted to wear bluejeans and now they are a perfect fit.
B002IICU7I|1|We just wanted something for the first 2-3 months and didn't want to spend a lot of money and didn't want plastic like the one's we were seeing in Target & BabiesRUs. Although the \\"look\\" is better then those in the stores (note the fabric is not great but what you sure expect from the price), it was cheaply made. We had to request replacement screws as the original one's didn't work as the nuts didn't have any threads (which was an easy enough process over email). But it ended up that this didn't fix the problem due to what seemed to be a defect in the frame and we had to return it.     A few other issues:   *the net at the bottom was too loose to actually hold anything.   *the wheels didn't stay put (which was mentioned in many of the reviews).   *And I can't imagine using this as a toy box would last long with any children plus there is no top so it is an open box and as it uses the \\"legs\\" of the bassinet so 2 of the sides aren't fully enclosed.     The overall idea of this bassinet is great but the quality is extremely low. We didn't expect super quality based on the price and the reviews, but this just didn't seem like a safe product and in the end I felt that our Pack'n'Play was safer & wiser choice then trying to get a replacement for the defective one we received. I will say it was relatively easy to put together (aside from the fact that due to the defect in our frame that we couldn't get one of the screws in).
B00INGNYXS|5|Very good.
B002QZ64T8|4|These get the job done and are a nice addition to the Bummis Easy Fits (love those diapers!). My only real issue with them is that even $5 seems like a lot for what you get. It is a very thin fleece lining. Obviously, this is a good thing because they don't add a lot of bulk to the diaper, but I think you should get more than 5 for the price.
B00081J3N6|5|gets the job done
B000096QQ5|5|SOOOOO worth it.  Get these, new mamas!<br /><br />I use this to sterilize my pump parts.  Since I am a full time working mama, I use these at work and it makes it really easy to keep everything in order and clean.  I highly recommend these bags for pumping moms.
B00073HJG8|5|This is a wonderful hammock. It holds almost all of my kids' stuffed animals. I think it is holding more than 200 toys. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made.
B000GPRTH6|5|Fit my Burlington bassinet perfectly like a glove. The soft pastel green is very pretty. It's a nice change instead of having everything blue for boys
B0055PIU0M|5|lovely idea it worked perfect for my granddaughter Christinaing
B006WR01L8|5|At first I thought this cover would be too big for my newborn/infant but I used it the last two weeks (she's 4 weeks now) and it fits. It definitely looks bulky on the bum but it fits and nothing has seeped out of the gussets and the baby went from 6lbs 11oz to 7lbs 11oz. Her thighs are on the skinny side.
B00KAG1KH6|4|Couldn't find a five pack anywhere else. Love the fact that they came with medium sized regular nipples. Leaks at first like all playtex bottles but serves the purpose and my twins love them.
B0009ANJOU|3|I loved this item until I tried to find refills.  I wasted a lot of time searching for refills at scrapbook stores, and anywhere else I could find them.  Nothing fit.  I even called and e-mailed Carters and the Gift Wrap Company (who manufactures the book for Carters).  Carters referred me to the Gift Wrap Company, but the Gift Wrap Company did not return my e-mails or my phone call.  The only redeeming factor for Carters is that they let me return the book for a store credit without a problem.
B00CD4VLR2|5|everything needed in kit will use it a long time good quality easy to use step up use as baby grows
B0081CFDLA|5|This is a darling crib set. It's well made, fits well, and looks very nice on either a dark wood or white crib.
B001QD0L0Y|5|The picture was a little misleading showing two caps, made me think I was getting two. If you really look though it's a cap in a bag and a cap out of a bag. But still cute though. Runs a bit big, but will fit soon enough.
B00EKP8BWK|5|Fit perfectly on a pink car seat previously used for a girl. Saved money not having to buy a whole new one. And it is very cute.
B000E0KN5I|5|Fantastic baby monitors. We have had them for three years and have never had a problem with them. We really like them.
B002968T5G|5|I have tried multiple other pumping bras and this is by far the best one. I love how soft it is and easy to put on and take off.
B000UCHISU|5|This car seat is good for a couple reasons - has a long life starting with newborn, up to 80lbs (I think), which gets you into the booster seat range.  I didn't use this when my son was a newborn, but it works both rear and forward facing.    For a forward facing seat, it has a recline option which is really nice when car naps are necessary.  The padding makes the seat comfortable, or at least seems as though it should be.  Gray color is nice to hide any stains, but at the same time the fabric seems to clean up nicely when needed.    I would highly recommend this car seat.
B003UBFN2Q|3|I really like the full folding floor mat, its really convenient and easy to store away...just one thing about it that bugs me is that, its not as comfortable to lay on b/c it's really hard, not like a futon...but besides that, its really great to have when you have guests over to sleep on.
B00EBRAJR2|3|I really liked this bag when I first got it.  However, after using it for less than 2 weeks one of the zippers broke.  I returned the product to Amazon and got a refund.  I was disappointed in the zipper breaking because my husband and I really liked the bag.  It is a great price and it is a great material with several outside pockets, which is nice for mom.  I was hoping it would just be a bit better made.
B008YPL8R2|2|Disappointed. Thought that they were lasers that you could point on the ground to play with my dog.  Great for kids to play outside at night.  That would be fun.
B000YDDF6O|5|The music options are great , at any age !<br />This toy will be a big hit , when my Grandson arrives .
B004IM8PDU|5|These are perfect for day trips. I can put them inside his bottles and it is easy and I'm not having to search for formula and bottles in my diaper bag because they are all in one place!
B00AROD4D4|5|I loved this movie as a child and now my children do and both have a 101 Dalmatians blanket, but not the same one.
B00NAE1R2I|2|This has good absorbency and it is super cute. However, it is so tight on my 18 lb baby and the Velcro folds over and rubs my baby's tummy raw. Maybe on a smaller baby this would be ok.
B00M0OKPWW|1|flimsy cheap not worth the money.
B00SIG6Q5G|2|Nice towel , just not very big. Mostly for infant! Not for as big a child as picture shows, they wouldn't be able to sit on it!
B002A9JCVW|5|I've been very pleased with this drying rack.  I received this as a gift when my first daughter was born in 2010.  It's been on my counter ever since.  We are long past the bottle stage but it still works well for the sippy cups and kids silverware. It has held up nicely.  It would make a nice shower gift for a new mom.
B0038JE650|5|When I bought this product, I was looking for a simple, reasonably priced, way to simply close my bath tub drain to take a bath! Since I've received this product, it has been extremely easy to do this. I just place the product over the drain, turn on the water, and you have a bath. Easy to place, and easy to remove. 5 stars
B000056HNZ|5|I was skeptical about using a hand pump, and felt like it would be awkward at work, but it was perfect. a compact setup with everything I needed and able to put a few extra in it as well. Easy to use, once you get the hang of it, quick and efficient.
B00EV323KW|5|This was purchased for my 2 year old grandson, who loves Elmo. I put photos of family members and pets in the sleeves and made labels with their names. In the first photo sleeve I made a cute &#34;table of contents&#34; page and titled the book, &#34;The People Who Love Nicholas&#34;. He looks through it all the time and names the people included. The album is cute, toddler appropriate, and something he goes to time after time.
B000TFMJEG|5|LOVE this blankie!  My son has already lost 2 of them so we are on our 3rd one.  They wash super well and come out softer every time.  My 8 month old loves rubbing it on his face during nap and bedtime.  The little elephant head is the perfect size as well.  Not too big where it would take away from being an actual blankie.
B0080E6AJI|5|I ordered these for my Granddaughter's baby. They came in excellent time, & she is quite pleased. I thought these were a very good buy, & their reviews were all favorable, so I thought they would be a good product. So far, we are all well pleased.
B000LXQVA4|5|Fabulous Christmas present for my 6 month old grandson!!  Easy to assemble.  Safe and well built. He loves it!!  Ideal for a baby of this age. Would definitely recommend it.
B012LM5JD2|5|Cutest bubs out there!  Quality material, awesome theme.
B008C0R684|5|It's great to have the base in two cars without having to buy two car seats. My husband and I use one car seat and two bases. It's easy to install and not have to worry about moving it around.
B000066CMV|5|I had great luck with this pump after I tried it in the shower. The water helps to create a suction, and get the milk flowing. You don't want to use this milk though because you are just practicing and it may have soap or water in it. Do try pumping afterwards. My lactation specialist recommended this.  So for you first time users I suggest this.  I also dropped my pump and had it break.  I called Avent and told them I needed to order a new part.  They asked what was wrong with it and I told them that the funnel was cracked.  They sent me a new one and it works better than the first one because it's a whole piece instead of in two parts. Less air is getting in to prevent a suction. So they took care of me and now I am pumping away. The Avent pump is more like my son's suckling. I also suggest not pressing the handle all the way down when pumping, it creates better suction if you don't. These are just a few suggestions.  So good luck to breastfeeding mothers.
B00E6UMJBS|2|The shipping of this item is very hard on the crib and came with several pretty severe scrapes and scratches on various parts of the crib.  It looks very nice and the color is beautiful but, between the one we bought for our son 2 years ago at Baby depot the quality of the wood is def not as sturdy and of the same quality.  They were both 400.00.  So for the money we spent on both, I was disappointed in the million dollar baby crib.  Also, our sons cam with the pieces to convert to a bed...This one it is extra 99.00.
B000X4WORU|3|My husband and I bought this for our 3rd baby when she was 3 weeks old.  She is very fussy during the day and doesn't like to be put down, but will sleep beautifully if she lays on my chest, so we figured this would be helpful to being able to get things done around the house without her screaming.  When we got it home, my husband (who is an engineer and generally has no difficulty putting things together and following diagrams) attempted to help me put the Moby wrap on and then put our daughter in to it.  She screamed and protested very loudly and wasn't in securely, as I tried leaning forward and she nearly fell out.  After several more attempts, he recommended that we return it to the store.  Later on, when she was calmer, I re-attempted this myself and did successfully get her positioned, but it was very awkward dealing with the ends, which basically hang on the floor until the very end while attempting the hold the baby in place while I wrapped myself.  (I used the kangaroo hold for her.)  I will say that she does sleep very well in it, but I do find myself holding her head while I move around with her, just because it doesn't seem very secure just tucked into a piece of cloth.  On a positive note, I can keep up a little more easily with my older children having both hands free.  Ultimately, I am hoping this gets easier with practice!
B00DYEK5S6|4|Good for clothing and schoolwork items but not for the garage.  I was expecting something more rugged but the price was low and it does function.
B00Q3A7T7I|5|I was really wary to order this, as I'm not a big homeopathic person. But after drugging our son with Motrin for 3 straight weeks through very painful teething, we decided we'd try anything. What a miracle. I kid you not, 48 hours we started noticing a difference, and 24 more after that we stopped the Motrin altogether. We only have to give him drugs on the really tough days which seem to be very few and far between. He didn't even notice when I put this on and never plays with it. I never take it off, and he seems okay with that too. I think I'll be buying these for all my mommy friends!
B000LEG1PS|4|love this for on the go.
B0018LYOW0|4|This is a great chair, the perfect size and very sturdy. Since it's made out of foam, it's light enough to move easily from place to place. We got it for Christmas for our 17-month-old baby, so he's a little younger than the recommended 2 years. He hasn't quite warmed up to it yet (he's used to sitting on the floor), but he has sat himself in it and seems to find a chair his size an interesting concept! I would have given it five stars, but I believe it's a smidge overpriced. We did get free shipping on it, so that mitigated the price a little and made me happier about the purchase. I believe we'll get years of use from the Little Reader Chair!
B000O3GCFU|5|We use this A LOT! It keeps food warm and beverage cool. But be careful to wash the lid really good, otherwise mold accumulates.
B0011H804O|1|I don't know what this stuff is, but it's so sticky that it's impossible to use. We rolled it out five times. Like others, I had problems with the dowel sticking to the stuff, but I solved that with a second piece of parchment paper on top, so it wasn't difficult to do over... it just soon became clear that the problem was the stuff sticking to my child's hand. Even with a perfectly flat surface and a decently still kid, trying to pull her hand back out of the mess completely deformed the project and left huge tufts of whatever all over her hand. We tried hands. We tried feet. We tried hands again. Then we wadded it up and stuffed it back in the bag to try to figure out some way use it. But I'll tell you right now, my instinct is that this stuff is a mess and should not be used ever, by anyone.
B009JV34RC|4|it is my toddler sons first &#34;big boy&#34; pillow. He seems to enjoy it even thou i still find it on the floor most mornings. You do have to buy the pillow case from them or you will have a difficult time locating one.
B00EFQXOTO|5|I bought this for my newest grand daughter and my daughters reports that is the best high chair she has had (three precious sons).<br /><br />Her favorite feature is the ease of keeping it clean and sanitary -- there aren't a lot of places for germs to hide.
B000I2MRLU|5|We bought this for our baby and also received the Lamaze peacock as a gift.  Our baby definitely prefers the moose.  We started him off with the peacock since it's a little smaller, but he never played with it much.  At first we thought he was too young to appreciate it so kept placing the peacock in his lap and shaking it encouragingly at him.  But he continued to ignore it.  Finally, spurred by my friend (who told me her baby was reaching for toys that have a ring on one end), I busted out the moose, which has rings on its butt, and offered it encouragingly to our little boy. He still won't reach for it, but he definitely loves it, grabs onto it when we put it in his lap, and stares at it intently when it's not in his lap.  He will play with it and wrestle it, and my husband told me that our nanny goes to the bedroom to find it for him all the time because she also noticed that he likes it.<br /><br />In hindsight, we think he likes the moose better because it's easier for him to handle.  The spindly legs are easy for small hands to wrap around, and he likes hanging onto the scarf.  He chews on the antlers, and the nose, and yes, the butt.  The two rings on the butt make a clinking sound that he also likes and he hangs onto that part as well.<br /><br />The peacock is a little too bulky we think and doesn't have any easy-to-grab parts besides the ring, which now that I think about it is the only part he ever played with. He'd grab the ring and put his mouth on it.  Perhaps we will revisit the peacock when he's older to play with the different parts of the tail, but for any kid who likes noisy toys and has basic motor skills of grabbing things and putting it in his/her mouth, this moose is a hit.<br /><br />Note: this toy is MACHINE WASHABLE(!!!).  It says so on the tag and makes me very happy.  Our peacock says \\"surface wash only.\\"  We haven't machine-washed him yet (but we plan to).  I did rinse him under the sink and let him air dry before handing him to our kid and he fared beautifully.and he fared beautifully.
B004KM6G52|5|Product arrived in perfect condition and was exactly what I expected.  Thank you!
B007BEHSDU|3|Works good
B00006966I|5|When my husband and I had our first child (5 mos. ago) we had registered for the Avent bottles.  Little did we know, but soon came to find out, that the formula was just pouring out of our little one's mouth, even using a stage 1 nipple.  We tried Gerber, Dr. Browns, and Evenflo bottles and none of them compare to the VentAire bottles. <br /> <br />They cause her no gas at all.  And, the nipples are just right for her.  With the stage 1 nipples, she gets formula only.  However, when the ped recommended thickening her formula, we switched to the stage 2 nipples, and she does great with them. <br /> <br />Now, when we have #2, we will be sure to use these bottles.
B002ZB8298|4|Our son slept in a crib in our room for the first three months of his life.  At that point we decided he needed to move to his own room.  We wanted the piece of mind that he was safe in his own room (right next door) and other monitors just didn't give us that.  SIDS is constantly a fear.  A friend recommended this monitor.  Yes, it is a bit pricey but absolutely worth every penny!  The pendulum is nice, I can look at that and know he is okay instead of having to sneak into his room as often.  The reception is great!  When the windows are open, a barking dog outside our house was actually louder on the monitor than it was in our room (on the same side of the house as our sons)!  We have had multiple false alarms but they are all due to him being off the sensor pad.  If the sensor pad was bigger that would be nice but it is also somewhat reassuring when you have a false alarm- you know the product is actually working! Definatly the best purchase we have made for our son!    If I can reccommend another product in relation to the prevention of SIDS... We kept our sons crib completely empty of any blankets and even a bumper because of the risk of SIDS.  Then as he got a little older he would roll around so much his poor little arms and legs would get stuck in the crib slats not to mention the many games of \\"find the binky on the floor\\" in the middle of the night because it rolled out of his crib.  I started looking online and found this bumper.  It really is breathable and keeps all his limbs, and binkys, in his crib.  We rest so much better now at night knowing our son is breathing all the time and he isn't in any pain because he got his limb stuck in a slot.  I can't recommend these two products enough!

B00AJSJCBG|4|I like everything about this jumper, except that i was not able to use it.  I dont have the right doorways to be able to use it.
B007NG5UF4|3|I bought this because so many people love it.<br /><br />The biggest con is that the battery does not last. So we have to keep it plugged in. But for the price it has a great range. My house is old so the walls are thick, and I can still hear my baby loud and clear downstairs.
B00005JSAH|5|I love this travel system.  It is SO easy to collapse the stroller and to lift.  I do not have a lot of arm strength, so this was a must.  The seat is a bit heavy (although my friends with kids laugh at this when compared to theirs).  You cannot access the bottom storage with the seat down (duh), but we've found alternatives until he is sitting up in the stroller.
B00C4PVC6A|1|Would return, but it is too much hassle.  Package written all in Chinese--should have read the reviews more carefully!
B003HS5JPS|5|It is a favorite crib toy. He can hold it, stare at it, just have fun and play with this wonder toy.
B003Y53YR4|5|i live in gravel and love it easy to fold and light weight
B001O4CE3W|5|Took awhile to put together but looks nice when finished.
B009R27JJC|5|I use these for my diaper genie. It fits OK.
B006YBHE6M|3|I have mixed feelings about this thing. I bought it when my LO was a few months old, and never really used it until a few months later. Like other reviews, the batteries do drain pretty fast, but name brand ones will last longer than store brands. Also like other reviews the sea animals stopped moving after not very long. However, because the mechanism was quite noisy (again like others have said) I didn't mind. She learned how to kick the starfish button to turn it on, and now she's 14 months and goes to sleep with it every night. She will even get up and turn it on when she wakes and will go back to sleep on her own (yay!).<br /><br />I don't so much mind the repetition in th music, and babies like predictability so I figure it works out. I don't find the lights to be too bright, or at least it doesn't bother her. The way it gets quieter and more dim before turning off is a nice touch. I never used the remote. If it would work through the door (the unit is almost literally right on the other side) then it would be brilliant, but it doesn't, so I just try to sneak an arm in through the door to hit the button when needed.<br /><br />To sum up, it's a nice idea but it's poorly executed as far as quality goes for the cost. I actually find that it's better without the moving animals because of the noise, and it would probably be too distracting otherwise. They could just as well make it with a lights/sounds option with no movement. BUT, if your kid loves it as much as mine does and grows to be able to use it to put themselves back to sleep then it's priceless (an extra hour of sleep on weekends PRICELESS). I would happily buy another one if this one croaks.
B00EY8PV1W|5|I've never owned an Ergo but I have owned high end carriers in the past (baby hawk OS and Mei tais) and would have to say that the one I received seems well made. The stitching is durable, comes with X stitching at the base of all the straps. I pulled and tugged at every strap and not one stitch was weakened. It also comes with the secure strap loops in case the strap slips or buckle slips.<br />For the price, you cannot go wrong. If you feel the need to, you can always find someone with a sewing maching to help reinforce the stitching but honestly, the one I received does not need it.<br />The shipping took about 2 weeks.
B002SW3B0O|5|The generous size is the reason I bought these.  My son keeps kicking his legs out of the rectangular cotton blankets we have, the standard flannel receiving blankets have long been useless, and the one from the hospital is too think.  When I opened the package, I was skeptical.  But now, I'm in love.  They're big enough to swaddle him, I love how lightweight they are, and they feel so nice to the touch.  I wish we had bought these from the start.
B0009OLSZ8|5|I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.<br /><br />I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.<br /><br />I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- High back to help support baby<br />- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floor<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Haven't thought of any yet<br /><br />I bought a second one of these to leave at day care.
B0042MUJAS|5|After watching a video review by kiddiecare on youtube, I decided to purchase this item for my first grandchild. Baby, parents (& nana) LOVED it! It has pockets on each end for storage, plus storage underneath. This size is very easy to move around the house. Folds like a pack n play, so it's great for travel! Can be used as free standing bassinet or co-sleeper. I did find mine online for less money.<br /><br />I also wanted to add...while it's not as easy to set up / fold up as a pack n play, once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy.
B00ALOT55Q|4|Great for keeping your kids in place when you need to get things done.<br /><br />When your child starts crawling/walking it's a tough time for parents.  You have to always keep your eye on them making sure they are not causing trouble, climbing something, or the slight chance they may hurt themselves.  This play yard keeps them in check.<br /><br />It was a fairly quick easy set up.  We placed it in our living room and filled it with toys.<br />The product is sturdy and fairly portable if need be.  (However, I wouldn't recommend traveling long distance with this as it does take up a good amount of space and a bit heavy.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a bit overpriced and the extra pieces if you want to extend it are pricey also but based on other sellers and all baby stuff in general you're sort of limited in options.
B004G8QT1Q|4|WAS REALLY EASY TO ADJUST FOR THE BABY AND SHE LOVES PLAYING WITH THE TOYS THAT'S ATTACHED IT IS SO CUTE
B008ESOI9O|3|Quality was not what I expected
B001IYRTWE|5|Soft cuddly and no pieces for little chewers. Perfect to put in the Easter Basket for my teething 10 month old granddaughter that put everything in her month these days.
B004S8MGGQ|4|Makes pumping life so much easier!
B001Q80GO0|4|Let me start by explaining that my baby is 11lbs 4ozs, 22.5 inches long and was born two weeks late (seems to have more control over his body/head that most newborns), so what works for him might not work for your baby, but I wanted to write what I thought since reviews are so integral to making the best purchases! :)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very Sturdy Material, Breathable but Warm (important for my winter baby! :)<br /><br />Easy to Get Baby In and Out - I also have an Infantino Carrier which I find to more difficult to use than this carrier.<br /><br />Subdued Design - I'm the type of person that wants my baby close but doesn't want to feel like I'm wearing 2 extra shirts, which is the feeling I got with the wrap style carriers. This kept him up high and close without making me feel uncomfortable!<br /><br />Comfortable - The Support strap that goes around your back is VERY comfortable! It's nicely padded and really wide.<br /><br />Adjustable - This carrier would fit a wide range of sizes and its easy to figure out how to get your perfect fit since there is only ONE strap to adjust, unlike my other carrier that had like 6 different buckles - UGH!<br /><br />Elastic Edges - They are fabulous because they securely hold the baby close to you and are nicely padded so they are comfortable against the baby and you.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Awkward at First- The only thing that made it a little awkward at first was the placement of the rings, you have to play around with the fit of it to make sure the rings aren't hitting your collarbone (ouch!) but this is a very minor and easily fixed since its completely adjustable.<br /><br />Too Deep - This is my only big warning about this carrier. In my opinion,the pocket was waaay too deep for my baby to safely be in the &#34;Cradle Hold&#34;, where the baby &#34;lays&#34; down in the sling. Now if you read the beginning of my review you understand that I have a HUGE newborn, so the  fact that someone would try the Cradle Hold withan even smaller baby than mine makes me nervous. This is just a precaution and will take some experimentation on your part with your own baby.<br /><br />I will say this is an overall GREAT carrier!! My baby LOVES the &#34;Cuddle Hold&#34;, where he sits snuggled up next to me in it, I think he feels like he is being hugged all the time :) :)
B000056HNZ|4|I am really impressed by how fast this pump works.  It is really convenient and easy to use.  Sometimes it squeaks but if you move it around a bit it normally stops.  I find myself using it more than my expensive electric pump because it is so much easier to assemble and doesn't keep me strapped to some machine, and it is just as fast!  I love it!  4 stars because of the squeaking...otherwise it is awesome!
B0018Z2BO4|5|Fits well seems comfortable. My toddler seems to like it.
B00H7LIQX8|3|It runs a little small I think. I only used it once and I suppose it might have been a little late in the game because my baby didn't really like it (1mos old). But then, she likes to stretch out, so maybe this just depends on your baby's personality.
B00E8KJYNC|3|Works well as long as you flow the directions. Yes there are certain discs for different types of formula, so it does make it a bit hard to change when and if you need to try another formula. Also, like it says in the directions, you need to clean the funnel and the dispensing part after each use. Worth it if you are capable of following directions! We love ours and how quickly it helps us out!
B000PY67G2|1|They are super soft but as I opened them up to toss them in the wash before using I had 3 diapers that the snaps just popped off and flew across the floor. I would hate for my toddler to put broken snaps in her mouth. Besides, $18.50 is a lot for a diaper that seems thinner that I expected and snaps wont last. These might carry the Bummis name but once you get them (and u can see it in the Amazon picture, look closely) the little blue tag says TotsBots which is in the UK and they don't make any diaper I have tried that is any good. USA made diapers are much better and WAHM make much better diapers. I will stick with Ebay and WAHM's diapers. What a waste of money for 5 diapers here!!!
B0002JETNS|4|The gate was a little stiff when trying to bend it into shape. We use it to gaurd our treadmill from little baby fingers. It is perfect for what we are using it for.
B00GUN41JC|5|This was given to my nephew. It is AMAZING. It's easy to set up, it's tough, it's light and strong, it's a decent size. It's easy to clean, it's attractive, and I do believe it will manage to outlast the child despite how active and rough-and-tumble he is.<br /><br />If you're considering getting this, I urge you to do it. This was the best money we've spent on baby stuff yet.<br /><br />And if you don't know if your kid needs a playpen, get this anyway. You can take it with you anywhere, it packs down small enough it could even be a carry-on item, and it works great for keeping at (or taking to) Grandmother's house for visits.
B001D150W8|4|When it comes to baby stuff I am always looking or things that fit into our house without screaming BABY has taken over. Additionally I'm a sucker for baby stuff that has multiple functions or can grow with your child. As a result this was the perfect chair for us. It's extremely well made and looks great. I love that it allows baby to sit right at the table with us. It's easy to put together. The only tricky part Is to make sure you put the seat and foot rest in BEFORE you tighten the screws otherwise they will not slide in. I find the straps difficult to adjust bit other than that it's an easy, well made, practical choice. Despite the price tag and expense add ons I would buy it again.
B00NFETDRY|5|My LO loves it!!! Very sturdy and comfortable.
B0037NXP18|5|I love this bag for diapers. It is such a durable, nice. Quality. Washes well with no smell doesn't leak. I know it will keep on lasting through many kids diapers and beyond. Its a great hamper liner for clothes as well. We take it on vacation for our dirty clothes. Works great for damp swimwear and wetsuits too.<br /><br />It never has a smell after you wash and we often put it in the dryer along with other clothes. It does great. Very satisfied with my wet /dry diaper pail liner.
B00HETP0JQ|5|I love it. Absolutely amazing. I bought it for my niece for her birthday *1 years* and she finds it hard to leave the swing. Assembly was a bit of a hassle but once assembled, the swing itself is pretty sturdy. One of the only cons I noticed is the placing for the head. It could use a bit more softening. I just use soft cloth. BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. Do remember that when you buy the swing.
B000A796WG|5|A very well made gate for the price. Keeps our Maltese pooch out of the 2nd bedroom. Plastic easy to clean. Free shipping. Great value!  Very happy with purchase.
B00FBF38Z8|5|This is a great diaper clutch that is easy to drop in a larger bag for a more extended outing or in the basket under the stroller for a quick outing to the park when you don't want to take a larger diaper bag.  It's surprisingly roomy - I'm able to fit a small, portable changing pad (from my SkipHop changing wallet that tore), a travel size container of wipes (about 60 wipes when full), 3 size-3 diapers and a small tube of sunscreen.  I wish it had a small strap to carry it around my wrist or to hook it to a stroller, but even without, I would purchase this again!
B002RT8O4Q|4|I love the grobaby cloth diapers.     They are very trim yet very absorbent.  The fit is fantastic b/c there is so much give in the pull tabs and the snaps work great for the length.      I love the all in two system which allows me to reuse the shell when my daughter has tinkled.  The downer is that cleaning up the poo isn't as easy, b/c often it isn't contained to just the liner, but has also spread to the shell.     However, the biosoaker [[ASIN:B002RJ96PW Gro Baby Bio Soaker Pads 50-Count, White, Size 1]]has a great elasticy cuff which contains the poo and is an excellent fix to this problem.  Not to mention that it is disposable!      Traveling with the grobaby is also great b/c usually all I have to do is through a biosoaker or an organic cotton liner in my coat pocket b/c they're both so compact.    Overall this is a great diaper that I would like to have more of in my stash!
B001D7KNYW|5|Great product
B001OC5UNK|5|Looks great and works as described!
B002XLI70O|2|The primary function of this device is to transmit video to a remote monitor and it does a satisfactory job of that.  Its range is 200' at most but I live in New York City where the amount of interference is very high so I'll settle for that.  Everything else about this device is shoddy and its design suggests that very little thought was put into it.  Here's a list of what I think are significant flaws.    TRANSMITTER DESIGN:  It's very light for its bulky size.  There should be a clamp and a swan/flexible neck so the camera can be mounted on something like a crib and pointed in any direction you want.  As it is, it has to sit on a flat surface - in my case that's a table or the rail of the crib.  For the latter the unit needs to be balanced ever so perfectly because even the very skinny power cord is enough to pull the unit over on account of it's light weight and smooth underside.    RECEIVER DESIGN:  The same problems I just mentioned also apply to the receiver.  It seems very light for its size.  The base is narrower than the rest of the unit and is also smooth, hard plastic.  Keeping it upright and pointed in the right direction is difficult unless you wedge it between other objects.  Again the power cord, flimsy as it is, is enough to spin this thing right around with even the slightest jostle.  A wide set of three legs with rubber stoppers would do wonders for this device.  Also, the buttons are cheap and too small for someone with larger hands.    VOLUME:  Most audio devices have a scale from one to ten, this device's scale looks more like this: 0, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10.  Which is to say it's either silent, loud or louder.  Yes, I want it loud when I'm asleep so that it wakes me up but if I'm reading or doing some other quiet activity I don't need every creak or slight noise echoing through my apartment.  Which brings me to my next complaint:    AUDIO DELAY:  The reviewer that likened it to poltergeist got it perfectly.  The offset causes everything that's picked up by the transmitter to have it's own echo.  Sometimes a sound can be heard live, then the echo is heard, then the monitor picks up the echo and \\"re-echos\\" it.  I feel like I'm in the Swiss Alps.    BATTERY LIFE:  It's much shorter than I expected.  It seems like they went overboard in cutting manufacturing costs.    Anyway, I hope there are better devices out there.  In the meantime this one will to the job, barely.
B000COUO8W|5|This is sooooo much better than the Graco sheets. It's thick and soft, especially after washing. It fits the Graco full-size Pack 'n' Play perfectly. The texture is great as well, keeps my little one from slipping around the bed.
B0058VTU7U|5|It's useful and convenient. My daughter and I both like it.
B00PX8PQBW|4|Love it.  It was easy to put together and seems very cozy for my little one.
B0072JKVQA|5|This was absolutely adorable and the mom-to-be loved it. Such a different style stuffed animal for a baby girl and the socks were delightful. Big hit at the shower. Definitely  recommend this to for any little baby plus their is a boy style available as well.
