B005C5C25O|4|worked but way too expensive for small bracket
B00M1OUBES|5|it's very nice and good
B0002SRL20|5|Very nice gauge.  Well built and accurate.  Perfect of my dually tire/wheels.
B00WXBYYR4|5|Hella price, and AC is cool.
B004GC8FGE|3|California-driver sideswiped me, hit and run. The Patriot gave as good as it got. His/her Honda mirror fell completely off . They kept driving.<br />Regarding quality this is about 70% of the original. Gaps where the molding doesn't quite conform to the body. Good enough for the price. Cosmetically you can't tell the difference. Functionally If you're bumping your sub this unit vibs right along, the stock one doesn't. Mirror swivel is loose and mirror drifts off center. Packaged in a nice reusable felt bag. Good to go. To the sucker that hit me. Speed on; Hell ain't half full!
B000IYR5R4|3|The condenser itself fit perfectly into my 03 Impreza.  However.... The bottom fitting (the line that goes from the condenser back toward the low pressure side) did not line up EXACTLY like the old one.  Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue, because when you begin to bolt this baby in, threading that bolt will make any slight misalignment a non-issue.  Trouble is, the cheap material (what I am assuming is aluminum) that those threads were make of began to strip quicker than a drunk sorority girl.  I say that jokingly, but seriously, the threads stripped bad and fast.  I spent at least an hour fixing this...  I am a solid weekend warrior mechanic, so this wasn't my first rodeo.  I had those threads lined up perfectly when I started threading the bolt, so I was obviously very frustrated when I started seeing them strip.  Anyways, I drilled a hole completely through the bracket (on the OEM condensers, the hole is all the way through, however on these it is not), tapped the same threading all the way through, went out and bought a new and longer bolt (I think the bolt here is a 6mm 1.0), and a locking nut and that worked.  I vacuumed out the system and recharged it, and so far so good.  No leaks, condenser works, and for the most part fits like a glove.  Also as a minor side note, I had to loosen and realign the bracket on the dryer.  That was no big deal, took 30 seconds.  If it wasn't for the threads stripping so easily and causing me a huge headache this would definitely get 5 stars, but that debacle cost me all in all like 3 extra hours of work...
B007PIZ8SY|2|Like others have said, the reception issues don't make up for the aesthetic boost. It's not worth the $.
B00A2VI752|5|Great item
B003F2T41G|5|Bought for my daughters 110CC Chinese 4-wheeler Nice spark, works great.
B000CKRWL8|3|This was the first &#34;lockable&#34; trailer hitch pin I ever purchased.  Installation was straighforward, but did involve some time spent on my back under the rear bumper of my car, banging the little sleeve with a hammer/screwdriver to get it to go into the hole far enough so that the lock could be installed.  It's not the simplest thing I can imagine to install, and removal will almost certainly be an adventure as well.  For this reason, and because the directions lacked any mention of these challenges, I am giving it three stars even though, as far as functionality once installed, it's a 5 star product.
B00V2XHQ4W|5|really nice bar. its defiantly water proof. i have this on the roof of my golf cart and it stays out side all the time and it has not had any water leak in yet. light turns night into day. only problem is i get a ton of complaints on how bright it is!
B001P2HWC6|4|Just what I needed. Good construction but only four stars as the visibility labels don't adhere well and the safety flag is a bit on the underwhelming side.
B00V2SC01Q|5|Nicr.fot
B00X8DE6ZG|5|Perfect fit.  Does not fog due to ample ventilation.  clear non-distorting lenses.  Blocked wind above 60 mp just fine. They are well ventilated and dust might be an issue if using on dusty roads.
B000COD19G|4|Pretty good wire but it looked like the package was pretty old because it was faded pretty bad but that don't affect the wire at all.
B00UULX2ZE|5|Fits perfectly! Need to assemble in the console.
B004AGTQZK|4|works just fine at keeping my beverage warmer than with no lid.  Plus I don't spill as much.  Fair price by todays standards.  Prime shipping was what tilted me to this cup.
B003W8FX90|5|This is an awesome addition to my truck.....
B001AD1GEA|5|Easy as pie to install! Works great in the Texas sun.
B00F9E72YO|5|Great
B001LQOSP0|5|Fits perfectly on my Jeep Wrangler.  Would do business with again
B000CB6FOM|5|Bouncy no more.
B00YVQD4A2|5|These are one of the better designs i have seen for sunglasses holders. They grip well but not to much to cause harm. I would recommend these to anyone.
B00681BE2S|5|Accurate adverstisement.  Good quality remote.  Good communications with seller.  Thank you.
B00GNDZJC2|5|it fit and its a filter.
B004GCGZC0|1|Terrible choice.  Didn't work, had to discard it.<br />It's just a lame plastic imitation product that is not very useful.<br />First, it comes with no hardware - no screws, no screw mounts, no tape, nothing!<br />They don't list anything else and you don't get the hardware needed to mount this bracket.<br />Second, it's plastic and it cracks or breaks easily, making it a poor choice.<br />However, I did order hardware in addition - the screw kits with square nylon backups.<br />I was not able to get the hardware to work with this plate and there is no way to bolt on a license plate, even if you did manage to screw this thing to your bumper.<br /><br />There are better products, made of metal, that ship with the appropriate set of screws and hardware needed.<br /><br />I did figure out a way to install this on my ridding mower, but I would never waste the time to mount it on a car.  That front license plate is easily stollen, if the thief only has to snap off a plastic license plate holder.  And, this one is weak enough to snap or strip through the screw heads.
B00CGCONVW|4|Great looking product! It is very classy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm thinking the VERY shiny background might not be so shiny after a winter or two. I'd recommend it though for the price. Love it.
B00Q1HGGWC|3|Brighter than the LED I have before don't fee like they are brighter than stock. wish I could get stupid bright.
B001NZQIDE|5|Plugged into my truck and the controller, worked the first time. Wires were a bit long, but that's better than too short.
B000GU0YFK|5|No complaints about these at all. Putting the spring washers in so there is enough tension to hold the pegs in the stored position so they don't rattle is tricky. They work very well but they are not that easy to slide in the space for them. I left them out at first so I could ride. No problem.
B000EDST1K|5|worked fine. fit our stove top perfect.
B005HEJ24Y|5|Another great Wolfman product !
B0081XO50Y|1|Bad fitment. Poor design. Faulty water proofing. Does not use OE 9006 bulbs. Expect to use zip ties, duck tape, super glue and reverse common sense to install :) enjoy these wonderful pieces of Taiwanese junk.
B00FB3GDXE|1|This is the worst thing I have ever ordered in my life.<br />Are you seriously selling these successfully?<br />If you want good car decals just buy them in a auto shop or at your local Walmart. Saves you money and avoiding this.
B007GCDM46|5|Works!
B0007CIHTM|5|The plugs work great. I've plugged at least 4 tires over the years and never failed.
B0023VFDD8|5|Its perfect..thank you
B003ZN730O|5|great product at great price
B007IVQZ5S|4|Fit my husbands 93 Chevy k2500 pickup great. A little flimsy feeling but great for the price.
B00MIZT7OK|5|Sturdy! Great little source of added protection. Be careful though, you'll get stopped at concerts, baseball games etc. They may take it.
B0042HU3GS|5|This wax goes on and comes off very easy.  Have applied once by hand and once with a DA machine,  and got fantastic results both times.  Very deep glossy shine.
B00GOW6VAQ|5|The polar white cover looked great and is solid.  Assembly took 5 minutes or so with the correct tools.  Time will tell on the quality of plastic and its UV protection.  Yes I would recommend to a friend and purchase again.
B007HUGX2U|1|didn't like these, BMW LOGO is a sticker
B00JBI9SIW|5|Exactly what I was looking for in a replacement headlamp. 100% happy with these.
B0002UQAXY|5|Fine.
B00FBKWNN6|4|Really good! No issues. 6000k 2011 jeep jk
B00EU1GGGC|5|Fit in my '14 CX-5 nicely.  Only took 5 minutes to swap out the broken one.  Seems to look & function exactly like stock.  It came with bulbs and bulb sockets, so now I have an extra set!
B007JOHHWY|5|These are great product they will be a day you won't be able to buy the whole headlight this solves that
B00O83OAGU|5|I was about to return the brake light when I saw the blue end tips. But after researching and reading a few reviews it was simple to figure it out. 1st I removed the 2 screws. Twisted and removed the light bulbs from old housing. Pulled out the light bulbs from their socket and insert blue end tips into socket. And thats it! It was simple and easy. I had my mom press on the brakes and turn on the lights to test it before I screwed it back on. The package came on time, thank you Amazon.
B005SUX810|1|It doesn't even fit my Atv an there's not enough clutch disks in the package
B001KSEJBW|5|Fit perfectly into my 2010 Hyundai Elantra.
B00TQ6OIFM|5|Really nice looking.  Our previous faucet in our rv bath sink was so close to the sink you couldn't really wash your hands.  This spouts higher and farther out so that the bath faucet becomes functional.  Before getting this we were having to use the kitchen sink for washing hands.  Also very easy to install, just unplug two hoses from old one and plug into bottom of new one.  Definitely do not pay a dealer to install for you, they will charge you an hour labor for 3 minutes of work (my parents made that mistake)
B00P4I3XW0|4|Lettering is good.  It's readable.  Have had it on my vehicle a few weeks and it still looks good.
B00LHMWQXO|1|Are you kidding me!! How loud of a whistle (not a click) do you need? Then it lasted about 2 minutes and quit.. Not happy.
B008G21WWO|1|Lights did not fit my 2008 Chevy Malibu
B000EAIERW|3|Using in a John Deere Gator. Seems like the foam handle will wear out quickly. It is an extremely soft foam.
B000C9TBI6|4|This is a good replacement part for the standard fuel filter.
B00KIXSXWQ|3|Hello,<br /><br />My unit has failed after only 6 months of operation and although I was very happy when it worked, would like to know how to have it replaced?<br /><br />Please respond and your response will help me determine how to rate your company.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Mike
B00YI8E6H8|5|It takes 5 minutes to install to my camry 2014,now it looks like a luxury car.
B00OM8T3MW|5|Perfect, it works for a month already, and feels like new.
B007AHH7CK|1|I don't understand all of these rave reviews. This headlamp is such a disappointment. It looks horrible on our Roadking, protruding like an ugly blackhead. [Happily, we're removing this expensive blemish within the next few days.]<br /><br />Aside from how it looks, let me share what I witnessed being in my car with my husband driving the bike behind me (in daylight). First off: The light was super-bright when within a car length or two, or at a red light/stop. Yup, when I looked in the rearview mirror, it was like a spotlight - annoyingly so. But when I created more distance between our vehicles, I looked in my rearview and was surprised to see that the light seemed dimmer than any stock headlamp. My imagination? I purposely slowed down and then sped up to verify. Sure thing, this headlamp is inconsistent/fickle/Irregular. Turning a corner, I looked back and watched my husband take the corner and the headlamp was totally black (an angle thing?), as if it wasn't on. Wow!<br /><br />Lastly, The King has developed a high-pitched whistling sound, at around 40+ mph, since installing this headlamp. Scanning the HD Forum, we found out that the new headlight rim could be the cause. We'll soon find out!<br /><br />What an expensive waste. Can't wait to change out this headlamp!
B000Q73A1S|4|Bought one last year and loved it but one side is collapsing and I can't get any one from the company to answer my calls or call me back. My husband has a hard sided one he has used in the tractor for years and we love that one,m too. I just thought for me the soft sided one would be easier to carry. Now I wish I would had gotten the hard sided one.
B001UKG8CS|4|Works great... However, i will move forward about an inch from back edge of footboard on the next bike
B00CO6OIFG|5|Works as advertised.
B003VB0LSQ|1|Tiny
B009YYVSZO|5|Exact parts that I need, fast delivery and super low price....
B00498FM3O|5|2003 forester
B00DYSDS72|4|The right size and wipes clean.  I hope it lasts a year or so.  Although there was instructions in 4 or 5 languages on the package, NONE of them described how you needed to dismantle the holder and re-assemble it to fit my Sequoia.  Thank goodness there was a few YOUTUBE videos to help me.
B00FX40C9C|5|My vehicle came with steel tension spring wipers. They have lasted 8 years and are only now beginning to streak. That seems to be a testament to their value over the one piece plastic blades that most manufactures offer. While on a large curved windshield all new wipers seem to perform flawlessly, holding up over time is not only economical but saves frustration.<br /><br />I used to buy refills but some end up being damaged by the time you get them into place. I am now sold on buying the complete unit and just trading it out on the wiper arm.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Finally a sun shade that fits my windshield perfectly! Thanks!
B003UVCY00|1|Absolutely a piece of garbage! Never charged and never worked. Do Not Purchase! This is a very cheap model with no redeemable qualities!
B00JJBWMDO|5|Haven't had to use them but they look and feel as expected. Ours came in bright pink.
B005ASY23I|5|One of the best compressors I have used in terms of portability and space saving design. Fits perfectly behind my backseat and works every time.
B000AYDXJQ|5|excelent
B003WOIT04|5|Easy Install
B00P0T9R8C|5|Goes great with my purse
B000B8JUEI|3|a little diferent
B0031I9KLS|5|I am a tech at a GM dealer. This is what's put on the car at the factory. Original equipment. Quality is very high. Amazons price was cheaper than my employee  discount on the exact same part at work. Free shipping to boot. You just can't beat that.
B00KTHXYO8|2|found my other rc before recieving from mail, seems sturdy like original
B00C305BBS|2|No big issues until about 600 miles later on the highway these decided they no longer needed to stay where I put them. I replaced the factory set for the same reason but at least they held up 25,000 miles.
B009X23B2U|4|Match is okay. Not perfect as some have mentioned but very passable. Also, good fit, and material is strong enough, IMHO. The only issue I have is that I wish the rocker switch holes were pre-cut. It was a pita to to cut them out with an exacto knife. would definitely buy again. Definitely the best place to put aftermarket rocker switches on a wrangler, especially with a manual gearbox, since you they would be so bunched up against the stick down in the center console.
B0045G8KBQ|5|Just put this in my Cadillac SRX Turbo. I had to replace the original OEM battery from AC Delco. This provided a more than suitable replacement to run the endless internal electronics and sensors. I ended up purchasing locally because I was able to save a few bucks, but I'm pretty happy nonetheless.
B005RIZ6TU|5|Excellent quality. Item as described.
B009Y8CCAA|5|It fits my windshield perfectly, is made well and nice and sturdy! Love it!
B00KTHYCEO|3|Just purchased a used 2003 4Runner and picked up this remote so I could have two.<br />Arrived quickly and I set them up easily.  They seem to work most of the time. But I have had a few occasions that the door would not open and I had to push the unlock several times before it worked.
B00UIQ55RE|5|Very high quality sticker and it should last me a lifetime. Easy to install and very good price.
B00EA4JCGA|2|though it has elastic strap to hold the back in place... you can't get in the truck with out the bottom rolling up under your butt.  Even bought a large cushion to put on top of it and darned if it still keeps rolling and curling up from the front...
B00PX1ORVY|4|Heavy and stinks like fresh cow poo but they stay in place, smell will most likely abate but until then.......... yuck.
B00JEUI2ZW|5|The part appears to be a very solid and durable alternative to buying the 300$ factory original one. The sensor went on smooth and has a good grip on the shifter link with no play. I particularly like that the range is very good on the sensor, meaning that you don't have to have the part perfectly aligned to start the car. Some of these sensors have little range and only start if the shifter is pushed forward while in park, but with this one that isn't the case. The harness has a nice looking sleeve that should protect it from the elements and engine heat, however the sleeving is a tad shorter than the original, leaving about 5 inches of the harness exposed, compared to the original which only had about 2 inches exposed, both on the connector end. The connector itself fits tightly into the receptor and stays put just fine despite the old receptor missing it's clips that would hold the connector in place. The locking nut and washer hold tight and firm. As for the price, I'd say this is a very fair price for a piece that looks like it'll hold up just about as well as the original.<br /><br />Now, I note on the old one. If your jeep powers on when you turn the key, but makes zero noise when you hold it in the start position, then your neutral safety switch has malfunctioned and is blocking it from starting. This is a very common problem on the cherokee and is usually due to the electrical contacts inside becoming gummed up and not springing into their slots anymore, which locks out the starter as if it were trying to be started in gear. You can usually take it apart and clean out the gunk blocking the contacts, which will make it start without problem, however, it will likely continue to throw a check engine light and it could even crap out unexpectedly if a contact gets stuck again. Not to be considered a permanent fix. You could also cut the wire in the harness next to the engine and jump it to another wire to bypass the neutral safety switch but I'd recommend against it unless it's an emergency!<br /><br />Mine is installed and starts every time with no problem and it has resolved the check engine light. The only concern I have is longevity, but only time will tell on thatt it unless it's an emergency!<br /><br />Mine is installed and starts every time with no problem and it has resolved the check engine light. The only concern I have is longevity, but only time will tell on that
B000GV4UX6|1|look up that part number and match it to the picture, pictured there is a $200.00 rotor, the one sold is a solid rotor...Buyer beware!!
B000CITK8S|3|Had to return. My mistake for not reading the product dimensions.<br />But photos made it look small. For me, right out of the box it was too big.<br />Only slightly smaller than my Walmart Schumacher battery tender.<br />Extremely heavy. Was like picking up a small cinder block. But I rated it ok, 3 stars.<br />I can only give something 5 stars if it was truly spectacular and surpasses normal quality standards.
B0044AZ4BC|5|Product is sturdy, and of high quality materials. Fits the airbox perfectly. No tools required. Just open the hood, pop open a few clasps, remove the old filter with the new one and you will be done in 2 minutes. Max.
B00AVPLRQK|5|Worked to fix some rust spots on my Jeep.  After clear coat it blended well.
B003FXI5YW|5|Very well designed...works perfectly with my storage racks!
B00CYLKBUM|5|Absolutely Perfect - very simple, easy to use, easy to wash - why didn't I think of this
B00KTIF652|2|One out of two is still working.
B00C4KECZ8|5|Perfect replacement.
B00BJ6DCE0|4|Pro level stuff delivered promptly!
B000KXT8EG|2|1st you have to put on your reading glasses to see it (becausae it is on the rear view mirror - close and small), then you cannot see through the rest of your mirrors.  2nd in this position it reflects everything and is hard to see even with your reading glasses on, 3rd.  It doesn't work in very hot weather, i.e., no image at all when it's over 90, which means it only works at night in Atlanta in the summer.  I am planning to replace it with the Biggest screen I can get that mounts low on the dash.
B005O25CXE|4|These fit well on a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but the adhesive strip doesn't work very well. I bought my first set and they blew off at highway speeds when I rolled a window down. On my second set I let them set in the summer heat with the windows up thinking that would help the adhesive. It didn't, as soon as I rolled down the front windows they fell down, so determined to use them I bought Gorilla double sided tape from Home Depot and trimmed it to fit the visors......the thicker tape and larger surface area seemed to help them stick better.
B005CMI3YQ|5|Best exhaust for a 350Z. EVER!
B00062YWP6|5|nice one
B00XFHZB40|5|EXCELENT, FITS YAMAHA FZ1S 2007
B00W67TGZK|5|Perfect look and function
B0002MBKAA|5|Still holding up a year later
B007K294DA|5|Easy to install, good fit and a great look.
B008ZDYLC2|5|Great Product
B00BG7K600|5|Worth every penny on the newwer Ram trucks!!
B00CCK9DO0|5|Good
B002SE1GFY|5|The vent shade is wonderful, looks really sporty
B002NAS2FU|5|Excellent service by Amazon-Product was excellent.
B00U7PXIUW|1|Extremely flimsy & lightweight.  I weighed one mat on a postal scale; it weighs a &#34;whopping&#34; 14.6 ounces!  That should tell you everything you need to know about quality. These mats are way overpriced. It would probably cost over $10 to return them, so I'll keep them till they wear out & go for a better quality mat.
B00KKEKWDQ|1|Buyer beware. Screws were falling out of these junky lights all over the place. Try to put them back in and the threads were non existent.  You WILL waste your money buying these. Should have went with my instinct that the price was too good to be true.
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Excellent product
B00Q1HBSKM|5|These are BRIGHT!  It's hard to describe how much brighter they are than stock.  I wanted to tint my tail lights but not lose output, so I got these.  The end result is these are still brighter in a tinted tail light than a normal bulb was in the untinted lights.<br /><br />You will need to add a resistor as with most LEDs.  I picked up a pair of 20 ohm resistors here for $6.
B00K6BJTUU|5|This switch is a good quality automotive grade switch. Works perfect! It might not be the easiest to install for a novice. The instructions weren't the simplest to understand.
B00AKGBHSS|4|Easy to install and working fine. Had hoped they could keep me totally off the ground but still end up kneeling due to my jacks being a bit far under the RV. Still better than the regular pins. Wish the pins on these stuck through the holes just a little bit further for a more positive feel.
B00PUY6FOQ|2|Looks good but doesn't get good reception outside of city limits, would return it I didn't wait so long.
B007EEVIR4|5|Great price and a great product easy to in stall if I can do it anyone can
B000S2KZIW|4|Installed on my 2013 Subaru Legacy.  Fast and easy.  Took me about 40 minutes to do it myself.  Also comes with grease packet and tells you where to put the grease.  I like this product because it doesn't appear to squeek, like my brakes were doing previously.
B00G8QRNIM|5|High quality container.
B00NLAYBYC|5|I have tried in the past to remove fuel lines and clutch lines with screwdriver and picks.  Don't waste your time and risk doing damage that necessitates a major repair.  This tool disconnects gm clutch  lines in about 2 seconds with no effort.  Worth the few bucks
B000CMGC6C|5|Nice set of plug wires, had an issue with one of the wires connectors got a hold of the seller and they got another wire right out to me. It was very quick.
B00FX40C9C|4|The Bosch steeltech wiper blade was a good fir fro our subaru impreza.  It was easy to install and seems simkilar in design to the other Bosch wiper blades we have used.  The only observable difference between this and the other Bosch bldes is that it is made of steel, which I believe will be more durable.  My experience thus far has ben mixed.  We had one set (Insights) which lasted jus over a month before one broke.  The second set (clear advantage) we have been using on both of our cars without trouble, and have been happy with the performance.<br /><br />The design on this looks almost identical, but fro the steel construction.<br />In general I have been happy with Bosch products over the years.  I do not know what was responsible for thee failure of that one blade, but we have not had a problem with anyof the others.
B009GIXPF4|5|Very happy with it, Works as expected, Great for summer storage last one was shredded during the winter / snow, but it was a couple of years old
B001C6P0NS|5|great tool to have.
B0095TC6I6|4|These are easy to install and gives me a very wide view on the sides of my travel trailer. They do vibrate some but not enough to be a big issue. Would buy again. A little pricey compared to other products like this.
B00BV0C8TE|5|Best hand soap, ever. I am not joking. I have tried everything, and while all the others required multiple pumps to even scratch the surface, the Kresto cuts away a far ton more with just one pump. Most of the time, I end up coming home from a grease/oil/sludge filled day only to end up using some to get rid of what the soap at the shop couldn't handle. Well worth the money, and since it does the job, it lasts a lot longer. Smells great too.
B000E43BDK|5|Fit my 2012 WRX with a Turbo XS 3&#34; Turbo back exhaust. Great quality gasket and the screw holes lined up perfect, if I need another one in the future this will be the one I buy agian.
B000EQD4H6|3|They do the job on my 1998 Honda  Accord.  Performance-wise they are doing their job, but a couple of the cables are a bit short on slack.  I was able to get them in, but they are pretty taught.  Also, the gaskets are small in diameter and don't fully cover the socket wells, so they won't provide any adequate protection for that.  I'll have to figure out some sort of solution to protect those wells now.
B00BCRMAAS|2|Looks good but impossible to install on back of rear seat of my double cab truck.  Straps tore easy upon installation.
B00HB9IYHY|5|Awesome!! Installed in 5 minutes.
B00CQ43WN0|5|Nice fit, quality mats, easy to clean. Would buy again. These are expensive but all of these type products are overpriced so what do you do?
B0084UIYEW|5|Custom fit is perfect.  No more sliding mats.  Don't know why I waited so long
B000C01SXG|5|Perfect fit for my NA miata 1992. Should fit all models from 90-97
B000PHHSM6|5|This cleaner works awesome!  I am not sure why I waited so long to get one, but it saves so much time vs my hand brush.  It even got into the lug nut area much better than I thought it would.  The first time I used it I started it after dumping in a bucket of water and there was some blow back onto my drill which made me nervous.  So I just presoaked all of the wheels then dipped it in the bucket, then spun a little before putting it on the wheels and it worked much better then.  The splashing was reduced dramatically.
B000E0UX8K|4|Arrived on time, good so far
B00KRQR9PG|5|This is a unique and really cool sticker for Golden fans
B00EAOIR8O|5|Great product and half the price of what the dealer charges you.  I change this out myself in my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Take only 5minutes.  View the how-to video online.  Very simple.
B006GJYOL0|5|Wow, this works like magic.
B003YJIIJO|5|just what I ordered and it works
B0022ZJ2WI|1|Just tried to put the chain on my ninja 300 and I have discovered that this chain cannot possibly work on my sprockets. Now I have no transportation and I don't have enough to buy another chain.
B0007Y6FGM|3|Works satisfactory
B00BGSFOQ0|5|Great for any lubrication where you do not want dust to collect, just let it dry. Try not to breath it. I recommend.
B000W3RU9Y|5|These are amazing.  We used them to secure a headboard to a hand truck and it stayed attached perfectly.  We were moving it on the streets on NY and didnt have to stop a single time to adjust it.  they do stretch out a bit from use; but not significantly enough to say they are not good.
B00JRU5OX2|5|These fot perfectly
B00OU5LOT2|5|These are great. The wiring was simple. They are pretty bright and the option to flash with the music works great.
B000COU5JK|4|Not a great gauge for carrying around in a dirt bike tool box, as bumping it around can cause it to lose calibration.  I bought the rubber cover, which immediately tore and fell off.
B00HX526CU|5|BRIGHT, HOLD TIGHT AND WILL BE A BIG HELP IF EVER WE HAVE CAR TROUBLE OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY. Do nt stare into it when you turn it on, it is really really bright.
B00FAMA436|5|Worked great - Easy to install and looks great!
B000HYL20G|5|Does what it is suppose to do.
B00SWPUU5K|1|Did not work in a 2015 Chevy Colorado.
B00GWFKSOK|5|These fit a 2015 Tahoe perfectly.  I always bought WeatherTech in the past but tried Husky this time and will never buy anything else.  These are a thicker and more flexible rubber than the WeatherTech and they do not move around at all.  The drivers side mat snaps in to the factory mat connectors.
B0097RODUU|4|Good hat, flat bill is ok. Doesn't bend to well. On time delivery, would buy from again.
B00826OVWW|4|Rec'd the creeper today.  It is heavier duty than the ones you get for 19.99 at HF, and is pretty well made.<br /><br />Assembly was simple and fast, did not even need the directions.<br /><br />Build Quality; the frame is medium square tubing with a couple pieces of heavy weight angle iron.  I weigh about 165 lbs, so it is plenty substantial for me.  The gray paint is nicely applied, no sags, scratches or dings.<br /><br />The foam is pretty light, not gonna have a lot of support.  Only a few staples in back attaching the vinyl to the plyboard.<br /><br />All in all, more than adequate, but not great.  A solid 4 stars upon initial review.  Well worth the 30 bucks from Woot.
B000CFO0AY|5|Easy install
B008HBM8GS|4|Installed these in anout 45 minutes on my 2007 bmw 328i. They fit great and look average nothing really stands out that why i gave it a 4 star review. Overall pretty satisfied with my purchace. I will say also my box was torn up pretty bad during shipping but all the pieces are still here so I could care less... just a friendly caution
B002ESF5QK|1|One star because I can't go lower. JUNK not universal even if cut to the largest opening it might fit a go cart and super thin material. Not even close to fitting an 05 jeep cherokee. Paid express shipping to get this on before vacation too.Complete waste of money and time.
B000EALHHG|5|Cleaned the old oil spill in the driveway with no problems. Would definitely buy this again.
B00IWL4J24|1|Horrible replacement arm.  Paint faded in 3 months.
B00NW62L88|5|Love this instrument. If you are patient and allow the unit to properly range find (takes about 5-10 seconds depending on the function), it gives spot on readings that are very precise. This is my third multimeter and I wish I bought this one first as it would be my only multimeter if I did. I have the UT120C also and an ancient Ranged meter. Both are okay but this is a rugged / durable unit, which is what I was looking for. I had originally bought the other units because they were small and portable. But this was traded against durability and functionality. The UT61A does just about anything a hobbyist would want of a multimeter. The U-shaped adapter allows for very accurate capacitance measurements so my capacitor meter is now collecting dust. I highly recommend this for most electrical and electronics work.
B00AR9239A|1|POS! installed on my sons 300ex, he rode for 30 mins, I got on it and could hear the park arcing due to lack of good connection, reached down and grabbed the new wire and barely tugged on it and it pulled apart,,very disappointing, very poor quality
B00407NK6A|4|Ok
B0057ZQJ12|5|Item just as described.  Perfect.
B000BZG5ZI|5|Used on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4.0l, threw no codes. Used when I replaced that catalytic converter.
B000C5SG5E|5|The same great product at autozone, but i paid half. Thx
B00KRQ865I|5|I put Weathertech in all my vehicles. There is no substitute. When I need to put a gas can, bag of cement or other potentially messy item in the cargo area I know I can pull out the liner and scrub it off. Fits perfectly and has cupped edges to keep anything spills where they belong, unlike flat mats.
B0040YQXK8|5|fit my father in laws chevy silverado and was waaaaaay cheaper then local dealership and auto parts store.
B008H3YMTM|5|Great instructions, easy to install and works great. Well worth the money.
B004JATNRI|1|Wagner does not really care about the packaging.. Need to inspect now, if they are damaged or not
B001FQL3AY|5|great
B00GSAUHB8|4|Looks great!
B00BAZCRRS|5|Super good price! Not the brightest h4 bulb ever but hey, for the price you can't beat it. Not sure how long they'll last though (probably not too long.. Lol) but for this price I bought two sets. One set for back up. Did I mention they look very nice, and not they crappy looking blue. Its a nice white blue
B00OZ83BS6|5|Worked perfectly when paired with Opt7 LED headlights to stop the flickering when the lights were supposed to be switched to &#34;off&#34;.
B0002T8FL0|5|No water required, this is great!  My custom bikes tend to have issues when water gets into the hand control area.  This cleaning kit eliminates this issue and works great!
B006WAMGVS|4|It was pretty easy and simple to put on
B007HRSXDK|5|Good value for the  money. 8' lengths, would buy a gain if I needed more
B000C5DUN2|5|I found it simple to replace my old switched that had rotted in place and then just stopped working. They work just like the old ones.
B000765MHI|5|Forget the noise!!! This turbo fan is awesome! I use it inside my camper hooked up to my solar 12 volt system to help circulate the air from the AC unit. The variable speed is an great added feature.
B00TPUCAH2|5|An Excellent plug for a Ford Flex (my car) or any other car for that matter! A great design with the twin tip (TT) and designed to hold up for over 100,000 miles (we'll see!). My car has better power than stock, better mileage 3 mpg better, better pick up. I like them. I have 94 k on my car and this is my 3rd set of plugs. Didn't like the pulstar plugs (2nd set no improvement there). Always gap to your cars specs but be careful when doing so.
B00YHF1VQG|4|Cheap but good
B004ULN610|4|Works well, excellent quality for the price. I would buy this product again.
B00VLFDGJA|4|Fit good and no problem installing.
B0041TNK44|5|Fit our 2008 Ford Edge limited great easy to put in . Works great.
B001RDQIWS|4|Good for a short trip and light load (about 125 pounds) worked great mounted on a Ford Flex with a Class III hitch. I would suggest a stabilizer for the hitch as it will sway a lot if loaded unevenly. Could be more sturdy and would not recommend loading over 400 lbs., but did its job for a round trip from Washington state to Southern California. I placed a scrap piece of plywood next to the container that was directly behind the muffler to prevent the heat from the exhaust from melting the plastic tough box. Exhaust ended up melting the bungee cords that held the bins in place. Good value, but not professional grade for long term or heavy duty use.
B008FCE6KK|5|Dealership wanted $500 plus labor to put a set on.  I paid $144 plus next day shipping, install took me about 1 1/2 hours, because I let my 11 year old son do one side.  Easy install, and increased car value by $1000.  I received the package within 15 hours of placing the order, Prime member shipping was under $8.00.
B00D2QL0DU|2|I was pumping transmission fluid and the hoses kept blowing off the pump, covering me and the driveway.
B00P9HE0EQ|4|This works on a lawn chair type of leg! We love it for holding a beverage can and a snack or cell phone!
B000KKMXN2|5|good epoxy
B00E7MH5F0|5|They arrived and look just like picture.
B00B9Z8G3I|2|Said it would fit our 2013 corolla and it didn't. Cheaply made too.
B0012GTVVA|5|These are awesome.  Every trailer should have one.
B00449LXFE|5|perfect
B0075SCD28|5|I really like this sticker. It is big enough that you can see it & the white color makes it stand out even on tinted windows.<br />It was easy enough to apply, seems to be stuck on the glass pretty well. Either way it is peace of mind knowing that tail gaiters will hopefully see it & slow down knowing that my son is in the car.
B004VRMAYC|3|The wafers work as intended and smell great. Biggest downside is that the freshener only lasts for about 2-3 days on average. Would advise to buy in bulk if you plan on keeping your car smelling nice 24/7
B001O17KGG|5|Works perfect in my 2003 Cobra
B00CJ0B6KC|5|great item
B007JSGR9Y|1|I tried this on my 1996 BMW 740 IL. The scanner powered up but won't  link. I also tried the obd port under the hood with an adapter. I also tried it on my neighbor's 2000 BMW 740 I. Same problem it powers up but it wouldn't  link.
B00PX6DV84|1|Only had them for 3 months and it broke, the zipper blew out on the side and and a piece of the zipper was missing and I cannot zip it back on the seat. When we received the covers the package stated fast installation, it took us over 1 hour to put the covers on and we had to put them on the best way we could because they didn't fit through under the seat because of the seat motors under the seat.( couldn't get the straps under the seat to tie the covers in place so we had to go around the motors instead, which we figured out after bloody knuckles). I researched for the correct covers because I wanted to get a better cover that would last longer than the generic seat covers.
B000CEE62W|3|It's made of plastic so it broke after about 2 years (maybe that's acceptable to some?). And it definitely does NOT stay in place. I screwed it to the concrete floor and no more movement. I think they need to make this out of rubber or something so it sticks better to the floor and does not move.
B007OW6MD6|5|These work nicely and as intended. As a factory part I would expect no less.
B00UZ0OHIQ|2|I used it only for a week, and then unplugged it and put aside. It may be cool to read some data out of one's car, but the Automatic apps don't really address any unmet need of car owners. It is a technology push effort. Perhaps, good for people who drive a lot for business and need to expense their miles for tax purposes, but then the $99 cost is too high for this utility.
B00FPDV3WG|5|what do you expect for this price? cheap and effective security too sensitive, but you can use it without alarm..
B0085KGOH0|4|Works well could use more ground clearness when pulled but that may interfere with filling, Do Not get the Tow Bracket 25644 one will come with it
B000EVU89I|5|great construction- I loved the heavy duty style rubber hose attachment- I have used others before and when the engine is hot they get soft, this one doesn't give easily so you can pull it out whenever you are done-<br /><br />Compared with a SnapOn tester and was well within 2% of accuracy
B00BFYGZXG|3|Alright quality
B00065L2D8|5|Love it thank you
B000VL9WTS|3|Like the look and fit of the cover. Although I happened to notice when it rains I have been getting a leak through the seam that goes parallel with the speaker bar. I think I can fix this by putting a bead of silicon over the inside of the seam.
B001KSCSQU|5|Preformed and fit as expected
B001KSEJBW|5|Probably a little better made than the one I took out.  It has a little more substance to it.  No instructions as to which side goes up and down.  you can see the flaps.  My old one had not flaps so there was no point of reference.  I decided the flaps may be to stop air from going around the filter edges so I put the hing of the flaps on the bottom.... 2013 Elantra
B00FOG9TR0|5|After viewing a particularly spectacular downhill MTB crash by my 15 year old son who locked up the front brake of his bike on the lip of a steep berm at 15 mph and catapulted himself 10 feet in the air to land in a boulder field, I decided to seriously upgrade his armor and add a neck brace. This is very adjustable, very well made, is easy to put on and works well. It also looks really cool so he will wear it. This is top of the line equipment and you will not find a better design than the GPX 5.5.
B00ZZGE4KG|5|[[VIDEOID:fc124e1e15c65d0420c6468b0a07d17f]] We are always reviewing devices on YouTube, but let me tell you about this product.<br /><br />It really help me out, 2 times till now,  left lights on inside the car and hot day and came back and no power, i had to hook this bad boy up and in matter of 10 seconds i was able to turn my car on...<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone to purchase
B00LO0M918|4|Not great!  Dimmer then the original filament bulbs but a lot cooler which is why I replaced them to start with.  Also, a blue white vs yellow white of the origionals.
B009ZIWH04|5|This item is almost a perfect OEM replacement. In some ways, it is better than the OEM original as it is one solid piece and the original OEM is actually two pieces. Color match is almost perfect. Due to how it is made, you can see the mold seams in the plastic but this is on the inside part near your gauges, so it isn't really noticeable. It has all the matching tabs the original has minus two near the top but it doesn't seem to cause any fitment or vibration issues. Installation takes time and patience. I recommend you start the removal of the OEM piece from either the lower left or right slide and then move up and around to the other side.  Use something that isn't hard (not a screw driver unless you wrap it in duct tape or electrical tape) or you will gouge up your dash plastic. When installing the new part, installation is reverse. Line up the tab of the new part with the tab hole starting on the lower left or right and work it in to place, going from one side to the other. While installing, make sure you clear the odometer button as I missed this the first time I attempted to install.<br /><br />The next part is installing the gauges in to the pods. If you have deep gauges, you might need to replace them with something not so deep or they won't fit. Lower the steering wheel down as far as it will go, fish the cables for your gauges up and over the steering column and behind the new gauge cluster assembly at the bottom and work those cable left or right to the openings in the sides of the pod cups. hook up your gauges and then secure them. Depending on how you secure them, you may have needed to install them earlier before you finalized the cluster installation. I just used thick rubber bands that held the gauges in snug.
B00ID981Z6|1|This winch came as standard equipment with the &#34;Cruiser Caddy&#34; that I purchased earlier this year. The Cruiser Caddy is a motorcycle loader<br />manufactured by Palladino, Inc., a metal fabricating company out of Pottstown, PA. The system operates by placing the front wheel of the<br />motorcycle on a small cart that is then pulled up a ramp and into the pickup truck bed by the winch. I was almost immediately struck by how cheap looking the  remote control switch was on this winch. Far less substantial than any of my Superwinch remotes and even cheaper looking than the switch on my Harbor Freight winch. Predictably, the remote failed in short order. The winch worked fine the first five times I used the Caddy. On the sixth time, the winch pulled the  motorcycle on the truck, but then refused to operate in reverse. However, I was finally able to operate the winch by removing the remote control completely  and jamming  wires into the female receptacle on top of the winch control box. So this is how I now have to operate my loader!  I have contacted Palladino and have recommended to them that they stop using this winch and go to another brand.
B00557RHXQ|5|Excellent.
B001A1MABK|4|As others have said there is kind of a weird blue tint to the mirror, but they work.
B006I24QAO|5|Perfect fit for my Mazda 3, there are guides on how to get the old ones out online. It's a little tight getting under the glove box, but the filters work perfectly.
B002LFAQGU|4|Borla quality here. No doubt about it, you get what you pay for, and in this case, you're paying for a high end, beautiful product.
B005XRHF4O|5|Perfect fit and well made
B000C9S6C8|5|Perfect fit
B00AYAID1O|5|These blades do a very good job of keeping my windshield dry. Works better than the OEM blades on my 2012 Ford Focus.
B000C9OLTU|5|Excellent product arrived on time and installed perfectly
B000FF76KM|5|Product arruives on time and well packaged.  One  must expect some broken tablets in shipping I fear as they are somewhat fragile.  My two tubes gad minimal broken tablets.  Aded to washer fluid in its original container.  Took longer than stated to disolve and I had to shake the washerr bottle to get it to disolve complately.  That leads me to questuion if it will disolve fully if you add it to the washer resevoir itself and whether solid chunks might plug some washer system.  This is the same product useed as original equipment by Hyundai.  Once disolved it foanms nicely when sprayed and seems to clean much better than with water or washer fluid alone.
B001KSA1WI|5|Perfect fit
B001553DP8|3|doesnt fit under frame
B002Q0RIRK|5|Great afro-pride item. The only people who think this symbol is racist are the racists themselves.
B007HIEXF6|5|Easy to install, However Needed to have a rivet tool nose that would go inside of snaps, Or as I had to do was use a small steel nut that would fit<br />inside the snap to let the rivet fit tight.
B00DULV8PC|5|It works everything fit like it was supposed to and everything come in in Honda bags like the picture
B0065FRBZ6|5|Amazing quality for the price.
B00JBICYN8|4|Its okay i hate it when it fogs up
B00VA84DF4|4|I have been using the car seat for several days. I earlier complained about the lack of a strap on the front of the car seat. Although there's a little movement when you sit on it, the movement is negligible. The increase in the number of stars is because of the aforementioned and the quick responses from the company's customer representative.
B000C57XJY|5|Good price, make sure you keep spraying the nuts with WD40, and tighten the large horizontle bolt/nut to 50ft lbs and DO NOT overtighten the upper nut on the shaft,, just until the blue bushings squeeze / bulge out some  thats it.  oil or neversieze all threads too.
B00D0QYNOK|4|I like it.
B00029WRJQ|1|Strap not long enough and doesn't stick out far enough for a popup camper behind a xterra.
B00D7HZ6FC|3|I quite like the Battery MINDer for all the reasons that others have mentioned, but I've encountered one flaw in it's usefulness:  It does not work when the ambient temperature is below roughly 50 degrees.  My garage is insulated but not climate controlled and often dips into the 40s during the winter... when I use the Battery MINDer the most.  When the temp is too low it will briefly charge, then stop and flash the &#34;reversed polarity&#34; light.  (I assure you, the leads were not reversed).  I tried charging the batteries on all 5 cars in the garage with the same result.  When I heated the garage to the low 60s the charger worked fine on all those same batteries.<br /><br />I really like the charger, but it is not economical to keep the garage heated all winter just to keep my battery charger working.  As a result I still have to use my old &#34;dumb&#34; 1 amp trickle charger during cold weather.
B00KVUZCIE|5|Great product! Everything worked perfectly!
B000GZMU8E|5|Worked great on my Honda EX650L, with a big gun exhaust, open the air box, and smog block off. Very pleased with the results.
B008F07OMO|5|Excellent product works great!
B00WPBNNWE|2|2014 Limited it doesn't fit. You have to slam the console cover down to close and that doesn't always work. If you look carefully at the photos you can see the rubber inserts are not glued to the plastic tray. I used 3M spray to glue it down. Bottom line I took a chance due to the low price but it was a fail.
B000B8UPMO|4|it works
B000FQ1RBA|5|Worked Great !
B0024E6ZW2|3|Hard to keep in place. Needs a wider plate.
B004CX9LPQ|2|terribly small, scares people on the street. But the idea is good.
B00427MHNA|5|2006 VW Jetta TDI. Perfect Fit. You will either get a engine service light code that says your O2 sensor is out or you will see a drop in fuel economy. Why pay hundreds more for a VW replacement when this jewel works the same.
B0002Z9L7G|3|I like it, but my kids say that it digs into their tummy.
B001PWA0IO|5|Although for my install I was kind of confused when installing the nutsert I was able to finally install my Dee Zee tailgate assist without a hitch this time( previous install part wouldn't fit/work) great product highly recommend it for truck owners with a heavy tailgate
B0002YR8H2|5|Exelent
B00DCEZU7O|5|Great! Still holding up!
B004GCAMFQ|5|Fine.
B00URELPU8|3|Installation was easy but not a good color match.
B00GVRJYKI|5|Easy to apply..and covers well.
B00KS3ZJU0|5|fantastic pants for the money . I was so surprised to see the CE knee protection and the quality work.. and real Kevlar ,, super good best pants I have seen for women and fast shipping A+
B000F09CF4|5|Fine.
B004A0YIMC|5|Great for the price. Great shipping
B000BHHW94|5|Nothing like &#34;the real thing&#34;! This is real sheepskin. Soft and natural ... just what I needed to keep the darn seat belt off my neck!
B00NFDTUEG|4|Good quality
B000BUOSGG|3|Definitely smaller than I thought but still good for camping.
B007KOT73A|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Amazing light output!  These are not just reverse lights, they are mini flood lights.  They light up the area bright as day and have a range of about 50 feet.  They will actually hurt your eyes standing behind them at night, not joking. Huge upgrade from stock bulbs.  Plug and play, took me less than 3 minutes.  Shipping was very fast as well.  I live in southern california where they ship from and received them less than 24 hours after ordering.  extremely satisfied with these bulbs.
B00GRHRTEU|2|Easy to install, but two major drawbacks:  1) They whistle at speeds above 35mph because the shape isn't aerodynamic;  2) the plastic wheel has to be tight tight TIGHT to keep the mirror from moving when it's brushed against
B00SV54LQU|5|This fit exactly as promised and looks clean.  Great addition to the dash.
B0091OE6K6|2|Glad they work for others, but not for me. The lap belt clasp pops open not often but sometimes; the whole thing slides back and has to be re-adjusted as I'm driving; the lap belt gets pulled up and the buckle does not lie flat but tips out with one edge jabbing me in the solar plexus. Probably has a lot to do with big guy, small Toyota, and a belt that's pretty much at it's limit.
B006OQ35GU|5|This takes the guess work out of RV tank maintenance. The swivel fitting are nice but I have an interference with the position of the bung in my waste water compartment. The bung hole touches the fitting and the pressure allows it to weep water from the swivel. I am going to use it on the other end of the hose where it dumps into the sewer. I initially did not want to see what was coming out of the tank but now I know when it is clean. fitting is very well made of high quality material.
B00BYNJ7OW|5|Had Bilsteins on my old Jeep also. Great shocks
B003ZOLRFK|5|A+++++
B00KTNO1WQ|4|works good so far, time will tell
B0058SPNW4|1|Just got try it out this week and it doesn't work for my 2004 Johnson 8 HP - the unit is too low and the handle for the adjustment on lowering it, interferes with the tilt mechanism on the motor so that the tilt will not lock, so you are dragging it with the propeller in the water all the time -  very disappointed - I'll have to see if I can sell it to someone who can use it.
B00B4KUGZO|5|The brake line rotted from the ABS module to the rear axle on my 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche 1500 and these lines made the replacement a Much easier job than it would have been to try to bend a new line with the old rusted/rotted line as a template.  Also, it included the rest of the lines for the truck so if I need to replace any others in the future I have them.
B000A3YRR4|5|Great for just what you need. Fits perfect
B00280BL9O|5|Great addition to the glovebox. Works as intended
B00H9KVEUY|5|Works fine for me!
B0045RQH8I|5|Very happy with them
B004Q3OEV8|4|Cheaper material, but very cute for the price! Fit my 2015 Nissan Versa Note fairly well. It adds a bit of flair to the car, and seemed to fit the seat better after I drove in it once or twice. Lightweight (may not be the most durable over time) but does the job and, for the price, is totally worth it!
B000C8PA3M|5|Good quality, easy to install, Carbon Activated for extra filtering and odor control.
B000C53S1G|2|order 3 sets, all had rust.  had to returned all of them.  wasted of time.
B007N6H0M0|5|Arrived quicker then expected. Fit right into my 40 amp Eastwood plasma cutter.
B004C6TZCM|5|Works fine after some modifications to make it fit my skinny bumper.
B004GC5DTG|5|OEM part at a great price
B007TG7HV8|5|best wiper I have ever used
B002RK9FBG|5|Apply dry, it's much easier
B00GBVHPP0|5|I really like love the gloves,arrived fast, road for 3 days broken in quick cool in the heat, great grip, I wear  large gloves,  glad I ordered ex large, fit perfectly,and look freakn awesome, would recommend one size bigger than what u usually wear. Wish I could show a pic...
B001T9DVFW|5|working
B00GT2FUB2|5|I really like this battery with a full charge it's good enough to start up a car a couple times. I also always use it to charge my multiple devices on the go. The flash ligh also comes in handy and is really bright.
B006ISKKUS|5|Very great
B00IKSKVIA|5|It works. Feels food. Light. Very light on the foot
B001A05D7Y|5|ok
B00ZT5IDDW|5|Key fob cover looks good, feels sturdy, and it does fit the key fob for a 2016 corvette stingray
B00F0MC8DU|5|Fit perfect love your products.Thanks
B001IH8PN8|5|Great quality but returned as too short for me.
B00YC04DZW|5|I liked Kawell's 2 leg harness that I used to install lights on my girlfriend's Jeep so much I purchased a 1 leg harness to rewire the lightbar on my Jeep. The quality is great and it is so simple to use a person who has never done it before could do it with no problem. The price is food also.
B00YCJ9ZRO|4|All I really look at is the speedometer, and that runs about 2mph high. But i guess i can get used to it.
B0073MEN74|5|Great product with a great price, also looks better than stock
B004OZR23A|5|A+++++
B006N963CQ|4|ok
B001HJR9XE|5|I purchased this for my antique horn that I installed in my Jeep. Easy to install and works every time I push it!!
B00GYDBPL0|5|looks nice
B00DO04MTS|4|It fits nicely but little bit off on passenger side
B00GLS9SZS|5|I have this with the chrome sheld and it looks amazing. And people love it. It's a perfect fit and feel.
B008BLFHS0|5|Did it's job just had to adhere it how I needed it.
B00IPMAAXW|2|does what it says, just not for me... not very attractive, clumsy looking..prefer a cleaner line..haven't found what I am looking for yet.
B002VHQ176|2|The ends are not spring loaded and lose contact
B000CQTIAK|4|quality part, reasonable price.400 miles  no problems. fit my 2005 jeep wrangler tj
B00FP17H0A|3|They look great and fit nicely, but the adjusters are wobbly and the beam pattern isn't very good. For the low beams, the top cutoff line is nice and clean (you won't blind other drivers with glare/stray light) but the rest of the light pattern is uneven and splotchy. The high beams are tiny and splotchy as well, and shoot way off to the left. The brights are nearly useless unless you have a 4-High mod because the pattern is so small and focused that you can't see anything outside of it. On a positive note, the parking lights fit great and work fine without any issue. I didn't install the corners so I can't comment on those.<br /><br />They look good and are a little brighter than the hazy old stock lights, but the light pattern is worse than stock. I'm going to be doing a HID projector  retrofit anyway so this doesn't bother me much, but if you want to keep using halogen bulbs then be warned.<br /><br />A must also add that this price on Amazon is way higher than most other online sources. Many places have this set way cheaper but at the time of ordering everyone but Amazon had them back-ordered for almost two months, Amazon was the only place with them in stock so that's what I ordered.
B003VCDFCE|5|Corrected the problem.
B0000AXQPA|5|works as advertised
B00SH1SN6C|5|This has jump started sooo many cars for me. I love it! I rarely use if for a USB charger because I have higher capacity chargers that are smaller and more easily tag along with my phone.<br /><br />If you work on cars, tend to leave your lights on, or forget to turn off your sub-woofer, then this was made to make sure you can always get your battery started back up again.
B00904WS84|5|Product came as advertised
B0093N7NTG|5|Took about a hour to install.  Very easy to connect to my 2011 escape
B003WLUB9E|5|The part fit perfect i had no hiccups with it perfect fit i will shop with you again
B002R0AZ2O|5|When you receive this item, you will wish you would have ordered the second one.<br /><br />I just received it, and under 5 minutes it was on. I looked at the other rear light and now I regret not getting them both.<br /><br />Here's what you get in the box.<br /><br />Housing, wire harness and bulbs!<br /><br />I was expecting just the housing. The harness and light bulbs were a nice surprise.<br /><br />For those who complain about instructions...<br /><br />If you don't know how to remove the old one, why order one to install yourself?<br /><br />Two screws is all it takes to install and and or remove this housing. Hint* open the rear door and look for screws on the right side of this housing. They are very visible.<br /><br />That is all it takes. If you have to remove or change the harness you have to pop open the trim on the inside.<br /><br />Had bunch of delivery issues. But amazon made it right  I'm not even upset about the fact that I paid extra for same day delivery and the item was lost. They took care of the problem lightning quick.<br /><br />This deal is hard to beat.
B001IZIFOO|1|I bought one of these covers what a waste put it on and it only lasted two weeks tore next to the seam on top. I didn't put it on right away so there is no way I can return it.
B007VRAM3K|5|Came with everything we needed. Install is easy if you know what your doing. If not a local shop can do it for you no problem.
B00MQA2PGY|5|Quality product, very classy.
B0002NIJVC|5|A little bit small for my F150 but made it work.
B00P141O6E|1|Fogged up the first time i washed my truck.
B005N53AM2|5|I have a Mazda2, got this, put it in the car to put on at the end of the next day (to let it warm up, since the car would be in the sun most of the day), slipped it on - went on very easily (I am female, &#34;mature&#34;, fairly good strength in my hands). It looks great in my Mazda red car, and has a nice feel with enough grip to be comfortable. Couldn't ask for more.
B000C9KO0K|5|This is a hard to find alternator as Caddy only used a water cooled alternator for a limited number of years. With this being a 4 hour labor job, you want the highest quality product being installed. This is it!
B00FE6RUXK|3|Nice cover in spite of the defect. The bungee cord is almost worn through. I will need to replace the bungee cord with something better. Fast shipping.
B000CITK8S|5|Works well and is easy to use.
B00N13AL7A|5|really good quality!!
B00NLGDRY6|5|Evo 8 and 9 sends just enough oil pressure to the head (does not affect turbo oil feed). Might have louder lifter ticks, but when it warms fully (I do HDPEs) the noise is gone and all you get is oil where it needs to be.
B0080HJL7S|5|got sick of garbage in my car, and I tried going back to my car dealership to buy a garbage bag but turns out not only does my car manufacturer not offer this accessory, but pretty much no car dealerships do.  This is rather peculiar as I figured car garbage is a pretty common problem and cars should come with something built in even in the trunk or something.  I ordered this recently and product arrived quickly.  I like where this garbage bag is mounted.  I took a look at a few other designs on Amazon but noticed some are floor mounted or shifter mounted which I didn’t want either of.  So far so good, the bag does the job. - item received as part of promo for review
B004VG6QYS|5|PROTECS GREAT, 100% RECOMMENDED
B004ME4NDA|5|at 5' 10&#34; this stool give me just enough height to reach my top cabinets , Also works as a stool when working on motorcycle.
B003SYQFYA|5|Perfect, just what my spouse was looking for to restore his '94 Lincoln!
B009OBVRY4|4|Pad is a little smaller than expected but it still works well, allows you to apply wax & polish very easily!
B000O80AZS|4|Used these a couple times already and they made the job alot easier, only reason I can't give this item a 5 is because of the price. $20.79 is way to much for what the are.
B0050PKX20|5|The vest arrived a day sooner than expected and that was great. It fits perfectly and is good quality. It is not to light nor to heavy. My pistol fits nicely in the gun pocket. It has two gun pockets,  both left and right side.  I had my Legion patches sewn on and wore it on a ride last week. I tucked and threaded those strings up inside so they cannot be seen until I need to make it larger for my winter jacket.  Plenty of pockets and no drawbacks. A great deal made even better by free shipping.
B000C9Y1BI|5|Evo 8 - you can't go wrong with this. EvolutionM voted WIX filters Top 3 solutions and is far cheaper than Mobil 1
B0006IX87S|5|Works great!!
B006VEHO8U|4|Very comfortable.  The only hiccup is that it doesn't slide easily when getting out of the car.
B001FAGJB8|5|great addition to the Jeep. Both protection and style. Fit much better than the OEM sill guards I purchased.
B0028ZKMM6|5|Makes for a no brainer installation.
B00EDWF1BE|5|I absolutely love this product. The package came in on time and in perfect condition, all the pieces where included in the box! It was exactly what I ordered and needed. The hinges are made of a sturdy, heavy metal and very easy to operate . Very easy and quick  to install (even for a woman)with the directions included. I would definitely recommend this product to any Jeep owner. I would say I would buy again, however that wont be needed, good quality lasts a lifetime!!
B0092Z6BZ2|4|Look great, fit great and took 5 min. To install.
B005JI7006|5|The best!!!
B006L61HXQ|5|use the siemens oem maf....lots of problems with the cheaper options
B0076PXV4Y|5|look and work good
B000E0GAXC|3|Have used Painless wiring kits several times and was pleased.  This Kit on the other hand was not as user friendly as others.  There also is an error in the booklet that I researched on line and was able to continue without too much difficulty.  Quality was as always great.
B008SHTZ2Q|5|Great Product. minor adjustment of mounting holes but easy fix.
B00JB4TL3S|4|I received and installed the seat covers and I like them, but I don't love them.  They fit snugly around the backrest and seat area and are exactly what I was looking for.  The one issue I have is that the headrest covers are not even close the the size of the actual headrest.  I was pretty disappointed, after installing the seat and backrest portions, to find that the headrest fit so sloppy due to the extra material.  For the price, I expected the headrest covers to fit correctly.  They are constructed of sturdy material and will protect the main body of the seats and that is what I was looking for.
B00C0Z2L0K|5|Works great! I covered my 97 dodge dakota floor to ceiling in this. The decibels on the highway went from 88 db to 80 db with just one layer. I am very impressed with this product. It wasnt too hard to install and it smelled mildly like tar on hot days and that only lasted about a month. I would buy this over any other kind because its cheaper and better quality than anything else that Ive tried.
B000JD5C8S|5|Goes on very easy and stays on. Have put them on all my cars over the years. When it's hot you have to keep the windows cracked open.
B00O97CWD8|5|Very nice!  Fit perfectly and look as they will last forever!
B001EP0GQS|5|Worked well on my 2005 Toyota Highlander. Installation was quite fast. You take out existing bolts and bolt this new unit in. I used it for 4-bike rack and went about 250 miles each way to a camping site. No issues. Not sure how it works out in the long run. I do see that most hitches on People's cars are rusted.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Awesome shade.  Keeps the temp in the car down by about 20 degrees, and is stylish.
B000FQ0I1U|5|Excellent replacement
B004TRKBOK|5|I feel better having this in my car.
B004EYI10O|2|Nice set of leads. The only problem is it was sent with the case broken. And I know it was sent like this and didn't happen thru travel because in big bold paint is says broken with an arrow pointing to the corner.. really?
B00MMQRJTA|2|product was delivered on time and packed well, however:  it is unusable without a lot of work.  The rear portion of the tip is so far out of round that it will not fit over a 3&#34; exhaust pipe without major (and expensive) work, and, the slots for the hold brackets have flash on the inside of the round version.  This will require more work to get &#34;it&#34; to fit.  The tip looks great; it is a shame that so many finishing details prevent it from being used without a lot of extra work
B003UHNMMS|5|This works exactly as you'd expect.  It was extremely helpful in adjusting the point breaker (spark) timing on my Honda CB350. I think that it would have been easier if this tester had alligator clips on both ends, but you know what you're getting from the picture, so that doesn't take away any stars.
B00BZHQ88A|5|So easy to install and doing what I want it for. I have 2 hds208 SoundQubed and 3000.1 planetaudio amp on my first alternator and it was struggling badly, but this alternator is doing is job.
B005BN46TM|5|Excellent
B007USCM7E|5|I checked out several different kinds of a/c recharge stuff, and settled on this because the dispenser/gauge was reusable . I had a small hole in my a/c line up in the dash, a $1200 repair job, which for a 15 year old vehicle, wasn't going to happen. Someone recommended adding the refrigerant. Even if it only lasts one season, it's still a lot cheaper than the repair job..brilliant suggestion! SO far so good! Made it to August and A/C is still putting out cool air. It takes a while to cool, but it is an extended mini-van so it may be more the van than the refrigerant, but it works well enough and because I bought the big bottle, I still have enough left over for another refill!
B000CCDO1S|4|love it especially on my boxer engine.
B00NT5U8UU|5|Cute, well made
B0041LN1L4|3|Fine.
B00X52N6HE|5|Not sure how well the bumpersticker works for particularly inconsiderate drivers, but I feel a little safer having it displayed prominently on the back of my car.
B009FUF6DM|5|This is amazing! Thanks!
B00CYLKBUM|2|Well this DOESN'T work at all... I put the seat covering yesterday... Today I have not even done any workout yet, I am setting with the AC on waiting to pick up my son... My back is all wet just from sitting here!!! If it can't wick away a little perspiration then how can it work after a full workout! NOT HAPPY AT ALL!
B004KK553I|5|Ordered two of these plate covers and they look great on my car!!! The rhinestones aren't as sparkly as the picture shows, but I'm sure in the sunlight they look shiny.
B00306YESK|5|I haven't used them 'in the field' yet but they fit just right to my fingertips, and are comfortable feeling.  As I ordered these last night and they arrived tonight I haven't tested them yet for thorns or such.  Just felt the need to post this because Amazon came through for me (1-day shipping) and I need these in the AM for outside work.  I did try to poke a screwdriver through them (don't do this at home!) and the gloves survived the test.<br /><br />Because I will use them often I doubt that they will last for more than a couple of months (I suppose I should wear gloves fit for the use..) but they are sooo comfortable.
B00EQ9KY34|5|this friction lock is of great quality fits well and was easy to install.  the operation is straight forward and easy to use.  best part is its hard to notice it is even  there, blends in similar to your standard bar end.
B0010G2KPQ|5|02 Monte Carlo SS. ABS, Trac Off light, service traction system warning lights all ON. (also fault code C1214) Product is a New ACDelco module. Was exactly what was in the car. Swapped out. Turned ign. over for the first time, and instantly fixed. All warning lights removed. The Product Dimensions listed on the page are not accurate and should be updated. Just verify your original module subs up to this number.
B00CIB3HSQ|5|I love my new sticker. Very well made.
B004A6JA2O|5|normal quality(there is smell normally after 2~3 months.<br />However, it is cheap, that I can change usually.<br />It is better than original because I can change anytime because cheap price.
B000WK5PWQ|5|works good
B00144B32A|4|good stuff
B00CYLESV0|5|This has been on my car now for seven months and still looks great! It was so easy to instal and adds a nice pop to the car.  I really like that there is the screw cover, it is a nice touch.  Nothing bad to say if a little bling is what you are looking for.
B009IF1NF4|5|Installed in a 1998 Acura integra LS.  Fitment was perfect.  Works perfectly.
B00JHQ7PZQ|1|S***y, my stock horn sounds louder
B00WVFORL0|5|Great looking bumper sticker.
B0002SQZPY|2|Found this item did not work very well. Does not hold Cam sprockets very well which ended up causing me a ton of extra work to get cam<br />sprockets re-aligned.
B00HRMSXWQ|5|Like everyone has stated, these are very simple to install. This kit comes with all bulbs to replace all interior lights as well as your side mirror puddle lights and even your trunk light. The whiteness of these LED really compliments the luxurious ambiance of you Lexus.
B00DRGFSOC|4|Fit and repaired the clutch problem of my  little Zetor 5211.  Not a difficult job and certainly necessary.  Could say a 5, but how can you really express love for a brake cylinder?
B00LNOK4E4|5|GREAT LOOK...THEY DONT GIVE THAT MUCH LIGHT BUT I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL..LOVE EM
B000E28C7M|5|so far so good.
B000CCZ5BA|3|Installed these on the rear of a 2004 Ford F250 Super Duty.  The orginal rear shocks were rusting out so I figured it was time to replace them before they rusted off in the road!<br /><br />The old shocks were rusted onto the bottom shock bushings so we had to take a cutting torch to remove the old ones!  We tried just about everything to remove the old bolts but no luck.  We managed to save the bushings though by pressing what was left of the bolts out of the bushings.  It took the torch and a 12 ton hydraulic press to get the bolt stubs out of those bushings!<br /><br />As for the shocks, not really much to say other than they were easy to install and they look loads better than the rusted out originals.  Do they handle any better?  To be honest, I can't feel any difference from what I removed than what I put on other than appearance!<br /><br />Maybe that's a good thing though, guess only time will tell  :o)
B001A6ZHWY|5|Comfortable & fits well.  Quality construction.  Minimal &#34;mushroom&#34; look.
B00ISLG8KY|5|Looks great on my 2015 Harley Softail Slim! Great price too!
B002E2D3N8|5|Awesome! Exactly as described. Bought it for my 2003 Honda Civic.
B00PHEOFR8|3|They look good but, I couldn't use the ends had to use the stock bar ends weights. Had to use Gorilla Glue on the Throttle side to stop it from just spinning around and around.
B000M5YYIW|5|Good
B002L9DHX0|5|it was a fun gift
B00HHNGGGU|5|Good as advertised and installed perfectly
B002G47GE6|5|these are amazing.
B0076AKISQ|5|Perfect for protecting the rear bumper with frequent loading and unloading. Toolk about 1 minute to apply.
B008TECLSI|5|Great thing for a parent of 2 teenagers to have. Well worth the money.
B004ZZL8HK|5|Great LED Flasher. Love the flash patterns. Also Fast Shipping. It was Delivered 2 days before it was expected to arrive.
B001CDP71Q|5|Exactly what I expected thankyou
B002TID2AQ|5|Love it works great.
B00DD0ZO14|3|Loved the design but its bigger than the window so it doesn't stand up in the window.  If it had suction cups that would help to keep it in place.  Keeping it but just letting in lay over the dash and steering wheel. Would definitely have give 4 to 5 stars if it could stay in the window.
B008MQ7S40|5|If you need instructions on how to install an engine gaurd, step away from the tools its 4 bolts. Great piece. Fit my 2014 883 super low perfectly
B0025271LW|5|Change my oil homework  easy  for me amazon great company
B00K8ECCN6|4|Works satisfactory
B001THVNCM|3|Let me say first that I really like the look this leaves when it goes on well.  Cleans water spots and leaves bright gloss.  That said..  I like to apply this immediately after drying due to said water spots.  It seems to not like any residual water and tends to leaves streaks that need a lot of buffing to remove.  On a dry car though it works great and one spray goes a long way.
B0077HB3SC|5|Perfect fit and so easy it would be a crime to pay someone to do this for you.
B000E199R0|5|Fast shipping great product! !!!
B00KZCALVQ|5|Ordered two.  first one is installed and working nicely.  Hopefully in the next couple of weeks I will get the 2nd unit installed on my other truck.
B00JBQR30O|5|Washer tank on my car broke free on Wednesday. Hanging only by the hose, connectors and the fender liner. Ordered this replacement on Thursday, got it Friday. Installed Saturday. No leaks, exact fit. $100 less than dealership pricing.
B00FZQ0HPM|5|Perfect fit for 1999-2003 Lexus RX300. Buy with confidence!
B00BH0UD1I|4|Caps are a nice touch to my truck. Not 5 stars due to the Allen screw rusting within a week.
B000CIO86M|5|Did its job and kept my Comp 260EX cam from dying during break in.
B00YI3IGA6|5|shadesox,wow now this i really love ,i will be ordering more when i need them,the best product review i have ever done by far.i have told every one i see about the shadesox.and told them where they can get them.i use it on my car every day when i am at work,haqve had people ask me where i got them so i let them know ,am hoping they are ordering them.will order them again for sure ,very easy to put on and take off when you need to.
B00IXDN0Y4|5|These lights provide much brighter illumination in reversing ... they are an excellent supplement to the original reverse lamps.  They installed well and are of excellent quality!
B0041GKR6G|5|I enjoy mine very much. Covers up old upholstery and is very comfortable.
B0099QV9BU|1|I ordered the new model and received the older model, the black bottles, and they charged me the new model price. My filter was dirty so I used it anyways. I don't know the difference between the two but I'm assuming is better, that's why I decided to pay more.
B00KY33230|3|Not long enough for a full size truck.
B00MB0EXDC|3|These are  not this bright pink!  They are a very pale pink with very little sparkle.
B004BFW82I|1|Don't waste your money. Work one time and quit
B004HJJOZC|5|Product came as advertised
B000C54496|5|A problem solver should install themselves.  Moog makes the best mousetrap.  My last set lasted six years on a lifted f-350.
B009TAB73G|5|Truly a custom fit.  Light in weight compared to original matts,but looks like they are very well made and should last.
B001OD0VPG|5|Works as it should.
B001SQ15QS|5|Like it
B000AM8BF4|5|Works great right out of the box.
B000BNZPT2|5|Great product. Use it alot.
B00FSCDLG0|5|same part was 56 dollars at advanced auto parts I got it at amazon for 11.50 give or take a few pennies.<br />1995 dodge neon threw the code for this part and so Great deal ! Came in a few days and was brand new.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great size! Works very well! I was having issues with other shades always falling, this stays put! Perfect :)
B007QNPVQ2|5|item as stated and received on time
B0071J166A|3|The silver on the handle is fading and looks dull compared to the rest of the handle i may need to paint it, but has not broken and for that I'M HAPPY
B0050H39OW|5|Works great, worth the $. Easy to assemble . On time delivery.
B0067UBXEO|1|Had to bend it to make it fit. No quality control. Pay a little more for a better brand
B003NU0EM8|5|Excellent product. Fixed my dent in 5 seconds. Was skeptical at first but it worked, saved me from spending a lot if I sent it to the shop.<br /><br />Works well with bigger dents (2&#34; width or more). Highly recommended!!!
B00CFALFXY|4|Used first one to dust electronics and it worked great. Gave two to my husband to polish his guitars. He loves them too. Looking forward to finding all kinds of applications for these and making chores faster and easier.
B003YMTJ2G|3|Appeared like a new solid rotor, however it did not fit my 2006 Honda Accord. Had to return.
B000C18Q4Y|5|Work great thank you!
B00GJYTU48|5|Alternator Clutch Pulley Fits Nissan - Europe
B00LG07MZE|4|I have a 2011 Pathfinder and the shade fits well. It is a tad too big, but it can be maneuvered for a better fit. The shade folds down into a small size that can be easily stored. While the shade does protect the dashboard and the leather seats from the harmful rays, it doesn't necessary keep it cooler in the car. Of course, it is summer time in Texas. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.
B0054HNQ32|5|Great product.  Worth every dollar.
B001MUGTUW|5|Work as intended! I bought this because I have kids and we all know how messy they can be in cars. They were not difficult at all to install. You are getting a lot of things for the price I mean this set is really inexpensive.
B004C443P8|5|Great !!!
B00ELZBDOW|4|Works great. foam on the handle will tear easy so be careful
B00BSHXNJE|5|They key itself was perfect; but I did not realize when purchased that it still had to be &#34;cut&#34; by a special locksmith. In the end, replacing the key at a dealership is not that much more expensive, if at all. However, our locksmith came to the house which saved a lot of time and energy than if we'd used the dealership. Furthermore, the technical support given to the locksmith on &#34;pairing&#34; the key to the car was invaluable. There were written instructions with the key that were accurate, but the locksmith still had trouble, so having a real person walk him through it made all the difference.
B009LQG64S|5|we use lot of them
B003CR2BP0|5|Exactly as described.  Was cautious about ordering an auto part, but this was a great purchase.  Much less than what you would pay at a auot parts store, if they had them.
B00COYYGDM|2|Had a nice size dent in the nurf bar. But it's a nice look called Amazon and they compensated me for the damage. So I decided to just keep it.
B00B51VD0E|5|Quality and color matched perfect to my car - The template helped, was a little difficult getting bolts installed and def. must take out tail lights but overall VERY happy with end result.
B002M5HQQM|1|Bought these for 2009 Buick Enclave. A couple months later, car is back to bouncing around. Didn't last at all.
B0035U7LRM|5|Excellent product with great quality!  Works great with the motorcycle and love the volts it puts out at idle.
B004KK553I|3|Looked great for a year and then turned yellow
B00KPWB1KQ|4|Mislabeled. Passenger side rail went on drivers side. They come further out from the jeep than I was expecting. Self threading bolts would not bite in and self thread into the frame and &#34;self stripped&#34; wound up taking it to a shop to have the drilled holes tapped and used different bolts.<br />Other than that, well made, heavy, and strong. Girlfriend likes the way they look and likes having a step into the jeep.
B00Z8ACKDM|5|Any shade that helps alleviate car heat in Arizona has to be amazing! There was a surprisingly noticeable difference in the interior temperature of my car once I used these shades. The product stays put after installation but is also easy to move to another desired location if need be. I highly recommend this product!
B001L9ZBZS|5|I bought this to put on my new car! I like it because it is very simple but cute. The application process was very easy and fast. The shipping on the product was also very timely, it arrived sooner than I expected.
B00AK1KATA|5|i love these headlights the quality Is on par with the factory and must be bought with Hid bulbs. The low beams points slightly lower than factories but it's adjustable. However, it's street legal just don't have the headlights adjusted too high. The wide area field of view is not as wide as factories but it's acceptable but they're so beautiful during the day and night and you will turn heads maybe even break necks. By the way I bought my products from recon website you'll have a highw chance of the product working upon delivery and it's a gamble when buying after market lights on eBay because they might not work or be of cheap quality. And just in case you are wondering? The outer halos are low beams and the inner halos are high beams and the led strip is white not blue.
B000ARPVO8|5|Great!
B002RKJA6Q|3|VERY thin. Not at all what I thought it would. I would say it could be used as an under layer to something more substantial. I was VERY surprised to see arrive rolled up in a small plastic envelope! My son did not have an accident which this might have saved him, so although worn, it was untested. Maybe my son can use it for lacrosse practice.
B00GI5YQ88|5|This window weather strip is absolutely amazing. They line up exactly on the door without any bend or gap on either end. The color matches the rest of the car. I purchased as an anniversary gift for a 2014 Kia Soul. I would HIGHLY recommend this product for its look and price. Durability I am unsure since this was installed this evening, so will update in the future.
B00QHO4BDA|4|definitely worth it for organisation.
B000IZ03G8|5|Cheapest ceramic pads I could find for my 06 Denali. Plus you get the peace of mind that they are AC Delco parts which pretty much makes them OEM parts.
B010CP8OGY|5|Awesome item to make your car standout! I've had multiple carbon bumpers and would have a BMW without one!
B00OI8HZJ4|5|Awesome unit. Serious blow off pressure fr
B00BYGMING|4|Worked great
B005KOZ25Y|5|very useful
B008OADK9G|5|Great kit raised my camper 7 inches more than enough to not hang up on curbs and what not. I would recommend his kit and to weld the perches on the axles for added security. No way I could have reused the old u bolts too rusty!
B00KCQSOAA|1|Crappy material doesn't fit well on newer seats
B0082365AQ|4|Easy to assemble but hard to operate. Kayak falls off on rough terrain. I need to find something that will help keep the kayak from slipping. Any ideas? My 4 year old grandson helped me put one together and then put the other together by himself while I videoed. He also commented on something stinky in the box, then he tooted. Too funny.
B00W0HH8AQ|4|I wanted LED lights to match the kick panels for front doors. These look great and make all the lighting uniform. Some form of instructions would have been nice but I was able to find DIY videos on Youtube. Tip: With these LED lights if they don't light up with initial insertion then flip 180 degrees and reinsert.
B002PQJ95O|5|Worked great.  The old assemblies had the plastic deteriorate to the point of failure. these new light assemblies fit like a glove & match perfectly.
B000CITK8S|5|Simple and reliable.  Left it out on the boat in the rain accidentally and it still works.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a great trickle charger
B001UGJPXQ|5|We have a 35 ft Jayco travel trailer. The camper moves quite a bit with only one person walking around. It was quite annoying when my wife walked 5ft away from me, and i could feel the camper shake. When we had guests sleeping on the sofa-bed, you could feel the other person roll over in bed. We have electric stabilizer jacks installed on the camper.  I ordered 4 of these RV stabilizers before our last trip with guests. Installed 2 on each side.  Wow, what a difference. It eliminated about 75 percent of the trailer movement. No more shaking when you roll over in bed.  We didn't even know our friends were up in the morning. I would highly recommend these stabilizers.  4 works well on this long of a camper.
B00DTL2ZGE|4|Bought these for my wife's '03 Ram. They greatly improved the ride of the warn-out factory shocks. Well worth the cost.
B00B0ZJPDW|1|It had a flaw in it that wasn't discovered until many gallons of oil wasted later and I repaired it myself as it would have cost me more time and money to return the item.
B00CE3PA6A|5|My son and I replaced the rusty OE links on my 2007 Chevy Tahoe LTZ with these.  The originals had the rubber completed rotted away and the steel sleeve (with plastic outside) was frozen onto the bolt the keeps this all together.  I could hear the clicking sound with every bump and corner.  With the Grade 8 steel bolt on the Moog kit and the high-grade aluminum sleeve, rusting together will never happen again.  The urethane bushings will also outlast the OEM rubber  x3 at least.  After buying the Moog upper control arms and lower ball joints, I've finally found a brand to stick with.
B00NQ8F53A|1|It was a cheep piece of crap
B004ME8MZ0|4|Good product, just late due to UPS mess and I did not get to use them when needed.  When I did finally get this product, (late) they fit on vehicle just fine, do not jiggle, and help me see all I need to see when towing my camper.  UPS just makes it a horrible experience.
B00KZJQ2L2|4|It's a tad bit large for my vehicle (2005 Tucson Hyundai), but because it's flexible every nook and cranny is covered. It works as good as any other window coverings as far as I can tell. Since I live in Tucson, AZ we have high temperatures most of the year (esp., in a car). Most foldable ones start to fold in places that keeps them from staying up in the window soon after you start to use them. This sunshade won't do that because of the wires that stay flexible. When I crack the windows to let out the excess heat that builds up inside the vehicle, these shades make it much more tolerable to sit there and finish things up before leaving without getting heat stroke. Totally worth the cost!
B00N58KQMQ|5|This is a great product.  I love the remote.
B003O6XJDC|5|Perfect!!!!!!
B004BVCQSS|2|Not as direct fit as they say. I would had needed to remove my headlights from the fairing to apply them correctly. After trying to adjust the best I could, I just wasn't happy with the look. Also they have a purple tint rather than a smoke.
B004809YBE|5|Great product, great value!!!
B009B5ROYU|5|Great price
B001O7PNNM|2|Didn't seem to buff out scratches. Made it shiny though.
B009EVP4ZW|5|Works great!!
B0084LT9YU|5|Gives vehicle a classy look and functional!
B009GQ8IGM|5|Just what I ordered. Works perfectly.
B001O7PNNM|5|This is straight up like magic! There were a lot of scratches on my door handle area from keys and this basically removed all of them. It took a long time to get it delivered but it really does work to remove minor scratches.
B0015CIZDQ|5|Good fit, does not have heat shields
B00EJOT6A8|4|better than stock part
B00NQF60SW|5|makes passing drivers laugh
B00TEA0RXC|3|The hardware stripped really bad, but after buying some other hardware the installation went well. Great look and approach angel.
B00G3AK2TA|5|its lime green kawaskaki green if thats not enough of a reason get out of here<br /><br />it also fits great and fells great its been in 3 washes now has not shrunken of cracked letter i like it alot
B0077S1BBU|5|worked like a charm....nice to have it fixed!
B007KOT83Y|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Supper bright got them for back up lights
B00CU6B8CQ|5|Nice to always have a flashlight with you for dog walks and the safety flasher on the dog is a wonderful addition.
B007N6YWQM|5|Perfect fit and so easy it would be a crime to pay someone to do this for you. After buying this originally for the hatch in my Dodge Magnum, I went and bought them for others in the family who were also having issues with there hoods/trunks.
B00I38SGPW|5|great
B00UZ9H59A|4|Good, inexpensive gauge.  The gauge works and is accurate enough to tell you when you are getting in trouble.  No complaints.
B0022ZSWRO|4|This do not work on the right side of a Yamaha motorcycle specially on a Radian. Other than that is a good replacement.
B00HU3E1QO|5|Does what you would expect.
B00KFJSEW2|5|Awesome pouch.  Sturdy and sharp looking; doesn't sag!  Not tons of storage but in one side I keep an extra pair of foam backed riding glasses and in the other I have a knife/sheath and my garage door opener.  The material is stiff but I can press the the flap hard enough to operate the opener and open my garage door without taking it out!
B00DR67P9I|2|Filled openings with silicone and lights still let in moisture. Wouldn't recommend.
B004ZF3IT6|5|Had these installed for a couple weeks now. No issues so far. Installation pretty straight forward
B001V6MGZO|5|Nicely made
B003750KI2|5|Gauge is easy to read and glows in the dark very brightly. It feels very solid and it is accurate and consistent. The metal case and rubber cover that surrounds the gauge protect it from being knocked out of spec
B00NKA02GO|2|DOES NOT FIT RIGHT. TO LONG. SOME MODIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED
B00C3Z8DAY|1|Didn't know how to post before & after photos, but they were exactly the same!  This cleaner did nothing. Dry erase marker on tan leather is still there. This company made claims that ink was no problem. Very expensive too. Don't waste $ & time!
B00DQGW2S8|1|This is a great wast of money and time. I installed it on my vehicle and one of the fins broke this almost cost me an engine at about $10,000.00.<br />I'll strongly suggest not to even look at it !
B0081SQY1W|1|Horrible.. Melted in the sun and fell off mirror..
B005PZMLDY|2|very difficult to put on the back seat (2009 Jeep Liberty) Also not good for leather seats, they keep on sliding so I just removed them :(
B000V2W0GE|5|If you use a pump this is a must and come with everything it takes to hook it up
B002TMDUCC|5|Love it works great.
B009EVM810|5|These are a great purchase. They let you vent your vehicle on rainy days and on hot summer days when the vehicle will be parked in the sun for a while.
B000C540QI|1|I ordered this part because it showed a zerk fitting to accomodate regular lube jobs.  The part i recieved (ES2388RL / AXXES2388RL) does not come with a grease valve fitting, as seen in the picture, nor does it have a hole to allow for one.  I saw the identical issue with PartGeeks.com, so this is either a problem with the manufacturer (MOOG) or a shared distribution center.  Addendum: I have since ordered another tie rod end from my local Autozone and by chance found that this Moog part pictured by both Amazon and PartGeeks, as well as others, is in fact an image of a &#34;Duralast&#34; brand tie rod end.  A conversation with tech support at &#34;Federal Mogul Brand&#34;, the maker of Moog suspension parts, has confirmed that part ES2388RL is non-serviceable (ie. has no grease fitting).  Unfortunately this person also see's no problem with the box having a picture of a serviceable part, thus misrepresenting the product.  So Moog, you deserve the one star rating.
B0073MFT5O|5|good fit
B0083H5RDM|5|Worked Ok, no problems.
B00L2HCZ9E|5|SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!<br /><br />I was a bit nervous about buying a jacket online, I had checked in local stores and at the Harley Store and found quite a few jackets I liked, but I really liked the design on this jacket, and the inside concealed gun pockets, so I took a chance and ordered a jacket online. Super glad I did, this jacket is amazing, Heavy leather, a nice detachable inner liner. The reflective skulls are nice and look amazing. Stitching is clean and strong. Nicer then most of the jackets I saw in the stores.<br /><br />If your on the fence about buying a jacket online like I was, you won't be disappointed with this one.
B00QWYO5A4|3|Some people say there's is pinker than the photo.  The one I received was almost as red as the photo just a shade or two lighter.  The thread adapters are garbage so I suggest buying a metal one in addition to this.  Also FYI this is metal and gets very hot in the sun and during summer.
B004XH7TP0|5|perfect fort my air horn system
B005KVPYQ4|5|Make my ram  looks great but need rear lift now
B00COYNZJ8|5|great and very fun thank you so much :)
B002QS3F9C|5|Easy to install and works great
B002R0MNXS|5|Exactly what I needed. Not the pretty LED lights, but it works and looks ok. Seller is great.
B001EDBEZM|4|Good
B00KI1C4AK|5|Fit perfectly and arrived on time.
B00563RU4U|1|Did not work for my ford focus.  Followed programming guide and was able to program other fobs (ordered elsewhere) but not this one.
B000GTYA8S|5|great for at the races.  easy to use and well constructed.
B000GVBQT2|1|Piston shattered less than 2 minutes after start up. Never in my experience have I seen this happen. Now I get to tear down the lower end too, oh yay!
B008BVZPCI|4|Appears to be of like quality as the original, installed easily.  True test will be over the long haul.
B000IYNTWY|5|This is my second replacement radiator. Both the original and first replacement cracked in the same area. So I'm guessing this is a car issue. But this fit just like the other ones. Did it at home on the driveway with standard tools
B00X32LTT8|3|Low suction and so small that it's only really helpful for small spills.<br /><br />Disclosure: While I was given a discount on this item, I was not paid for my review and it is my unbiased opinion.
B00TF7BVWK|3|Product arrived on time and reasonably well packaged. Product folds nicely for storage.  When in use the sides are a bit weak and the dividers are very weak.  It is OK for intermittent used but there are much better products out there.....Even at this price point it is a marginal product at best...
B00NQ45AA2|5|Perfect for my son who loves anything Star Wars
B00192JG9O|4|This is very nice flag pole. I'm very happy with the quality of the pole and anchor system. The little spring loaded D rings that come with it are not very good, but for 99 cents you can get a whole pack of them at Walmart.
B000BW8VZ8|1|DOES NOT FIT LT1 OR ANY POST '91 CHEVY V8.
B000IYSIUC|4|fit and allowed my ac to work at lights or idle. 1998 honda civic ex coupe. You will have to get under the car to loosen up some of the wiring. Tight to get out, but you can get it out.
B005PEW5TU|4|Bought this for my son's 2003 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V.  It immediately fixed the issue (hence the current 4 star rating), BUT there is still an issue with the idle (even after doing idle relearn multiple times).  Will report back after more testing and experience with this MAF sensor. Hoping we won't need to replace this with OEM - something that has been recommended as a known fix for this.
B00AHJZBCG|4|works great, no complaints...price was right.
B001F0MBWE|5|It does a good job and goes on easy
B0045LXHUA|5|Perfect! Just what I needed.
B002UBZL8I|4|Bought this as a replacement for a failed one. Unit was easy to install, but I had to enlarge the opening as it was bigger than the previous unit. Other than that the wiring was easy.
B004GBJSZW|5|Excellent product. Works perfect. We used it to installed a number of glass pieces and this tool make the job of handling the pieces so much easier.
B00AYH48M0|5|Very good!!!!
B004ZF39ZY|5|Looks amazing in my car for such a affordable price. Thanks
B00KCXMCTM|3|Some are a bit flimsy but they do the job
B009HLFRKQ|3|At day it doesnt see at all
B00DM8NH02|5|Came out good fit perfectly on my 2011 chevy silverado
B00P2D41OQ|5|These were installed in my 2015 Honda Accord EX-L V6 sedan. When reversing at night these lights help tremendously in illuminating the landscape enough for me to see in the rear view camera compared to the stock bulbs. As others have stated the light temperature is pure white and gives the car a clean look. From safety to aesthetics you win both ways.  I have also installed these in the following cars... -2012 Toyota Camry SE V6 -2012 Hyundai Elantra Limited -2013 Chevy Malibu  These did NOT fit in the 2015 Camry SE. While the bulb type is correct, the housing is 1-2mm too shallow for this bulb.
B00C7P12EO|5|Nice product.  Light, easy to use and effective.
B00AN7CT4K|5|This make its work very well, eliminate all the oil in the engine and the plastic parts, now looks very cleaner, i will buy it again.
B00BFDIUZ8|5|I installed this myself on my 2005 Acura TL (even though Amazon said that this part shouldn't fit). The &#34;check engine&#34; light has been off for over 5 months. I guess it worked fine. Bought this part after receiving an oxygen sensor fail code. I used the following link to see how to install (http://acurazine.com/forums/problems-fixes-114/e-130-diy-oxygen-o2-sensor-installation-rear-upstream-f-aka-p2251-811823/).
B004R30BCS|5|Very solid hitch, I use it a few times a year, most of the time I use my WD Sway hitch.
B001V3959W|5|Great glasses. Still a little wind in your eyes while riding but better than most regular glasses.
B00RYPYNVG|5|Works as described. In anything it needs one more rim protector.
B00MV8W0O8|4|The arms are well built bushing were a lil to big to slide the factory mounts. but other then that their great. I am at 5&#34; of lift and they still had lots of threads left
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Bought this for a 1500 mile trip. Still working months later. haven't had any power issues at all. Would recommend to anyone who needs one.
B00T5J030Y|5|great
B006CUIL2Q|5|These work great, though the wires are far too short and needed to be lengthened. They are very clear, the refresh rate must be very quick. They look good too, can read in the light and at night (and its a convertible).
B00BTSFUD4|1|Purchased two of these to prepare a couple of helmets. Most items worked well but did not receive the microphone wind screens. I read in some earlier reviews that this was an issue but figured that this issue would have been resolved by now. NOPE. They just continue to sell the package without it. Everything else in the package did great for preparing my helmets. If it wasn't for the false advertising my rating would be much higher. To not have dealt with this issue by now tells me they just don't give a crap.
B0068FX74C|5|Great kit! Worked well.
B000GKD5NI|4|Was a little larger then we thought, or we mis-measured. Does not fit the back out of our larger truck. So we ended up with it in the car, so far it seems to be working well.
B00GD4I97S|5|Fit my 2002 Caddy SLS.  Price was excellent and quality seems to be as well.
B002M9LBIC|5|Product works very well on brake dust build-up.
B0001EFSTI|5|Very handy device to keep on your keychain!<br /><br />Don't forget to remove it when flying.  It made it through screening (I forgot it was there) 12 flights but it didn't make the 13th.
B001THQP84|5|works great to hang my lights of the awning
B00REJXRS2|5|I love the TriFold Tonneau cover from MaxMate  ! It hides and protects any cargo that may be in the bed of the truck. It's easy to access and easy to secure if it needs to be removed to haul something large. Great product ! !
B000MS5T42|4|Bought the Lumax 90 Degree grease coupler to fit a fitting that couldn't be reached straight on. I thought the coupler screwed on to the end of my grease gun but the coupler has its own fitting inside the sleeve that's shown. If a lot of pressure is needed on the fitting, your gun might pop off the coupler fitting so be mindful of that.
B00IUV7PFO|5|There were no power sport batteries at any of the local stores, so I ordered this one--which was cheaper and, even better, maintenance free.<br /><br />It works great. Came fully charged. The output on the display matched my multimeter. Had issues in the middle of the woods and had to crank my 400EXC a bunch of times and this battery never showed sign of giving up.<br /><br />The battery is just slightly wider than my previous battery, so it is a snug fit in the battery box (it bows out a bit).  Not bad enough to cost it a star.
B001TLP6UI|5|Excellent
B0006PXYGQ|5|Grate product loved it even  though it was a pain only problem I had with my 01 dodge dakota slt was the steering extention bolt hit on the motor mount but a little grinding never hurts love it
B00COXVNNO|3|I'm only giving it three stars because it says &#34;Works on ALL OBD2 compliant vehicles( not including Ford)!&#34; and it does not work on a 2005 Nissan Xterra. I have tried with multiple OBD apps on my Samsung Note 4 and MacBook Pro laptop, all of which can connect to the unit itself, but the unit is unable to read data from the vehicle.  EDIT: I have noticed there is something loose inside the unit and you can hear it rattling if you shake it, so I have requested a replacement, if it works, you will see it here.
B00029JC6M|4|worked of my jeep in my Weber carb conversion
B00KHUAQO8|5|Heavy duty works great
B0009IBJE4|3|product feels very cheaply built.
B000CHG0H8|1|installed in van worked for 3 weeks and quit

B00LBOK8JW|5|Fantastic lamps. Could not believe the brightness. Incredible bang for the buck.
B00LNNR9GG|4|These bulbs are very bright and they fit well. However they are a bit too blue for me. They look about 6000k color temperature. Im looking for something a little more nuetral. If you have aftermarket HIDs, these will match nicely. But these make my OEM HIDs look almost yellow.
B00412YT8W|5|Was a great buy and easy to install if you have two hours to spare. Great investment
B000BZI1UU|5|Easy to install. I had a check engine light on for a sensor malfunction and this cleared it.
B003WKHMBA|1|The service I received while ordering this product was amazing however the product itself was not so great at all we only have the seat covers on the seats for less than 24 hours and the seams are already ripping not satisfied with this product at all!
B00G0PJNKW|5|Perfect fit
B000ALJ4NS|1|This worked really good to reattach my car mirror. My mirror is heavy because it has all of the electronic gizmos attached to it. The first time I tried it, it fell off. I did not wait the full 5 minutes. I tried it again and per the instructions, I let it set for 5 minutes before letting it go and it is holding up good as new.<br /><br />I had to revise this. My mirror in my car fell off less than a year later. Back to the drawing board.
B00K6T5IWA|5|To change the strobe pattern you leave the hot wire connected and break the ground connection real quick.  That will change the pattern.
B0054RYIR0|4|sucks.. dont work..
B0047DTDH2|5|Installed in a 2014 Passat, just didn't want the rear to sag when loaded up with passengers and stuff. Worked great and install was a breeze.
B00FRHOLK6|1|Streaky windshield wipers are the worst kind. This wiper hasn't worked well since the day I put it on.
B001Q4DX9E|5|It works great.
B002P35N66|4|Nice product!
B001F0I4QQ|5|Good
B005GDZP1U|5|Lasts forever.  Love it!
B001MA1P24|5|These fog lights look awesome on my 4Runner.
B001AIZ5HY|4|Very high quality kit.<br />I love the fact on the drill bit it has the foam padding under the velcro to protect against using too much pressure.<br />They include enough product to do multiple vehicles if done right.<br />I recommend wiping sand paper off on your jeans from time to time because it gets clogged up. Just because it's clogged up doesn't mean you throw it away, simply wipe it off and continue or you just wasted that pad.<br />I've done 3 vehicles with my kit, one with heavily oxidized headlights and one with medium oxidized, and one lightly oxidized.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this kit does NOT contain headlight protectant, so I recommend picking up some Meguiar's Headlight Protectant. I also recommend picking up Meguiar's PlastX. When your headlights start to haze, put some PlastX on, and then some Protectant, and your headlights will look perfect again. You could go longer, but I'm very OCD about my vehicle, and I hate the slightest oxidation. Put protectant on when you do your oil change!
B002L0HOZG|5|Great product
B000C9U126|5|Fit Perfect.
B00I6YBATM|5|I bought this for my boyfriend and he was so excited! You just need a patient and steady hand to make sure you don't get to many bubbles. My boyfriend loves it on his car!
B007LICGWY|5|My car has black accents and this plate frame fits the motif.  The plastic frame I got from the dealer broke (since it was plastic) and this metal plate is a great replacement.
B001C95580|5|these are like night and day over my stock pads, kind of high dust but well worth it.<br />I run them on a 2015 subaru wrx
B000C8T9LQ|5|Great price, perfect fit and seems just like the factory filter.
B00FB7YO0Y|5|excellent very good , the only thing is that when packaged to be more careful because the crystals are broken in transportation like bulbs
B000GU7I72|5|fit my Honda shadow Aero w windshield, highway bars, saddle bags and twin backrests perfect.....covered the entire bike to the floor. Don't know about the weather proof aspect of the cover. My bike is inside.....just tired of the dust and random pollen settling on the bike. The XX size is the way to go for any bike the size of mine or larger.....seems to be a well built cover.....time will tell.
B000O5NQOS|5|Great. My father in law is starting a wedding business and they have a few unique fun parking spots like this now.
B003S87D4W|5|I have a 2005 Toyota Corolla and this key is a great inexpensive backup key. It cost only $5 to get it cut by a locksmith and was easy to program myself.<br /><br />Here are the steps I used to program the new key:<br /><br />1. With the doors closed and unlocked, insert the original master key in the ignition 5 times leaving it in on the 5th insertion. 2. Immediately open and close the driver side door 6 times. 3. Pull out the master key and the security light should start blinking. 4. Immediately put in the new cut key and wait for the security light to stop blinking. This may take up to 2 to 3 minutes of blinking. When it stops blinking, pull out the key. 5. Put the master in and start the car and turn off. 6. Put in the new key and the car should start, programming is complete.<br />If it does not work on your first try, do it again. (It took some people 2-3 tries because they did the steps too slowly the first time such as not pulling the master out soon enough after opening and closing the door.)
B00EI6CKVE|5|I absolutly love this decal. I get lots of laughs. Ive had it on over a year and its still on my car and looks new. I still get a laugh at it myself when i see all thise stick figure family decals... Truthfully im quite annoyed by them thats why i bought this. I actually have an extra that im putting on my newest car. I wanted to wait and see how well it held up.
B000CPIMXK|5|Used this to paint the instrument panel of a '59 GMC Pickup my dad is restoring.  I watched some videos before I attempted it.  Followed their advice and it looked great when I was done.
B0031I0NCS|4|look ok, made in china
B001HBWW48|5|Fast service and very good price.
B00WVZV074|2|Nice and bright, the color is excellent. they do flash fast .. but i don't mind since i know it will be almost impossible for these light to burn completely out , I love leds because of this redundancy ..<br /><br />I don't like the fact that they create radio interference (static). every time they blink you can hear static on the radio :(<br />2006 Mazda3<br /><br />Please let me know if this review was helpful or if you have a fix for this issue.<br />Happening with the red ones from the same vendor on the breaks .. and those bug a lot more.<br /><br />UPDATE : Still having bad radio static when lights are on, Will be changing these lights out soon.
B0058VYZR0|5|installation was easy on 2015 Toyota Sequoia. clean and dry area before installation. cheap investment on foot traffic
B000HBGGQ4|3|Convenient and seems to work as expected ~ Nice scent ~ Bottles seem to have an issue and &#34;cave in&#34; at a point ..
B00SDQPI46|2|Parts look great and fit great, but the overall quality is bad.  The lock does not fit in the plastic back; its as if the plastic that holds the lock from the back was designed for a different size lock.  What's worse is that rear part of the plastic lever does not sufficiently contact the metal lever to release the latch- basically the part will not function once it is installed.  This is not the first aftermarket door handle I have installed on this Toyota and would recommend the Dorman part over this one.  Will attempt to return the parts.
B00HCVRPY4|1|No directions and fell apart easily.
B000CC9C64|5|Got mine on sale from another online retailer for $103, and am very happy with it.<br /><br />I have an 04 2500HD with a 6.0. I kept the factory dual in/dual out pipes, and just replaced the muffler. Sound is great and not raspy at all. Low rumble down low. Can hear it a little bit on the interstate, but it's not that noticeable at all. It drones from 1500-2000rpm, but I don't spend that much time there, so it's not a problem.<br /><br />Inside the muffler, there is an X-pipe, so you won't need to buy one of those extra.<br /><br />Welds look like the prep work wasn't done properly, but that's why I filled out the warranty card. I still expect it to last until my truck dies.
B009L0BON2|5|It may look different for the 04 ninja 636 sprokets. They fit the same.
B006TMKFXA|1|Tabs to secure bulb were not present.  Bulb has nothing to lock to.
B00D2I0IAE|1|So far I'm disappointed with this scanner.  The main reason to buy it was after issues I had with my brake lines rotting the ABS and BRAKE lights are on in my 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche 1500 Z71.  This scanner is supposed to be able to read ABS codes but comes up with the message that this vehicle does not support ABS codes.  This seems incorrect as it is listed as one of the vehicles supported.<br /><br />The tech service help line was also of little help, I tried their suggestion of removing the batteries, then starting the vehicle and plugging it in, still the same problem.  The next time I called what is labeled as ASE Tech. 1-877-CarScan I got a lady who kept asking if my truck was a &#34;heavy truck&#34;, I kept telling her no, it's a 1500, 1/2 ton pickup.  Then she asked is it a regular Avalanche?  I said again, yes it's a 1500 and she just didn't understand this.  This makes me believe that the ASE Tech is BS as she has no clue but she did help me get a complaint submitted but unfortunately now they need to find someone local with the same make/model to test it on, how long am I supposed to wait?
B00DCO4LAQ|1|I am very disappointed. It took about a month to receive the item.
B000IYITU6|5|My 01 Mustang was needing new spark plugs, and these Motorcraft suppressors, with finewire platinum tip, provides longer service intervals up to 100,000 miles. The only replacement spark plugs recommended by Ford Motor Company for Ford vehicles. These I got at Amazon at a really good price, as always.
B00075XCT4|4|2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo with skid plates. Good quality product seems durable, but it is a pain to put on.
B000C9EK50|5|Had a hard shifting problem on my 1999 Grand Prix. Went to the local parts store and got a BWG (Borge Warner) TPC. The transmission shifted a lot better but had an intermittent hard 1 to 2 shift. Not wanting to go to a transmission shop and get ripped off I decided to try the OEM replacement.<br />The difference was day and night between the power curve and how the car drives between this TPC and the BWG. The car accelerates and downshifts like it did when it was new.  I still get a hard 1 to 2 shift but its so rare now that it dosent bother me because the car drives so much better. The price of the auto store part and OEM part on Amazon were about the same.<br />For electronic parts I have learned an important lesson. Stick with the OEM.
B00F1ZW43U|5|Perfect
B00R3C3RDA|4|Been on for a year now so far so good now gonna put sum on my2003 dodge neon as well........
B001ODAS68|5|Factory replacement and good price.  Arrived in two days.
B0009TOBVG|5|I bought this because I have a Gambler Bass boat and the motor is far away from the trailer so my standard transom saver is about 5' long. I replaced it with this Attwood Lock in and man it makes it a lot easier installing and storing. This is a great product.<br /><br />Vel<br />Hilliard FL.
B000C57ZSI|5|Appear to be good quality
B000E8OUZY|1|dont waste your money.........have to replace after  2 years, they leaked. warranty is only 1 yesr.
B000CRXGH0|5|Good
B00CRR5L8U|1|This pump died after one month of use, beware!  I called the warranty phone number and it was just a string of paid ads that lasted for ten minutes.  What a joke!  I'm filing a grievance with my credit card company to get my money back.
B00E9FJWHE|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B00UI3U98C|3|product O.K. may stick to the clay bars
B00559VRDU|5|Worked perfectly for my 2007 Impala. Just had to reset the check engine light. You MUST also buy the wire harness (AC Delco part #19257603) so that it will fit properly.
B00GSAUHB8|1|Great idea but the wire popped out after about a month of use and is very sharp.
B00CQNXOSO|4|seem to adhere well to our car.
B00480GZ6G|5|No complaints.
B000I66JEM|5|This is perfect for filling the space when I am not using the hitch. Be sure to keep your keys in a plastic bag and throw a silicone packet in with them to prevent moisture build up. I would NOT advise using this in the winter with the potential for salt damage. I've run into a situation where I needed a torch to remove a master lock pin bolt because the salt seized the tumbler.
B00PT18QAQ|4|very good quality
B00E9FRQPY|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B007Q945UE|1|Upon opening the package I didn't have high expectations as the product looked and felt cheap.  Construction was haphazard with the LED chips not installed uniformly on the board.  After installing in the dome light socket the light would not light up.  I even tried installing on a different vehicle which yielded the same results.  I returned the product and would not purchase again nor would I recommend anyone else purchase this light.
B000WFW416|5|Very good!!!!
B010VUZGFC|2|Although my make and model was listed as compatible with these covers, they were not. They did not fit properly at all so I would suggest contacting the seller with questions. Also you must have access room under the seat to connect the Velcro straps which, due to side seat panels, I did not have. I have contacted the seller for return and hope to hear back soon.
B000B5ZM6Q|4|These covers fit my wheels comfortably even though my tires are at the farthest end of the size range. I just got these so I cannot speak about how long they will last but the construction seems strong and they do seem sturdy.  They are really, really white, but I am sure over time that will fade a little. I just hope they protect my tires from the elements
B00JA80PEO|2|Bought to talk with my wife while she's learning to ride, have to fight with it every time we try to connect the intercoms, and when it does work, the buyee won't connect the intercom again after it is disconnected, the other intercom has to initiate it. Spend a little extra and get a sena, I've never seen them have connection issues. Second star was because it connects to my phone just fine.
B00C42SYO6|5|Fit my 2006 GMC envoy perfect, had no problems happy buyer.
B00I3K4RXA|5|best shine
B00JRU9WKS|1|Was to small for me phone
B004O844EM|4|Worked great with a good price compared to other brands. Assembly directions suck, words are vague and pictures (most important) are way to small.
B004JAZ7IC|4|worked as described
B00LNDK5DA|5|Very nice.  Includes bulb.  Bulb is held in a real socket, not some bent metal clamp thing.  No indication of which wire connects to the tail light filament vs the brake/signal filament, but there are only two to worry about so by using the trial and error method, it did not take too long to discover the correct connections.
B00ARUPXTQ|5|affordable extras for the truck/car
B008QR1ANA|1|I bought those cloths in red (it was the only one available) and it was the biggest mistake I made. They stained all my white rags when I washed them together and also everything I wiped with. I don't recommend even the white one bc the fabric is so thin that you can't even use it to clean a mirror they don't dry it.
B00CEK88DU|4|I have always used Honda friction for my Odyssey. There is never squeal or grinding like seems to happen with most ceramic pads. They last about 25,000 miles on the front and twice as long on the rear. The only draw back I can see is that they are very dusty. I'd rather have dust than brake noise.
B004I0SW1W|5|Fit perfectly and are clear and very bright
B00DPMLA22|5|Looks great on our car! Very sturdy and beautiful to look at.
B00FUT7IP6|5|they definitely improved my 350z's performance aspect and definitely stopped the misfire i had
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fits my 2013 Prius V well. Folds up easily and fits on the side door pocket area.
B004JAKFLQ|5|Good fit, good value.
B00EEKN9YG|4|I have 2002 grizzly product works good and fits good but little tough getting to so you can turn off and on
B00IZOM41G|4|Really nice sunshade. Definitely helps keep the car cooler. I wouldn't say it says it helps as much as the the details says it does but it's better than a cheap sunshade.
B00IAAV5XI|5|Purchased and installed with the Borgeson 000950 steering shaft.  This gearbox and shaft set are designed as an exact replacement/ upgrade for Dodge Ram trucks and does so perfectly.  Installation was simple and straightforward. I have installed several Borgeson steering upgrade parts over the years for others who have been very satisfied. This is the first install of Borgeson parts on my own vehicle and I am very glad I did it. The quality and manufacturing of the parts is second to none, finishing is flawless. Performance is immeasurably improved over the worn out & leaking stock gearbox.  The steering ratio is tighter, and all of the slop is completely gone from the steering system. The power assist is much more noticable when doing fast maneuvers at slow speed (backing trailers or off-road in tight areas) and the variable assist is great at higher speeds.<br />Note:  Waste at least a gallon of fluid to completely flush the steering system otherwise the warranty is void and performance & life span will suffer. Look elsewhere for instructions on flushing techniques and repeat the process with alot of fluid before putting the system under pressure.
B004RH8H1Q|5|EXCELENT
B005LWZPZ2|5|Great quality, exactly what I wanted.  Gary
B00N5UBQHS|5|Bought the lithium battery for my son's motorcycle.  This was the recommended charger. Works as described.  Most products by Battery Tender work well.
B00XZ78W3C|5|Just as good, if not better, than anything on the market today, at a fraction of the cost.  Thule charges three times the price for racks, that do the same thing as the Apontus racks.  It pays to shop around.
B00F8KUTWQ|2|Very cheaply built. Jack broke on me even before I was actually able to use it.
B00E9HWQ2U|5|Great
B00QK11YPI|5|Love it.Beautiful,with a snug fit.Its exactly as pictured.
B007DIE9VS|4|Looks great, although you cant see it well on my tinted windows. I put some foil behind it, so you can see it.
B000EVYH36|5|Works great
B00HV50HLY|4|Good
B00JV61WCO|4|Would the seat covers fit an  kia optima ? And the back seats??
B00DPLEND6|5|This bar is great it looks and feels good on my bike. It came packaged in a bar sock so no scratching it's def worth every penny. High quality very pleased with the purchase.
B0006GK5NA|3|Works satisfactory
B002PUTC0M|2|Does not work well for dually truck tire/rim setups.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Just installed these on a 2006 Chevy Impala for the reverse light bulb...they look great, really bright
B009LUQFMC|5|Super bright and allows me to find anything in my truck at night.
B002EW5G2O|4|Cleans excellent
B000C5WCFO|5|All the right stuff, all the right prices. thanks
B00OTZNMX4|5|Thank you. I had been looking for. Thank you vary much. Paul
B00H429DY6|4|good product, once the instruction glitches were worked out.
B0046KNO26|5|Super strong and fit perfectly on 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
B00DOLOGC0|4|OK does not hold up to water that good. When I re-wrap I am going to try paining it with header paint.
B0009JKGII|4|I bought a new car 4 months ago, and found tree sap on the roof.  I sprayed this on it and let it sit a few minutes. It took 3 tries to get it completely off, perhaps because the sap had been there for a while.  Nevertheless, it worked with no damage to the paint job.
B001GMX4A4|5|Simple to install.  Lower to ground than other products but was able to install by myself without cutting license plate frame on Chevy 2500.
B00ODFO9HI|5|Wow.  The quality of this solution is terrific!  I have a short bed F150 and the small size is perfect for my needs.
B005VPWRY6|5|Fit perfect for my T&C 2008.
B011Q18D14|5|No more guessing with this nifty little device. Plugs in under the dash. I had my check engine light come on..: I plugged this device into my 2006 Chevy pickup and it gave me a code to look up in the booklet that comes with it. Turns out it was an evap code because I forgot to put my gas cap back on. Learn something new every day. Nice having this little machine so I have an idea of what problems I'm getting into. Should be a must have in every car. I would recommend this. I did receive this product at a promotional discount for the exchange of my honest unbias review.
B00GEIIQ12|4|It works.
B008J5H6I2|2|Still does not cut enough noise that I can sleep at night with this unit running.
B001CEG90I|5|This filter was an exact replacemt for our 2011 Toyota Sienna cabin air filter.<br /><br />The price was right and quality was on par with the oem part.
B0091YV1F4|4|great replacement bulb. very bright, cool blue color.
B00JIIZCM6|5|I used this to clean the car seats, my leather shoes and handbags. Very nice product, cleaned easily and well with no residue. Left the leather soft and supple. Very pleased with this product
B001XLG5FE|5|I bought this for my 2014 Chevy Cruze and its a little big but I love it! ☺️
B00BWPG37Q|4|Breathability is not too bad and the jacket looks great. Reflectiveness is good, the pads slide around a little too much, especially around the shoulders. I am 5'8&#34;, 170lb, and the medium has the right arm length and shoulder width and torso length for me but the jacket has more waist and stomach space than I need.<br /><br />Also, the back protector goes up to the top Lumbar disk and leaves the lower area exposed. I have to ride with an offsprey backpack stuffed with the right size back protector instead of using the Jacket's built-in back pocket
B0036TOFY4|3|Missing necessary hardware.
B00GYDBPL0|4|It has a small frame, You cant see the design unless your on top of it. But my car is all Disney.
B005C1Y9D6|5|Fairly easy to install, recommend going to YouTube to check into how to remove lens cover for your respective vehicle model.  Light install simple plug in.  Best to test before installing lens cover as if light doesn't come on..simply remove and switch 180 for proper polarity.  Lights are very bright and produce a white light as one would expect from LEDs.
B00EZUL6ZY|4|good quality for the price
B008SHTZ2Q|5|As expected 👍!!!
B0055PD1H4|3|definitely made the trim darker but the color faded after it rained.
B00HHH1IUK|5|As advertised. Very bright, great reflector coverage.
B000BUU5YA|4|Sturdy, strong and well made.
B0031I808M|5|Stock replacements for a 2006 Yukon Denali.
B00Q8ECCXK|3|Fit great, poor paint job on inside of bezel. Had to touch up paint.
B0030430KK|5|Just what I needed as it is soft and made to be a replacement for OEM.
B00U7WHY7I|5|Fast shipping fit perfectly and works perfectly.
B00473W5V8|5|Fantastic stuff. Used it with the 3M 08609 Window-Weld Super Fast Urethane Black to repair re-adhere a glass window to convertible top.
B007V2E3S0|5|Fits great and easy to fold up.
B000SL4AA2|4|A bit smaller than expected but it serves the purpose.
B00GXDN30W|4|Fits the stator side just fine! Don't need the other side but it's there. Didn't like the fact it was folded in half... Could of creased it and caused gaps in the seal. Other than that it works just fine!
B002XLHUQG|5|This product was every thing I expected it would be. Works wonderful for the application I am using for.
B004AQZGJU|5|Fast delivery good price
B000XSI96G|5|worked perfect
B0049C6ZM2|5|Arrived on time, good so far
B003VFNZEY|4|GREAT BUY AND FAST DELEVERY
B004LYJAG6|2|This is for the old style plugs of the sony stereo's beware!
B00C5SS1CO|5|Got my part and itworking fine now
B00496JLW4|5|Filters the air and fits my vehicle.  That's all I can really expect and it does it nicely.
B00A82A3RK|5|As a third party batter for power wheels. 1/2 the price and 3 times as good. Best battery with super long life - easily 3 to 5 times long than power wheels battery.<br />This battery works for all power wheels 12v to give added boost and long lasting power.<br />For the connections I used batter tender - with their quick connects. you may need to modify engine compartment or battery location. on two power wheels I did not modify but on a power wheels Escalade I cut out some plastic to fit.
B00L841X7Q|5|They fit on our BMW x5 as a glove. Good price
B008BVZPCI|1|Did not fit properly, does not work. Cannot return. Bad deal. Oh well?
B004HXB44M|4|Slides around more than we would like, but looks good and seems durable.
B00EAIG58E|4|Unfortunately freezes up and you have to reboot it sometimes. Actually flashing the ECU involves a lot of patience as you have to turn your car off and on a million times before it starts the flash. The 0-60 app will sometimes finish prematurely and not display any results. In the end it still flashes a new tune so it's fine.<br /><br />One thing to note: A &#34;realtime&#34; flash does not update the entire tune. When you want to switch tunes a full blown flash is the way to go.
B001UMZ07A|3|Every product in this kit is black.  Wear gloves, and use a separate compound between the pre-wax cleaner and wax.  This will not really take out superficial scratches.  Got my black Jeep JK looking really good, but the &#34;prewax cleaner&#34; would be better subbed with a good compound.
B004JAMAXC|4|Good fit, good value.
B000C55MQK|5|My 2005 Grand Caravan rides better than new.  The ride is not stiffer and the rise in the rear is barely noticable. Much better control and the &#34;wallowing&#34; is gone. Exceeded my expectations.
B00590W5IG|4|Mirror fits perfectly.  Easily installed.
B0016I5AK0|5|Product was as described. Fit just like the original. Product was shipped quickly and undamaged.
B0009OA4JO|3|I am unable to use the seat I purchased.  I had looked at other seats on other websites and they all had the brackets to bolt the seat to the tractor.  When amazon put up this seat I had just used the tractor and the broken worn-out seat was a fresh memory so I ordered the seat,  having seen it listed Massey Ferguson as a tractor it would fit.  I did not notice there were no mounting brackets in the picture or description;  so my mistake , so I will not return the seat.  I just have a useless seat unless I can cobble together some way to attach the seat.
B00ECCOWQU|5|Bought as a gift. They loved it and keep it on their keychain. It was a bit bigger than I thought, but the birthday boy liked it!
B00753S8CC|5|Love it!!
B0002X520S|5|You can't beat this stuff. I apply it with my finger to heat up the product and work it into leathers. It conditions my leather belts far better then the feed provided by the manufacturer. It smooths over scuffs from shoes really easily. It protects leather in all but the worst rains. Best of all on smooth leathers it creates a great shine and can be used as the base for a mirror shine on the toe. Along with Saphir polish I use this on my best dress shoes.<br /><br /> Highly recommend this product for all your leather conditioning needs.<br /><br />P.S. Generally I have found it is best to let the product sit for up to three days before brushing off, since it goes on very wet and heavy compared to others.
B00JQR53ZU|1|Not very good quality in my opinion.  Headlamp assembly fits loose and moisture has caused the reflective material inside to start flaking away.  Now i need to get a new headlamp.
B00977GPA6|4|Good Price & Fast ship.
B00WQNIC36|2|Took over a month to get in. And poor to fair quality was very hard to keep sticker together while applying.
B00H8TJ9UI|5|fit perfect to the body style, easy to install
B008B7OGB8|5|Bought for my fathers BMW scooter and it's perfect. I feel better knowing he has a great first aid kit.
B00VCS14ZO|5|Works for 2015 ford fusion
B008FNCZSE|5|excelent
B000LG41RQ|5|Nice sound for a V6
B00W78DH3A|1|Worked for a week then the high beam burned out
B00BUSIKQ2|5|Great to put groceries in! I love it
B005O31WMS|5|Very good
B007Y87SKG|5|It's in and it is working flawlessly. What else can you say about something that has one simple job to do and gets it done. As for installation on my 1997 Ford Explorer .......with the help of my friend Charlie (who also has an old Explorer) we popped off a few wires, took off three bolts and it was installed much more quickly than I would have thought. I had a few people tell me that changing an alternator is not very hard and now I know firsthand. The hardest part was knowing the few covers, etc. that needed to removed to make it easier to get your hands in a position to undo the bolts. Thankfully Charlie was familiar with what needed to go. There are YouTube videos that will provide you step by step instructions if you're going to do it yourself.
B003TDIL5G|5|Very easy to get on my 2&#34;07 Tacoma.
B000GTWX7I|5|These T handles make maintenance SO MUCH EASIER than typical sockets or wrenches !
B00CVFIJ14|3|Makes your Mercedes keys look cheap
B00UFERZKO|5|Well made does the job as described easy to use.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fits perfectly.  Stays up. My older accordion type kept falling down.  This does not.
B00VEK67VG|5|I have the Husky Liners in my truck already and had to get them as soon as I bought my new Mustang also.  They fit perfectly and really protect the carpet/interior.  All of my future vehicles will get Husky Liners as well.  Keep up the great work!
B00E4VYUUW|5|Awesome for a 350Z. Old antenna made my car look like it was radio-controlled. This installs super easy and gets better reception that my factory antenna.
B00FKVANY2|3|POOR QUALITY, BUT IT WORKS
B004W13LEU|5|Fit perfectly on my 2012 Nissan Frontier and gives my truck a nice sleek look as well as protects my hood from rocks.
B00JSCK650|2|Light appears great, functions well, and highly visible from far distances. HOWEVER.. only 5 months after purchase the magnets detached from the light base and ripped the rubber protector/ suction cup off the bottom of the light.  I will be contacting Amazon for replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE*****<br /><br />Amazon has replaced the original unit with no problems at all, replacement unit looks to have a superior magnetic base from the original, We will see how this light holds up after the upcoming winter weather!
B002E51W06|5|Factory replacement part for my cruze at a great price
B00PXT45OU|5|Nice multimedia monitor for my car
B003TQ82NO|4|Good quality, but you need a circular punch to cut it. If you try to cut it with a razor or knife, you'll probably ruin it.
B006Z907TY|5|good
B000EDOTCS|5|Great for outdoors and camping. love it!
B00ECJ447A|5|Fit the 2004 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon perfectly.  Price was almost half of what Jeep dealership wanted.  Great buy!
B00822XK1E|3|Fit OK but faded to brass after 3 months
B00WFHYG38|3|Impossible to tell if it really works without proper testing on a dyno, however wonderful customer service!
B00E9W2PPS|5|Good
B000A8JNF0|2|I had light algae buildup along the lining of my convertible top and i purchased this with the hopes that the cleaner would take care of the ugly green problem. After two washes and an entire bottle of cleaner, the algae was reduced but still remained.I am disappointed with the cleaner product but the protectant seems to be working just fine. Two stars because I hoped for the cleaner to be much more effective.
B00W3TOFIY|4|Had to file/grind the outside of the holes on the transfer case side so i could get the holes to line up to start the bolts
B000SL4AA2|5|Great little compressor to keep in your car. It is a little slow but does the job nicely!
B004U3Z5XU|3|Cheap quality, started to show rust after a years worth of use. Typical Jeep products.
B000CO9QBI|3|Not great quality, but they'll do. They don't quite match the OEM size despite being the proper part for the car, a 2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder. They are a bit too big for the front struts and get caught in the springs a little. They're plastic, not rubber, and are really thin.
B007KPTEO6|4|quite pretty
B000AOMQ80|4|This stuff works. You seem to need a lot of it, which is good for the manufacturer.....<br /><br />It's pretty nasty when the time comes to actually change a tire, though.
B00IS93Q10|5|Awesome. This was a simple install and looks great.
B0007UQ2N2|4|Small but doesn't kink. Exactly what we were looking for. We use this for our small front yard.
B00AL1KK9Y|2|I cannot place the blame on the product -- although I never did figure out a way to fold the tent up properly. I used it one time. My queen size air-bed didn't fit. The entrance/exit was too low. I have bad knees, the ground was rock and gravel, I got stuck inside three times. Then I tripped and fell on my knees  -  see photo.<br /><br />I gave this tent away for free to a young couple with two kids. I bought a six man tent that I could walk into with no bending. This would be a great tent for a young adult or for a couple kids -- not a good choice for a 4x guy.<br /><br />Read all the specs to insure both you and your equipment will fit.
B00L3NYVHQ|5|Great product!
B001UFRUWU|4|there on my truck now love them until i can get air bags
B003BHIAOW|5|My original Stant locking cap had a broken o-ring so I needed a new one.  Happily I found this on Amazon, cheaper than my local automotive stores.  In fact they don't even carry the green cap that says Diesel, they have to order it, and for more money.<br /><br />Arrive just in time for my bi-annual smog check.<br /><br />My old stant cap you use to have to make sure that it was locked with the key once you installed the cap.  This one locks automatically a great feature.  With people stealing fuel all the time it's a simple feature to put you at peace of mind.
B002UC6NFM|5|Perfect
B00L844O1S|5|The fog lights fit perfect and makes my truck look new.
B001AWLTX4|5|This is the product to buy of course it's more money but it is what you want anything else you will be sorry
B007JVQHC8|5|quality
B00WT68IGG|5|OK
B005GHB5U6|5|Got this as a gift for a friend.  Looked way cool.  We got a lot of stares whole riding our motorcycles.
B00C4B1F7U|5|Very sturdy hitch. Easy to mount on vehicle.
B00M10P0WA|1|backseat cover did not fit properly and when sent email to seller with photos of problem, got no response.
B00GTSEMVA|5|Exactly what I wanted!!!
B00MFTD5TW|2|Although these fit a 2015 Yukon, they did not fit a 2015 Escalade. The only way I could make them fit was to drill new holes and force them to fit.
B0062TQ8FY|5|Excellent  product.  Arrived on time.<br />Bravo!!!!
B007580FGE|5|This is a great piece...fit perfectly, and looks really great on my bike! Well worth the money!!!!
B00DVQHT04|5|great product
B00GSAUHB8|3|delete this review
B008YFTB4E|5|Been buying these hid kits for a while now, they are great the only kits I trust good price! I recommend these kits!
B002XUXUTS|5|this is outstanding and the price is nice.
B00NPIUFMM|5|These are an easy plug-in to get a LOT more output from your reverse lights or any other white light (not amber or red, you should use matching bulbs for those).  The extra brightness is hard to describe.
B00JFE96QG|5|Great finish, killer sound and arrived four days before promised.
B004J0YQ70|1|Shipped on time, however, the top of the Chinese radiator came with the top fitting matching the bottom fitting of the trans cooler lines, forcing me to try and addapt to the banjo fitting on the original radiator. Not a quality replacement.
B0068FYB24|5|Great price and sound great.
B004RCOUP8|5|Put the at camper and attached hose. No ore leak!
B000BRJVSY|5|I love these lights!  I always get compliments and asked where I got them.  I did have to back down the wattage on the lights.  We started out just a little too bright for my taste.  Once we replaced with 15 watt bulbs, it was perfect.  Great Product!
B002GOLH50|3|I like the light but I'm disappointed that there was no mounting bracket in the box. For 40 bucks I should have gotten the brackets.
B00QVSHVPM|4|VERY VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT
B00W89J1JC|5|really cold on the rear a/c on astro van 2003 cool in summer
B004R3203Q|5|Excellent Product!  Was not that difficult to install and I installed it by myself!
B004TCYONO|5|Factory replacement part for my cruze at a great price

B00NHQXIXK|5|This motor is awesome .so small and so much torque .PERFECT !
B0029L4YA0|5|Great product, really helped with the extra storage i needed.
B00NJJ0NPG|1|I installed one of the  2 and it instantly started smoking thank goodness I did not reinstall the cover on the light.  What a fire hazard returning item.
B005GVDS8Y|5|Great pads
B00029XEC0|5|AS ADVERTISED AND FAST SHIPPING
B00652G4TS|5|Great product ! Fixed my truck using this. Love the software (app) the repair reports alone makes this product worth the money.
B00UGNBJOW|5|as expected. lets people know i have a baby on board. that is a ninja
B00HD9UK7E|5|oem quality
B00ZDHCFV2|2|poor quality, crispy plastic, cracked in 3 month normal usage.
B009SWFFUQ|4|Nice quality product.
B002EQO4ZU|5|Work fine.
B00E9AR762|1|Is NOT a bolt-on for the 2015 Impala LTZ!!<br />When installed in accordance with the printed instructions provided with the the hitch, weld-nuts was pulled off my brand new car. The holes in the angle bracket that connects the hitch to the suspension attachment point under the middle of the car are located too far from the rear of the car.<br />The unit interfered with the rear end of the mufflers causing a loud rattling sound particularly once the exhaust gets warm.<br />Spent lots of time on remedying the novice/indifference engineering of the CURT Team who obviously never installed this on a 2015 LTZ.<br />No I would not recommend nor purchase another CURT product given all the actually competent companies in this industry.<br />(Was trying to give a local company my business. Obviously a HUGE disappointment)
B002A5672S|5|Just what I needed, thanks
B000CQDRTI|5|I needed to add a fuse and my fuse holder was already loose so this fit perfectly.
B003YCKTIE|5|used as bar rags and kitchen towels, worked well
B00IZ5KZOI|1|Very cheaply made. I would definitely not purchase again.
B00MO1O9MI|4|Great easy to install with good stick too tape

B000CIPHUI|5|Everything good!
B0029L37XU|5|this is strong and secure
B001FK63EQ|5|This is my favorite sticker.
B0014JBYTC|1|pretty poor device for the money, did not use it I built one better
B00H4FDIOO|5|Love it works great.
B003FXNCQS|5|If you need to air down for wheeling, crawling, or mudding, get one of these.  Save a couple bucks because it doesn't say ARB on it, hell I believe the Currie and the ARB are made by the same company.  Accurate, quick, easy to use, great piece of gear.
B00DBEO008|4|Love it works great.
B00CAKILAO|5|Delivered as advertised
B000GVP3L4|5|Item was as described and met my needs.
B0068G0O24|5|Great product
B00HAWKI0I|5|Exactly what it said it was and in pristine condition.
B000GU3R4K|5|Please Vesrah, don't ever discontinue these! By far, my favorite motorcycle brake pad. I've tried Brembo, EBC, Carbone Lorraine, and Ferodo. The Vesrah blows them all away. Great initial bite. Good feedback. Shockingly little brake dust. I haven't tracked these yet, but I get zero fade on the street. The only negative I've noticed about the Vesrah pads compared to most others is their wet performance. Just be aware the first time you go to grab the brake lever when riding in the rain - or even after you've washed your bike! You'll get used to it.
B003ULRAOK|5|great
B009AA6Y1U|4|Overall a really good experience with these. easy to install on an e350. Great price to fix my problem.
B000WLHGJA|5|I bought this for my 2015 Subaru Forester that I street park in DC and I have been happy with the Bumper Bully. It provides a decent amount of protection from bumps, it cleans easy, and looks fine on the back of my car. It is a good value for the price.
B00MOR4CME|3|2007 Chevy Trailblazer - lights are very bright. These replaced a set of HiPro 80w blue lights that were about 4 years old. To fit in my Trailblazer I have to leave the rear rubber covers off for the heatsink/fan. The LED is off to the side and not the center facing forward. This does not seem to be an issue with the beam pattern. It was a very simple plug and play I mounted the module on the back of the light in a recessed area. Passenger side wire does want to get pinched be careful with your wire placement.  I deducted one star due to the fact that my headlights are not sealed and I will have to keep an eye on them for dust and condensation. I have DRLs and they work fine, no flickering, I can switch them off from the dash, I think I might buy another set for the high beams 9005 and for the wife Chrysler van. Update 26 Dec 2015 the lights have began to cut off randomly. Pulled my headlights and check all the wiring, replaced with factory light bulbs and the issue is now gone. I could not find a link on how to contact the seller to address this issue. Please contact me asap.
B000TYQB14|4|Worked and fit as expected
B004I12424|5|It works just like the one that came from the manufacturer. i have a 2005 Chrysler town and country. I only wish it came with some instructions. i had to go on line to learn how to replace it.
B003VF3AE4|5|I didn't receive product but when I contacted seller I received them immediately. They are good quality and exactly as pictured.
B001NZFCRW|4|does it clean all bug on window?? NO!NO!NO!NO!<br />but better than others in same price.
B0033WDDQA|5|great hitch!
B00MJDTCE6|5|very nice package, my car looks like a dark halo now !!! i lke it !!! speed delevery and come clearly clean, no broken . i recommend this product because the parts are very nice and the price is very very attractive .
B00553A5I4|5|Shipped fast... very happy!
B001CEJH0W|5|Nothing much to say other than that it functions great. Only fair warning is regarding the subscription option. I honestly can't believe why you would not have the option to change the month-between re-send length to something longer, as the short options are a joke. Will be buying again but would appreciate the requested options.
B00G620ZVU|5|Very bright, as expected. Just needed them as a fog light. Mounted them on my bull bar. Quick and Easy mount. I with the wires were a little longer, it would have made splicing cables a little easier. Can't complain for the price especially. Great Accessory.
B00GBVHPNW|5|These are awesome and very comfortable!!!!  Very good quality and value for the price.  Highly recommend!!!!
B0035P7KCI|1|The plastic screw holds the middle breaks esily. Waste of money.
B00A8ZF4HQ|3|Does not fit in any 3 vehicles I have tried.
B00OJ8SKHE|5|Works great has a nice flashlight on it (3 flash modes) it can jump start a small car twice. Charges up in 2-3 hours. And excellent customer service. hope this helps.
B001OZS7B4|5|Very high quality, good looking door. We get compliments on them all the time.
B00MF9TT9M|4|I ordered a pair of these for my rock-crawler (off-road truck) and I'm pleased with the result. One light arrived with a broken internal reflector but the seller replaced it immediately and communicated really well.<br />These were supposed to replace the four 50W Blazer brand driving lights I'd been using as headlights; in that regard they do a bang-up job. Each LED light puts out as much illumination as all 4 of the traditional halogen lights combined, but the really noticeable thing is that these lights produce a clean white light. I hadn't ever noticed how yellow and sick looking the halogens were until I flipped on theses ones!  They're not magic and, being flood lights, don't reach any further than the halogens but they do make a lot MORE light covering the same area and it's much easier to see.<br /><br />I've bought a second set to mount on the sides of my crawler, too.  I like these!
B005HMNEZE|5|Very nice, holds up well very little if any bleeding of the color.
B0017W1ZP4|1|Had it for a little over a month and the key housing broke in half.
B004ZF3C9C|4|I purchased the conversion kit with 10k bulbs for my 2003 Dodge Stratus SE 2.7L V6. I recieved the product in the small briefcase as shown in the picture. I opened the briefcase to find the product strewn about inside. It was not packed neatly or organized in any way. Idk if that was due to shipping or failure to pack correctly by someone from the company. Also, there was no indication on the product that I actually recieved the correct bulbs or kit. There was nothing at all that said 10k or hb5 or anything like that at all. So I didn't even know if I recieved what I ordered.<br /><br />The install took around an hour. The first headlight took around 50 minutes and the second one maybe 10. The hardest part was figuring out what to do seeing as the instructions are terrible!! I bought the single beam HB5s which had no wiring diagram in the instructions. The instructions also called for a 25mm drill bit which I ended up not needing at all. There are also multiple typos throughout the instruction booklet which makes it painful to read. The instructions were essentially useless for me and I figured everything out on my own. Once I did that, it was pretty quick and easy.<br /><br />The lights are exactly what I wanted. Nice and bright with a light shade of blue. When driving at night you can really tell they're blue from inside the car. However, if looking directly at them from outside the car they appear mostly white. I doubt I'll have any problems with local Law Enforcement but we'll see.
B0100FL5N0|5|Fits perfectly
B002MAMBDU|5|This was the easiest clay bar I have used.  One bar is more than enough for a few vehicles unless the paint is really bad.  Clay luber is very slick and also lasts a few vehicles since it only needs a very light misting
B007RYMT7O|5|Arrived with all the parts for easy replacement. Very quite.
B00VUUKXWO|1|Worked for 2 minutes then nothing was displayed. Still lights up but no text is shown.
B00DR14U0K|5|I got this for my 1994 miata and it fits great! It was a pain to install, but after it was installed my car looks better than ever, also I was never able to close the convertible top by myself with my old top, and this top allows me to close it with ease. The window is much larger than the stock top as well, which is great.
B00UQUI6IW|3|I had a hard time applying it.  The decal wanted to stay on the wrong side of the paper
B00BCRMAAS|1|These car seats covers are the worst things i've ever bought online. After people sit on it, it looks like there's some whte dust on it.there is no holes on the bench covet.they ask you to cut small holes for the seat belt accessories, when you do, the holes keep getting bigger.this item is no good and i'm thinking about returning it.don't buy it
B00JZ5BZB4|5|love it. nice color . easy application. satisfied
B006K8VI7A|5|Great!
B00M8GF00Y|3|Now all I need is a new car
B00MJV4E5K|5|love this map
B001DRFJSW|5|Perfect fit and stops as would be excepted. Would buy them again.
B006Z94XW6|5|A simple amp meter that does the job with no issues.
B00E0CSN5I|5|Everything worked as it was supposed to, would buy again.
B005G5RFMK|5|like the size, more comfortable then the old smaller one.
B003JH6HPI|5|Expensive but the best
B005CNH558|3|Fits very tight on the sides.  Had to compress the foam on the sides.

B00SSPFOYQ|3|I had to re-engineer this product to make it work on my car. The light bulb socket did not fit my lens housing. My original bulb socket has four connection point to hold it in place while this product had three. One of the tabs was aligned in a different location. I had to cut the wire and re-fit them with new female connections to make it work.
B00AQKRWLY|4|Wanted a cargo mat for a 2013 Surburban LTZ, that would cover the full rear area<br /><br />Have had great custom fitted cargo mats in two prior SUVs, so was not too concerned about which one I should buy. But this cover seemed perfect, since the 3rd row seats could be installed over the cover. I purchased this mat based on the other reviews. <br /><br />When I got the cover, it was fine. Thick, sturdy material, not too slippery, fit the cargo area perfectly, and it laid flat as soon as I took it out of the box. <br /><br />Only problem was installation. When I followed the instructions, my 3rd row seats would not fully open (I was surprised since no other reviews mentioned this.). It seemed that the area marked for cutting did not exactly match the brackets.   I figured I couldn't return the mat after cutting it. So, after a lot of trial and error, it worked fine. But I had to cut much larger areas on the mat. <br /><br />Also, when removing the 3rd row, it may get stuck on the mat, so you have to kinda hold the mat down when pulling the 3rd row out. Not a big issue, if you don't remove the 3rd row frequently, which I don't. <br /><br />Now that it is installed, I'm quite happy with the mat. 
B001KSGJKQ|5|Fixed my non functioning cruise control. Very easy to install.
B00FEUA2BI|5|awesome Amazon seller!A++++++++
B00PAMUACQ|1|The Mustang logo looks nothing like the picture. Going to return it
B011A0UJXQ|1|I suppose you realize your picture is of a FEMALE to FEMALE adapter
B00PN1RT0K|3|Too small for a sportbike tank sticker and not 3d. Otherwise good quality and will find somewhere else to use them.
B001M0XR3Y|5|Excellent
B000LY9IIA|5|great took a few hour put it on my self and love it
B0049CM1NE|4|2012 VW TIGUAN. It worked, however very confusing. On my Tiguan the turn signal and the brake light both come from the same wire. Meaning, one bulb does both blink and brake lights. In 2012 one of the changes along with the body style change is a different taillight cluster. So if your following the step by step video provided by e trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw6rxw1nzxk you will see them identify a separate turn signal and brake wire. Since mine came from one wire I followed the instruction exactly except left the brake wire alone. Tested and everything works appropriately. The only other minor difference I found was that the taillight cluster is removed from the 2 screws just beside the cluster that will be found by prying off a protective plastic cover, as well as releasing a clamp at the apex of the light by a 1/4 counterclockwise  turn of a screwdriver from the inside.<br /><br />The reason for giving the product 4/5 rating is that it does not come with the 12 gauge wire to string up from the fuse panel to the trunk, and the 30 amp inline fuse. Both I got both at lowes for $7.50 25 ft 12 ga wire, and $2.15 for in line 30 amp fuse.
B0057FK08A|5|This fits the Hyundai Azera 2012. Very happy with the purchase and quick delivery.
B0066QUY5S|4|fits and works as expected<br /><br />thank you
B0002SQYUA|5|Very helpful for me to find leaking vacuum hoses.  I'm really glad that it does both vacuum and pressure because sometimes you need both.
B0073ME6US|5|Shipped quickly and lined up properly, no issues.
B008HTBTDS|4|SoSo
B0000AXCSP|4|It works just like they said it would. I unloaded a full yard of rock with no problems. It installed easy. The only question now is longevity. Time will tell.
B002XLHUQG|5|If you have ever had a moment where your RV moved a little bit because you were using cheap chocks, then you know how important a good set of chocks are.  I bought these after owning my  31' camper for 7 years and I wished I had bought them when I bought the camper years ago.  I love these.  They work perfectly and are easy to set up.  once they are locked, nothing is going to move your camper.
B00N2K6M2A|3|Worked for a 02 Toyota Tacoma, however I could not get it to work with any 97-98 Saturn S-series vehicle. So it does work. It pairs, phone recognizes the device with bluetooth.  The torque software indeed works with it.  However if you get this, it may be a hit or miss with which vehicles it actually works with.  It did work with another guy's vehicle at work, so most likely will just keep it and give it away since I cannot use it for the vehicle I intended to use it for.
B000W0OHY8|5|if it keeps me from one brainfart its priceless!!!
B00EZUL6ZY|2|Did not fit my Toyota Highlander 2015 front seats. It was too small and even if I were to trim the foot rest was still in the way and prevented the floor mats from covering evenly.
B001OBKJ6Y|4|quality part, reasonable price.400 miles  no problems. fit my 2005 jeep wrangler tj
B000NNON7U|5|FITS OUR HONDA CB 750 PERFECTLY~WAS A B-DAY GIFT AND HE LOVED IT!!
B000ZB1FHQ|5|Nice design and sturdy. Fit is great.
B004ETRWLS|5|These spouts work quite well.
B004AIYO8C|5|Personally installed these on my 05 Sentra. I am by no means a mechanic and these were not hard to install. Just look up some youtube videos and you should be fine! Great product!
B004BRI8IY|3|The Tweety Bird decal was as cute as it looked online but looks a lot smaller on my car than I had pictured;  It would be better to offer different sizes.
B00K8UPR5K|1|What a pile of junk ! The battery lasted 6 month 3 days !<br /> Internally  failed, completely dead from 1 minute to the next ,<br /> Not weak , but dead, no sign of trouble .<br /> 100s of miles a way from home! This is  a second battery what fail the same way,  FROM BATTERY SHARK!<br />When the first battery  failed after 8 months , the same way,  just dead, i believed this is just my luck!<br />Now with the second i know it is not my luck , but a  Poor quality<br />,This junk made in china!!<br /> The original yuasa battery lasted 10 years and still was able start the bike when the charger stayed on over night !! That is a quality product!!<br />yuasa is only 15 bucks more!<br /> They offer 1 year warranty! With battery shark NO MONEY BACK!<br />Weight is what makes the difference! No lead no weight  no quality . In this kind of application, and type of use, in lead acid batteries only lead what makes a difference ! In this cheep batteries the led is so thin the plate is practically gets eaten a way by the acid in a really short time! Then is no connection from the plate to the terminal and the battery becomes completely dead!  It is just open ! 0 v output ,<br /> This happens when you try to start the bike, ATV, or what ever the battery in .<br /> In the moment you hit the starter  the plate connection just burns, melts a way and the battery is permanently fail!<br /> Do not buy! Quality battery last a long time and slowly fail giving ample sign and time  to the owner telling,  need a replacement, soon.<br />After years of service!<br /> Not 6 month!!<br />Battery shark is just a shark! In the business for a quick fast buck not in any kind of quality, No integrity! .<br />When i ask them what if i buy a new battery and i decide i don't like it can i get a money back?<br /> The answer no!<br /> They only offer a replacement product after when they  decide ,  the battery really faulty, and no wrong doing in your part.<br /> All this  after when you pay 25-30 dollars on shipping !<br />Pay a little more for a quality battery,  look at the weight on a same kind of battery ! more weight is mean a better product and longer lasting.
B00387DX0G|5|fit great, look a glove, best on the market, Thanks
B000CIJ308|4|Shipping broke the top trigger.  Product may be fine once I get it out.
B00CVTWJE8|5|Ah man. Great tag. Looks good. ROLL TIDE!!!!!
B00IBOLM22|5|I've had these in my 2014 Avalon Hybrid for five months with no issues whatsoever.  They clean up easily by either vacuuming or removing and scrubbing-hosing.  They do NOT move or shift around once in place.  The material is rugged yet adds an elegant touch to Toyota's flagship.  I am pleased with my purchase and will buy again when the need arises.  Highly recommend.
B000HUIJQK|5|Perfect fit for 92 miata thermostat gasket
B004159N12|4|I Liked it but the controls were in the wrong place for my trailer
B000CQFWNM|5|Perfect cut-off for that battery drain.  No more jump starts!
B00FKHKQ0W|5|Awesome piece of gear.  Mounts up in about 10 minutes, holds tight, and doesn't interfere with opening the hood.  Pretty much one of the only products that I've been able to mount to my jeep without cutting, drilling, grinding, etc.
B002ZBWKAU|5|I can't tell you how much I love this pump! It's saved me twice this summer. I love that it knows the perfect pressure for each tire and shuts off on its own! I love that it also has a long cord so you can reach all your tires. It makes checking your tires easy, so you'll end up doing it more often.
B00KLT3JVC|5|works great. i use this for my torque app.
B0027ZY0V6|5|Fun
B00663W0VM|5|Made very sturdy! Good quality!
B00063X7KG|5|Came with all the bars this time, works wonders as well.
B0091RCIOO|5|Simply the best tire chains money can buy.  They work great, go on easy, and never come off from being loose.
B001O28622|1|Hooked it up to my points distributor in my 66 chevelle.  It lasted 2 years and I'm lucky if I put 2,000 miles on my car during that time. Have had goodluck with their 6a boxes though.
B000GS4PN4|4|would have given this 5 stars but the plastic is thinner than stock or other after market windscreens..  It looks great on the motorcycle especially if you have a top case.  Functions well and did not buffet any air.  this is slightly taller than the stock screen by maybe 4 inches I didn't have it to compare so that's just a guess.
B006GJPSKG|4|As advertised.  Have not had a chance to install them yet.
B00AQ97GG6|5|lowers just the right amount awesome coil must buy
B00W31VMYC|1|Has not showed up on my iPhone as yet in Bluetooth. Tried on Chevy HHR/2011, BMW 740IL/1998. A couple of different softwares from the Apple Store but doesn't matter if it isn't showing up on Bluetooth.
B0015PPWUM|5|Good
B00KH704NO|3|Bolts hang down lower than OEM can be seen.
B00R6PZDMM|5|Great shipper great product
B00FKSPORG|5|I got this bag for my Husband, he is a tow truck driver, he puts his rain gear in it( we needed a big bag to fit boots and all) he can put this on the back of his bed and everything stays nice and dry inside the bag, I would recommend this bag.
B00HJ1592C|2|Love the product but not sure if the quality should be this poor.  This is the second one that I have bought and the black part of the heel does not stay on. After a couple of months the black part began to chip so I attempted to glue it back on and that did not work.  Should this product only last about 4 months before it begins to come apart like this or is there some type of maintenance necessary ?
B000HYL20G|5|Dynamite little magnetic tray to keep small parts from getting away. Good for all small parts, but obviously best for ferromagnetic metals. I bought it to use when working on guns, but found it useful for any job that uses small parts. Being magnetic the tray also holds well to the appropriate substrate.
B0000AY65X|5|Amazing!!
B00008RW9V|5|Works like a champ...
B00KTIQDZY|5|My wife loves this replacement remote, pink instead of usual black, can see it easily in her bag.  She had used this for about a year now.  Cost only a fraction of what the dealer was charging.
B0007TR47G|4|I read many of the reviews here about using this on cars so I wanted to give it a shot.  I have a jet black corvette convertible (C-5).  I would give this wax 5 stars but for the difficultly of removing the wax by hand.  It is liquid and goes on quick and easy.  I put it on my cool car (84 degrees but high humidity) in the garage.  I waited about 15 minutes then tried to remove the dried wax with a cotton terry cloth towel.  It left horrible swirls and discoloration on the car.  It actually freaked me out.  I moved the car into the sun for 10 minutes then went out with a clean microfiber and just rubbed and rubbed....  The end result was fantastic.  The car is as slippery as ice and has a deep shine.  However, if you are going to use this wax you should probably have an electric buffer.
B00JA80PEO|5|I bought three of these not knowing what to expect. I read the reviews and figured, why not? I love them! I can talk to my friends with no problems! Super loud at 70+mph, great range with minimal static interference, and super easy to use! The Velcro and clip feels solid even at freeway speeds. I'm going to buy a few more for gifts. The shipping was fast and reliable, and it doesn't look bulky, and out of place on any of the helmets!. 5 stars easy!
B00I25Z8MA|5|Real Nice
B007JMTSTQ|4|good fit as described
B000JZZU9C|3|Like others have stated, they are very squeaky. I put anti-squeal on all the proper places when I first installed and they squeaked. I disassembled and repeated the process with a different lubricant, same results. Stopping power is good, but they are very noisy.
B00DDXGY06|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B003L31RHI|5|I switched to this filter on my 3rd oil change from using the Mobil1 Extended performance filter. I've always used RP oil but it never stated that this filter fit my car until recently. After switching to this filter, it feels like my engine is running way smoother and its a brand new car. I don't know if its just a coincidence but Royal Purple is known to make the best oil so this must be a great filter. It feels like my car is more rev happy and pulls harder. Maybe this filter is a more better oil flowing design than the Mobile1.
B001B6Z10Q|5|I saw some reviewers reported excess noise w/ this model.  But, in my 2004 Honda Pilot, it sounds just like the original.  Works just like the original too.  Couldn't be happier.<br /><br />I replaced the blower  (which had been noisy for some time) after it finally stopped working all together.  But the new motor wouldn't work either until I also replaced the blower motor resistor.  Apparently, it's not that uncommon that both need replacing...so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Both the blower and the resistor together cost about $100 and were fairly simple to install.  The hardest part was working in the cramped area underneath the glove box.  Anyway, everything is working great now and I did it for $500 less than the dealer would charge me.
B001FAIA9M|4|Other than the fact that they aren't waterproof, they're pretty good.  Look good, easy to put on, lots of storage, and feel fairly sturdy, no complaints here.
B007SYGRBW|5|fit nice and easy to complete my instalation
B001EP0I5M|5|We love this adapter! Pinned right into place as promised. Is WAY heavy built! Pulled a heavy 3 horse steel slant load trailer home with it no problems. If only everything ordered over the Internet could be this satisfying. (Box WAS torn to shreds when it arrived, however, as another posted)

B0030G4VBA|5|Once you've used a compressor-based fridge/feeezer like this you'll never go back to a thermoelectric unit.<br /><br />Takes about 9 hours to freeze 70°F water in four 1qt bottles. The specs mention a turbo function but the instructions do not so I cannot access it. There is also an ominous red selector on the power panel marked &#34;Emergency Override&#34; but it isn't covered in the manual either.<br /><br />The fitted removable metal basket with a divider is a nice touch.
B00332GOI4|1|Do not buy these for a Jeep Cherokee.  When installed they put too much strain on the window operating components.<br />Even after the &#34;break-in&#34; the window would not close and there was wind noise on the highway.  Pulled them out but one<br />broke during the process so no return possible.  Go with the stick-on shades.
B0000AY3SR|5|I purchased a 3M Headlight Restoration kit because it was on sale, then I ordered the Meguiar's headlight protectant and Meguiar's PlastX.<br />I apply Meguiar's Headlight Protectant every oil change, but unfortunately it gets a light haze before that so I apply some PlastX and it completely makes it look like new again. It also works for non-restored headlights if they aren't badly oxidized.<br />Many times my friends ask me to do their headlights and they're only hazed I'll use this and 5 minutes later their headlights look brand new!
B00FRHOGU6|5|I vanquish you, rain.
B0022Y1RAE|4|Works great but adhesive backing a little iffy.
B007DBVS8C|5|Worked as good as the original when they were new.
B00OWK4E3I|5|very happy with product, exactly as described, and fast delivery
B0000AX5X5|4|Love it works great.
B000XQ9MGE|5|A must have for everyone in their car
B002R04JLC|5|Worked
B00Z89I2OY|5|Roll Bar Grab Handle (Pack of 2) - #1 in Jeep Wrangler Accessories with 5-year FREE Replacement Warranty  FOR REVIEW<br /><br />perfect fit! it took me about 5 minutes to complete this installation and that was being picky. you just slip it around the bar and strap it tight and bingo it is done about that fast and that easy. the grab handles blend in very nice and look like they should be there. you cant beat the warranty not many things will have a warranty like this product, I think it is safe to say this company believes in its products. this is a all around no-brainier safe purchase.
B000JFHNG0|5|Nice gauge set!  Fits on R134 nipples very easily.  Very pleased with this purchase, and you can't beat the price!
B00BLQ2NJI|5|I replaced it in about 5 minutes, looks great and works great! Thanks!
B00WF94DB6|4|Wish I had the room to set it up on my bike.
B00XET55FO|5|Good product, fast shipping, very pleased!
B00U7CSALC|5|Plenty of room for me. Fits easily back in the bag after use. Built in bag positioned to hold your stuff within reach when you are laying in hammock. Would be nice if bag had carabeener.
B008QY0M7S|5|Look great on my SUV. Here is a link below to my YouTube review. I had a co-worker install them for 100 dollars, he said it was very easy to install.<br /><br /> https://youtu.be/o_j4pD1feO4
B00AC6Y8U0|5|I have a 1992 bmw K75S and this tank bag fits very well.  The construction seems to be pretty durable, and it is easy to install.  Really like the clear top that allows me to put my GPS in there, but the only problem is that it overheats so I need to leave the bag open a bit while i ride to ventilate.<br />Has a lot of space in it, and don't even notice the bag underneath me, which i was worried about since it looks so tall in the pictures.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied, and I will give a follow-up review once I come back from my cross country trip!
B00WM36XNG|5|I got this product to review.  My partner is a very messy person in her car so I thought to give this a try and we love it. It holds alot of trash,  holds wet clothes when we go to the lake.  It's water proof and it's perty big.  Has extra pockets.  Honestly if u have a car and you have kids this is great.
B000CO76PG|5|Perfect in every way. Local parts store couldn't (wouldn't) order this, even though they carry Dorman products.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Nice Lights I took the advice from other reviewers and got some marine silicone and sealed everything to prevent fogging.....I am a bowhunter and I need an extra light on the road to my stand these are perfect for my 2008 Dodge Dakota
B00D2DS50Y|4|They fit a 98 honda civic ex coupe. I just mounted them...took about 30 minutes for both sides. Spray PB blaster or some other rust breaker/lubricant, before taking old parts off. Makes it easier. Helped my car's alignment as far as pulling to the left immediately...without getting an alignment. Make sure to measure your old non adjustables to the new ones and if your car is pulling because of on wheel pushed out..pull it in by making that side longer to push top of wheel out...worked for me.
B000KL5DOW|5|Love it works great.
B000CLVS0S|3|The picture shows 2 sets and there was only one in the box.
B00F9G8ACK|5|We purchased both the 3 ft. and 10 ft. ramps and the 3 ft. ramp worked very well.  The 10 ft. ramp was adequate for what we intended but not quite as sturdy as I would have liked.
B0051SUMJA|2|Two stars because while it's beautiful and well built, I could not get it to work on our jeep. Not sure if it's manufacturing tolerances or what, but they would not adjust loose enough to allow locking the hood without pulling the hood all the way down to where it was metal on metal at the front edges. Returned. 2014 Wrangler Unlimited.
B00ASMX23W|5|Arrived quickly and was installed in quad... working fine
B000CFVMSC|5|better then the plastic radiator I had before.
B009KAAFDI|3|Not as comfy
B00FH7VNFW|2|Metal is very think and cheesy.  Dont waste your money.
B00MDAJJ34|5|This is a high quality  decal it arrived faster than was estimated the only issue i have with this is that a portion of the decal stuck to the backing and removed some of the paper so that it wouldnt be able to be stuck to the window however the portion that stuck was less than a half inch and was able to be cut and it doesn't change the look of the decal at all
B00D9C2CDO|5|purchase this for my sister for a long road trip.  they loved it.  her husband isn't very good at building things so I was a bit concerned when he was going to have to do this by himself.  he watched the video and everything worked out great.  they used it last week after packing up 4 adults and 2 teenagers, they ran out of space for luggage.  they didn't test it for waterproofness, but from the construction it looks like it would do the job.
B00KY41OLG|4|Does the job.  But the reflective side gets very hot
B0072UGXSY|5|Installed this in my 2011 Sienna without a problem, used the CURT 51515 Harness for ease of installation.  Instructions were easy to read and the kit had almost everything I need.  It would have been nice to have a fuse thrown in there but certainly not a deal breaker.  The unit looks good, is easy to install, adjust and read.  Calibration was quick and easy following the instructions and I immediately noticed the difference in braking.  very happy with this controller.
B000ONZT5E|5|Worked fine for my dirtbike filter project.
B00EKEGRVS|2|not tight after a few uses
B00KYWB2YW|5|Five star for what it is.
B00A3FMFNC|5|VERY high quality bags, comes with all hardware, even the rubber mounts. missing the actual lock, but completely usable as-is until you get a set of locks elsewhere. and the reflector indent is left empty, so you can easily install a custom piece and not have the ugly red reflector. thats a huge plus, as removing those is sort of a pain. one less step.<br /><br />came pre-assembled, and the paint was very nice as well. If you have a gloss black bike you could go straight from the box to the bike and it would look amazing. I had mine painted so I had to tear them apart. easy to paint because they ship very smooth. just had to wet sand and primer over, was almost too easy.<br /><br />full sized harley bags and mount perfectly to stock saddlebag brackets. couldn't have asked for better for the money! and they shipped next day for me, was not expecting that at all.
B00KTJ207S|3|One of the two clickers didn't work, but I can't entirely rule out the possibility that I damaged it when super-gluing a key-shank back in. The feel and materials are 85% - plenty good enough but noticeably non-OEM. They are missing the Ford logo (as should be expected). Since one does work they get three stars.<br /><br />It's not the keymaker's fault, but a 2012 Taurus (and presumably newer Fords using the same key) can only be programmed by Ford. I even tried a fancy $1,000 Autel computer/programmer to no avail.
B001GMTKOS|5|The new clips were shipped quickly and were a direct replacement for the ones we broke.  I think the originals had rivets and these were screws, but there was no issue installing them.
B006N94ELS|5|No issues with purchase or install. Worked as expected.
B000CISPSY|5|i have a 6L lq4 t56 combo in my rx7 with this clutch i really like it. it chatters loudly but its normal and does go away after awhile pedal feel is light and grsbs really hard 4th gear rubber all day. igood purchase
B00GJMXTD8|5|great grease this is better than normal grease i use it on my pwc trailer and ive been putting it on my atvs now it visible last longer in and out of water than other stuff i have used its all i am buying now
B001Q4VILY|4|Very solid product, but didn't work for my application. I have a 2012 Massimo 400 UTV and this didn't fit the stinger coming off the back for the 2&#34; receiver. The metal on this is actually to thick for it to go over the stinger, which isn't a bad thing because that means that this is a solid product. I will find another use for it.
B005Z82LNG|4|I bought this to put on my Honda rancher.. not only does it give my rancher a shape look but also ads extra storage to carry things along with me. the only thing I found to be wrong is the back bar at the seat is very un computable but I took the back bar out and added cushions and it fixed the problem.. so with that being said I gave it a 4 star but if it wasn't for that back bar making it hard on the back it would have gotten a 5 star form me. but it is a easy fix by removing it and adding cushions as I stated earlier.
B00JU65OP6|2|I just found it clunky, my head kept hitting the plastic clip when it was folded up. Not crazy about the color. I wil stick to sun glasses, ( I just need to remember to keep them with me!)
B000LQN0CI|5|Product was well made and fit was perfect.<br />I had no problem lining up with holes in fender, unlike other bars for sale.<br />Wires were no problem and lights bolted up fine.<br />The look of a short taillight bar does make my Harley FLSTC look even more gorgeous.
B002P8B70C|5|If you can use a Socket, Ratchet, and a Flat Head screw driver you are good to go. Fit perfectly. Used existing painted insert instead of one that came with it and fit nice and snug. Pried the tweet speaker and the top of the door panel out just enough to get the ratchet in and I was buttoned back up in about 10 minutes from start to finish. Put on 2007 Ford Fusion.
B00F3T01MU|5|A design needed to realize expected life cycle of synthetic oils, highly recommended for regular oil changes.
B00SLHL22E|5|Good price and quick shipping.<br /><br />No-brainer must-have mod for your CB500X
B001TQMZWU|5|What a great chair!  I wanted a couple of rockers on my front porch that were light weight and foldable.  These are it!  They are comfortable and clean up easily, too.
B00JEGXVL6|3|Ok, So I've made lots off purchases for my 07 titan and all I've been extremely happy with. . This one however it does work... radio stations crystal clear i think it didn't add anything to the sex appeal. Think I'd perfer my $40 back honestly. If it was chrome then I'd be much more enthusiastic.
B006EGAIII|5|Ramps work well. A neat feature is that they have a little area in the very front that applys downward pressure as you drive the car on. From using other ramps without it, I think this is helpful.
B00CMOI8UG|5|Installed on my granddaughter's bike.<br />She was extatic.
B00BQAL016|3|Nice shine for 2 weeks. Started to dull already,  I have used better wax/Polish
B0002SRCMO|5|Helped getting the bumper off the Civic to replace the light units
B004EKB5HY|5|Sure fast shipping great quality I highly recommend!!
B00XKYEK4A|1|It doesn't stick properly to the tank. I have bought 4 of them and all of them r the same. It comes off after u place it on the tank. The glue is bad I think. Low quality. Don't waste your money on it. Pay a little more and get something that sticks and stays on the tank. See the pics.
B00VB8BIP6|5|Just like it's pictured.  Unlike some of the other reviews, mine came with black hardware.  Shipping was a bit slow, but that's to be expected coming from China.  Had I noticed that when I ordered I would have bought from an American vendor, but worth the wait.<br /><br />Metal emblem, and hardware.  Everything looks just like the pictures.  I put a dab of LockTite on the fasteners when I installed it, and I've had no issues.  The black hardware is undetectable behind the grille.  Good product.
B00RW7X1QE|5|Best wipers I've ever had, fast shipping, got them within 3 days I'm impressed!
B00TWH78HA|5|My Other Ride Is An FZ8 Decal, arrived in a few days in perfect condition. Ordered this to show Pride in my Yamaha. Ordered Gloss black.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Great shade; opens, installs, and folds easily.
B000WJCDB8|4|pretty decent decals for the money.  Some even look good on my 2001 KLR250.
