B000002AQQ|3.0|Perhaps the most symbolic &quot;Gump&quot; song of the movie is missing from this compilation. When Forrest is heartbroken by Jenny leaving and he goes running - who cannot pump their fist in the air with the joy of the human spirit and the freedom for that spirit that America provides when Forrest runs past scenes of our beautiful countryside to the Jackson Browne classic &quot;Running on Empty.&quot; When you hear the great music and the lyrics:  &quot;Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive<br />Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive&quot; you want to run with Gump - but you won't run to the soundtrack because its not on here!
B000002KNY|5.0|This is my favorite Talking Heads album. The quirky lyrics hint at paranoia and fear of everyday things like &quot;Paper&quot; and &quot;Air&quot;. Some of the background music really enhances the flavor of the music like in &quot;Electric Guitar&quot;. The funky rhythm in &quot;Animals&quot; has made that track a personal favorite of mine. If you are a Talking Heads fan, this is a must. If you're just into music, this is still definitely worth a try.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic. The ultimate movie. Winner of a lot of Academy Awards and who knows what else. I'm one of those people who thinks that the movie, the cast, and the crew got deserved all that it got. <br /> Everyone knows the plot, so I'm going to skip that. The acting is astounding. All of the performances are worthy, and are given with heart. Kate Winslet could not have, in any way, played her character any better. She was astounding, and so is her beauty. Leonardo DiCaprio was also good, but some of his dialogue seemed dull. But that didn't slow down any of the movie, nor did it really damage his performance. Billy Zane did well as the over-possessive poor excuse for a man. You really hated this man from the first shot of him in the movie. Gloria Stuart was awesome, and gave a little bit of humor to the movie. The rest of the supporting cast were wonderful, and I can't go without mentioning Kathy Bates. Her character, Molly, was the most lovable woman ever to grace the big screen, but that's just my opinion on that. <br /> Since I really don't know much about the directing elements of a film, I can't really comment on it, but I do know that scenes were well organized and the moods were set just right. The characters were introduced very approachingly, and never really focused on one character while the introductions were occurring. We were set up perfectly to know who we were going to be watching. When the sinking began, the movie took a faster pace, and did it well. All the while, focusing on Rose and Jack's love for each other.<br /> Titanic has gone down as classic, and certainly does live up to that standard.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is one of the best live concert albums you can get.  What a great show, I wish I was alive to see it.  Duane Allman traverses from delicate and beautiful to slippery and energized blues guitar.  Greg Allman's voice shines on Whippin' Post, one of the best blues songs ever recorded.  The Allman Bros. will hopefully be remembered as one of the greatest blues ensembles to ever play together and they only get better when they're on stage.  This album captures some of that lively magic.  Live at the Fillmore will provide you with hours of listening pleasure.<br />The only drawback to this particular CD is that there is another CD of the same concert that comes on a double disk and provides a ton of info, stories and pictures of the band in the sleeve insert (it's about 1/4 inch thick).  I haven't been able to find it used but my friend has it so I know it exists...However, the sound on this CD is a better so it's a give and take.  It's not worth the wait though...buy this CD, take a shot of Sour Mash, sip on a tall boy and strike up a conversation with an old friend...the Allmans be keepin it real!
B000002I2G|1.0|There are only two tracks on this cd that I like: &quot;Wild Child&quot; and &quot;Wishful, Sinful.&quot; The rest is, as one reviewer put it, schizophrenic. Judging from the cover, even The Doors themselves seem to be shying away from this album.
0679819401|5.0|I love these two stories and it is terrific that the reader can get a hold of both of them with one book.  If you are in search of an escape from reality, and a book that will stretch the limits of your imagination, then this book is it.  I loved Charlie and the Chocholate Factory and Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator both for being off the wall, really weird and hillarious all at the same time. I do not reccomend this book for readers who demand that everything makes sense in the things they read.  Such readers will not enjoy this book, because much of it doesn't make sense, (Though that is why makes for a pleasant departure from the normal and the ordinary).
B000007S5B|5.0|These guys just kept getting better and better. The first track, \\"Hello, I Love You\\" gets the album going with a Kinks-sounding song. \\"Love Street\\" is a sweet-sounding tune with Ray Manzarek's keyboard playing. Next comes the killer: \\"Not To Touch The Earth,\\" an eerie-sounding song where at the end Morrison exclaims, \\"I am the Lizard King/I can do anything.\\" Why sure you could, Jim! Anything except stop drinking. <br />The next two tracks are atypical Doors music, yet they are very beautiful songs: \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" and my favorite, \\"Wintertime Love.\\" \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" is an excellent song about war - perhaps a tribute to the Viet Nam soldiers. \\"Spanish Caravan\\" proves yet again that Robbie Krieger is an extremely talented guitar player. A beautiful song. \\"My Wild Love\\" has Morrison delving into his Native American soul. Morrison sings while the rest of the bandmembers are chanting away- and that's the song. No music, but very, very captivating. Next is an upbeat tune \\"We Could Be So Good Together,\\" from which Patricia Butler took the lines \\"Angles dance and angels die\\" and entitled her book about Morrison's relationship with  Pamela Courson. \\"Yes, The River Knows\\" is a slow melodramatic song with Manzarek's beautiful piano playing. I hear it's one of his favorite Doors' songs. Last, is the precursor to heavy metal music called \\"Five To One\\" where Morrison is practically screaming and not singing - he almost sounds as if he was drunk when recording this one. <br />All together, the songs, the music, and the lyrics prove that The Doors were one of the greatest bands of the 60's - if not all time. Although I'll never know why the title track is not included on this album but rather on their later release \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" this is great listening and I highly recommend it. Get it and enjoy!
B00005B4GU|2.0|OK Computer is one of the best albums ever.  What happened?  This is no longer a rock and roll band, they've become an experiment in inovative electronic sounds, whiny vocals and a smattering of boring guitar work.  Over time, see how many times you actually listen to this disc.
0783240236|5.0|After Dial M for Murder, Rear Window and To Catch a Thief - Hitch was sold on Grace Kelly and her image. Indeed he tried to recapture the ice cold blonde with Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint and Janet Leigh. However; the most successful of them and probably the best(with Kelly) was a newcomer, Tippi Hedren. Now - the DVD offers a LOT of special features including Tippi`s screentest and a &quot;making of&quot; showing us Miss Hedren 2day. The film has not dated at all and still is among my favorite Hitchcock films. Story, star performances and good production values makes this a treat - repeatedly.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This classic LP (which I recently aquired on vinyl in mint condition!) not only made the movie soundtrack a viable commercial enterprise, but it raised the bar for creativity in popular music. Using grandiose orchestral backings, horns and a FUNKY rhythm section, the late great Curtis Mayfield created a masterpiece of modern black music that teaches but never preaches, cautions but never panders, and scolds but leaves the choices up to the listener. Everything about this album works, from the music and arrangements (tell me you don't want to cry when you hear the moaning strings that close &quot;Little Child Runnin' Wild&quot;) to the detailed and cutting lyrics ( the brilliant &quot;Pusherman&quot; comes to mind).  You all know the hits &quot;Freddie's Dead&quot; (will this song ever sound less than cool?), &quot;Superfly&quot; (what guy can't resist 'gettin' his gangster lean on' when this comes on the radio!) and &quot;Gimme Your Love(Love Song)&quot;, THE love ballad of the 70's. The sustained strings and jazzy feel of &quot;Eddie You Should Know Better&quot; is perfect background, chill-out music, and &quot;Junkies Chase&quot; is one of the best instrumental pieces Mayfield ever composed, it's so evocative, you can actually picture the chase scene from the movie while it's playing. This man was a genius.  &quot;Superly&quot; is that rare 70's concept album that doesn't sound embarrassing or dated and taken on it's own, without the film it plays as a great cautionary tale to people living the drug/hustler lifestyle. Not a wasted note or word. Essential Listening.  P.S. Curtis Mayfield, you are sorely missed. R.I.P.
0784011206|5.0|I seen first blood when it can to theatres 20 years ago (when I was 8). I forgot how great this film is. I got this film in the DVD Rambo Box Set and I was blown away by it. <br />I ecpected it to be mindless action (which I like). But it has layers to it. It has emotion and you really feel for John Rambo. The action is great and the back-story is heart-wrenching. <br />Do yourself a favor and get it.
B000002UAX|5.0|Spanning 30 songs and overflowing with creativity, &quot;The Beatles&quot; is like listening to the history of pop music up to 1968. While signs of fragmentation were beginning to show through, the fab four were still capable of making incredible music. Contrary to what the other reviewers have written, nothing here should have been left out. George's &quot;Piggies&quot; is one of my favorite tunes with it's great baroque string arrangement and inspired singing, while &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; features some great, stinging guitar work and cool percussive sounds. &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; is John at his most lyrically oblique, and the arrangement is quite clever (notice the rise and fall of the guitars on each verse along with the gradually increasing volume of the drums and Paul's sliding, funky bassline. Special Musical Note: Don't you just love Paul's little mini-song that follows at the end of this track? ('can you take me back where I came from, can you take me baaaacckk?'),  could this be the birth of the album &quot;interlude&quot;? While there are far too many songs here to write a completely detailed review within 1,000 words, listing favorites is a game my friends love to play. My theory is, don't try to limit this sprawling collection to any handful of tracks, everything here is classic, this is afterall, The Beatles! Just sit back and soak it all up. The eclecticism displayed here is simply stunning. Was there nothing these guys couldn't do? This is such a generous outpouring of Beatles compostions that the final mixing sessions at Abbey Road Studios took an unprecedented 24 hours to complete. &quot;The White Album&quot; is THE standard by which all double albums should be judged.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Although young I had always heard about the Chili Peppers and knew they were well regarded.So when i purchased this album i didnt know what to expect,but i realised what i was confronted with was almost an hours worth of pure genius.Each ong is tweaked to perfection,but still maintains that Chili Peppers unique edge.There is nt one song i dont admire and adore,the opening song,&quot;around the world&quot; is a ruff great starter to the album grabbing your attention,followed by a beautifully crafted 2parallel universe.My favourite track on the abum,and probablt ever is the much exposed 2californication&quot; every time the song starts it makes my heart flutter.The gentle tracks on the album suprise compare to old peppers stile but the amaze me every time i hear them.Fleas undoubtably amazing bass playing often hovers in the background but never loses your attention as each pluck of a string is literally beautiful.This album made me by 3 other chilli peppers albums,they are almost in stark contrast but still amazing.That is why The Chilli Peppers are in my mind the best to ever grace this earth! Frusciante spakles,Flea electrifies and Keidis simly stuns with one of the most heartfelt voices ever.Dont even wonder about buying this album,you cannot possibly dislike i,even if you go into determined to hate it!!
B00003CXSP|5.0|This picture is one of the best I've seen in my many years of reading and viewing scary movies. Ms Moore gave an outstanding performance and set the tone for the movie from the start. Mr Hopkins? What can I say but as usual, flawless !! I haven't been startled by any movie for a long time but this one made me jump about four times and squirm quite a bit.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the first Tool cd I have, and I have to go out to the store later on and buy the other ones.  I was never really a fan of Tool except for a few songs that I didn't know they were even from Tool until a friend told me that they were a Tool song.  The song that got me addicted to this cd was &quot;Schism&quot; and now I can't start this cd without listning to all the songs.  the best songs on this cd is:  &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;The Patient&quot;, &quot;Schism&quot;, &quot;Parabol&quot;, &quot;Parabola&quot;, and &quot;Lateralus&quot;.  If you do not already own this cd, get your lazy butts away from your computer screens and go buy this cd.  If you already have this cd, more power to you, go buy it for a friend that doesn't have it.  I hope that their next cd has this much power behind it and the songs flow smoothly into each other like this cd.  Until next time.
B000051VWW|4.0|What a beautiful comeback for Sade!'Lovers Rock'is an album full of inspiration,elegance,and the very deep and hot undertow characteristic of her earlier work;it is very hard indeed to name a favorite song,since the album flows and mesmerizes from the beginning to the end.Higher music...
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I am thoroughly embarrassed to say as a 37 year old, bitter, crabby, uninspired divorcee, I have seen this movie 7 times!  From start to finish, I was stunned!  Have NEVER liked Nicole Kidman in anything before, now have a new respect for her.  Who knew she could sing? Fell completely in love with Ewan McGregor. My children are so tired of the CD, they actually ASK to go visit their dad when I turn it on (ok, just kidding there).  The frantic pace of the movie turns a few people off in the beginning, but stick through the first 1/2 hour and find yourself mesmerized.  I saw it on opening day, and the theater was full. I was near the back and noticed for the last 45 minutes, not one person in the theater moved a muscle.  All 500 of us collectively gasped and cheered without provocation.  I heard open sobbing, and people clapped when scenes and songs were done.  I am visiting Paris in the fall, (without my children) and both are upset that I will get to see the actual Moulin Rouge.  Utterly Fantastic! Now I just need to know how to scrape the money together for a big screen HDTV, as I know that when the DVD is released, I will need one!
B00003CXSP|3.0|A decent follow-up to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; the adaptation from Richard Harris' novel just shows too much to be truly terrifying, at least in the psychological sense.  <br />First, it is important to note what a great job both Moore and Hopkins do in this picture.  Their performances keep a movie with a mediocre script truly entertaining.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman (though you wouldn't know it from his appearance).  Hopkins alone puts in a performance that makes this movie worth seeing.<br />My biggest gripe against this movie is the unnecessary gore that is displayed with too much frequency.  For me, the most terrifying part of &quot;Silence&quot; was learning how the man occupying the cell next to Lector died.  We didn't see it, we just heard about, leaving our imagination to create the imagery for us.  In &quot;Hannibal,&quot; there's just no room for imagination.<br />Like I said, the movie is completely character driven, which works because there is a great cast.  For those of you who were disappointed in the ending of the novel (I know I was), the movie provides a different (and in my opinion, more appropriate) ending.  <br />In the end, I think your enjoyment of this film will be based on the expectations you have going into it.  I think this movie is extremely successful as a thriller or horror film, but it doesn't have the developed psychological component of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; or &quot;Manhunter&quot; (the first in the Hannibal Lector series).
B00001U0GQ|2.0|Great picture quality and sound, terrible editing.  They edited out the intensity the original film in theaters and VHS gave to the plot.  The battle scenes that were added made the film boring.  The soundtrack that was edited away took away from the intensity of the love between Nathaniel and Cora.  I went searching for the VHS version and bought that version.  Fortunately, I didn't get rid of my video player when DVD technology came out.  I definately would NOT recommend the DVD unless they release a version of the original film that was released to theaters or at least a DVD version that is identical to the VHS.
B000009QPG|5.0|If any parents are reading, please continue.  I'm 28 and I still rock to Slayer.  They were my favorite band growing up and still rank right up there.  I will promote them by saying that I used their lyrics in a poetry report I had to submit to a college prep english class.... way back... <br />I don't do &quot;said&quot; poetry, so I looked to my album collection that had lyrics inside the cover.  I finally chose Slayer's &quot;Expendable Youth&quot; as the poetry I would write a review about and read aloud in class.  You can read all kinds of stuff into the lyrics on every song of this album, especially &quot;Expendable Youth&quot;.  I actually read the lyrics aloud in class and got an &quot;A&quot; on my report.  This is a great album (although not meant for the concert hall) which shows the true musical talent of Slayer. All of the songs on this album are about life, trials, tribulations, and a little bit of death.  Slayer became my favorite band of all time after they released this album
0486282112|5.0|If you want to read Frankenstein as a classic horror story, you are missing Everything! Outwardly, especially due to the bastardization of the enigmatic and prophetic novel by cinema and mass media, people look at Frankenstein as a novel about a monster. End of story.  But Shelley meant so very much more. Frankenstein is a desperate, angry, pleading outcry against industrialization and the destruction of humanity by moderization and advancement. The creature was Shelley's way of saying &quot;where are we going?&quot; &quot;what have we done to man when science takes precedence over forthought?&quot; This is also a new persceptive of man as the creation of God and banishment of Adam. Instead, in Shelley's world, man has grabbed at the reigns and assummed the role as creator and, as God, is horrified at his creation. Frankenstein acts without thought, then hastily casts off his creation as an abomination. And, the creature, like man's pursuit of divinty, ravenously pursues his creator. Shelley asks if this is the relationship of man and God. Have we been rejected? Cast aside as a hideous mistake? Are we relentlessly pursuing a creator that sees us as an abomination? If you want to peer into Shelley's philosophical soul, read Frankenstein. Write in the margins. Puzzle over the questions. Ask yourself where you stand after you see the vision of Shelley. Of course, if you want a monster on a rampage, rent the movie. The black and white versions the best.
0767819462|3.0|STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, and hilarious movie. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, &quot;Anna! You DO NOT run out on your mother!&quot; I was moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, &quot;Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me.&quot; I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts.
0671027573|4.0|Because I read in pretty much all of my spare time, I have had great difficulty finding authors that are worth reading. I bought this book when I was having trouble finding a book the piqued my interest at that point. I was going through the bestseller shelf saying to myself &quot;read that, will never read that, read that&quot; and so on when the cover, of all things, caught my eye. When my gaze traveled I realized that I had never read this author and before I even read the synopsis I was in the checkout line. When I finished the book the next morning I was pleasantly surprised. The humor of the novel was certainly not expected but welcomed. The four women had great in depth characters with differse personalities.   The plot of the story was not one I had read before, which is always a relief when someone has read as many books as I have. Even though the villian was easy to recognize, it was made believable and the psychology of it all was interesting. I was intrigued and it made me laugh. There are no better reasons to like a book than that.
B00001OH1S|2.0|When I saw &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair,&quot; what I liked best about it was the music. Not the songs, but the music. So I kept an eye open for this CD. Finally, I found it, bought it, put it in my CD player, skipped the songs, and was shocked to see that all the terrific music I remember from the film was drained. And when there was good music, it was shortened down to about 50 seconds.<br />Only tracks 5, 6, and 2 save this from being a total waste of money.
0060977493|2.0|There are certain books that you wish would never end.  For me, this was one of them....<br />Because the ending of this book made me wish that I hadn't wasted my time.  I won't give away the ending, but sufficeth to say, I have not been so disappointed in the summation of a beautiful novel in a long time.<br />I was hooked from the first page of Roy's work.  Her prose is glorious.  Her characters are beautiful and tragic, even those hideous to the core shine under Roy's pen.  The subtle yet persistent (and sometimes not so subtle) observations of a destructive culture were dead-on.  Even slight problems that I had with the rhythm and motion of the prose and plot drifted away as I read.<br />Then the ending came and blew it all away.  I have no qualms over what happened; I've read far more &quot;disturbing&quot; things in novels.  What I did mind was the utter unbelievable nature of the final few pages.  Out of nowhere.  Blindsided, like a bad surprise ending where you find out the entire story has been a lie.  Completely contrary to the characters, their motivations as presented by the author, and the environment that they had been portrayed in.  It couldn't even be described as an &quot;escape&quot; or even &quot;desperate&quot; action.  It just looked like another book had been pasted on to the end of this one. <br />In short, I've never seen a novel so beautiful be so completely undone by a mere few paragraphs.  Sure, read it, but then drop it before you finish.  Don't let a few bad pages spoil you to Roy's gift.  Hopefully, her next work won't fall victim to the same problem.  I'm hopeful but extremely wary.
6303282237|4.0|- Write, or in this case film, the myth. Those reviewers who complain about the general historical inaccuracy of this movie are quite correct but they have forgotten Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar is not only history but myth, like Robin Hood or King Arthur or Roland. 'El Cid' is a good cinematic version of the *legend* of the Cid if not of the actual eleventh century history it is based on. The tale of Rodrigo's marriage to Jimena after killing her father is straight from the late medieval romances, as is the portrayal of Alfonso as a weak and unworthy king. Watch 'El Cid' as you would 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' not as a history but as a medieval fantasy.

630469654X|4.0|The score of this movie makes it seem like a late Saturday morning show instead of a serious movie, but get over it.  The M. Broderick character is too darling.  There is some good stuff in here.  Not a bad movie for the price.
B00003CXV4|2.0|you might just find yourself watching this.  It was neither good nor bad.  It's one of those movies that you won't feel you missed anything if you don't see it.  Charlize Theron is an extremely talented actress, but I'd rather see her in interesting roles like in The Devil's Advocate.  Keanu Reeves is still just another pretty face.  This movie is not especially original (see: Love Story and Autumn in New York) nor exceptionally well acted, although Chaz (downstairs neighbor) and the kid whose name escapes me are great characters.  The plane landed before I could see the end, and I dozed off somewhere in the middle, but I really don't think I missed anything.  If you're looking for a tear jerker, rent Legends of the Fall or Last of the Mohicans.  The stories are much more interesting and at least Brad Pitt and Daniel Day Lewis are pretty boys with acting talent.
0553573403|5.0|From page one I could NOT put this down. Classified as fantasy this reads like a Medieval history novel as much as fantasy but that is a great thing here. Romance, political intrigue, action and humor do a wonderful dance here. The world and characters are 100% believable and engaging. They feel like neighbors that become good friends that stay in your mind and heart. Do you like Medieval Fantasy? Than pick this up and take the journey into the Seven Kingdoms. Enjoy.
0792845668|5.0|If you liked the first you'll love this one!
0553579908|5.0|Welcome back the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Here the action, humor, romance, and suspense of A GAME OF THRONES  all return in spades and build expertly, like gathering storm clouds. New characters are met and old ones explored more deeply. They all make you want to get to know them better, as they are compellingly written, fleshed out and brought to life vividly. Sometimes you wish you could leap into Westeros yourself and rescue your &quot;friends&quot; from danger and grab the &quot;enemies&quot; by the throat. But both friendly and enemy characters are easily understandable as to why they act the way they do and tha makes them &quot;real&quot; and sympathetic even if you do not like them all. (ie: Cersei, Joffrey) All in all a great read. Prepare to continue dancing to a great tune...Dance, to the Song Of Ice And Fire.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD rocks! If you are a alternative rock fan, then you can't pass by this CD. It's different, and is one of the CD's that changed me from a rock and roll fan to an Alt. Rock fan. Here is a review list of all the tracks:<br /> Papercut-This song is awsome! I didn't know about it when I got the CD, but now it's my favorite track. Good lyrics about paranoyia, so don't listen to it if your paranoid, it could give you ideas. 5/5<br /> One Step Closer-Another great song, definetely my 2nd favorite song. The lyrics are probably some of the best in the CD, they blend perfectly. Great music too! 5/5<br /> With you-This songs ok, but not anything to make a big deal out of, I usually skip it. More of a rock/rap song. Not to good. 2/5<br /> Points of Authority-A bit better then the last song, not quite as much as a filler, but still not that good. Some good guitar parts. 3/5<br /> Crawling-This song is really good, but doesn't sound like One Step Closer and Papercut, giving the CD a bit more variety. If you don't know this song by name, you've probably heard it, it's extreamly popular. The chorus has great guitar sounds and there are a lot of other cool sounds that add to the songs perfection. 5/5<br /> Runaway-This song is another good one, I think that it doesn't get enough credit, it's not even on the radio. If you get the CD, listen to this track. It blew me away, i was like, \\"Whoa, I've never even heard of it and it's better than most of the other songs!\\" 5/5<br /> By Myself-Lots of heavy, techy, loud music. Pointless rapping and screaming. It's got a good beat, but just doesn't cross the line. 1.5/5<br /> In The End-This song started playing on the radio, and my friend told me about it. It's kind of a rap song, but has a really good beat, melody and singing. The chorus has Linkin Parks \\"Papercut\\" guitar, but the rest is pretty mellow. The lyrics make sence, and you can tell that they put a lot of effort into this one! 5/5<br /> A place for my Head-The beginning of this song sounds like it's part of the last one. Another Rappish song, but you you have to give credit to the good distortion guitar. 3/5<br /> Forgotten-This song isn't much. The rap is stupid. The chorus (FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM!)is ok, but it's not very good. 2/5<br /> A Cure for the Itch-This is all DJ tech stuff, but it's good and it's funny. He make his voice all strange, and when I first heard it, I laguhed out loud. It is good music, and the DJ (Mr. Hon) has a talent. Nice sturdy beat. 4/5<br /> Pushing Me Away-Mellow, but not slow. I don't usually listen to it, but it is a good song. Once again good lyrics, music and beat. ....<br />I would strongly recommend this CD to Alt. Rock Fans, light rap fans, or somebody switching over from one style of music to Alt or rap. This CD really is worth the money!
B000059PQQ|5.0|Ewa Aulin stars as the blonde beauty Candy. Her wide-eyed innocence serves her well throughout a series of encounters with a bemused group of movie stars. Among the cast, Walter Matthau particularly shines as an ultra-patriotic general who wants nothing more than a peek at her luscious body, but is soon demanding that she bear him a child! John Astin steals the movie in the dual role of Candy's square, college professor father and her randy, pot-smoking uncle. How Mr. Astin failed to get an Oscar nomination is beyond me. Ringo Starr is totally unconvincing as a Mexican gardener, but his performance adds to the overall absurdity of the film. This Candy is very much an acquired taste!
B00005MAM2|4.0|When I first saw this movie, back in the 80's, I loved it.  Now that a lot of time has gone by and I'm older, I watched it again.  And I still love it.<br />To re-arrange one person's very admirable review: &quot;It takes a very open mind to enjoy this movie.  Akira draws fanatics too bloodthirsty to appreciate its message, and scares away critics intelligent enough to understand it.  All in all, be careful with this movie; it's not for everyone.  Just ignore the hype on BOTH sides (pro and con) and judge for yourself.&quot;<br />While this film condenses a long pre-existing manga (comic book) storyline, the movie's plot may seem &quot;chunked together&quot; at times.  The film is filled with gritty violence to appease the blood-and-guts fans while they have &quot;some morality shoved down their throats&quot;.<br />The new DVD picture quality is &quot;heads and shoulders&quot; above that of the original VHS/LD/VCD version.  The film negative has been digitally cleaned up to remove scratches and dirt.  The colors are so vivid and rich in this version.  The picture actually looks BETTER than it would have when the film was brand new (in a theater in 1988).<br />This version's picture may be the most vivid, rich and colorful animation work I have ever seen.  This DVD version looks and sounds the way every version of Akira should.<br />I would highly recommend this version to any and all Akira fans.  I would highly recommend this title to anime or science  fiction fans, but simply recommend it to everyone else.<br />The animation equals or exceeds Disney's current BEST.  And this film came out in 1988!
B00003CX97|5.0|As war films go, this is the best. Thematically, it balances the bureaucracy and the reality of the military, showing the absurdity of it all. I remember when it first came out. &quot;The Colonel Bogey&quot; theme was EVERYWHERE. Everybody was whistling it. But, ironically, I don't think it made it's point to a lot of viewers. The musical theme became an anthem for the militaristic. They may have seen the film, but they didn't see the film.  In my top 10. Must see on a clear day.

What can I do to become wealthy???<br />These are the sort of questions answered in this awesome book by Robert Kiyosaki. This book is especially for those whom have no idea about money and how it works. Its depth as far as ocean deep. <br />It's easily read and eloquent. Read it now Period.
B000002UDB|4.0|I gave this album 4 stars because of 2 flaws- Blue Jay Way and Flying. Those are the most stupid songs I've ever heard. I'm a very extended Beatles fan and collector. In all the records and CDs I have, there is nothing more stupid than those two songs. Every thing else is excelent-------superb!<br />   I suggest you bye this for all the other songs, Magical Mystery Tour, Fool on the Hill, Your Mother Should Know, I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Baby Your a Rich Man ,and All you need is love.

I knew their 1st full length CD, SCIENCE, was out .... ....I listened to it [Incubus] and was I amazed. From the first track, Redefine, till the last, Calgone, the music is great. It's a blend of funk and metal. It's awesome. The best tracks are Redefine, Summer Romance(Anti-Gravity Love Song), Glass, and A Certain Shade of Green. If you like Make Yourself or have any musical taste then you will love this.

0380973650|3.0|I'm trying to like Neil Gaiman. I really am.<br />I appreciate clever, creative, inventive, passionate imaginations as much as the next guy. I understand how he revolutionized comic books with his Sandman series. I read Smoke and Mirrors, Stardust, Neverwhere and his kids' book about trading his dad for two goldfish (or whatever it was).<br />Each of the aforementioned books had moments of brilliance in them. Real, genuine creativity coursing through their veins.<br />However, as a whole, I've thought each of his books to be fatally flawed because of some plot, character or narrative defect that caused me to stumble and scratch my head. That doesn't happen when I read Bradbury or Leiber or Tolkien or Lewis or virtually any other of my favorite authors. But it happens with Gaiman. It's almost like he's trying too hard to be The Most Creative Writer On The Planet at the present time. I don't know.<br />I eagerly awaited American Gods and snatched it up the week it came out. I read it from cover to cover in about a week, taking it everywhere I went.<br />Sure enough, creativity and solid storytelling abounded. A few parts were gripping and awe-inspiring. Yet, a few parts left me wondering what the hell was going on, why he needed to add that particular part, why he worded it this or that way, etc. In other words, I found myself studying his narrative style more than enjoying a good read. I can do that with other authors (Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr mystery series, for example) and not trip up. But I can't do that with Neil Gaiman. When he trips me up, I tend to stay that way for the rest of the book.<br />The creative idea that made American Gods is a surprising, almost profound one. But I don't think it was developed as powerfully as it could have been. The theme and focus seemed to shift from the idea of the gods battling it out, to the main character (Shadow) to subplots and characters that seemed almost too weird to even remotely pass for &quot;real.&quot;<br />Please don't get me wrong. I think Neil Gaiman is very creative and talented. But I also think he's unfairly staggering under a load of critical praise and pressure that may cause him to think more highly of himself than he ought to...or cause his editors to not question flights of fancy that don't seem to go anywhere, or exist only for their own stake.<br />I certainly hope he continues to write books and share them with the world. Although I think American Gods was good, I don't think it's as good as the book he'll likely write five or ten years from now. Given Mr. Gaiman's staggering imagination and talent, THAT'S the book I'm waiting to read!r />Please don't get me wrong. I think Neil Gaiman is very creative and talented.

B00005BL2A|5.0|OK, this album is fantastic and I'm fed up of reading critics and old fans criticising it so I decided to voice my opinion. It is not immediate, not commercial but it's good music. Like many I discovered Depeche Mode with Violator and became a fan, working through their back catalog. Exciter is a return to the Violator production with lots of synths, analogue bass sounds and drum machines, plus slide pedal steel guitars and normal guitars. Apart from I Feel Loved, a classic, it is less dancefloor oriented than Violator (although most songs have a tempo of 100bpm and above), but it maintains the high production standard with possibly Dave Gahan's best vocal performance yet. The songs are diverse. Comatose, Breathe (great lyrics) and Goodnight Lovers are a return to simple heartfelt tracks and weird synth loops akin to the non-single tracks of Some Great Reward and Black Celebration. Dream On, the dissapointing first single, is a very good song close to Personal Jesus in concept, but not punchy enough for a first single. Dead Of Night is a far cousin of Barrel Of A Gun, When The Body Speaks is a U2-ish track. Highlights are Shine (just great), Sweetest Condition (one of those weird tracks that grows on you) and I Am You. Freelove also is a great ballad (Anton Corbijn's favourite). Anyway, it's a great album, mellow and groovy but still very DM. Strayed Devotees, give it a go. For the novices to the DM world: you won't be disappointed. It's not lyrically as brilliant as Songs Of Faith And Devotion but it's still brilliant.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said about this film? Nothing, probably, but I'll give it a whirl...<br />Moulin Rouge really is like nothing you've seen before. I won't dare just call it a movie. It's a piece of art, it's live theater, a fantasy, a complete celebration of pop culture, but most importantly, a moving love story.<br />Moulin Rouge tells the story of a young, penniless poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor) who comes to Paris to write about &quot;truth, beauty, freedom, and above all things, love&quot;, when he is befriended by a group of Bohemians who are dreaming up a musical called &quot;Spectaular, Spectaular&quot;. Their only problem is getting the money to produce the show, and a good writer. The latter is fixed when they find Christian has a great talent for writing some of the greatest songs written (&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;) So the Bohemians drag Christian off to the Moulin Rouge where he meets and falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman) who is the biggest star (and most highly paid prostitute) at the French can-can club. Christian and Satine fall in love, but it's not without problems. In order for &quot;Spectaular, Spectaular&quot; to recieve funding, Satine is sold, along with the Moulin Rouge, to an evil, rich Duke. And thus, the plot is set.<br />The telling of the story is what makes this film so special. It's all about the music. The plot is old as time and loosely based on myth but have you ever seen this story played out with songs by Nat King Cole, Madonna, David Bowie, The Police and Elton John all at one sitting? I didn't think so. The songs are edited in such a way that they do what all musicals aspire to do: to heighten the story in a seamless, emotional way without the &quot;oh God, they aren't breaking out into song again, are they?&quot; cringe factor. I have seen many musicals in live and film form and I have to say this is the first where I didn't feel that feeling coming on. The only feeling I felt was one of amazement that Luhrmann made everything work so well: the can-can girls calling out &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; lyrics while the male patrons answer with Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, Satine's sparkling entrance which is Marilyn (&quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot;) meets Madonna (&quot;Material Girl&quot;), Christian's declaration of love in the stars (Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;), the amazingly seamless &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; sung by Christian and Satine contains pieces of 10 pop songs, the over-the-top version of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; which features dancing waiters and the breathtakingly intense tango version of the Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;.<br />So far I've seen it 5 times, and I hope it won't be the last. I dearly hope the Oscars will take note of this film - the acting (which is the most important thing in films) is top notch. Nicole Kidman plays all her cards right and stuns the audience up until the last curtain call,but Ewan McGregor is the real star of the show. I don't think I've ever seen an actor put so much real visable emotion into a role.  <br />Lush and colorful sets, stunning period costumes and a cast full of beautiful and talented extras, Moulin Rouge MUST be heard and seen. Go....NOW!
0671015206|4.0|According to Stanley and Danko, American millionaires do not fit Hollywood's stereotype of Mr. and Mrs. Conspicuous Consumption living &quot;the good life&quot; in smoking jackets and slippers whilst noshing on caviar and watercress sandwiches: &quot;Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?&quot;<br />To the contrary, today's wealthy (defined by net worth, not high income) may be your plumber, dry cleaner and even your child's school teacher as easily as your doctor, lawyer or accountant.<br />How do such mundane occupations buy their owners admission to the millionaire's club? The authors list seven good reasons, the first of which is that today's millionaires &quot;live well below their means,&quot; saving an average 15% of their gross income, year after year, and investing it with wisdom and care.<br />Frugality is not the only quality required by those who would be rich. But, it is a great start! When you pick up this book, head straight for the other six attributes of rich folks in the Introduction. You may be surprised.<br />At times tedious, I suggest you quickly scan those paragraphs of The Millionaire Next Door that delve into more statistical data than you care to know about your wealthy neighbors in order to find the authors' conclusions on each point. They are gems worth highlighting and referring to again and again.
B00003CXSM|1.0|This is just a plain bad movie.  The plot does not make any sense and the movie is badly mis-casted.  (Jennifer Lopez playing Italian with a TexMex accent???)  The director did manage to include some pretty nice scenes though though.  So my suggestion is to play the movie, turn off the sound, and play your favorite CDs.  You won't miss much.
B00004C4KZ|4.0|It's nice to hear these almost ancient experimental efforts again after so many years. When it comes to sheer effect, it hasn't lost any of it's impact. Tangerine Dream made it's finest albums in the early seventies, and this is certainly one of their best; but it's also disturbing and a little freaky at times. When it comes to drifting away (with or without foreign substances in your system) I would recommend 'Phaedra' or 'Rubycon', both made in the same era.
0345350499|5.0|I first read The Mists of Avalon 1989 and it facinated me.  The women of Avalon weren't the evil witches they were portrayed as in Camalot etc. they seemed to me like todays herbal healers that were also, in varying degrees &quot;sensitive&quot;.  Of course the men of the Christian church wanted no oposition at all and what they didn't or couldn't understand they labeled as witches.  <br />How sad it was for Morgaine to be tricked into sleeping with her brother Arthur at his king making.  Already she had to deal with Christian society and the fact that she looked like her &quot;fairy&quot; heritage but then to have to face her brother and others with incest.  An act that her aunt orchistrated and she was lead to like a sheep to the slaughter.  Her love for Lancelot that would never be fulfilled.  I found my heart aching for her.<br />I also read Lady of Avalon and while good it didn't captivate me the same way that The Mists did.  I have since read many books about Morgaine, Arthur and Merlin and suspect I will continue to read the different books written about them.
6303471501|5.0|The deterioration of society is the basis of the first Mad Max film. A dark vision of the near future, the film's low budget works in its favour: it feels real, props look suitably well-worn and there are no unbelievable settings or overblown special effects. The world the film is set in, with industrial decay, vast empty motorways and gangs of low-life bikers terrorising the remaining decent people left, is a deeply disturbing proposition. Mel Gibson, who looks remarkably young (he was 22) plays the title role - police officer Max Rockatansky of the Main Force Patrol, a specialised unit whose task is to rid the roads of the biker gangs who have brought anarchy to the cultural wasteland that they roam. Gibson's character has a wife and young son. They, like his colleague and friend, MFP Officer Jim Goose, are eventually hunted down and brutally murdered by the psychotic gang leader Toecutter, who holds Max responsible for the death of a gang member. The film moves towards its inevitable conclusion - Max is without all that was important in his life, so takes to the road once more in vigilante mode. This is a very unsettling film, devoid of Hollywood sensationalism. Two sequels followed, but the original movie, for me, has the greatest impact: a stark and gritty nightmare in a barbaric world that seems all too close to home.
0767802659|3.0|This was a bad movie. Had it not been for the title, I wouldn't have had a clue this was even based off the book. The plot and tone bear little resemblance. The plot-related sins are forgivable; however, the atmosphere is the fault of the actors. They can't act. Period. I could forgive the excessive violence and fascination with computer graphics (the bugs grew very boring after reptitive appearances) as a &quot;guy&quot; thing, but I cannot forgive the actors for turning a so-so movie into a dismal, superficial farce of the ideas the director was trying to convey. The periodic emergence of those themes in brief, biting satirical propaganda paradies were the movie's one saving grace, and the only way I was able to sit through the thing. I'd say watch it just for those; they were an absolute hoot.
B00000J2KT|5.0|great movie. Most people indicate that the first half is the true movie and the 2nd part falters. True boot camp is the better part of the movie but the realization is that nothing prepares you for the chaos that later ensues. I own this movie now and watch it over again without tiring. excellent acting by thedrill sargeant and mathew modine, vincent donofrio
0385501560|5.0|I go to high school, and in English class they make us read boring novels about fake people who would have died hundreds of years ago, as if relating their stories to everyday life will help us at all once we leave the God forsaken classroom.  And they call these &quot;classics.&quot;<br />But it's stories like Chuck Palahniuk's CHOKE that can truly be interpreted and applied to today's culture.  Depressing, humorous, and deep in philosophy.  While I found Survivor to be more memorable than Choke, Choke is still leaps and bounds ahead of any other non-Palahniuk novel I've ever read.<br />Choke is more of a story than a bible, but it has a very fullfilling ending that leaves you in a pensive mood.  Get this book if you've enjoyed other Palahniuk works, but if you're trying this author out for the first time, go with Fight Club or Survivor.<br />And remember, Don't Read Ahead!
B000059PR5|2.0|I really don't know what would make any person ever want to buy such a disturbing movie as this.  The damn movie isn't exactly your saturday family night blockbuster!  Of course all of this can really happen I really don't think we need to sit and watch people die of radiation poisoning from the nuclear bomb and see people suffer. Even though the people are acting the all star cast in this movie does a good job acting the whole nightmare out.  Thats what makes this movie so chilling you put yourself in those peoples shoes and see how you would act to it.  The movie is quite depressing especially near the end and leaves a long lasting depression on you after you watch it.  Let me just say this its not one of those movies where you'll watch it and forget about it for the rest of the day you'll keep thinking about it after you watch it because of the chilling disturbing effects it has.  Well acted, but It will scare kids and many grownups.  I really though don't see any point of having this movie in your video collection.  It may send a message but a negative one and life is too short to watch movies like this and think about the negatives in life. Not a positive movie at all and I think a comedy movie would be more suitable.
0792842073|2.0|The movie is well directed and acted and is very emotional. But with movies like this, it all comes down to the message, i.e. death penalty pro vs. con. While not overly didactic, it is definitely against the death penalty. I am also against the death penalty and I wanted to like the film but the film's arguments have a major flaw.<br />In the first half, director (and consummate lefty) Tim Robbins touches on most of the major facts that you may or may not know about the death penalty. He presents the inherent and unavoidable imperfections in the justice system like the uneven quality of defense lawyers and resources, the influence of politics (elections, race quotas), etc. But in the second half, he leaves most of that behind in favor of emotional arguments. From the stand point of character and plot development, this may be understandable but it weakens the arguments. As the murderer approaches his date with destiny, he undergoes a transformation from despicable and remorseless criminal to finding love (and religion), taking responsibility, expressing regret and penance towards his victims and their families, etc. (with the help of a saintly nun) and Robbins is also careful to reveal his pitiable origins and circumstances (fate is cruel). I think Robbins' point is that even the most heartless killers have humanity and therefore it is not right to execute them (sob! don't kill Sean Penn, he said that he was sorry!).<br />But here is the major paradox. Penn's character becomes human and sympathetic but only in the face of his imminent execution. In other words, to follow the religious themes in the movie, THE DEATH PENALTY WAS HIS VEHICLE OF REDEMPTION. I came away with the weird feeling that the death penalty had worked out well and saved an otherwise worthless human being.<br />This is not the feeling we should be presenting. Stick to the legal and logical arguments that undermine the idea of the death penalty as proper justice. Poncelet's (Penn's character) equally wretched and guilty accomplice avoided the death penalty solely because his family could afford a better defense attorney.  The film brings this up but it is not a central plot. But that is what stuck with me the most. That is an injustice and proof of the reason that the criminal justice system should not have the right to kill. Make a film about that if you want to make people really think.
0780627024|5.0|Wow. This is a really good movie. Like everyone else, I have a billion reasons for saying so. Let's just go straight down the list. It's well thought out. The plot is pretty consistent and doesn't leave much out (except why David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are there in the first place). My favorite characters were David and Jeff Daniels's character, Mr. Johnson. I liked the courtroom scene (very affecting) and the fire in the tree.The movie reminds me a bit eerily of Lois Lowry's The Giver (was anyone waiting for me to mention that?). But only in a few ways: most notably, the color. All in all, I thought this movie was cool. It's turned into one of my favorite movies, as Tobey Maguire turned into one of my favorite actors. Rent it now if you never have. It's a true must-see.
B000003H34|1.0|I love Anathema...... but not this album. There are maybe 2 stand-out tracks that are mediocre at best.  the rest of  &quot;the silent enigma&quot; is well.... very bad.  Death Growls are laughable played against any kind of metal.... but Anathema tops death/vox comedy here.  While the mood on this album is probably the darkest of all Anathema albums..... it is still a horrible release.  There are fine reasons why albums like &quot;the silent enigma&quot; were not released in the United States until years after its' european release and why it received absolutely no press coverage.  I'm happy that they buried the hatchet on the &quot;doom/death&quot; sound and opted for a more refined goth/prog rock sound with &quot;eternity&quot;, &quot;alternative 4&quot;, and &quot;judgement&quot;.  If you want an Anathema album.... buy anything released after &quot;the silent enigma&quot;...... total garbage
052594527X|5.0|What an exquisite novel!  Deceptively simple in the telling, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is told from the perspective of a serving girl in the house of Vermeer, who becomes both model and muse.  Chevalier captures the very quality of a Vermeer painting in her writing, and vividly brings the Delft of the artist's time to life in this breathtaking first novel.  A lovely, lyrical tale of love and art.  Don't miss it!
B00000IJPU|5.0|Truthfully the title of this CD sums things up... 'Best of the Beast'. This CD is a 16 song compliation of Iron Maiden's 16 top singles from their albums prior to their 2000 released CD. On the trip on this CD, you start off with the aptly placed Number of the Beast, and from there the CD only gets stronger...to the live version of Fear of the Dark, to their major mainstream hit Run To The Hills, to 2 Minutes to Midnight, to The Trooper, and finishing with Hallowed Be Thy Name. <br />   Every song on this cd ROCKS, heavily. If you've been on the fence as to whether or not Iron Maiden is for you, get this CD...afterall, once you get a feel for the sound with this compilation, you'll want to get their other CD's to check how those songs sound. And best of all, you get to see the various covers with our good friend Eddie on them.

6305508550|5.0|Office Space is to 'working' movies what Animal House was to college movies. Peter is your average guy who hates his job, barely enjoys his life, is trapped in a loveless relationship..and in general has no control over his life. After being hypnotised one night, his outlook changes. Peter no longer cares about his job, and goes when he feels like it. He dumps his girlfriend and begins going after a waitress at his favorite haunt (played by Jennifer Aniston). At the same time, his two best friends at his job are about to be fired in a shakedown of the company. Meanwhile Peter is going to be promoted....this is when the hijinks begin. Another great turn in this film is the character of Milton (played by a barely recognizable Stephen Root most known for the boss in NewsRadio). He mumbles constantly, and is put down all the time. Gary Cole plays Peter's boss, and he's about as self absorbed and snobbish as one can be. But rather than tell you the story, you have to see this one yourself.<br />   If you've ever had a job you hated, and wished you could get back at your boss...Watch this movie.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album is an amazing album.  I think people are slightly dissapointed that it isn't as punk as &quot;Live Through This&quot; was, but it showed that Courtney isn't just some loser, punk, groupie, she has real talent.

B000002UJQ|5.0|...and I'm not ashamed to say that this album fits into that category. Though I'm generally hesitant to quote previous reviewers, I feel that &quot;polystyreneman&quot; speaks for me when he says:<br />---- I always say that The Beatles, Radiohead, and Pink Floyd are the three greatest bands of all time. These three bands represent the pinnacle of artistic and musical expression for rock music. ----<br />That about sums it up, though I'd put Jefferson Airplane, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, and the Black Heart Procession in there somewhere Very Close, the point remains the same; this is music you shouldn't be without. I've written over 30 reviews, and this is the 1st album to get a 5-star review; I believe that the 5-star albums should be those that are the absolute magnum opus of a band, the creative apex; Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, the Beatles White Album (or Revolver), the Jefferson Airplane's Crown of Creation, and, of course, Radiohead's OK Computer.<br />OK Computer.<br />I didn't get this album until nearly 2 years after it came out, after a friend informed me that it &quot;rocked&quot;. I generally do NOT like things that &quot;rock&quot;. I generally loathe things that have a &quot;good beat&quot;. I do not generally like songs that I &quot;can dance to.&quot; I like deep, introspective lyrics, wrapped in a shell of creative, moving music, reading poetry on a rainy night. I do not want stuff that rocks. I want stuff that moves me, makes me think, makes me wonder what the artist is feeling when he (or she) originally penned the album. (And just for the record 1) No, I am not fat. 2) Yes, I have a girlfriend. 3) Yes, I do go outside frequently.)<br />Back to OK Computer - a brilliant timepiece, a legacy of the 90's.. I have listened to many, many albums, and, in my 500 CD collection, I will have to say that this one is the best album of the 90's. It beat out Automatic for the People by a narrow margin - it flows. It is a concept album. It is Dark Side of the Moon, it is Sgt. Pepper, it is glory, and hope, and fear. It tells the epic tale of a man who wanders from death to hope to life back to death again, seamlessly... the only &quot;weak&quot; track on ther album is Electioneering, I find..  For me, the best moments: Exit Music for a Film No Surprises<br />Don't die without listening to this album.Dark Side of the Moon, it is Sgt. Pepper, it is glory, and hope, and fear.

B000007T1M|4.0|I guess I should start off by saying that nu-metal isn't really my thing. I know I'm flying in the face of fashion for my preference of power/classic metal and extreme death and black metal over nu-metal and grunge. I don't like rap, I was disappointed when Machine Head sold out, I deteste Fred Durst, I can't stand Korn or the Deftones. But despite my tastes, I put on this CD which somebody had given me as a present years ago (just as it came out and just before nu-metal suddenly exploded) and I started to bang my head. And then I remembered that this is actually a good CD.<br />Well, I wouldn't put it up there with some of my personal favs, but it certainly is a cool album. It has quite an original sound and the vocalist is very versitile. It isn't very technical, something that puts me off nu-metal as a whole. There's only one solo, and even then it sucks. But the overall feel of the album is quite unique. The songs don't just mesh together, but instead all have a unique quality about them.<br />I guess if this were more my thing it might get a full 5, but the lack of technicality drops the mark. This is certainly a good album, but the only problem I have is that because of the scene this band are part of, they're probably never gonna do the sort of thing I like i.e. more technical stuff. But the fact that I of all people listen to this album is a testament to its difference in sound that sets it apart from a genre full of copyists.
0151003084|5.0|I was really only aware of Gorey's work from the opening credits of PBS's MYSTERY series, but after ordering this book as a curiosity for my store..., I fell in love with Gorey's deliciously twisted sense of humor -- our customers did too. Over the past year, we have reordered the book - up to 10 copies deep each time - and it always sells out within 3 days! <br />While never truly grotesque, this ABC picture book of small children succumbing to death by pick axe, well and murderers would by description offend most people. However, the humor is so irreverent and out of left field you'll most likely find yourself giggling, hoping no one will see you. You probably be embarrasssed to admit you like it, but at least you'll be howling when you do.
B000005HN6|4.0|When somebody says melodic death I picture Haunted's lead singer screaming into the mic with a face so red he looks like he's stuck his head into an oven. And when you say black metal, I picture Satyricon sitting in the snow, Frost whacking his drums harder than humanly possible while Satyr wonders where he's gonna plug in his guitar amp when they're in the middle of the forest. For these reasons alone, I could say that this wasn't either. In fact, the only black metal traits that Opeth have are the demonic vocals and the epic nature. In every other respect, they're are in a genre of their own.<br />The first track alone is 15 minutes, all 7 tracks adding up to a massive 65 minutes. But the sound? Well, a bit of black metal yes, but lots of alternative rock, lots of classical acoustic and dripping with atmosphere. They don't use keyboards at all, another thing that makes me feel they are not black metal (and also they are not a very fast band, another black metal trait). The guitars are hard left and right, meaning that true stereo effect can be acheived with headphones. And since the guitars play different things it is a very good effect.<br />Although one person complained about the vocals, I love this guy's voice. Michael Akerfeldt can sing very softly when he chooses, but when he growls it sound truly amazing. He doesn't do the typical Cannibal Corpse grunt. And also, the lyrics are brilliant as well. Kiss the satanist lyrics goodbye. Akerfeldt has done himself proud with these poems by themselves. They are very poetic and graceful.<br />So basically, while this is hard to get into (but worth the effort) and isn't for everyone (which is a shame considering their talent but lets face facts) Opeth are definately a band that everybody should listen to at least once, if not much more. You won't be disappointed.
B00005B6N8|5.0|In my opinion, there can't be enough scary space creature movies!  I love the genre, and Pitch Black will not disappoint you.<br />The action starts right at the beginning, with a truly spectacular crash scene.  There is a convict on board who escapes, survivors stumbling around trying to figure out what to do, the bounty hunter who wants to find the convict, and the pilot with a chip on her shoulder because of a bad decision she made trying to bring the ship in.  Then one of the survivors finds a hole in the ground and the scary space creatures introduce themselves by chomping him.<br />They look for water, they look for the convict, they find more scary space creatures, and then discover that the planet will soon be engulfed in total darkness because of an eclipse and the scary space creatures only come out at night.  They find the convict and team up with him because of his enhanced night vision, but is he really bad and is the bounty hunter really good?<br />Pretty typical?  Yes, but with some very big exceptions.  The casting for this movie was excellent.  Radha Mitchell as the pilot and Vin Diesel as the convict are both talented new actors.  The casting was well done, each character well performed.  The Photography was superb, especially the lighting.  With three suns on the planet (two yellow and one blue) the lighting at times was almost surreal.  The special effects were much better than you would expect, not just the aliens but also the scene where this huge planet is coming up over the horizon, soon to block out the suns and cause the eclipse.  And the aliens?  Scariest space creatures since &quot;Alien&quot;, spooky and deadly.<br />Pitch Black will not win any awards, but for fans of this genre it is a rare plasure to watch.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00003CXP0|5.0|I went to the video store to rent it.  The clerk warned me\\"its good, but its depressing\\".. I thought \\"ive seen Titus, I can handle morbidity....\\"  WRONG!  This movie without a doubt is THE MOST DISTURBING, DISORIENTING, SHOCKING , MIND NUMBING , SOUL DRAINING FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!  After the credits rolled, I just say that there, exhausted, dazed, confused and just watched with glazed eyes as the credits rolled.  I literally had to rouse myself, and plunge myself in another activity to \\"shake off\\" the after effects of watching this film....This movie is the most powerful and intrusive and yet, well crafted film ever put on celluloid, period.<br />Now, as to the review...I dont agree with all these heavy-handed PC reviews about it being anti-drug.  I dont think this film is anti-drug...it draws no conclusions at the end. To me this film while being an emotionally searing film, is in a way, apathetic in its portayals of the major characters..It shows you their lives, and how they lead them, no more. The film is not meant to be a cautionary tale, or blaze the path of salvation for someone else...its just s story...a nightmarish, hellish bedtime story, whose unifying theme happens to be people on drugs.<br />AS for the performances, all the major characters shine..Aranofsky really got the best out of them.  Most notable was Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb; simply put, the woman was ROBBED this year at the Oscars by old horse-mouth herself. As for the rest of the cast..to me, they all put in career-defining performances...my heart was not failed to be broken by ALL the characters in this movie. In fact, that is what the experince of watching this film is like..it breaks your heart over and over and over again, but not in any cheesy or obviously sentimental way..but graphically, brutally and shockingly.., it totally goes for the jugular and will not let go.  At the end of the movie...all the major characters end up huddled in the fetal position...which is exactly what I wanted to do after watching this movie. Great flick...if u dare.....- A.N. Oh, and P.S....if its not the director's cut version, dont bother...u wont get as much from the ending without it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|...It's a remake first of all and secondly they tell you the enitre story during the performance of spectacular spectacular! However, Baz uses this to his advantage by putting layer upon layer upon layer to transform the simplistic plot into a sensory overload. From using the exact same lines within the movie and the play within the play, to the tango paralleling the characters events, Baz uses different forms of expression to convey to the audience the emotionality and significance of what is taking place. I happend to appreciate the camera angles because every time I see this movie I catch something I didn't the first time. For example, every time Satine has a relapse the camera flashes a split second image of her death scene. I enjoy the paradox presented within Satine singing about dreams dying while in the shadow of the symbolic bird cage. I LOVE that the speech impediment inflicted Toulouse is assigned the task of saying the most important line in the entire film to which for ONCE he does not slur his speech!! I also like to recognize the things the audience doesn't think about while watching the film. For, example..the fact that Toulouse was going to be playing the part of Maria in the sound of music?!?!?!  And just the pure concept of a Narcoleptic Argentinian tango dancer!! C'mon? How can you not laugh at that?!?! I think that Richard Roxburgh does an AMAZING job at portraying the duke as a pathetic yet psychologically demeted duke that is both evil and hilarious! Talk about character development!! My conclusion is that those who find they cannot appreciate this film don't really know what they are talking about.  Yes, it is very melodramatic and over-the-top, but that Baz makes it so that EVERYTHING is over-the-top makes it work! The term \\"red curtain\\" means that you are \\"watching a movie\\". It is not suppossed to be real!! So just kick back and enjoy for cryin out loud. You have to understand that this is a musical...it is not going to be anymore reality based than an english babysitter who flies around on an umbrella and dances with penguins. As far as the music goes, I think they did a wonderful job with witty lyrical exchange. I personally would have done anything to be a part of this production. Kudos to everyone involved! I have never seen a movie in which I liked Nicole Kidman's character, but she was surprisingly amusing in this film. I had no idea she could be so funny. Of course, Ewan McGregor is beautiful and maybe I just love the movie so much because I secretly lust after him, but... The point of my boring ramblings is that this movie holds on to the Bohemian in all of us and no matter how hard we fight it, it insists that we leave believing that love above all is the answer. Everyone at some time in their life has dealt with that feeling of heartbreak and tried to flush all romantic ideals from their head. If it wasn't for movies like this, altough the theme may at times be considered naive, people might forget that it's okay to let go of all the world's sorrow and misfortune and dream a little. I used to think that people with their head in clouds were childish and naive. But if there is one thing to be learned from this film, it's that having the courage to hold on to your dreams and believe in love with all your heart is truly a wonderous and beautiful thing; that which people should encourage in each other, rather than scorn.
B000002TYX|5.0|This third/final CD installment of the Beatles anthology is really great.  The studio tracks the Beatles have done is very intricate, and hearing this in different ways (besides what was heard so far), would be a real plus.  If they could take the whole four track reel, uncut, put it on a DVD with a GUI four channel mixer to adjust the four channels throughout the DVD, this would truly be enjoyable for me and many others that would purchase this type of DVD not even heard of yet.  Most of Anthology 2 would be a good candidate as well, with the exception of the live tracks.
B000002JSP|3.0|It had been three years since Led Zeppelin cranked out an album, and fans were getting restless. They were again to be surprised when they took off the brown paper bag on &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot; to find a band that had changed for the times. Instead of trademark Jimmy Page guitar riffs, they found that every song was laden with synths and that John Paul Jones had writing credits on 6 of the 7 songs---this was essentially his masterpiece. The reason this happened was that John Paul Jones and Robert Plant got to the studio before Page and Bonham, and had written a lot of the material before they arrived. Another reason may also have something to do with Page's diminishing abilities due to his struggle with alcohol addiction. <br />The first half is quite silly, while the second half is more of a serious mood. The first half kicks off with &quot;In The Evening&quot;, a great addictive happy piece. It is followed by &quot;Southbound Suarez,&quot; which is a little too goofy and needs a little work. &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; drags on way too much for a song of its overall disposition. The first time you hear &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; you will swear it is a joke. It is the band's foray into Southern Rock that is pretty much a filler piece (note its length compared to the other songs).<br />The second half kicks off with the 10 1/2-minute &quot;Carouselambra&quot;, which fails to be the epic it is supposed to be. Most of the reason this happens is because the song is so heavy with synths that Page can barely be heard and Plant's lyrics are indecipherable unless you have a lyrics sheet handy. The highlight of this album is &quot;All My Love&quot;, the main single off this album. Even it gets a little old with repetition, but some of the synth work in this song is absolutely beautiful even if it is obvious Plant's voice is giving out. The album closes with &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl.&quot; This seems like such a fitting way to end the Zeppelin catalogue. In this song, Plant sings with such desperation that you can't help but think that he knew something was coming when he recorded this blues piece. Whether he did or not, this song ends the album, and, though the band didn't know it at the time, the Led Zeppelin catalogue.<br />Perhaps if Led Zeppelin had known this would be their last real album, they would have gone out with a bit more of a bang. However, this still is much more solid than &quot;Presence&quot; as a whole. Not recommended for someone starting Led Zeppelin unless you are already a huge fan of bands like Pink Floyd, Rush, Yes, etc. A great closing effort.

B000002J1U|3.0|In the early 1970s, ever since Led Zeppelin II, there had been high anticipation for another rumble of thunder Led Zeppelin album. Boy, was everybody in for a shock when they went to purchase Led Zeppelin III on its release date and discovered that rocking you senseless was not all that Led Zeppelin was good at. <br />The album starts out innocently enough, with one of Led Zeppelin's few singles: the 2 1/2-minute straightforward-rock &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot; It is then followed by two more uptempo numbers, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Celebration Day.&quot; However, these two have a different feel to them than earlier Led Zeppelin fast songs and even &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;; it seems Led Zeppelin had spent some time experimenting in the studio. After this, the next two songs are a perfect showcase of Robert Plant in his prime. The 7 1/2-minute (longest on album) &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is a scorching blues number that is reminiscent of Led Zeppelin I. It is followed by straightforward rock yet again with the vastly underrated &quot;Out On The Tiles,&quot; which again shows Plant in an excellent vocal performance.<br />However, flip over the tape or vinyl, or journey to the second half of the disc, and it's a different story. The last five songs on this album are all acoustic. While you may be thinking this lends some monotony to the second half of the album, it doesn't. After all, Jimmy Page learned acoustic before electric. It kicks off with &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;, which is an OK enough traditional. The next two songs, &quot;Tangerine&quot; and the 5 1/2-minute &quot;That's The Way&quot; are the highlights of the second side that showcase some beautiful chemistry between Page and Plant on a pair of ballads. However, when Page and Plant attempt to go uptempo acoustic, as on &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp&quot; and especially the quirky &quot;Hats Off To (Roy) Harper&quot; they fall flat on their faces. This would be one area that Led Zeppelin neverseemed to master during their career, except on some parts of the extraordinary &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot;<br />That being said, those are why I gave the album three stars. They also could have spread the acoustic songs out a bit more, they could have had a neat electric/acoustic exchange going throughout the album. However, if you like acoustic better than electric, this is your Led Zeppelin album to get. For anyone else, it's definitely not a way to start out; the best way to get introduced to the acoustics of Led Zeppelin is on IV, their album after this one. Still a stellar work from a musically talented but enigmatic group.
B00005B7CK|5.0|I found this movie inspiring, humerous and greatly entertaining. Clooney transforms himself into his character incredibly well and provides his audience with a superb performance, as do the other actors.  The movie is rich with symbolic meaning and is moving at times. I recommend it highly.
B000002JSN|5.0|After they got on a roll with their album releases, often, Led Zeppelin albums seemed way too short. It seemed like 45 minutes and 8 songs were way too little time to take care of what they wanted to take care of. So, fans asked for it and they got it: The sprawling 80-plus minute double album &quot;Physical Graffiti.&quot; <br />To accommodate the size of this mammoth project, half of the songs on it were newly written between 1973 and 1975, and the other half were little studio experiments that were added into the mix. Disc 1 is generally regarded as the rocking half, and may very well be one of the best rocking-straight-through discs in history. It starts off with &quot;Custard Pie,&quot; which is a great rocker...however, in this song, fans realize that Led Zeppelin are maturing, as Plant's voice is lower than usual and he even has substituted his usual metaphor for sex, a lemon, with pie. After this comes &quot;The Rover&quot;, which has a very unique feel to it. It is another hard-rocker, and it even has flair! Next up is the only clunker on this disc, the way-too-long 11-minute &quot;In My Time of Dying.&quot; This is the longest song in the catalogue and could have been halved easily. Even as a 5-minute song it wouldn't have been so great. However, things go back to superb again with &quot;Houses of the Holy.&quot; This song just screams &quot;radio, radio&quot; and sure enough it was, after the band disbanded. It is a more pop-rock approach. However, I hate it when bands stick title tracks on the wrong albums! Straight rock-n-roll prevails again with &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot;, the only top 40 hit off this album. Of course, the album closes with the legendary, addictive 8-minute orchestral nugget &quot;Kashmir&quot;. No more need be said, except that Plant and Page both agree that it is their greatest composition of all time (of course, they maybe are just showing modesty about &quot;Stairway&quot;.)<br />On the second disc, Led Zeppelin get more diverse. The 8 3/4-minute &quot;In The Light&quot; has one of the quirkiest intros they've ever done, and it switches back from that influence to heavy metal and back again. It is followed by a short acoustic instrumental, &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot;, which seems lost among all the greatness. Next up in the ballads section is &quot;Down By The Seaside,&quot; my favorite on the disc. It again has lots of flair. Then comes another ballad, the maybe-overlong &quot;Ten Years Gone.&quot; This song is way better live than in the studio, but it is alright as a studio version. The ballads section closes with the very keyboard-heavy &quot;Night Flight&quot;, that is a solid piece. However after that eloquent piece, they come back at you with a bang with &quot;The Wanton Song&quot;, which is the last truly good song on this album. The last three songs on Disc 2 probably could have been thrown out if they weren't trying to fill up a double-disc album. &quot;Boogie With Stu&quot; seems way too silly for their own good, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; is another foray into acoustic blues gone awry, and &quot;Sick Again&quot; just fails to capture me.<br />Overall, a great and more mature showing from Led Zeppelin; however, don't start with this, go with the easier-to-digest Led Zeppelin I or Led Zeppelin IV before digging into this. This is the last album of greatness from Led Zeppelin, as not long after Robert Plant would get into a car accident and never have the same trademark wail again.
6305014140|5.0|Yes, I said it one line ago and I'll say it again: NINJA SCROLL is one of the best animated films (western or not) ever. I rented this on vague recomendations and loved it so much I had to add it to my collection. It is more enjoyable than most of the other anime films I've seen as well.     Usually, my enjoyment of an anime film is somewhat limited since anime flicks tend to be visually appealing but uneven, and alternate pretentous talk involving some sort of shallow atheistic mysticism with outrageous and often inventively gruesome battles between beings of unimaginable power (Usually in a nightmarish futuristic or Post-Apocalyptic Tokyo). Usually, they have disappointingly vague endings, and they are almost always based on a Manga. However, my admiration for the artistry and detail of anime allows me to set aside their typically impenitrable plots and award most of them with a marginal &quot;thumbs up&quot;.   Then I saw NINJA SCROLL, and my opinion of anime changed forever.  Hence, it is quite refreshing to see an anime film that dosen't favor a gloomy BLADE RUNNER/MAD MAX setting, but instead is set in medeval japan, and we can ascertain much about it from it's breif but rich canvas which often suggests a world of warfare, political struggles, intrigue, plagues, and terrifyingly powerful devils who toy both directly and indirectly with the lives of humans and there are more than 2 sides in these conflicts. <br />The hero is Jubei, a lone sword master who is pierless but honorable. He is as skilled as he is tough, not to mention salty and intelligent. However, unlike most other anime protagonists, Jubei has no super powers and is quite mortal, despite his ability to withstand an incredible ammount of punishment. Vulnerability is key for any hero. Jubei reluctantly finds himself blackmailed into working with an old wizard with ulterior motives in the conflict, as well as Kagero, a ninja girl who's body is poisonous (er...I'll just leave this part alone now.) <br/>This isn't a story of Good vs. Evil, either. There is hardly a scene in NINJA SCROLL where everything is as clear as black and white. Even the Devils themselves are given to petty squabbles and machinations and often find ways to dispose of each other. Each enemy is unique and displays some awesome power. One commands wasps from a hive in his back. A cruel humanoid with rock-like skin (Who seems to have read Beowulf as well) hurls a double edged sword like a boomerang. Another fiend hides in the shadows and shoots a mechanical barbed claw. Yet despite how powerful these enemies are, they are not invincible. <br />NINJA SCROLL has an intriguing and complicated plot with well-developed protagonists and villains. The pacing is fast, and unlike other anime, which grab our attention by presenting us with sexuality, NINJA SCROLL does so by using it. And at about the halfway point, an astounding thing happened: I found myself caring about the characters. Even my mom, who hates most anime and anything in a HEAVY METAL vein (and who has the annoying habbit of walking in during the most disturbing scenes of any animated film) detested this film at first but found herself liking it as well. <br />NINJA SCROLL is an absolute must for anyone who is interested in animation, even if you aren't an anime fan.
B000002J0B|4.0|This album came immediately on the heels of an album that still has legendary status: &quot;Led Zeppelin IV.&quot; It, of course, was also right before the sprawling &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;, meaning it is often a forgotten album in the catalogue. This is so much the better for it, for it has a great reward if you remember to get it. This album was released at a point when Led Zeppelin had nothing to prove, so they decided to showcase their eclecticism and branch out on this album.<br />The album kicks off with the overwrought but still pretty good &quot;Song Remains The Same.&quot; The reason I say it's overwrought is because this originally was supposed to be an intro to &quot;The Rain Song,&quot; before they came up with words for it. An overlong 5 1/2-minute intro as bombastic as this would not have done, and it makes you wonder if they were perhaps resting on their laurels. Not a bit. The song that would have been an introduction to, &quot;The Rain Song,&quot; is next and is one of two Zepics on this album. It is a very uplifting song that especially sounds good...when it's raining. The moody-to-happy mode of this song set the stage for the rest of the album. &quot;Over The Hills and Far Away&quot; is by far and away (sorry) the best tune on this album, as it has a great acoustic intro leading to an all-out rocking piece. It is followed by &quot;The Crunge,&quot; which many belittle. I don't see what is so bad about this song, a homage to funk. Sure, Led Zeppelin weren't funk artists, but you've gotta give them points here.<br />The second half of the album kicks off with &quot;Dancing Days&quot;. This is also excellent, though it sounds a little dated because it was perhaps Led Zeppelin's homage to disco, which was just starting out. This is followed by the only song that got any major radioplay from this album, &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; (phenetically Jamaica). This song showcases Led Zeppelin's sense of humor with its childish lyrics set to very reggae-ish sounding music. Next on the agenda is the only dark point on this album, the mysterious &quot;No Quarter.&quot; This is a classic, even though Plant sounds like he dunked his head in a watering can to record the vocals. It sounds vaguely like Pink Floyd. After all this experimentation, Led Zeppelin decided there is no better way to close your album than with a straightforward, all-out rocker, which is what &quot;The Ocean&quot; is, though the riff in this song sounds very borrowed from &quot;Black Dog.&quot;<br />Overall, an excellent album from Led Zeppelin. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that compared to other works by this artist, it doesn't quite measure up. However, it's still highly recommended. This was my introduction to Led Zeppelin, and it wasn't a bad one to lead directly into &quot;Led Zeppelin IV.&quot;
B00004Z459|4.0|A friend complained that Linkin Park, in every song, has  part that sounds like a boy band. Well, personally, he may be right- but the cd is awesome- from &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;One Step Closer&quot; to &quot;By Myself&quot; and &quot;With You&quot; Linkin Park has invaded my cd player for a month- at least.
B000002JSJ|2.0|It would have been very tough to follow up &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; at all. And Led Zeppelin proved this by putting out the worst album of their career. Give them credit; Robert Plant was still recovering from the effects of a car accident and the band couldn't even record in their home country because they left for a year because of taxes. Still, Robert Plant's not-quite-up-to-par voice is no excuse to let the songwriting (except the excellent guitar work) go to pot, and that is exactly what they did here.<br />The album starts off on a fiery note with the 10 1/2-minute Zepic &quot;Achilles Last Stand.&quot; This is my favorite Zep song of all time, and it is very addictive and catchy with a couple of great guitar solos. It earns the album two stars all by itself. I had heard &quot;Achilles&quot; in its entirety before listening to this album, and was very confident based on that song. However, the rest of this album doesn't even come close to measuring up.<br />&quot;For Your Life&quot; is a sappy overdone foray into blues; &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; is good only as a quick filler piece (note the length compared to the other tracks); &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; is decent enough, but too musically inconsistent for its own good; &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; is trash; &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; is a bit of a sleeper that also is listenable; and the 10-minute drawn-out &quot;Tea For One&quot; is a reminder that Led Zeppelin's heyday is over. This sad blues song just drifts away to its soft conclusion, never hitting a Plant trademark wail like on any other Zeppelin blues songs.<br />That being out of the way, I must say the guitar work is excellent on this album; maybe better than any other. However, Jimmy Page cannot carry this band all by his lonesome, which is what shows up in an ugly way here. Overall, not recommended except to the Led Zeppelin completist or diehard fan.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I have seen this movie many times, I know most of the lines and all the parts get better every time.  I rented a horrible HBO Video version of the movie and the screen was horrible and the audio wasn't too big either, a rough sort of mono mix.  The DVD must do justice and take out the grayness in the colors, add more color and of course improve the sound.  The gunshots and explosions sounded horrible I think in the original tape so I think that is improved on the DVD.  The front cover looks a lot different than the original movie poster and mostly the video boxes but get it? new cover-new movie?  The synth music is great I think, it gives it the whole robot 80s feeling that the 2nd movie couldn't make with the stupid strings and steel clank noises.  The first one seems better because it's so original and it focuses more on story instead of action and guns.  This movie has its gross parts like Arnold punching a guy through the stomach, taking out his eyeball, and sliting his arm to look at machinery but it's all old effects so it's really fake but much more realistic than Friday the 13th. Anyways, this movie is classic and it doesn't make me scared anymore because 1997 has already passed and that's when the war was supposed to happen. All in all a great flick
B000002J03|4.0|After their first album, which was kind of bluesy in sections, the quartet of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonham and John  Paul Jones decided to change their sound to a more straightforward rock approach. This led to one of their biggest (and certainly most infamous) songs. The lyrics on this album also gave them a naughty image.<br />The album starts out with the barnburner &quot;Whole Lotta Love.&quot; This is their most infamous hit because of course, in the climax of the song, it really is the climax more than figuratively speaking. Ahem. It is followed by another great rock song &quot;What Is And What Should Never Be.&quot; &quot;The Lemon Song&quot; is the only song that sounds anything close to the more bluesy tunes on the debut, and it is followed by the album's lone ballad, &quot;Thank You.&quot; This shows the softer side of Led Zeppelin and is again a preview of what is to dominate the next album.<br />The second half of the album picks up where the first one left off with &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, another great rock-out song with an unforgettable guitar part. After that, the second half falters due to inconsistency, but is still great. &quot;Living Loving Maid&quot; is quite catchy and &quot;Ramble On&quot; is OK, but not the best. Not all may want to sit through the Bonham drum showcase &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, but at least they gave us mercy with the length, unlike on their live album. &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; is an appropriate way to bring the album to a close. <br />Overall, Led Zeppelin II is a great rock album that showcases the heavier side of Led Zeppelin, which (at the time) was heavier than what the world had heard before. The ever changing Led Zeppelin decided to throw us for a loop yet again on the next album, but if you want their most straightforward and consistent album, look no further than here.
B00003CXS4|5.0|One cool movie.  No doubt about it, if you enjoy an action movie with a good strong plot and a good amount of comedy (who doesn't) then this is the perfect movie for it.  Brad Pitt does an incredible job, as usual, and this movie is packed with incredible actors doing great work.  This movie is hilarious, and just flat out kicks.......definitly one to own.
B00004SCX6|2.0|This album is better that Spears's debut, but there still is nothing that great about it.  The only songs that I listen to are &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction&quot;.
0380002930|5.0|There are no right words to describe this book.  When I was little my sister read the stories from it to me and my other sisters and I fell in love with the characters.  Several years later, I saw the book in the bookshelf and recognized it, read it, and fell in love with the characters all over again.  This is a book you can read by yourself, with children, or other adults.  Watership Down wasn't a book I could read just once or twice.  I read it so many times my mom threatened to burn it (thankfully she didn't).  I still cry each time at the end of the book because it's time to part with the characters, but they're still in my heart, and someday I would even like to get around to visiting the real place, Watership Down, and envision the story again.  I recommend this book to everyone I know and I'm still trying to convince several people to read it.  I have noticed these two things about the people who have started reading it and stopped because they didn't like it:  they read it on and off and give up too early.  If you read a page and put the book down it becomes harder to fall in love and know the characters and be able to appreciate them.  Please don't make the mistake.  No one needs to miss out on this book.
B00003CXSM|3.0|It was a decent movie...It had it's funny moments, but it also had places were it seemed to just drag on.  But the commentary on the DVD was really good!
6301966015|4.0|Any film which encourages 30 (or more) people to submit a written review has to be just a little bit special. There are more than enough subjective and objective reviews listed here before mine to make any additional comments redundant. However - having been a teenager during most of the 60's - and also having personal knowledge of the films locations gives me perhaps an edge over some other reviewers. The park used in the film is Maryon Park which is located in Charlton - a suburb in the south-east of London. The antique shop was actually a general food store and was owned by the parents of one of my school friends. We used to take walks round the &quot;park&quot; nearly every lunchtime and therefore I know it like the back of my hand. Because of this personal knowledge - I was unable to experience the tense hypnotic effect that the film is supposed to generate for some of its viewers - such as in the night scene in the park. Anyway - I digress - the film attempts to typify the &quot;mod&quot; era and almost succeeds. If you want to see REAL mod fashion and design - take a look at any repeat of the old 60's pop music show &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; - then compare. Even the Yardbirds (as wonderful as they were) - could have chosen a more appropriate track. I must admit - the film is MUCH more enjoyable than I was expecting - having read most of the reviews before mine I was almost put off buying it - as I had my doubts to its general watchability. I do totally recommend this film/video to anyone who lived through this era - in particuar native Londoners. Todays teenagers/twentysomethings may find it trendy to say they enjoyed it - because of the mod connections - but very few actually will if they were being REALLY honest.
B00003CXN4|4.0|I have to say I was a little dissapointed with the movie because of all the hype, but is was still really good.  It has a few different story line witch all kept my interst.<br />I think everyone should check it out and rent it, but I wouldn't buy it, there is no reason for repeat viewings.
B0000009SY|5.0|On a cold day in early December of 1993, I learned that Frank Zappa had succumbed to cancer.  I pulled out this CD, put disc two in my CD player, cued up &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay,&quot; and  wept.  We miss you, Frank.
B00003CXRP|3.0|When Hanks is the cast away the movie is great..him on the island and him trying to get off of it, but the rest is just boring and the ending isn't that great.  <br />Half of this film is good, and the other part is just so slow.
0767805712|5.0|Wow! Thats pretty much all I can say because this film is one of the best that I have ever seen. The acting is top-notch. Uma Thurman is absolutely beutiful and puts on an excellent performace, along with Jude Law and Ethan Hawke.<br />The DVD is one the best translations I have ever seen as well. Extras include cut scenese, trailers, poster and photo gallery, and a neat documentory that interviews the actors and their thoughts on the film and the future as portrayed in Gattaca.<br />Along with a clever name, this movie has it all. Its not frusteratingly tense, but there are a few heart-pounding scenes and an excellent plot that unravvles like clockwork and isnt obvious or an overused rag either. The whole story is frighteningly believable, the soundtrack is the best I have ever heard and the Gattaca CD itself is terrific. The setting, a 1950's type retro America is perfect for the film, and gives a meloncholy feeling to it.<br />I cant recommend this enough. It is honestly one the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and the DVD is wonderful. Buy it, you will be in for a real treat once you do.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I loved this movie!  1 second after I saw this movie I knew I had to get the DVD when it came out.  This movie has everything, great story, wonderful actors...I can go on and on, but just get the movie already! :)
B00000J6AG|2.0|Is it Trance?  No. Is it Techno?  No. Is it House?  No. Is it even Electronica?  No. So what is it?  I have no idea. It is truly sad to watch one of the original gods of electronica fall to such...trash.  The CD is simply a pop CD for the masses.  Nothing more.  It is 18 tracks of piano, slow beats and 70s &quot;wawaah&quot; guitars.  There is no life in this ablum.  Now I know why he was jumping on the cover; he is smashing his soul to please the masses. I suppose to the average person this Muzak-esque mix might not be all that bad.  But to those of us who embraced Moby when he was new, and understand Electronica, it is a dark betrayal that really deserves nothing, much less the multi-millions of dollars that he has earned through copywriting and album sales.  It is, in all honesty, one of the most successful albums of all time.  But does that make it a good CD?  No.  That makes it Pop. On a brighter note, the song &quot;Natural Blues&quot; is extremely well done.  And &quot;Why does my hear feel so bad?&quot; can be also passed as music.  But you can get a Katcha remix of &quot;Natural Blues&quot; on the Gatecrasher Global Sound System CD that is much faster and club worthy.  ATB also has a remix of &quot;Why does my heart...&quot; on the Ibiza '99 CD that is better than the original.  Both remixes have more life, more beat and more energy than this entire CD.  So why bother picking this one up? If you are looking for good Electronica, go somewhere else.  If you are looking for pop, you've come to the right place.  Sadly, the true Moby that we know and loved is dead.
0140177396|3.0|This is the only Steinbeck I have read to date (except for The Pearl) and I started it expecting a masterpiece, given that Steinbeck was a Nobel laureate.  It is certainly a good enough, solid story, reasonably well told, but no masterpiece.  Maybe it's just that the plot element of a person killing another he loves as an act of compassion has been used too often since (e.g. Betty Blue and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).<br />So read the book, by all means, but don't harbour the expectations I had. It's a short little book, not complex at all, so it won't be hard work even if you don't like it all that much.

0440180295|4.0|I first read this book as a student and found it brilliant.  I then went on a Vonnegut binge and though I enjoyed  his other books (with the exception of Galapagos) none came close to this one.  The cover blurb praised the book as \\"funny, compassionate and wise\\" and I can only concur.  The story deals with weighty topics like war and death, and though funny it avoids flippancy.  And in Billy Pilgrim Vonnegut has created one of the most pathetically likeable, characters in all of fiction.<br />If you still wonder if you must read the book, just read the first one or two lines of the story proper (not the introduction).  If that fails to interest you, don't bother.
6305728437|5.0|Although Disney's movies have not been up to standard recently, this movie was an exception. The animation was very colorful and vivid. The songs were all fun to listen to, and the vocals were great. If you are considering buying this movie, go ahead! It's great!
B000002G89|4.0|This is a must-have CD not only for Clapton fans, but for anybody who enjoys good, solid guitar-driven music.  It is not at all racuous, except for the opening track, Motherless Children, which I happen to love.  I have always liked the way the guitar picks up speed and volume and intensity in the intro to the song, although most people don't seem to find it all that special.  The other songs are much quieter, with Clapton delivering flawless guitar playing (as is to be expected of the maestro), combined beautifully with his laid-back vocals.  All the songs are solid, and they have grown on me with repeated listening.  Do listen to this CD if you don't know it.
B000001Y5J|5.0|You have got to love this cd in my opinion it is by far the best from nine inch nails. It may only be 30 minutes but the cd is totally mind boggling with songs like wish and happiness in slavery you cant go wrong when I first heard wish I knew I had to get that cd with the numerous guitars it feels like your head is going to explode and with line like \\"i put my faith in god and my trust in you now thiers nothing more (...) up i could do\\" it's an anthem song to (...) off you parents with. And thats why no matter who your are you need this cd.
0679731725|5.0|This is one of the greatest books of our time.  It is a deceptively simple story about a wasted life spent in self-imposed servitude, at times very funny, but ultimately very sad.  Ishiguro deserves the highest praise for this masterpiece.  Writers who set out to write works of literature and end up creating pompous, unreadable novels should be forced to read this book.<br />The movie is also worth seeing, with Anthony Hopkins the perfect casting.
B00003OSSM|1.0|This was possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't mind if this review is not helpful to you, I just needed to get that off my chest. Don't see this if you have a pulse.
B00003CXV4|2.0|I'm a guy, and don't generally appreciate \\"Chick Flicks,\\" but this one started out all right.  My wife wanted to see this movie, and I'll admit- I like Theron and Reeve's chemistry in Devil's Advocate, although their relationship in that movie ended even worse then theirs in this picture.  I went to see the movie, and it had an enjoyable enough beginning as the cliche's of the movie were Hammered into the audience.<br />Reeve's character is a stiff suit, obsessed with himself, his talent and his career- he Lives for his job, and is not a healthy person.  He is wholly self- absorbed, and has no real love for anyone but himself; his success at work is driven by his desire to satisfy his ego.  He is obsessed with satisfying himself, by distancing himself as far as possible from his humble beginnings.<br />Theron's character is a flighty lovable leftist- PeTA type who liberates huggable puppies from evil experimental labs and gives them happy homes... .  They are \\"better off\\" for having met her.  Basically, she's a ...who shacks up with a guy to show him how twisted his life is without having Heavy amounts of leftist vitality.  Granted, the character is a LOT more likeable than that of Any of Reeve's characters business partners, and her quirks are all lovable- but the viewer must realize that her intentions are flawed; she doesn't make any room for real love...<br />After the characters are detailed, and after they fall in love, the message of the movie self- destructs.<br />Reeve's finds out Theron is dying.  Theron displays incredible selfishness by distancing herself from Reeves.  She shuts him out, because she doesn't want him to see her as weak, basically rejecting Reeves love.  Reeves goes to great lengths to see Theron, and eventually succeeds, forcing her to talk to him (Stalker!).  He proposes marriage, and she rejects him.  She admits she is dying, and wants him to leave her alone- forcing him to give up his love for her.  It seems all hope is lost, and eventually- both characters give up all hope for a miracle recovery, and decide that even though they're MADLY in love, it's best if they never see each other again.<br />Who in their right mind would shut out their loved ones during their last days?  Ironically, throughout the movie, Theron's character was doing just that.  She had been refusing to see her family, because she didn't want Them to see her dying... at the end of the movie, she decides to allow them to see her, but STILL shuts Reeves out.  She trades one bit of faulty logic for another.  The movie seems to say, \\"It's ok to shut out the people who you love when you're dying.  There is no hope for recovery from terminal illness.  When you're dying, romantic love is too tragic to deal with...\\"  <br />If I were in Reeve's characters position, and I allowed her to walk away at the end of the movie- I'd hate myself forever...<br />If I were Theron's character, and realized I'd only have one more minute to live, I probably would agonize during that last minute- wishing I'd be able to hold my loved ones hand...<br />Maybe it's just me, but I think this movie just ended terribly.
B00005B4GU|3.0|They must have forgotten that they released the same album less than a year before.  This album IS Kid B.<br />The lyrical tracks are good, but the plodding instrumental ones bore me.  I rank The Bends and OK Computer in my personal top 10, Pablo Honey in the top 20.  Radiohead's creativity, emotion, and darn good musicianship make me a big fan, but these last two are just so-so as a whole.<br />Can somebody tell me why I now have two versions of Morning Bell?  The one on Kid A is good.  The one on Amnesiac should have been thrown away.
0790733226|5.0|Contact -- based on the best-selling novel by Carl Sagan -- is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The story has many different levels which mean so much more than what it appears to mean on the surface. Jodie Foster plays Eleanor Arroway, a scientist who listens for signals from civilizations in other galaxies while struggling with the prejudices against women and her career, which is considered silly. But what this story is really about is the way religion and the government control science today. This movie is one that needs to be watched several times to really get the true meaning.<br />In Contact, you get profound acting along with a brilliant story plot that gives you a deep message that can be interpretted on different levels. Along with this, you get stunning visual effects unlike any other.<br />Part of what makes this such a good movie is the all-star cast of Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, and James Woods, plus the directing of Robert Zemeckis.<br />The only thing that I didn't like about Contact was the way they used Bill Clinton as the president, not an actor. They used his images from video clips of him in real life which never seemed to fit in correctly.<br />Contact is truly a movie for all ages and I hope that they re-release it in the theaters again, I would be the first to see it.
0345350499|5.0|I'll pass on plot descriptions and comments on writing style/characters/etc; there's enough of that here already.<br />I do not consider myself a fan of fantasy.  My expectation was that there would be a lot of quests and swordplay.  There wasn't much.  However, the appeal of this book lies in the story itself.  Very well done.<br />The bottom line is: Any book that can hold my intense interest for 1000 consecutive pages deserves no less than 5 stars.
B00003CY5H|4.0|You could say I went to see The Score for no other reason than for Ed Norton! If you asked me to list the greatest 'thirthysomething' actors out there, Ed Norton and Don Cheadle top my list. As I mentioned, I was concerned about seeing De Niro re-runs, but in The Score I really felt he delivered something that, while familiar, was also new. For any of you Marlon Brando fans, you've got to check out The Score; I thought he was fantastic, and I laughed out loud when I heard that he refused to let Frank Oz be on the set when he did his work, declaring &quot;I won't work with a Mupppet Man&quot;! The Score is a nice caper movie, it runs at a much slower pace than most caper films, and it spends a lot more time on characters and character interaction. Ed Norton didn't disappoint, and although the movie doesn't have much new to offer the caper genre, it's worth checking out just for the acting. Maybe a good one to wait for DVD, which knowing Paramount will probably come late this year. [Geoffrey Kleinman DVDTalk.com]
0782008372|3.0|Usually when you see &quot;directors cut&quot; one thinks a &quot;better&quot; or with deleated scenes etc. In this case, I think they had a good reason for deleating the scenes they did. In some DVD releases you get a choice of seeing it in the &quot;original&quot; theatrical version or &quot;directors cut&quot; with the new added portions, but in this case they didnt and I wish they had. I started to watch the movie and was disapointed with the first &quot;duel&quot; in the parking lot. I dont remember the dozens of &quot;backflips&quot; that Connors opponent makes, over and over again. One moment hes flipping without his sword, the next the sword is amazingly there? Oh well, for 6.99 I guess if I had rented it, it would have cost me about the same.  I'm hoping they bring out a special &quot;ultra&quot; collectors (blah, blah blah) like they do with some of the oddest titles, with a choice of versions.
0312243022|2.0|I read this book because it received so much hype I felt I HAD to.  Also, because it's based on Mrs. Dalloway, which I think is one of the finest novels ever written. Having read it, I can see why it's gotten the attention it has--it's just the sort of referential--and reverential--book that academics love.  But it's boring and full of cliches about contemporary urban life as well as suburban life in the late 40s.  It has none of the subtlety, brilliance, and depth of Woolf's own writing. Not one of its characters engages the reader's interest--instead, they're all dull shadows of Woolf's sharply drawn originals. You won't waste much time reading this book, as it's very slight both in length and content, but if you're looking for good writing and true insights in human character you'd be better off reading Mrs. Dalloway again,.
B000021Y77|5.0|This movie is about interactions. What you say and do, what others say and do, influence what we do. Action and reaction with a smidgen of chance mixed in. That's it folks, in a nut shell.
0345423496|2.0|All right, the basic premise of this novel is just plain wrong.  According to the speed of light, the Alien Overlords are just finding out what humanity is like and that maybe we are not that nice.  Didn't Clarke read his own book.  The speed of light can be gotten around.  The aliens knew EXACTLY what we were like right from the start!  His vision of the ring around Earth is kind of cool, and the best thing about this book.<br />It needs to be said that Clarke's condescending comments about religion and religious people are so callow and insulting that I lost much of the respect I had for him.  I now assess most of the credit for 2001 to Stanley Kubrick.  Judging by this book, the aliens were wasting their time putting the monolith on Earth.
B00005B36H|3.0|It took me a long time before I started liking this album. This did not make any sense to me because as a TOOL fan I was supposed to connect with this album immediately. The stage was all set up for every TOOL fan to rush out to their local record store and get their fix of an album that was four years in the making. As I pressed play on my cd player I thought I had bought the wrong cd. It did not sound like TOOL and Maynard's voice sounded different. I guess we all thought that TOOL was going to create another Aenima or Undertow. Well I was surprised at how different they sounded. Maybe this is another step the band has taken in order to evolve as musicians and artists. Lets face it, there will never be another band like TOOL and their fans should appreciate the time this band has been together because bands that are this good do not often last.  As for the album, LATERALUS, I found that there was no flow to it. Certain songs like Disposition could have been extended and experimented with even more. Some things I do like about the album is the actual cd case it comes in. If it were not for the black casing it came in you would not know what band it was. TOOL is a band that focuses on every detail of their albums which shows how much they care about their work. I also think that the best song on the album is The Patient.     Overall I gave this album only three stars because I felt something was missing. However, maybe that is what Maynard and the gang wanted all of us to feel. Or maybe this could be their final album together as we all wonder what lies in the future.
0451457994|5.0|This is my favorite science fiction novel of all time!  However, much of the credit goes to Stanley Kubrick.  Kubrick and Clarke holed up together in a hotel in Manhattan and hashed out the details for the plot.  The movie and the book happened contemporaneously, and I have to say that - as great as the book is - the movie is better (I believe it is the best movie ever made).  Even though there are differences between the book and the film (Saturn?), I believe one should see the film first and then read the novel to get a more straight-forward interpretation of what happened.
0553106635|5.0|I like very much the development of the plot in the book. It is superb - everything happens unexpectedly and no-one of the main characters is protected from dying.  That is just great - I can't stand stupid books where we all have to suffer for 10 books each 1000 pages long for the good to prevail the evil - it is so boring and easy to predict what will happen.  Martin is a different sort of author - he surprises the reader in every page of the book and makes the plot more and more interesting - almost no character is all good or bad. All characters are just people and mortals. Read the books - you will utterly enjoy them
0345347951|4.0|I believe that this is the book that put Arthur on the map, and led him to the attention of Stanley Kubrick.  It has all the themes that are present throughout his work - and also all the problems.  The one concept that Arthur has never understood is that the status of the human race - or any race for that matter - is not as a species, but as a collection of individuals, each with his own story and agenda.  Therefore, the &quot;happy&quot; endings of his books completely miss the point philosophically.  Like most scientists, he would do well to read a little existential literature - but I fear that would mean nothing to him.  That aside, this is a major work in the field of science fiction literature.  Like all great science fiction it is about ideas.  Yeah, it does begin with a visual that was stolen for the movie Independence Day, but it is more about the concept that humanity is in its infantile state.  The only problem is, I find Arthur's conception of its &quot;adult&quot; stage to be truly horrific.<br />Also, Arthur has an unfortunate (and stereotypical) prejudice against religious-minded people which, alas, is present in this book as well.
B00005B36H|5.0|Yep, Maynard and the group are awesome. This album is great, the songs are long and engaging.  I agree with the reviewer who recommends listening to it the whole way through, very well put together album.  Can't wait to see them play live this year, I am sure it will be even better. Oh, and as to 'non-music' tracks, give me a break, all the tracks count, some are just very long, and others are very short and serve as a sort of lead-in for the next song.  They are all quite intriguing tho.
0553573403|5.0|This should be it.  Enthralling, fast moving, absolutely fabulous writing by a new name to the genre.  If you are tired of series that go no where, then Martin is your man. Aside from the fast-pace, Martin has done his research on the  middle ages, and his writing reflects his vast background in heraldry and the realities of a nation at war.
B00004R9A4|3.0|&quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; is quite the piece of nostalgia for me, and this DVD is a pretty good package to explore that nostalgia with. Unfortunately, like all movies one loved as a child, this one just doesn't hold up as well.<br />And part of that problem may be that this is he complete version, oddly enough. I had never seen the full version of this film until now, and the result is a very long, almost taxing viewing experience -- not to mention some really poor tries at restoration here and there. Some dialogue has been re-dubbed by completely different actors and without a lot of care given to the lip-synching; scenes with the dubbing are maddening to watch.<br />That being said, the picture quality is mostly spectacular, and the documentary with the Sherman Bros. (who, surprisingly, are still alive and well) is informative and intriguing.<br />What remains is a very entertaining children's movie that, much to my dismay, would probably not be enjoyed by today's kids, especially at its new, 140-minute running time. Sure, it's great that the film is finally presented complete, but maybe they were right to make some cuts the first time around.<br />That being said, it's still a very charming film, mostly thanks to the songs (&quot;Portobello Road&quot; being the highlight) and David Tomlinson's wonderful screen presence.
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris' wit ranks with any other writers, reminding me mostly of David Barry, and his series of personal essays left no doubt as to his writing ability.  This one has made most bestseller lists by now, so if you haven't read it, pick it up. A great way to finish off the summer!
B00003OST8|5.0|This film is still thrilling for children and intensely nostalgic for grown-ups. 1938's THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD remains one of the most popular adventure films for all time. The film gives the legend of Robin Hood a light, satirical edge. Everyone in it is defined clear to the bone. Errol Flynn with exuberant aplomb plays Robin with a mixture of daring-do and self-mockery.  It's good vs. evil all the way with Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian, Alan Hale as Little John, Ian Hunter as Richard the Lion-Hearted, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the villains. The rousing film's direction is credited to Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, the former having replaced the latter. In a way this is a forerunner of the modern popular screen action hero. There is no situation as hopeless as it looks that Robin cannot escape from. This should be credited to Flynn's tongue-in-cheek approach to the role with all and his athletic screen presence. Composer Erich Wolfgang (CAPTAIN BLOOD, JUAREZ, THE SEA HAWK, KINGS ROW) Korngold's score won an Academy Award. The fantastic colour photography was the work of Cinematographers Sol Polito and Tony Gaudio. When we think of the best of Flynn we think of this role. I hope someone somewhere is seeing that this film is being preserved for future generations. Films like this are rare and we need them today in these uncertain times more than ever before.
0380973650|5.0|I recently stumbled upon Gaiman (well, 2 weeks ago) and since then have read nearly everything he's produced.  A fabulous writer who takes the worlds we live in and creates realistic alternate realities that will leave you wondering just how much Gaiman had to make up :)
B00003CXMG|5.0|ALMOST FAMOUS is truly the greatest film ever made. I wanted desperately to see this ever since I saw the trailer. I never even knew I'd enjoy this kind of film. After all, me...a 17-year-old who doesn't normally like rock 'n' roll but a teen Pop fanatic who loves the Backstreet Boys instead of Led Zeppelin loved this film! So it doesn't really matter if you are not a huge fan of rock 'n' roll or lived in the 70s.<br />Anyway, this is a feel-good, smart comedy that takes place in 1973. It's roughly about director/writer Cameron Crowe's life as a 15-year-old rock journalist. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is an extremely smart young teenager who, even though he is only fifteen, is a senior in high school. William lives in San Diego with his hard, strict, down-to-earth mother, Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), a college professor who can't seemed to understand why her children like rock music and stuff. He also lives with his older sister, Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), who is rebelious and decides to leave home so she can have more freedom.<br />William's love for rock music urges him to become interested in journalism, and soon he meets the editor of Creem magazine, Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who starts giving him tips on being a good rock journalist. Then Lester gives William an assignment: get an interview from the rock band, Black Sabbeth. William manages to get his reluclent mother to let him do this, and he goes to the Black Sabbeth concert. When that doesn't work, the band Stillwater shows up late for the concert since they are the opening act. William manages to get an interview from them instead by showing off his intelligence. Finally, Rolling Stone magazine calls William and asks him to do an interview with Stillwater, which takes him on an incredible journey-experience with Stillwater, where he eventually becomes friends with the band, especially close to the band's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and the beautiful, but mysterious &quot;band aid&quot; follower, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).<br />ALMOST FAMOUS has humor in it's own right. The cleaver, original script and screenplay is only a part of this masterpiece. The actors are a large piece of the masterpiece - the chemistry between all the actors is the thing that holds this film together. All the actors are perfect for their roles - from Patrick Fugit, who is a truly gifted actor, to Jason Lee, who plays the lead singer for Stillwater. I am ashamed that this film was, for the most part, over-looked by the Academy for Best Picture. I was glad that ALMOST FAMOUS won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved, but it should have won more Awards. And I think Kate Hudson deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress more than that other woman who won it. <br />This, by all means, is my favorite film of all time - it even beats TITANIC! I recommend this film for anybody - you don't even have to like rock 'n' roll to enjoy this film. ALMOST FAMOUS rules!
0060925000|5.0|'A Suitable Boy' is full of rich and detailed accounts of India and everything Indian. It is a great book to read, though I must say that I nearly didn't pick up the book at first glance (due to the size). It took me some time to finish reading the book but, what a journey it was!!!! Once you've been introduced to the characters of the book you feel yourself submerged into the world of the Mehras, Kapoors, Khans and Chatterjis as well as their friends and enemies- a world full of passion: of love and hate. The main focus of the story is on Mrs Rupa Mehra and her quest to find a suitable boy for, her daughter, Lata to marry. And Vikram Seth has charmingly woven the tales of the other various people, who are equally interesting, into the story. Politics also plays a main part in the novel, since it is set in 1952 when India was newly independent and as well as struggling to keep peace among the Hindus and Muslims in the country. But even at the times of extreme hatred and fightings among the people of the two religions, we see the strong ties of friendship and love shared between the families of Kapoors (Hindus) and Khans (Muslim). The rural life of India is explored through Maan Kapoor and the reader is transported to peaceful villages where the life is slow. And the urban life of India is best represented by the Chatterjis who live in the city of Calcutta where life is full of busy social gatherings. The main theme- Love, is what we see in each of the characters, not just for their lovers but also for their parents, siblings, children and friends. The book is a treat for everyone and once you start reading it, you'll not want to stop!
B00004YRQA|3.0|What really pisses me off is the fact that SONY just had to be so greedy that they WAYYY overpriced us, gamers. Since Ps2 is 300 bucks, why cant they give us a break and sell these memory cards for a cheaper price? oh yeah, and another annoying fact is that PS2 games can't be saved on PSX memory cards, and PSX games cant be saved on PS2 memory cards... grr... so if you're a new playstation gamer like me, you'd have to buy both memory cards! do you realize that i would have to spend nearly 50 dollars just for some memory cards? i dont see why SONY cant just build the memory cards in the system itself.
B00003CXE6|5.0|In a world of film that suffers an astonishing paucity of good material, GLADIATOR is a pleasant relief. Hollywood has long needed more true Heroes, and this delivers in great fashion. <br />GLADIATOR is an old-fashioned epic, along the lines of BEN-HUR and EL CID. A rousing story, gripping action scenes, breathtaking sets, and aptly mournful music -- along with stellar performances from many cast members -- combine to make GLADIATOR one of the best movies of the decade (if not, as in my own opinion, one of the best of all time!)
B000056K04|1.0|In 1994, Dave's sister was murdered in South Africa.  May she rest in peace.  However, there was a very special appearance in Boulder, Colorado.  A little (Nationaly, big in Colorado) band called The Samples played a show with Dave Matthews' Band, minus Dave as he was tending to his family in South Africa.  This is the most amazing show I've ever heard.  The band played the Samples songs with a twist... a solo here, an extra chorus there.  Upon listening to the new Everyday album, I couldn't help but skip vigorously through the tracks, and come to the conclusion, the band is better off without him on this record.  I came to the end of the CD and said &quot;That's it.&quot;  Come on Dave, where did the acousitc guitar go!  I don't understand why you have to pick up that silly electric thing and play it as if you liked it!  <br />As Dave fans we know the Jimi Things, and the perverse lyrics of Crash, not &quot;Oops I did it&quot; (again?)... no wait that's Spears title....  Both &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; are so superior to this album it's almost hard to compare.  I just don't understand why he had to write the record without the band.  A band usually consists of band members (yes that's plural) who write a track &quot;together&quot;.  Not you and the new manager.  What happend to Boyd's violin?  Did it break or something, I didn't hear it except for maybe 10 seconds on the entire album.<br />I did however hear an acoustic version of &quot;The Space Between.&quot;  Absolutely incredible, it was as if Dave was back to his old self again.  Of course it will never be released.<br />The fact remains that if Dave wants to write music for the people, the new boy band loving teenage population of this country, fine.  But he's going to completely loose his loyal fan base that he has acrued over the past decade.  <br />My final statement:<br />If you like todays hip hop, and the &quot;pop&quot; music of today......  Buy it, you may very welllove the album.  You'll be amazed at the talent of Dave's fingers on that electric guitar.<br />If you like the Dave Matthews Band.... as in the whole band and enjoyed their previous albums.......  Don't bother, instead, purchase all the previous albums, they are all excellent and deserve to be purchased and loved.  If you already own them all, go check out bands like Guster who write music for themselves and their loyal fans. Or the melodies from Pat McGee, The Samples, Josh Joplin Group, or Five For Fighting.  You won't be disappointed.<br />Sorry for the Dave bashing, but it's just not up to par.  I'm praying the band releases another record under Lillywhite soon, he's worked wonders for them in the past.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Brad Pitt steals the show, even with a small part like One Punch Mickey.  You get the option on the DVD to turn on the Brad Pitt &quot;Pikey&quot; subtitles (Pikey being the Brit equivalent to a type of nomad or gypsy, that you can never understand), which is not only helpful but hysterical.  The fact that you can't understand him is funny, but when you read what he's actually saying, it's even funnier.  <br />Dennis Farina is great as cousin Avi, and has some really fast, witty lines and he does them with perfect dead pan.   Example, after the huge Fiasco that Farina flies to England to deal with... US Customs agent: Do you have anything to declare? Farina: Yeah, don't go to London.<br />All of the actors are dead on with their respective characters, and all fit so well together...Guy Ritchie chose an excellent cast, and has made a terrific, and very modern film that still has me laughing.
0441008356|5.0|I just got done reading in my humble opinion the best sf novel of the year,Revelation Space. Reynolds has estabished himself with this grand and mostly chilling space opera set in the 26th century.He has the ability to tell diverse storylines and have them come together in cohensive and gripping fashion.Dan Sylveste, a obessive scientist on the colony world of Resurgam seeks to find the answers for why the planet's original inhabitants,the Amarantins a avian race was wiped out eons ago. But Sylveste doesn't know it but he and his simulation of his dead, father calvin are being seek by cyborg crew of starship Nostalgia for Infinity to cure their captain who suffers from nanotech plague.Sylveste isn't aware that one of the crew,a lady assasin, Khouri is contracted to kill him!The tension of this novel is so palpable you can almost cut it with the knife.Reynolds also knows his plot twists, as he illustrates that in the future technology changes but human nature doens't as he gives scenes of machivellian manuvers among the crew of Nostlagia.Characters in this epic novel also are not what they appear to be like the brave and sometimes ruthless Volyoya who seeks to save her captain from the nanotech plague. Khouri the assasin who must kill Sylveste in order to be reunited with her husband.The deadly Sajaki who agendas on the ship no one knows.Reynolds how to create memorable worlds and aliens like engimatic intelligence called the Shroud and how those who enters it are changed. The atmosphere of the creepy ship, Nostlagia very memorable as the crew battle each other and deadly stowaway called Sun Stealer.Reynolds also gives a answer why there are few intelligent civilizations found in the universe.the reason will terrify you!The author's ability in universe-building puts him in the same league as David Brin, Greg Bear, and frank herbert as he tells a epic saga that transcences space and billions of years in the history of the universe.Reynolds also knows how tell a storywith hars science in a way that doesn't confuse the reader or take away from the human element of story.Reynolds knows how write action sequences as he describes in relish as the ship battles the defenses of the machine planet,Cerberus and terrifying escape from the menace of the Sun Stealer.This was the best space opera I've read since Peter Hamilton's Reality Dysfunction series and bodes well for Reynolds future in the genre!
0226264017|5.0|Without a doubt, Milton Friedman is the most important and influential economist to emerge in the past half century, and is only surpassed, at least in terms of influence, by Keynes when one considers the entire 20th century. <br />As we all learned in macroeconomics, Friedman is best known for his &quot;monetarist&quot; movement. That is, the belief that inflation is always caused by excessive monetary growth and that changes in the money supply directly affect aggregate demand both directly and indirectly.<br />In &quot;Capitalism and Freedom,&quot; Friedman argues that politics and economics are practically impossible to separate. Therefore, one can not have political freedom without economic freedom, and vice-versa. However, Friedman does acknowledge the need for government as a &quot;rulemaker and umpire,&quot; as well as to control externalities.  <br />While this book was written in the 60's, it covers some surprisingly contemporary issues: public schools, international trade, corporate social responsibility, etc. Friedman even suggests a school system that is publicly funded but privately administrated. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the population (cattle) are too ignorant to ever allow such a thing. Last year, a voucher system that would allow parents to choose a private school instead of a public one for their children was placed on the ballot. It was rejected by the voters. <br />Of course, conservatives will love a book such as this, while the something-for-nothing types will cry foul. I suppose that I am neither. I just know the truth when I see it regardless of the package it comes in.
B00001OH7V|5.0|David Bowie made three albums while living in Berlin.  The second of them, &quot;Heroes,&quot; sees Bowie continuing his bare-bones production, ably assisted by Brian Eno.  The title track of this album remains my all-time favorite Bowie composition, both for its poetic quality and for the harmonics, hooks and production values.  Bowie utilizes several unusual instruments on this album, including the Japanese samisen (a stringed instrument).  Another favorite piece on this album is an instrumental, &quot;Neukolnen,&quot; inspired by Bowie's Berlin neighborhood.  This is an album not to be missed.
B000000WCV|4.0|&quot;Homework&quot; sounds like a test, an  experience Daft Punk have attempted for in order to improve their work. Except for &quot;Around the world&quot;, it´s imature music. Very different of &quot;Discovery&quot;, THE BEST CD OF EVER!!!!!!!<br />Anyway,Homework´s worth 5 stars....
B00001OH7X|4.0|&quot;Lodger,&quot; the third and final installment in what Bowie fans call the &quot;Berlin Trilogy,&quot; is a marvelous album in and of itself.  As part of the trilogy, it is slightly weaker.  The singles released from this album, &quot;DJ&quot; and &quot;Fashion,&quot; are solid pop songs.  However, my favorite cuts are &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; and &quot;Look Back in Anger.&quot;  The latter has a fascinating video (Bowie was a video pioneer) showing Bowie as a painter in reverse &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; scenario -- whatever happens to the painting happens to Bowie.  Two rarely mentioned tracks, &quot;Red Sails&quot; and &quot;Yassasin&quot; (Turkish for &quot;long life&quot;) are superior in many ways to &quot;Fashion.&quot;  The most depressing track on this album is definitely &quot;Repetition,&quot; which is about spousal abuse.  Bowie has a lot of interesting things to say on this album ... and it sets the stage for better works yet to come.
B000053VAF|5.0|I found Dogma to be a wonderfully satirical statement on the state of organized religion.  Using the backdrop of plenary indulgence possibly bringing about the end of existence was a delicious choice.<br />The Special Edition improves on the original product by adding some outstanding behind the scenes material.  Though I found some of the outtakes to be tedious (the Matt Damon Star Wars one-liners as a notable exception), the rest of the material is excellent.  The deleted scenes expand upon the story, most notably that of why Bethany was unable to have children and Azrael's description of why Hell was the way it was.  The audio commentary was also very informative.
B00004SPYJ|5.0|Franco Zeffirelli's production of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; is my absolute favorite Shakespearean film.  Zeffirelli's daring casting of teenagers Len Whiting and Olivia Hussey in the title roles is perfect in the context of the play of two star-crossed teen lovers.  Another ideal casting choice was Michael York as Juliet's cousin, Tybalt.  York brings a particular venom to the role, all the while revealing his skill and training as a fencer and former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company.  The film is also visually quite beautiful, with outstanding cinematography and scenery.  I have seen numerous productions of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; on stage and screen, and this one surpasses all of them.
0060934913|5.0|This is a fantastic story, blending blunt, often hilarious narrative with powerful insights into the core of the restaurant business, with some touching and bang-on insights on character.  We learn about how the restaurant industry really works (which is great for those of us who eat in them frequently), and the invisible characters behind the kitchen doors come to life most vividly.  For those of us who've done some time in restaurant kitchens, it's a great revisitation; for those who haven't, it's quite instructive.  Regardless, the book remains thoroughly riveting and enjoyable from beginning to end, and, with all it's threads back to the human condition, Kitchen Confidential should be widely appealing.<br />Bourdain comes through as honest and learned, and his story never fails to engage, amaze, and satisfy.  One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long while.
B000007MVM|3.0|This album is not great as much as people would have you believe. Its not for people who arnt interested in psychedelic albums, and the early pink floyd is some what listenable to anyone, but this album is very biased. Barret has seemed to traded in his brilliant work in psychedelic based instrumentals and interesting uses of music, as in astronomy domine or Pow R Toc H, and follows a more dylanistic style of music. The vocals are still pretty much as they once were in Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, but the music seems easy, very much so less full of the power which Piper has. The guitar is that most used, and keyboard and other things are pretty absent, not very imaginative, but give him credit, he was just schizophrenic. His vocals are by far the best part, and he uses expert use of echo boxes. His lyrics are still very brilliant but seem to be more mellow, and less abstract, and seem to follow the same key for most of the album. Some of the tracks seem oddly familiar. This album seems to be very erratic as well. Its pretty obvious when he switches from lead guitar to rythem and they have to do some over dubbing. Its mostly just love, and romantic songs anyway, about girls and such. Some of the tracks are honestly scraping the bottom of the barrel, but others seem very well done. Octopus is the best track by far. And golden hair and others do very well indeed. The guitar is well done as well, Syd can play quite well is pretty apparent, but as for the songs being incredably interesting as they once were, alot of them fall short. Syd's musical genius is there, but it seems garbled, and it seems as if theres a strain on him every second of the way. Roger Waters, and Dave Gilmour had little to work with even, but they did terrificly well in making the album absolutely endeering. This album is not on of my favourites, probably in the late 30's, but it does a good job in psychedelics. Its a good album, but doesnt stand up if you really speculate it, just ease into it for agood time. Its not exactly piper at the gates of dawn, nor is it an album by Ween (If you know who they are, you know that most of there stuff is pretty bad). Anyway its a sure buy if you really liked sargeant pepper, or piper. If your more of a plain dylan fan, or of new pop culture, youd probably not enjoy it that much. I like it though, and im just saying that it might be wiser to go onto the internet and get them free of charge.
B00005CDUE|5.0|...the perplex being, how the heck do you approach a &quot;Best Of&quot; for this seminal group?  If you've read the other reviews on this page, you know that no one is satisfied with this compilation.  But they're wrong, and I'll tell you why.  Yes, this is the 85th &quot;Best of&quot; we've seen from these guys in the last twenty years, but it's also the best, balancing the early and late periods nicely.  Yes, those two periods are different stylistically, but their &quot;weird&quot; period is very accessible, their &quot;sell-out&quot; period far quirkier than elitists accuse it of being, and both periods stay true to their great theme (romance and how it relates to issues of class).  Yes, the reverse chronology is silly, but you have a programming function on your CD player, don't you?  Yes, their cover of John Lennon's &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; stinks, but it IS a rarity.  Yes, there were some glaring omissions -- there always will be, won't there? -- but this hits the unassailable high points.  In fact, the only way to reconcile these problems is to make (VIRGIN -- are you listening?) a 2 CD compilation, the first half devoted to the first four records, the second half devoted to the last four. Til then, this fine substitute will do, as Roxy's records (regardless of what everyone tells you) are woefully uneven.  And you have to give Virgin credit for cutting out all of Ferry's solo work -- even the good stuff never seemed to fit in alongside the (better) Roxy material. All things said, however, the finest single-disc Roxy you can buy.  The two Roxy camps, early and late, should get over it!  P.S. -- And since everyone else pitched theirs, here are my nominations for that future dream compilation which I'm sure is in the works now: &quot;Ladytron&quot; (the poppiest tune on the debut), &quot;Editions Of You&quot; (how could they have left this one off the single disc job?) &quot;Song For Europe&quot; (maudlin but hillarious if you get the joke), &quot;Just Like You&quot; (personal favorite of mine), &quot;Prairie Rose&quot; (my favorite Roxy track), &quot;Could It Happen To Me?&quot; (obscure, but lovely, and it outlines Ferry's worldview beautifully), &quot;Just Another High&quot; (heartbreaking answer song to &quot;Love Is The Drug&quot;), &quot;Still Falls The Rain&quot; (funky, funky) and &quot;Take A Chance With Me&quot; (marriage proposal).  Will someone at Virgin get on the ball?
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD is amazing to me. Everyone seems to love it, regardless of what music you typically lisen to. It is great to see different generations, classes, races, - whatever - relate to the same body of music.<br />The reason why, I think, is that the music on this album has a certain purity about it. Stright forward and honest, yet spiritual and deeply moving. It is impossible to listen to this album without a warm comfort wrapping itself around you.
B00003CXB2|5.0|You can read the story of the movie from just about any other review on these pages. I simply want to add my vote to the growing collection of right-thinking people who believe and know that this a truly stupendous, awe-inspiring movie, plotwise and filmingwise and musicwise. And please, God forbid, if you can't get a wide-screen edition, don't bother to watch the film! This is one of the few wide-screen movies that have been made that really, absolutely have to have widescreen - the width of the film is actually part of the story-telling, and cutting the sides off and giving yourself a smaller picture is just as bad to the storytelling as if you cut out the volume.<br />This is in my top 10 favorite movies (right up there with Citizen Kane, The Thing, 2001, Clockwork Orange...), as it should be on yours. It's just plain brilliant. And it has Alec Guinness, and that's worth the price of a ticket right there.
B000056K04|2.0|First of all, this album seems to embody the the term sell-out. Dave didn't even write these songs. This is just over-produced music industry fluff. Very bland, and very bad.<br />Now, what happened to the album DMB recorded with Steve Lilywhite that is suppose to be fantastic, if not radio frinedly? I wish I knew. I do know that it has been floating around the internet, and I'm going to find it. Anyway, some powers that be made them stop that album near its completion and put together this horrid mess of an album. I only gave it 2 stars because it is DMB, it really deserves 1.
0679879269|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy greatly, admiring Pullman's breathless style.  He has an ability to write his way out of potentially nonsensical plot pitfalls that threaten to derail his narrative on occasion.<br />But as a life-long atheist, the parts of the book that genuinely brought a smile to my face were the undisguised anti-christian 'rants' that appeared toward the end of the story.  He even goes so far as to call christism &quot;a powerful and persuasive mistake.&quot;  I am sure Pullman knew the reaction he'd get from statements like that, and I admire him all the more for such bravery in the face of the supreme foolishness that has held the world in its sway for so long.  If literature contained more honest and thoughtful voices like his, I feel the world would be an infinitely safer and saner place.
0425107469|5.0|This was my first Dean Koontz book. It DEFINITELY will NOT be my last either. One of the book's main characters was a dog with a human mind. This dog made the story for me. I won't even go into the suspense this &quot;watcher&quot; thing'll put you through. It did lack the actual horror I thought it would have. Maybe, Mr.Koontz decided to break from the real gruesome horror and just make us really tense while falling off the edge of our seats? I have no clue. I'll find out soon enough though after I read a few more. Anybody reading this review that hasn't read anything by Dean Koontz should start off with this book. I don't know if this type of story just appeals to people like me (weird people, that is). But from what I've heard this book did a lot of selling when it came out. Try it. You'll enjoy it.
6301902645|5.0|Today, a film like Le Mans could probably never be made.  It really took the insistent passion of Steve Mcqueen to bring the blunt, terrifying beauty of sports car racing to the screen.  Though the movie proved once and for all that mainstream audiences simply have no interest in reality-based racing films, for lovers of the &quot;golden age&quot; of sports car racing, this film is pure treasure.  The sights, the sounds (The spine-chilling scream of a Porsche 917 changing gears at 8000 RPM; can you ever get over it once you've heard it?) and the gut emotions that racing cars ilicit are right there to have and hold, as in no other film, ever.  It is certain that McQueen the racer made this film for us, the race fans.  Though a commercial flop, it may well be his most honest, and personal, film.
006097625X|5.0|This is a fundamental book for anyone interested in comics. And anyone interested in words or representation. Period. A history, anthropology, guide, and critique to the medium of comics *in* the medium that transcends the medium.  Scott is brilliant -- both as a thinker and as an artist.  Buy this book.  Read this work. <br />(Then go out and read his other stuff, like Zot! or visit his website at [...] -- And no. I do not know Scott personally, I have not been paid to say these things, and I have no other interest than as a critical fan and (pardon the onomotopoeia) thinking man.)
B00004SCX6|2.0|I am not a Brit-Basher, and make no attempts to be. However, this album was pretty weak. Although Britney is the &quot;Pop Princess&quot; she simply hasn't any substance. Her rendition of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is extremely untrue to the original, and a great disappointment. This album lacks in identity. This CD was a fun listen for a week or so, but the novelty of &quot;Oops...&quot; has worn off, and the CD has sat in the rack ever since. Don't waste your time on something with so little longevity.
B00005JHAB|5.0|This movie is excellent!  I saw it in the theater with my cousin and sister.  I was unsure about Jennifer Lopez at first because I had only seen one movie with her in a main role.  In the first few minutes of the movie I was already laughing and enjoying it!  Jennifer and Matthew have a great chemistry.  He was a very good actor in this movie!  I thought that this love story was really sweet!  I thought that the fact that Matthew was a pediatrician was classic.  They both convinced me! It's now one of my favorite movies and as soon as it comes out on VHS, I'm buying it!!!!
B000002LGQ|5.0|Everyone knows Madonna for songs such as Material girl, Holiday, Lucky Star, etc. But no one realizes how artistic Madonna really is. The Title track is a wonderful song. The video is great too. But there are songs on the album that wern't realesed but are just as magical. Promise To Try is a wonderful ballad talking about how her mother died. It really captures the esscence of how she must have felt growing up without a mother.Oh father is another great song talking about how cruel her father could be while she was growing up. Other songs like Express Yourself, Cherish, Spanish Eyes, and Love Song are really good songs. Whoever thinks that Madonna has no talent is beyond wrong! This is one of the best if not thee best album I've ever heard. It is a album you can listen from Begining to end. If your'e thinking about buying this stop thinking and buy it! that is how good the album is.
B000001F7R|5.0|Basically Def Leppard emerged from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) in 1979. Groups such as Iron Maiden, Saxon,  and Def Leppard were about the only groups from that period to find success. Saxon was never popular in the U.S. but was huge everywhere else. Iron Maiden made it here in the U.S. like Def Leppard. I first heard &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; played on one South Florida radio station and I immediately went out to buy it. The entire l.p. was solid hard rock, not commercial stuff! Just listen to songs such as &quot;Rock Brigade&quot;, &quot;Wasted&quot;, and &quot;Rocks Off&quot;. Great guitar licks courtesy of Steve Clark and Pete Willis are spread throughout this debut l.p. If your looking for Def Leppard commercialized stuff (ex.&quot;Photograph&quot;) you won't find it on this release. Also their followup l.p. High N' Dry&quot; is a masterpiece. Yes it does have their hit &quot;Bringin' on the Heartbreak&quot; which became commercialized thanks to MTV, but it also showed that Def Leppard could write great ballads as well as rock. Other than that, the l.p. just smokes and is even better than &quot;On Through the Night&quot;.  Highly recommended!
B00000IBRX|5.0|This movie was very, very, underrated.  It seems like everyone I know hated this movie, and thought it was &quot;arty&quot;, &quot;boring&quot;, or &quot;weird&quot;, but I thought it was amazing.  Robin Williams is quite possibly the greatest actor to ever walk the earth.  He's primarily known as a comedian (and a great one at that), but he proves here that he's just as capable of doing drama, and better at it than anyone else.  Anabella Sciorra is worth an honorable mention, as well.  If she didn't win an award for this, it's quite a crime.  The basic plot of this story: everybody dies!  Robin and Ana are a married couple, with several kids, and they all die at different times.  Robin and his children are in heaven, and Ana (who commits suicide) goes to hell.  But, Robin doesn't want any part of heaven if he can't be with the girl he loves, so he goes in to save her.  Basically, this is the ultimate love story (how many people would go to hell for the one they loved?).  The story is brilliant, and the special effects are amazing.  This is a very heavily dramatic movie, by the way, and it may almost be too much to take for some, but it is a really excellent movie, one of the best ever made.  You must see this, it will really get you thinking about life.
0671027573|5.0|If i can`t put it down so can you because it was very entertaining book. I`m not a murder/mystery fun but with this you will laugh your head off to her witty dialogue and you get glued to the story because it was never boring.  So for all of you thinking of buying it. Well dont think buy it its worth every cell of your brain to read it.
B00004UEIH|5.0|In 1957, eccentric piano genius Thelonious Monk was on the verge of breaking into the jazz mainstream.  He formed a quartet featuring tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, another musician who was no stranger to controversy.  Their legendary collaboration (and gigs at the Five Spot Cafe) only lasted a few months, but the few recordings that it produced are classic.  This studio CD (recently remastered in clear 20-bit sound) contains three great tunes by the Monk Quartet, two &quot;leftovers&quot; from the octet session (with Art Blakey and Coleman Hawkins) that produced _Monk's Music_, and a solo piano feature.  All the tunes mix Monkish angularity with catchy melodies as only Monk could write them.  It's hard to pick a favorite on an album this good, but if I have to: &quot;Trinkle, Tinkle&quot; really stands out for both Monk and Trane's playing (you can hear some of the earliest traces of his &quot;sheets of sound&quot;) and Monk's unaccompanied playing on &quot;Functional&quot; is outstanding.  But that's not to say that the tender playing on &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot;, or the octet versions of &quot;Epistrophy&quot; and &quot;Off Minor&quot; aren't fantastic in their own right.  If you like this album, you must pick up the lower-fidelity recording of the band live at the Five Spot, as well as the aforementioned _Monk's Music_ album.
B00002DE2L|3.0|Although this piece of music is the most over recorded work in recent history, it happens to be an enduring and captivating baroque classic.<br />I really love it, as it contains enough highs and lows to satisfy my love of passionate, firey, emotional and colourful music.  Whether it is Jazz, Progressive Metal, Funk or Classical music, I like to hear and feel these qualities coming at my aural senses with abandon!<br />I have to say that Anne-Sophie Mutters rendition of this work displays her usual dreamy tone and energy.  It goes without saying that her technical prowess handles everything with apparent ease, maybe too much so because I feel an artist is at their best, when performing right on the edge of their abilities.  Sadly, Mutter plods along through most of this work, causing you to sit uncomfortably in your chair, urging her to propel each movement forward with more energy and passion.<br />I have heard many, many versions of this work and I still come back to the one that captures every nuance, tone and emotion with thundering power and sensitivity.  That version is by Nigel Kennedy, released in 1989 and everytime I hear it, you are left uplifted, exhausted and satisfied.  I doubt very much if anyone else could better Nigel Kennedy's performance and Mutter certainly tries to bring something new to the work, but ultimately fails to capture it in the right way.<br />I love Anne-Sophie Mutters other recordings very much, but I wouldn't really recommend this one, apart from the added bonus of Tartini's 'The Devil's Trill', which is excellent and in many ways overshadows the main attraction of the CD.
B000002I25|5.0|the Doors were the very first band i really liked and they got me into music. The Doors were the sinister band in the hippi free love 60's. They represented a \\"dark side\\" to all the 60's love peace and happiness. They released this album in Janurary 1967 and includes the #1 hit Light my Fire. It also includes 10 other songs which are ALL GREAT! the best ones are Break on through, soul kitchen, crystal ship, back door man, take it as it comes, and the end. this album is solid throughout and has a great blusey, psychadellic feel of the 60's. many of todays bands are influenced by the doors. if you like ANY Doors songs or your a doors buy this, it's a MUST HAVE. if you want to get into the Doors but no nothing about them this is the album to buy. BUY THIS! YOU WON'T BE DISSIPOINTED!
B00003CXA2|4.0|A simple man, no, an &quot;INNOCENT&quot; who &quot;KNEW what love is&quot;<br />What a wonderful two hour escape into the clarity of his heart and a needed escape from our troubled times.<br />Move over Mr. Frank Capra and make room for Tom Hanks on your bench please.<br />I am sure we all found a slow monent here and there, but, the movie is a collectible.<br />Dr. Mario T. Scaduto Ph.D.
B000002V0Q|2.0|This album was a big disappointment for me. a few years ago when I was just another big Metallica fan I heard of a great group called Megadeth and one of the greatest metal albums called countdown to extinction. so I bought this album and instead of the great metal album I expected to I got simple chords, silly lyrics and some good guitar solos. luckily a good friend of mine loaned me Youthanasia and I really liked it then I got Rest In Peace and So Far, So good... so what? and those were killer albums also. now I got most of Megadeth's work and I can't believe I almost missed this great band because of one bad album, C.T.E.  if you haven't heard Megadeth yet do yourself a big favour, get R.I.P and pass this one or you might miss a great band.
B000002I27|4.0|The tone on the Doors second release is dark and haunting.  Strange Days, Unhappy Girl, People Are Strange, all of them talk about the eerie side of life.  Creative set to the color black. Moonlight Drive is the song that especially does it for me.  The haunting lyrics, the slick slide guitar, and the atmospheric keyboards make it one of my all time favorite Doors songs.  I like the Marimba effect on I Can't See Your Face In My Mind.  I like the debut and LA Woman more but this release has a lot of merits as well including one awesome album cover!
0140186409|4.0|This is an utterly poignant tale - a reading experience that rends the human spirit. My week-long journey with The Grapes of Wrath is an intimate one because it has the expressions of passions whether tragic or bitter that have been beautifully written, an ingenious verisimilitude that is as close as a personal story. Although this intimacy is only but a woof of the awesome fabric, the warp is its universal allure; its actions - alive, soulful, depressing and frank that appeal to any man and woman regardless of experience and race.<br />The Grapes of Wrath reflects the hellish downpour of misery upon the farmers who lived and loved their land as much as their life but whose farms have been encroached by capitalists whose only concern is profit and wealth at the expense of the abuse of the farmers and their family. This is a great tragedy, an allegory, by which an enduring family travels through life's travails. The story revolves around their sensibilities of hope and survival, that in spite of the foreboding, they are dauntless in their seek for a better life. The Joads mirror the plight of the migrant workers- depicting the same suffering, the same fear and the same hope. And all the misanthropies that happened have its bitter toll on them, nevertheless under the frosting of modernity, within the fillings of promises of abundance by science and economics and above little dashes of fraud and selfishness. And all these infuriated the migrant workers but whose voice are stifled under the narcotics of hunger.<br />The whole story runs toward a single-paced arrow but the characters bounce back a certain tense, or perhaps a curiosity. They play transparent roles in a way that a reader is carried along some of their introspections. In particular, Tom who is the main character is given a trenchant role in the movements and resolutions of the story while their mother who is such an audacious persona embraces the moral force so that the other characters maintain their moral substance. The other interesting character is the defunct preacher, Casy who constantly denies his capacity to preach again, and who eventually becomes a martyr for the cause of the Joad family and for the migrant workers which he led during the labor strike. The rest of the family and the other fleeting characters also played brilliant roles - either in rich metaphors or as colorful realism.<br />Along the precarious highway 66, their life-story evolved and adapted as they settled in from camp to camp. It is depicted as free as flying dust, as treacherous as the desert at the roadsides and as promising as the land of the west. It is at this highway that Steinbeck rolls most of his radiant poetic flair.  John Steinbeck has smoothly used paradox in his materials, he has proved a master in dialogues and his metaphors and symbolisms elegantly put flesh between the story lines.oral substance.

0064407667|5.0|After reading many reader reviews on this site I am shocked at the problems some people have with the start to this great series.  Some complain about a lack of character development, but they fail to realize that this is one book in a series of 13.  One can't be expected to learn everything about the characters in one small part of the overall series.  Also, people are complaining about all of the definitions Snicket uses.  He seems to be making a point of what the orphans are going through.  He's treating you, the reader, like adults treat the children, that is, he's underestimating you're intelligence.  I think this gives great insight into the frustrating world that the orphans inhabit.  The website and overall design of the books are also great.  I also don't understand the comparison between these books and the Harry Potter series, other than the fact that they are very maturely written and have enough twists to keep you reading until you're finished.  The Series of Unfortuante Events doesn't have to be seen as filler between the Harry books.  They should be read and appreciated for what they are, and how they stand on their own.
B00005JHAB|1.0|Most possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. If only there were an option to give a film a negative rating. The character Mary is about as transparent as J-Hose awards show gowns... and it proves once and for all that she is as poor an actor as musician. Just pairing those words along side the Lopez name diminish the meaning of both. One thig I can say for the character Mary, an Itilian by the way, is that she had an uncanny ability to slip unto a latino accent with no warning whatsoever, or... could it be that Ms. lopez is unable to stay in character? I really feel sorry for Mr. McConaughy for being cast in such a loathsome excuse for a film. He did a spectacular job at creating some interest, but one man can't make up for a horrible script. If you plan on seeing/renting this film, do yourself a favor and pray that you are involved in a fatal accident while en-route to the theatre or rental shop.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|This movie itself deserves 5 stars but the dvd only deserves 4.  Only because I didn't really notice how it was digitally re-mastered, and the picture was only a little bit sharper.  You should definitely buy this movie nevertheless.  The convenient part of the dvd is that it has both the new dub (which really isn't as bad as people make it out to be) and it has the japanese with subtitles (watch it this way)  The ending is breathtaking, and every time I watch it I notice even more.  Just take notice that this isn't a movie for children.  Keep the kids out of the house, and don't think this movie [...] because you don't understand it.  Watch it a couple times, ask questions, and then decide.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is probably one of my most favorite driving in the car albums.  It's loud but melodic it has fast slow and mid tempos.  The guitars are blazing the drums are bashing the bass is booming .It's pure punk adrenaline.  Just try to go the speed limit and listen to this album at the same time.   Billie Joe is one of the best lyricists that I have ever listened to.  Believe it or not he is registered at Poetry.com and for goood reason.  He can write these kick arse anthems about boredom, the hometown, masturbation, break-ups, jealousy, all these things I/you could relate to.  And you thought poetry was just love and flowers!  This is punk no matter what the nay-sayers say.  This is a good jaded teenager type album but the music is happy upbeat catchy melodies that divert the meaning of the lyrics.  Listen to &quot;Having A Blast&quot; and try not to think of Columbine.  Just crank up this album, headbang if you want, shred the air guitar or even better play the invisible drums just don't run over any squirrels.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Had I know it was this good I would have brought it years ago.  I don't know about the concept album monoker that has been hung on it, except that David Bowie was Ziggy.  I find the songs to be very moving and heartfelt.  Mick Ronsons guitar just cut through me at the beginning of &quot;Moonlight Daydream&quot; and of course on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Suffragete City&quot;  EXCELLENT.
6305079811|4.0|Some will say it is a cheesy ripoff of Star Wars, but i disagree although it has a similar storyline, I would say that it is more or less a tribute to Sci-Fi. like the ''Empire Strikes Back'' the same year (1980), it was definately ahead of its time in special effects,G.Lucas himself said the 1930's series inspired him to create ''Star Wars'' which this pays tribute to. it will definately make you feel like a kid again, somthing the whole family could enjoy..
B00000JG41|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  though i should warn anyone who wants to take a listen of mr. bungle should know that they're not anything like radio. nothing like mtv, these guys are they're own thing.  I'd say that all these guys listened to a lot of jazz and frank zappa in they're day.  but those influences are way more apparant on disco volante. this one is way more listenable than disco, and much more immediately likeable.  The overall sound of this album is very melodic, hawaiian type sounds mixed with elements of jazz, death metal, lounge, and other genres i can't quite put my finger on.  I would say that this band and album are for people who are tired of hearing the same songs on the radio played over and over, only to have the same song be rehashed by another up and coming band whose smash hit too, will be played over and over.  These guys helped satisfy something in me that my previous music wasn't delivering.  this stuff is origional, it has personality and when you hear it, you can tell they don't really give a damn about what anyone is going to think.  when you listen to this, i suggest you listen to it in a nice clean room, by yourself or with the person you love, because i feel it is a very romantic sounding album.  especially songs like 'pink cigarette', 'retrovertigo', and 'the air-conditioned nightmare'. it's very atmospheric, has a lot of depth if you know what i mean. i think this album 'flows' very nicely too. it brings all it's influences together and it works surprisingly well, much more fluent than the self-titled. that one just kind of stopped abruptly and started playing something else, but this one just flows. it's beautiful.  that's how i would describe it. i find it a truly enjoyable listening experience.  all tracks on the album are more than worthy efforts, though the best ones are 'air-conditioned nightmare', 'goodbye sober day', and the song that origionally got me into these guys, 'golem ii: the bionic vapor boy'.  definitely check this thing out.
B000002WAD|5.0|Let me just say that Rick Rulez!      I love a lot of bands... The Cult, Sammy Haggar, Run DMC, Kenny G, etc... but Rick has always been my favorite. HE LIBERATES ME!<br />Thank you Rick.<br />Peace out,<br />Matt
B00005BJPO|3.0|My one complaint is the new english dubbing for the remastered Akira movie.  The voice actor who did Kaneda's voice for Akira is the same actor who did Vash the Stampede's voice in the Trigun Series.  I sat there trying to watch Akira and everytime that Kaneda would appear on screen all I saw was Vash the Stampede in my head.  While the voice fits Vash the Stampede character perfectly, it wasn't strong enough for the character of Kaneda. And Tetsuo's voice at times sounded like young Knives' voice who is also from the Trigun series.  Maybe I am being to picky.  I am a huge Trigun fan and I could not get the Trigun characters out of my mind while I watched Akira.  Next time I will have to watch the subtitled version.  Otherwise an intriging movie!
B0000027RL|5.0|All I got to say is that &quot;Ten&quot; is the best album I've ever heard and maybe will ever hear.  The lyrics are inspiring and make you think, the guitars are loud, and all that together is something special to listen to.  Keep it playing!

B00003CXAQ|5.0|Definately not \\"Raiders of the lost Ark\\" but good in its own way, set before \\"Raiders\\" this begins with Jones meeting with several chinese gangsters who want an antique that Jones has, he in turn wants a diamond worth millions, the tension is evident as Jones & the gangters try to out do each other, the pacing is fast as all hell breaks loose with Jones barely escaping with his life taking an unwilling Willie Scott with him, the film then progresses to its plot where Jones, his sidekick Short Round, & Willie Scott,the female lead that is quite opposite of Marion Ravenwood, embark on a quest to retrieve the Shankara Stones at the request of nearby villagers, once they reach their destination, all is not what it appears to be, they soon arrive at a palace that harbors a deep past that is soon evident as Jones begins searching in the deep corridors of the palace, what Jones & Co. discover is a ritual taking place that involves human sacrifice, the stones are the centerpiece for this ritual, while waiting for the right moment, Jones begins to retreive the stones but is soon captured along with Willie & Short Round, this is where the film turns into a rollercoaster ride as Jones & Co. make their escape, it is clear from the start that George Lucas & Steven Speilberg set out to outdo \\"Raiders\\" while being much darker at the same time, this one has a level of intensity that has been hard to do since, the first \\"Die Hard\\" comes close in comparison, the coal mining car chase is so tense, it has to be seen to be believed, the out-of-control water sequence is full of tension as well, not to mention the bridge sequence that leaves the viewer on edge as Jones & Co. are confronted by Mola Ram (the villian who is a high priest) Mola Ram is a villian with such imagination & an evil laugh to go with it, that one can't help but like him, despite having some gross-out humor, this is a fun film from start to finish, but should be viewed with caution in the presence of children.
B00004Z459|1.0|..linking park! the trendiest piece of (junk) to come around since the boybands!! these guys make you wonder if there isn't some big agency/production company thing that just slaps together four or five young, relatively good-looking men, tells them to spike their hair, grow goatees, get some 'rad' tattoos  and wear black stuff. then they are told, 'sound sensitive(crooning vocals, whiny 'woe is me' lyrical shtick)so the girls will like it, but not so wussy(that means you scream during the choruses) that guys won't.' now go make popmetal! if you get stuck, here's some korn and staind albums but add some techno bits so you don' sound like COMPLETE rehash.  these guys and this genre of music are the equivalent of boybands, blonde popstars and all that is trendy.  they are totally fake.  the guy has a decent enough voice when he sings, it actually sounds kind of nice, but it reminds me of savage garden.  when he screams he's not as whiny as fred durst, but his lyrics are. they've perfected the nice melodic distorted guitar picking during verse, get 'heavy' during chorus style of song-writing, which nirvana did very well. they are trying to act (....) in the words of pantera, 'you can't be something you're not.' anything but origional, just another fad that i hope will die soon, but not until i'm through having a good laugh at the people who call this metal.  if you like pop, pick this thing up, along with the other popmetal bands like disturbed, papa roach, drowning pool, crazy town, Godsmack even(though 'whatever' is a cool song). stuff like that. but if you like real music, go buy something good like radiohead, slayer, paul oakenfold, the new dimmu borgir. stuff that will actually expand your head.

Celine will always be my favourite SINGER YEP SHE WILL:) THE BEST SINGER IN THE WORLD! I have only 2 record's right now but ill totaly have more.
B00005K9LK|5.0|I have always loved Heavy Metal and Judas Priest is one of my favorites. Other than Winger and Warrant they are the best. Rob Halford is super-sexy, even sexier than Kip Winger. Sometimes I put on this album, bang my head against the refrigerator and &quot;Scream for Vengance&quot;, What a rush! Keep up the good work Rob! Did I mention that I think your sexy!
B000002UJQ|5.0|An excellent CD put together by Thom Yorke and company, this CD is a true mixture of The Bends and Kid A with belting guitars and harmonious synthesizers.  I do not feel like describing this CD in great detail, my suggestion to you is to JUST BUY IT (or burn it if you have a CD burner)!  You will be glad that you did.  Frankly, I do not think Eric Feckzo listened to this album (at least not carefully), the entire CD is definitely not mellow and slow as he mentions.  Just listen to Paranoid Android and Subterannean Homesick Alien, they all speed up and one point, Electioneering is also a somewhat fast song itself.  Well, I'm done with the details now it's your turn to listen to this wonderful creation of musical genius.
0553106635|5.0|Just finished the 3rd installment of Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series and I must say that it is a must.  I suppose if you looking into purchasing this book then you have already read the first two and thus dont need encouragement to undertake the reading of this vast novel.<br />I dont want to give anything away but the reason that Martin is so wonderful is that he spends so much time on character development yet isn't afraid to kill them off when the plot requires.  There is one particular point in the book where four of the main characters die (or do they) within about 100 pages of text.<br />I have e-mailed Mr. Martin and thanked him for the stories and characters and told him that I was going through withdrawl.  When he wrote back he said the true withdrawl wouldn't set in until I realized that the next book wouldn't be out until 2002, and he is right.<br />This book has only a few slow spots and you dont mind those so much because you know he will pick up the pace very shortly.  His characters are superb.  My favorites are Tyrion and Stannis.  He hasn't given away his plot so we are left hanging until the next book which is great.  I can wait for Jordan's next installment, but this one is going to be hard to wait for.<br />I would definitely try to collect the first editions of these books as they should definitely sit on your shelf as part of a true collection of fantasy.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - DONT MISS
B000006PYU|5.0|This has got to be one of the great all time blues CD's from a man who really know's the blues. A great tribute to America's bluesman Robert Johnson.<br />I had no idea 'Love in Vain' and 'Stop Breakin Down' were Robert Johnson compositions. The Stones haven't credited Johnson for these two songs which is sad. The just say 'trad. arrangment' or something like that.<br />To all lovers of Peter Green's music I say buy this CD. Peter bares his soul here.
B000051VWW|5.0|I purchased this CD months ago and just opened it tonight.  I shouldn't have waited so long, it's great.  I could listen to All About Our Love over and over again.  By Your Side is another favorite but all the songs are easy to take.  Order the CD and when it arrives kick everyone out of the house, pour yourself a Jack Daniels and sit back and enjoy.
B000002H1T|1.0|Ignore the people who call this commercial? Why? It is commercial dreck and shame on the Cars for making it. By this point the Cars were poising themselves to be multi-platinum superstars and they suceeded big time with thier music suffering. The first three releases (&quot;The Cars&quot;, &quot;Candy-O&quot; and &quot;Panorma&quot;)I would highly recommend to see what the Cars were all about. But hey, if you like over processed, slicker than oil, calculated, derivative, drab pop music, this release is for you.
B00005LB50|5.0|I just finished listening to the third CD of the set, and it is great listen too!  In a box set I look for a lot of extras and raw material, and this box set has it!  I feel the set is really for fans of the Buffalo Springfield.  If you're just a fan of Stills, Young or Furay, then you might not like it that much.  The set is evenly dispersed with contributions from the three and the band.  The full band version of &quot;Down Down Down&quot; is a superb example of Bruce Palmer's bass playing.  The only thing that confuses me about the set is the 4th CD, which is just their first two releases on one CD.  This would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that a lot of these same songs are on the other three CDs in the same version... but I still give it five stars... for what it's worth.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD is a compilation of songs with character.  They will uplift you, force you to smile and sing along.  Maybe dance too, if you can groove to folksy music.  Seeing the movie is not a requisite to enjoying this CD.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I'm a huge Blur fan.  That's what first lead me to this cd.  I've followed everything they've done, be it Graham Coxon's solo stuff, or Damon Albarn's soundtrack talents for &quot;Ravenous.&quot;<br />Then, the icing on the cake:  Kid Koala, turntablist extraordinaire.  If you are at all into underground (i.e., true) hip-hop, you've probably already come across Deltron 3030's release featuring Kid Koala and Del the Funky Homosapien, along with about 200 other guest appearances.  If not, check it out at once.  And for a TRUE showcase of Kid Koala's talents, check out his solo cd on the Ninja Tune record label, &quot;Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.&quot;  It is beyond awesome, and simply amazing.<br />This, giving its background, could not miss.  It doesn't.  From start to finish, it is incredible.  I remember first seeing the video for &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; on MTV2.  If the animation and humor of these guys don't get you, the music certainly will.  Tripped out music with cool, almost indifferent, vocals.  The beats, and samples are, as always with the Kid, without fault.<br />Definitely give this one a go.  And, as a special bonus, the cd comes as an enhanced cd, with some very cool animation, and even better wallpaper and screensaver additions.  With this cd, you will be given the key to Murdoc's Winnebago.  Next stop, figure out how to use it to get in.<br />Enjoy.
B000002MTU|4.0|The blues have always provided the backbone for much of the music that Eric Clapton has made in his career.  Despite that fact, he had never released a proper blues album in his solo works until 1994's From The Cradle.  The album contains sixteen blues numbers that Mr. Clapton faithfully and reverentially recorded adding his own special touches.  &quot;I'm Tore Down&quot; is a rollicking number with a quick and biting guitar line, &quot;Sinner's Prayer&quot; has a dark sound and &quot;Driftin'&quot; has shuffling riff.  The album's best song is the inspired &quot;Motherless Child&quot; that has a ringing guitar and perfectly captures the Delta essence of blues music.  Capitalizing on the success of Unplugged, this decidedly uncommercial album became the first, and so far, only album of his career to debut at number one.
B0000508U6|5.0|I don't watch TV or listen to radio anymore cuz it disgusts me....so, as a result, it's hard at times to keep up with what's new in music, but I dismiss most of it anyway.  I heard of this band by word of mouth, being asked if I had seen the video to \\"Yellow\\" & thinking 'if it's on eMpTV or VH1, it can't be all that great', but after hearing the song, I figured I could give the album a listen.  Like other reviewers pointed out, it kinda grows on ya, but once it does, yer in luv.  Some Radiohead & Dave Matthews Band references, but definitely not clones.  My fave tracks are definitely \\"Shiver\\", one of the 'rockier' songs on the album, & the piano part on \\"Trouble\\" will just make ya melt!!  Overall, it's mellow, but totally fits the mood throughout.  Get this instead of the new Radiohead!  cuz this album is soooo much more melodic.  If you like this, u might want to also check out Echo & the Bunnymen's new album \\"Flowers\\", which kinda fits the mellow rock tone of some new brit albums.  I think someone else mentioned the Bunnymen as being influences, or they heard influences in this album or something along those lines.  I can hear some references to those moody early 80's bands I luv so much (like Bunnymen & The Church to name a few), especially with the bending guitar tones.  I look forward to a 2nd album that's at least as good.
B000000W6X|5.0|Massive Attack coupled with the vocal stylings of Tracey Thorn make for an incredible combination, that is what you get in this CD. Every track on &quot;Protection&quot; is great and there is something for everyone: ballads, reggae, dance, and a great live performance at the end. Highly recommended.
B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou is a lot of entertainment packed into a couple hours.  Its humor makes you chuckle to yourself more than laugh out loud, but then the Coens don't appear to me to be trying to make you laugh out loud.  The acting by Clooney, Turturo, Nelson, Goodman, Durning, etc. is spot-on to the mood of the movie -- quirky but not at all absurd or overdone.  And the music is fantastic throughout the film, especially in Dolby Digital or DTS.<br />Buy this one, you'll want to watch it more than once.  It's wonderfully entertaining.
B000002MFE|5.0|MTV's Unplugged series started out as a curiosity to viewers who tuned in to see artists play their songs in acoustic versions.  Many artists rose to the challenge of unplugging and playing their songs in the barest of forms.  In alot of cases, the results were not only entertaining, but inventive and groundbreaking.  Eric Clapton's Unplugged appearance falls into that category.  Stripping away many songs to their core and reinterpreting old blues numbers, Mr. Clapton.  The most startling song is &quot;Layla&quot;.  The original is a classic rock staple, thanks in large part to one of the most memorable guitar solos and codas in rock history.  Stripped down to a shuffling blues riff, the song takes on a new meaning.  The original was about unrequited love and you could feel the singers pain through the music.  The new version is more of a man begging for a second chance.  The big hit from the album is the haunting and beautiful elegy to his son, &quot;Tears In Heaven&quot;.  The song became a huge hit peaking at number two and went on to win Grammies for Record &amp; Song of the Year.  Other standout tracks include &quot;Running On Faith&quot; that has some wicked dobro playing, a Layla and blues chestnut &quot;Nobody Knows You When You're Down &amp; Out&quot;, &quot;Malted Milk&quot;, &amp; &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot;.  The album became his first top ten hit since 1981's Another Ticket and his first number one album since 1974's 461 Ocean Boulevard in addition to &quot;Tears In Heaven's&quot; Grammies, it won Album of the Year.
B00005B4GU|1.0|BORING &amp; OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!  yes, I heard this album out of curiousity (didn't buy it obviously)...once...&amp; had no will to really hear it again.  I like Radiohead, don't get me wrong...but all this attention they've been getting since OK Computer is a bit confusing...if U ask me, their better material was BEFORE OK Computer!!  OK Computer was good, true, but I don't get the whole revelation of &quot;ohhhh, these critics say this band Radiohead is good, so I should buy this cd!!&quot;, &amp; the cd after, &amp; the cd afterwards...DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS!!!  listen &amp; think for yourself, people!!  If so many people hadn't given it raving reviews, I might have given it an extra star, but this is just too experimental for my tastes...they need to stick to their guitar roots like they did for their earlier albums.
0440224764|2.0|I agree with mike.sue -- bad, bad, BAD ending. Put me in a sad mood for days! I can't abide Grisham's view of human nature and so will also not be reading more of his works -- want my copy?
630575067X|3.0|I'm almost ashamed... I can't believe i gave anything with a Star Wars title 3 stars... Can i live with myself? Where's that bootleg copy?!?!<br />Ok with that said lets get on to the review.  The movie itself was a decent movie, but it didn't live up to the name of Star Wars.  The acting was pretty good, though Anakin couldn't have done a better job.  A few hard core Star Wars fans might notice every historical mistake made, such as the alterations in some peoples' ages and the C-3P0 problem... but other than that, no one else will notice.  The movie does more for the Star Wars fan than it does for the average movie goer.  Most Star Wars fans looked upon Phantom Menace as a menace, tarnishing the name of StarWars with the ever annoying Jar Jar Binks.  This character seems to be out of place, way out of line, and just unnecessary comic relief that was never needed in any of the other movies.<br />I wouldn't suggest this movie unless you are a Star Wars fan.  Though the soundtrack is good and the pod racing scene was great, there isn't much you can get out of the movie other than historical data on the Star Wars universe, and unless you're a fan, you probably don't care about the historical value.  If you saw it in the theaters and liked it enough to see it a second time, then you proably got everything you will out of it.  Renting it might not work for you, because the one great thing about it was it's Big Screen production, and a 45&quot; TV with stereo won't cut it (Though a theater system with a 16:9 super screen might fall just Shy of the Imax i saw it on).  Again, i would only suggest this movie to the fans.
B00004Y6NM|2.0|Behind The Sun was Eric Clapton's attempt to &quot;modernize&quot; his sound.  Calling on Phil Collins to produce, the album has a contemporary 80's feel, with a slick studio production that all but stifles his blues roots.  The album opens up with &quot;She's Waiting&quot; which is a very good song that is accentuated by the fife and drum coda.  But after that, the album falters with bland music including one of his all time worst songs, the calculating &quot;Forever Man&quot;.  The album is revived for a bit by the strong &quot;Just Like A Prisoner&quot; in which he lets loose on the guitar.  By associating with Mr. Collins, who was super hot at the time, Mr. Clapton assured himself of getting some airplay, but the collaboration fizzled in the quality end.
0790751305|5.0|&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is just what many harsh critics of this film ought to be. Certainly, &quot;Unforgiven&quot; didn't win &quot;Best Picture&quot; for nothing. This is the ultimate Western. Yet, in a sense it is not a Western at all... or at least not the Western we have come to know. It is dark, dusty, violent, and gloomy. It is not a film for kids, or for the weak of heart. What it is, is a film for those who appreciate plain, good cinema. Amazing!
6304539258|5.0|Of course you can!  It's Star Wars!  Everyone knows about it, the hype the hysteria, the people waiting in lines dressed like Jedi and Wookies to get in for the first viewing at 1am!  You gotta ask yourself, what kind of movie has ever generated that much fan addiction and widespread loyalty ESPECIALLY after all these years?  Well i can only think of maybe three... The three movies of the Trilogy that is.  It's always been Nose and Nose with StarTrek as far as Fan Hysteria has gone, but Star Wars always captured the crowds and brought in mega bucks.<br />Ok, the movie was released when?  1977?  Hey, that's old!  Heck yeah it's old.  I remember reading one review from some 10-year old who didn't quite understand why Star Wars was so popular.  Well it is true that the SFX in Episode 4 don't compare to modern day (eg. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Matrix)  But it was groundbreaking!  Kinda like what Sony and Square did with Final Fantasy, Lucas did with StarWars.  (To the 10 year old reviewer... It was a kid but it was over a bowl of cereal, no cookie... apple juice, maybe).  If you haven't seen this movie by now then where have you been?  I'm not blaming your but you've missed a few rungs on the ladder here... Star Wars bridged and advanced so far in its day that Movies went where they never had gone before (like the first Scifi to take place BEFORE the present)  You can't rate this movie thinking today, or comparing it's qualities against modern times... it's a CLASSIC and like any classic it's already been rated... why do you think the darn thing is still around?  You can't say it's better than this or worse than that because no duh.  Compare the suprise endings of the Original Planet of the Apes with The Sixth Sense... they were total shockers in their times but yes The Sixth Sense was better.  Movies have gotten better, more intelligent, more focused and with better effects.  Everything about Movies has come along way and advanced far beyond what they were that older movies aren't even remembered anymore.  So then how come there are some that are... Gone with the Wind... (the first use of a vulgar word) The Ten Commandments, Star Wars, heck i'm you have to think of what movies will become Classics out of the New Releases if any.  Matrix, more than likely, Sixth Sense, definitely, Green Mile, don't know quite yet, Titanic... already forgotten.  Star Wars... oh yeah.  It's still a household name after more than 20 years.<br />Think Democraticlly here... If this many people like it, have liked it or still do, there's gotta be something about it that's good... you'd think so right?  :-)
B00001U03Q|3.0|The Clapton Chronicles gathers together Eric Clapton's work from the mid 80's to the late 90's.  There are some stellar tracks on the album including &quot;Bad Love&quot;, &quot;Pretending&quot;, &quot;Tears In Heaven&quot;, the Unplugged version of &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;She's Waiting&quot;.  But most the album is comprised of the glossy 80's junk he did with Phil Collins including one of his all time worst songs, the insipid &quot;Forever Man&quot; and his easy listening hits like the Babyface collaboration &quot;Change The World&quot; and &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot;.
B00000BKE0|2.0|&quot;No Prayer for the dying&quot;, what can I say about it?, well, for me is a regular album, of course, it ins't as good as &quot;Powerslave&quot; or &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, but it's a Maiden CD anyway, &quot;Tailgunner&quot; and &quot;Bring your daughter to the slaughter&quot; are good songs, so, if you're a true fan this album can't miss in your collection!
B0000025GW|1.0|Bob Dylan - Slow Train Coming<br />Nothing new musically - your standard run-of the-mill, very simple, 80's pop-rock/blues fare.  In track one, &quot;master lyricist&quot; Dylan &quot;sings&quot; the following: You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy, You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy, You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray, You may call me anything but no matter what you say<br />You're gonna have to serve somebody  Who does he think he is? Ray Jay Johnson Jr.?<br />Dylan isn't much of a singer to begin with, but 22 seconds into track 3 he warbles a note so sour, that I cringed as if somebody scratched nails across a blackboard and nearly hit eject.  A few clunkers that ran from 1:54 to 1:58  had the same effect -- awful.  Dylan should stay away from ballads (that should be like a law or something). <br />Is track 5 a reworking of &quot;Cocaine&quot; by Clapton?  This album could use some -- the white powdery stuff, not Eric.<br />Track 9, another ballad? He'd get beers thrown at him on karaoke night in front of even the most talent-starved audiences.<br />If you're really after Christian music that's just an imitation of real rock and roll, just grab an album by Petra or Whiteheart or even Stryper.  If you are a Dylan fan, grab one of his good albums.  <br />Mediocre music, awful vocals.  Slightly above average &quot;Jesus-freak&quot; lyrics (for good Christian lyrics, check out John Michael Talbot or Keith Green).<br />1 star because it is Dylan.
B000002G8H|5.0|After his major comeback in 1974 with 461 Ocean Boulevard, Eric Clapton shied away from the mainstream with his next two releases. There's One In Every Crowd &amp; No Reason To Cry.  With Slowhand, he returned to the sounds that made 461 a hit.  On his first solo album, he had a major triumph with J.J. Cale's &quot;After Midnight&quot;.  He returns to the Cale catalog for another triumph, the searing &quot;Cocaine&quot;. The song has a propulsive riff and a ringing guitar solo.  On the flip side of that is &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; which is built around his waiting for his wife to get ready for a party.  The song is among the prettiest things he's ever done and it his easy picking of the guitar shows that subtle playing is just as powerful as in your face power chords.  &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot; has a country flavor and was a big hit becoming his second top ten single and peaking at number three.  The best song on the album is the lengthy &quot;The Core&quot;.  The song has some marvelous vocal interplay between Mr. Clapton and Marcy Levy and some stellar guitar work.  Slowhand was a return to the top ten for Mr. Clapton reaching number three in early 1978.
B000002BE9|5.0|sultry, moody and a bit dark, this CD will grow on you with each listen.  I love it!
B000001F26|5.0|Times Pieces is a collection of Eric Clapton's greatest hits from his 70's works.  It contains the essential songs from the era including the inimitable &quot;Layla&quot;, &quot;Cocaine&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, &quot;Promises&quot;, &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot; and &quot;I Shot The Sheriff&quot; as well as lesser known songs like his version of the old spiritual &quot;Swing Low Sweet Chariot&quot;.  An indispensable collection for any fan of Slowhand.
B00005B36H|5.0|To all the reviewers who are complaining because this cd &quot;Drags on&quot;, and is too boring, I ask you.. Did you complain in gladiator when people werent fighting? Were you bitching when they were setting up the rest of the movie? If so, go back and watch Nsync on TRL.  Tool's new album is trance like rock. And its great.  Friends who never have liked tool before, sat and I made them listen to this. They thought it was great.  Its not as agressive as any of Tool's other works, but if I wanted more like before I would have bought another copy of Aenema.  Tool has proven themselves to be great, without one bad album.  Let them take and transmutate your leaden grudges into gold. Sorry, couldnt resist.
B000002LN9|4.0|Every year Eric Clapton has a tradition of playing 24 shows at the Royal Albert Hall in London.  In 1991, he released this live album to document his most recent stand at the fabled venue.  The songs from the album include the expected superlative guitar play from Mr. Clapton as well as other guitar greats like the fabulous Robert Cray and Jimmie Vaughan.  The set list includes a nice variety of songs include old Cream war horses like &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; and the always amazing &quot;White Room&quot;, the Derek &amp; Dominoes' chestnut &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and new stuff from the time like the blazing &quot;Bad Love&quot; and the gentle &quot;Running On Faith&quot;.
B000002572|4.0|A little known guitar player named Tom Scholz revolutionizes the art of engineering and sound quality.  All 8 songs can still be heard in heavy rotation on the radio today.  It has sold over 15 million copies since it burst onto record shelves in 1976 with its awesome cover art.  What is this?  Why it's none other than Boston's mammoth self-titled debut, and they did all of the above with just this album.<br />Scholz was an MIT graduate in engineering who was also a studio perfectionist, and it shows since in the album booklet he tells you to stop reading and listen to how good the record sounds!  And man...does it sound great!  No need for remastering on this one.  And with his perfection, he has crafted the perfect album for sound scaping.<br />Besides the sound, everything else is good, too.  Brad Delp's soaring voice and high-pitched harmonies are truly from another world and Sib Hashian's drumming is solid (as well as his huge afro).  And the production and musicianship are great considering this was recorded in a basement and various studios.<br />There's no need in mentioning the songs, because there all so good and memorable, from the recognizable opening acoustic guitar lines of &quot;More Than a Feeling,&quot; to the progressive rock bombast of &quot;Foreplay/Long Time,&quot; to the beautiful &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot; (which features of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard).  Despite all this acclaim, I only give BOSTON 4 stars because some of these songs sound better individually on the radio than as the full record sometimes.  But I still have respect for it and it's most certainly a contender for a &quot;best album&quot; list.
B000002G8L|5.0|Eric Clapton periodically releases live albums and they show the reason why there are few guitarists that walk with him.  Sometimes on his studio albums, one loses sight of his extraordinary skills, but he continues to amaze in concert. The passages he reels off in songs like &quot;After Midnight&quot;, &quot;Cocaine&quot;, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;Setting Me Up&quot;, &quot;Blues Power&quot; and &quot;Rambling On My Mind&quot; are thick, meaty and full of passion and power.  Mr. Clapton scored a minor hit with the rollicking live version of Tulsa Time and the album peaked at number two for six weeks.
B00005JGAF|5.0|Like the Clash, the third time was the charm for the kings of Queens, who hotwired 1960s sincero-spunk (&quot;Locket Love,&quot; &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;) with 1970s chainsaw punk (which they singlehandedly invented on their debut and perfected on &quot;Leave Home&quot;), and somehow wound up in a dead heat with the Beach Boys for first place in the title bout for greatest surf combo ever (&quot;Rockaway Beach,&quot; &quot;Surfin' Bird&quot; and especially &quot;Sheena Is A Punk Rocker&quot;). In the process, the protoboyz from da 'hood absolutely shredded anything and everything gobbed up by London's Class of '77 (listen to any Damned records lately?), not to mention their CBGB's peers (the combined careers of Blondie, Television and Talking Heads weren't as influential as &quot;We're A Happy Family&quot;). Even the pinheads-in-straightjackets schtick (&quot;Cretin Hop,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be Well,&quot; &quot;Teenage Lobotomy&quot;) sounded fresh, frenetic, fun and especially funny, unlike &quot;I Don't Care,&quot; which reads like a suicide note written in her lipstick and left on the windowsill. The demo/outtake flotsam is better on the other reissues, but that's mostly because it's impossible to improve on perfection, crystallized in Tommy's four glorious every-drum-at-once beats that kickstart the last chorus of &quot;Rockaway Beach,&quot; which rivals the first three minutes of the Stones' &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knockin'?&quot; as the most astounding, gut-wrenching, giddy, grand and life-affirming rock and roll moment ever. Gabba gabba get it before it gets you.
B000002G8N|3.0|Eric Clapton started off the 80's with a middling effort, Another Ticket.  Mr. Clapton doesn't particularly inspired on the album as he runs through by the numbers songs like &quot;Black Rose&quot;, &quot;Blow Wind Blow&quot;, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;Rita Mae&quot; and the top ten single &quot;I Can't Stand It&quot;.  The album reached the top ten, but it would be his last for over ten years.
B00000K19E|1.0|This is one terrible movie. I forced myself to sit until the end just in case something happened, but it was painful and it was fruitless. Loaded with style, but beyond that only a dull, half-thought-out storyline and boring special effects. I met one aficionado of leather who liked the film, but otherwise don't waste your time.
B000002G8J|5.0|Backless is another melting pot of sounds from Eric Clapton.  He mixes in some straight blues with &quot;I'll Make Love To You Anytime&quot; and &quot;Roll It&quot;, the superb &quot;Watch Out For Lucy&quot; has a rockabilly feel, &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; is good old rock &amp; roll, &quot;Walk Out In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Early In The Morning&quot; has a subtle sound while the top ten single &quot;Promises&quot; and &quot;Golden Ring&quot; are ballads.  Stir them up and you have another Clapton classic.
B00003CX95|5.0|Definately the best movie ever....well, at the worst it is tied with &quot;The Patriot&quot;...need I say more?
B000002LJW|5.0|After releasing the two worst albums of his career, Behind The Sun &amp; August, Eric Clapton released one of the first box sets to capitalize on the new format known as compact disks, Crossroads.  The four cd set was a celebration of his career spanning his Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith, Derek &amp; the Dominoes and solo days.  Inspired by this past greatness, Mr. Clapton released his best album, Journeyman, in over a decade.  The songs have blues roots, but are spiced up enough to sound modern without the gloss.  &quot;Pretending&quot; has some great guitar riffs as does &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;No Alibis&quot; and &quot;Breaking Point&quot;.  &quot;Bad Love&quot; is a brilliant song and one of his best, with a stinging guitar solo and strong vocals.  &quot;Running On Faith&quot; is an absolutely gorgeous with a lilting dobro and a honey sweet vocal.  Journeyman reinvigorated Mr. Clapton's career and showed he wasn't a slave to the times.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The wonderful drama with just the right amount of comedy to keep you alert and captivated
B00004Y6NK|2.0|August again finds Eric Clapton teaming up with Phil Collins and much like Behind The Sun, the results are disappointing.  &quot;It's In The Way That You Use&quot; was featured in Martin Scorcese's The Color Of Money and is a solid song, but the album doesn't offer much else.  It is mostly made up of glossy songs with alot of synthesizers.  This makes Mr. Clapton sound like he is trying to catch up with trends instead of setting his own.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|The best word I've heard to describe Mark Knopfler's guitar-playing on this Dire Straits' debut is: finicky.  He is so precise and has such a light, airy touch to his solos, that sometimes I find myself pining for one hard sustained chord.  That being said, this is a wonderful CD.<br />I don't play the instrument, but I have a sense that Knopfler is a guitarist's guitarist.  And in this setting, his playing is clearly the raison d'etre for the band.  I've always found it ironic that the hit single here is &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, dedicated to a &quot;trumpet playing band&quot;, when there's nary a brass horn on this CD and Knopfler's solos are so riveting you can't possibly want to hear anything else for awhile.<br />I've heard enough Joe Satriani on the radio to know that a great guitar-playing doesn't necessarily equal great music.  Lucky for us, &quot;Dire Straits&quot; songwriting is more than competent, and presents a satisfying blend of tempos, alternatively jumpy or brooding; and Knopfler makes the most of his limited range as a singer.  <br />A solid first effort.
B00003CY3W|3.0|I really wanted to like Terry Zwigoff's &quot;Ghost World.&quot; And there is much to appreciate in the performance of Steve Buscemi. But unfortunately there is much to dislike especially the zombie-like performance of Thora Birch who was asked to play the role of Enid after Chritina Ricci turned it down. Birch plays Enid with the same notes that she played her role in &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The difference is that in AB she was a supporting player but in this film she is the lead. And a lead role requires variety and shading. By the end of the film Birch's never-ending bank stare is bewildering . On the plus side much of the script is smart and witty. But Don Roos did this sort of thing 100% better in &quot;The Opposite of Sex.&quot; And just imagine what Ricci could have done with the role of Enid.
0671045865|1.0|I borrowed this audiobook from a relative and found it to be so boring that I had to give it back without finishing the story.  From what I can tell, the plot consists of a mother, daughter, and son who fight constantly yet end up going on a hiking trip.  This trip is supposed to consist of some quality family time, but ends up in another mother/son fight.  In the middle of all the fighting, the daughter (Trisha) ends up stopping to go pee in the woods, which ends up with her getting seperated from her family. And the rest of the story is about her being scared and lost in the woods.  It just wasn't very interesting to hear about how scared she was and how she couldn't find her way back to her family. There wasn't a scary twist to it...just a girl lost in the woods.
0671027344|5.0|This book is so terrific.  I could not put it down, and read it in one night.  The main character Charlie is such a wonderful, honest, and articulate character.  Anyone can relate to him.  All the other characters were wonderful too, and I especially thought the themes of the story were important (i.e.homosexuality, physical and sexual abuse, drugs). My favorite part of the story was when Charlie, Patrick, and Sam go through the tunnel, and Charlie says that he feels &quot;infinite.&quot; I also enjoy entertaining the idea of writing a &quot;diary&quot; of letters annonymusly to someone who you don't know.  The Perks of Being A Wallflower is my new favorite book.
B000002B30|3.0|If you're looking for radio hits from Springsteen then you're halfway there with this CD. I say halfway because there are so many more songs that hopefully have been left off only in favor of a &quot;Greatest Hits volume 2&quot;.  &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot;, &quot;Promised Land&quot;, &quot;I'm Going Down&quot; and so many more have been excluded. The best way to assemble a Springsteen collection is to start with &quot;Born in the USA&quot;, then grab a copy of &quot;Born To Run&quot;, &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Nebraska&quot;.  Bruce is one artist whose career can't be summed up in a collection of singles.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I first caught a glimpse of A-Ha back in 85 in that classic bubble-gum pop video for Take On Me.  The first two albums were great, but since then A-Ha have been a bit hit and miss with the greater public (of which I'm one).  I'd picked up Memorial Beach for Move To Memphis thinking the rest might be in this style and been disappointed with the direction the band were going (although I have to say the music was not bad, just too mellow for me at the time).<br />This album really expands on that direction and enhances it.  I'd love A-ha to go back to doing fun, bouncy stuff, but I have to admit that this style suits them well.  There is no chance of rocking out with this album as all the songs are incredibly laid back and just flow gracefully into each other.  Understated keyboard work, lots of acoustic guitar and strong strings make a perfect mix.<br />Morten's voice just sounds so natural and the atmosphere created in combination with the music is pure tranquility.  This album is perfect for those late nights, a bottle of wine open, lights dimmed, windows open and just drift gently away.<br />Outstanding tracks : Summer Moved On, Velvet, I Won't Forget Her, Mary Ellen Makes The Moment Count (and all the rest).
B0000029D1|5.0|I've been drumming for eighteen years, but was introduced to jazz from a friend in 1986- Steps Ahead with Peter Erskine.  I've been sorta hooked since.  I'm kind of familiar with Cobham and know who he is, as well as Stanley Clarke.  I was given this CD by a bass player brother of mine in our praise and worship band at church.  The song 'Stratus' blew me away.  Cobham starts with a crazy, bizzare, technical, rudimental, freak out thing--then him and Clark start groovin' on a real heavy, straight forward fusion-funk feel that's out of this world.  The drum sound through the mix is astounding as well as everyone elses.  This musical masterpiece tells me that I must buy more Stanley Clarke stuff--especially with Cobham playing...  This would be a great album to listen to on a road trip with a friend who can't stand to listen to jazz.  They may change their mind with this one.  I think also, this one would be good for beginning musicians to go out of their way to get.  Mainstream always hides the best music.  But if you know where to look, you will find stuff like this from time to time.
B00004XOWM|1.0|well maybe not compeletly...i cant say that i didnt see this coming.  in the past limp has been one of my fav bands, with their combination of rap, nu metal, funk, hip hop etc...they were innovatords i guess...however their new album comes off s formulaic, recycled, and well like everything else.  I used to think that limp could only get better after their summer smash take a look around, but i was sorely disapointed...i had hoped it would be a while before they completely sold out for money.  the album is a rough ride, seeming to be sequenced bya three yr old.  musically, it can be either original and creative with great composition...or just some more hard rock guitars and and bass ripping off RATM.  if only wes borland could concentrate more on music than his (...) solo stuff and his lamer costumes we might have something wort listening to    at least for the musical element.  i know it would definetly not be for lyrics.  one often comes away scratching theeir head, or laughing at fred dursts lame atemtpts at \\"rap\\". (your not black, or eminem so get over it)  speaking of lyrics most of them either the f word repeated over and over (i have nothing against profanity but) or what sounds fred durst making sure you know how great he his...it gets very old.  the only elements clear in his lyrics are anger and a large ego.i do not mean thisw album is all bad...my generation is an okay song...if you can ignore the fact its a (...) attempt to make teens think their understood and thus buy the record...my way is also good musically...and surprisingly clear musically...althoug garunteed to get old fast..and take a look around...which seems to be left on to only further sell the record...i know it doesnt fit in here.  also the guest spots are also highlights althoug one wonders whay scott weiland would bother himself for such (junk).  overall the album is a good one maybe for moshing...although some songs are al little too mellow for that...and thats about all.
B0000029D1|5.0|This is some of the best music I have heard.  Cobham and Clarke rock!  Everybody played a part in this one.  There is not a weak link in this one.  The mix is great and loud.  The song 'Stratus' will rock your world!  This would be a good CD to play on a long road trip for one of your friends who hates jazz!  This album will produce within you an appreciation for a lot of years of practice and performance.  To you beginning musicians--- Don't quit!  Work hard and you can be at this level of playing.
0385335482|2.0|I read all of Helen Fieldings books in a matter of days and was in search of something of the same caliber.  Well, this is a very similar story but it is NOT the same caliber of writing.  I found the first 150 pgs of the book to be a little &quot;ho hum&quot; and frustrating.  For 150 pgs the book dwells on her addiction to shopping, but you know she has to overcome it - that's the whole point of the book, right?  So you read and wait - serious overkill detailing her addiction - and wait... Finally she hits bottom (3/4 of the way through the book), starts to pull it together, and love is added to the mix.  The love story comes too late and ends too abruptly.  The rest of the book's underweavings never come to a conclusion.  When I finally started liking the book - it was over.  I was left unsatisfied and wanting a complete conclusion.  Read Helen Fielding's books - enjoy Bridget Jones (or Cause Celeb for something different) and save your money on this one.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon was the first Pink Floyd album I heard, nearly 3 years ago, and it is problably their best.  I instantly was drawn in by the way the whole album sounded and felt.  This is the album that really shows how good music can sound with great production, and I have since purchased every album that the band has made, and loved every one of them.  Great stuff.  If you have never listened to Pink Floyd before, its a real treat, and this is the best place to start.
B00000J7S8|5.0|What a terrific CD! Classic songs like &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; and &quot;I Can't Give You Anything But Love&quot; sung with incredible rhythm and style by Diana Krall. If you don't look at the album cover and close your eyes, you'll think you are listening to a remastered jazz recording from decades ago. The trio instrumentation provides a perfect counterpoint to Krall's voice. I've listened to this CD over and over again, each time finding more to enjoy.
B00005K9OX|2.0|But that's not my complaint. John McTiernan's only film worth seeing is PREDATOR (1987). That Schwarzenegger film has action, suspense, humor, and intensity. Now why would I think that DIE HARD possesed the same qualities? Proves to be a major disappointment, and Willis should've used his sixth sense before signing on and reading the script. However, if you've never heard Reginald (\\"Family Matters\\")Vel Johnson curse, then you have got to see this [...]. Are there any good movies out there?
B000002GDJ|3.0|The Police at the time of Regatta de Blanc sound like a band that is rushing through a recording, throwing anything at the wall and recording whatever sticks. Sting is beginning his rapid development as a first-class songwriter (&quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, &quot;Bed's Too Big Without You&quot;), but there are still some clunkers here. &quot;It's Alright for You&quot;, (co-written by Copeland, I believe) has lyrics that sound like random words pulled from a rhyming dictionary newspaper: &quot;limp wrist, tight fist, contract, no twist, black dress, no mess, two-for-one no less&quot; (Huh?). And I like Copeland a lot. Probably one of the top five drummers in all of rock, but don't sing when you have Sting in your band, ok? He happens to have a pretty good voice and you should be behind the kit doing what you do quite brilliantly not writing crap like &quot;On Any Other Day&quot;. <br />Sting takes his turn churning the pabulum with the adolescent, self-pitying &quot;Does Everyone Stare&quot;... &quot;last of all I'm sorry 'cause you never asked for this / I can see I'm not your type and my shots will always miss&quot;. Oh, please. If you're 14 years old and have a crush on some girl in your class, songs like this will resonate. As for the rest of us, we'll have to settle for the occasional great tune (especially the group effort on &quot;Deathwish&quot;) where Andy Summers' atmospherics are fascinating. <br />In short: Unless you're a big fan you may want to pass on this. Everything else they recorded is much stronger.
B00004U30D|3.0|What are we (as an audience) supposed to make of a film that shows Spacey masturbating in the shower in the first five minutes? Obviously we are dealing with a perverted family, but we're also dealing with a very serious message that Ball (inadvertently?) stated. The things I saw in this movie reminds me of what I see (or hear about) in the real world. It suffers from cliches at times (can't Hollywood dock the &quot;f&quot; word?) and it is not for prudes, but this movie has a fine point even though watching it is difficult. Anyway, Spacey, Benning, and Bakula are peerless here. I am truthful with my MPAA reasons, so this movie is rated R for profanity, suggested sex, gore, violence, nudity, drug use, sex references, simulated sex, and mild adult situations. There is so much beauty in the world...
B00005BJPO|5.0|So Akira on DVD is finally here. And wow. Pioneer? kudos to you guys for an excellent restoration job, as well as alla round nice package for this SE. I love the tin, and the extras are very cool, although I had seen most of it before. However the movie is fantastic. Buy this and watch this excellent movie that flabergasted audiences 10 years ago and is back to show just how good the best really was. The story is a bit complicated at times, but dont despair, watch it again and then maybe if your still in doubt, you can look fro some info online to help mesh out the manga based story that is a bit much for only a 2 hour movie.<br />Anyway, if that mae sense to you, buy this DVD. Enjoy it and just think about 10 years from now you'll be able to play it again and again without worrying about holes like those of us who bought the VHS when it first came out.
B00000JGEF|5.0|While most films masquerade as suspense classics, PREDATOR is the only one that kept my riveted. I couldn't turn away, too much action, excitement, and suspense. Terrific in more way than one.
B000002OMN|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I must've heard &quot;I'd Do Anything For Love&quot; at least 100 times growing up and thought it was a great song; a long opus where a male singer describes with poetic similes his expecrience with love and this girl while he keeps coming back to the statement that he'd do anything for love except the negative aspects. Finally, at the very end, the girl speaks and eternal love is pledged. (You may interpret the song differently if you wish; one thing I like about it is how ambigous it is).<br />I loved that song, but I knew barely anything about it's singer: some big man named Meat Loaf who'd been in Rocky Horror and the more recent The Mighty. Then I heard &quot;Two Out of Three Ain't Bad&quot; on the radio one day and my love for Meat Loaf was heightend. In the time since, Bat Out of Hell became one of my favorite albums. All the same, I lusted for the Bat Out of Hell II album. I finally found it (in a shop in England for Christ's sake) and after hearing a first track I knew by heart, I entered its world. I stepped back into Hell.<br />What makes this album so great is that it manages to really feel like a sequel; all the epic musical greatness of its predecessor, which is one of the greatest albums of all time, by the way. Steinman's genius is shown in how he takes ignored views, coarse language, teenage crushes and situations, and even modern brand names, and fills these lyrics with music that comes from everywhere, using piano &amp; guitar to motorcycle sound effects. It's poetry coming from the backdoor of Hell.<br />Life is a Lemon...so true. And try getting It Just Won't Quit out of your head. The Wasted Youth monolouge is twisted humour of course, but it's the perfect intro into Everything Louder Than Everything Else, the ultimate teenage rebellion song. My one and only complaint is that Lost Boys and Golden Girls feels a little weak and the beautifully serious Objects in the Rear View Mirror would have made a better closer.<br />Critics attack this album 'cause it's over the top. They don't realize that's how most teens and Meat Loaf fans like their music. My love for &quot;Anything For Love&quot; has been increased even further. It is, after all, the longest pop song ever at 12 minutes (yeah, I know it's only that long 'cause of it's long musical interludes and constant repititions, but it's still a masterpiece). So here's to one of one of the few albums that is always great to listen to, that can truly create and image of its singer, and that truly IS art.<br />And remember, a wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age.
B0000028VT|5.0|Music Box is Mariah Carey's third album, and one of her best. Music Box is composed mainly of ballads, but don't let that scare you. There are uptempo songs like I've Been Thinking About You, Dreamlover and Now That I Know. And plus, the ballads are really spectacular. I have the import of Music Box which has the bside Everything Fades Away on it, which is a wonderful song that you can also find on the Hero single. Speaking of Hero, that wonderful motivational song is on here, one of her best songs of her career. The title track is a great song that should have been released. Never Forget You and Without You are wonderful ballads, where Mariah's beautiful voice cascades over the song beautifully. Anytime You Need A Friend is a wonderful, gospel influenced song. Overall though there are so many great songs here, some may find it boring but if you like her ballads you will LOVE this cd.
B00005LMWI|5.0|Florida-based power metal band Kamelot does it again with their epic &quot;Karma&quot;. This album shows a lot more energy and grinding guitar than The Fourth Legacy (another really good one), yet has some really nice ballads to go along with  also. The strongest track on the CD is probably &quot;Forever&quot;, along with the title track itself, but there's also 3 songs based on the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory, which generate quite a bit of interest. Overall, this album is a &quot;must have'.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Finally, we can get all the Beatles songs that we like on one CD.  I've always found that the Beatles were great songwriters but that all of their songs were hit-or-miss.  This album gathers up all the hits and delivers them in a neat package.  Get it!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Well, I have to admit that I am a bit biased because my favorite band is the Pumpkins, and because several of the other &quot;best albums ever made,&quot; in my eyes, are by the same band.  This album gave birth to the Pumpkins as we know them today with such hits as Today and Disarm.  There is a bit of everything on this CD, starting with the hard in Cherub Rock all the way to the other extreme in the melodic Mayonaise.  This is a fantastic CD!  A definite must-have for anyone's collection.
B0000028M7|5.0|1992's Dirt is Alice In Chain's masterpiece. It remains relevant and still packs an amazing punch nearly 10 years after its release. From Layne Staley's opening scream in \\"Them Bones\\" to the last dissonant chord of \\"Would?\\", the album never lets up on the intensity.<br />Jerry Cantrell is one of metal's greatest guitarists, equally at home grinding out riff-heavy tunes like \\"Rain When I Die\\" or adding shimmering acoustic chords to \\"Down In A Hole.\\" The middle third of the album (\\"Rooster,\\" \\"Junkhead,\\" and \\"Dirt\\") features some of Staley's most tortured vocals and some truly scary lyrics. There's a sense of doom present in just about every song, with images of death and addiction ever present. But there's also a sense of resiliency--while Stayley's demons might ultimately have gotten the better of him, you won't hear him giving up.<br />If you're an AIC fan, you already know what an impact this album makes. If you like brooding, intense, guitar heavy music but haven't heard this CD, do yourself a favor and buy it today. The imitators (Godsmack, anyone?) don't even come close to matching the glory of AIC at the top of their game.
B00005AQE8|5.0|although it's hard to say which CD is his best, i think this is tupac's best work, he rapped this album in a few weeks when he was &quot;fresh outta jail, out on bail.&quot;  what makes this CD great is you get to hear 2Pac's insights, visions, sorrow, pain, and struggles.  tracks such as life goes on, how do u want it, only god can judge me, all about u, 2 of amerikaz most wanted, and california love are the best tracks i think.  2Pac is still the realest rapper ever to live and with this CD, his messages and ideas remain loud and clear. unlike all these watered down hip hop lyrics that are played out and commercialized today, 2Pac's music was intended to not only entertain, but to communicate powerful ideas and provoke people to think and stand up for themselves. can't wait for 2Pac's other double album to drop in the fall. tupac shakur lives on!
068484267X|4.0|McCourt paints an outstanding picture of life in post-famine Ireland.  McCourt reveals the story of his own life growing up in poverty, with a drunken father, death, love, and a Catholic upbringing.  This books is filled with sadness but ends on a happy note.  A great book.
B000002GF8|4.0|Many artists that started as punks transformed into cleaner pop stars as the 80s dawned. Blondie, The Clash, The Go-Go's, and the Pretenders are just to name a few. The Police were the only band to follow this trend and stop when their fame went too big too fast. If you look at their past albums, they shift through styles, both succeeding and failing to register on the pop charts. With Synchronicity, however, the band's full fledged pop album, they got pop right where they wanted it, and still left room for whatever differently-influenced songs they could fit.<br />&quot;Synchronicity I&quot; is the powerful opener, like punk for geeks with its complex synth intro and fast, hard tempo. One of my favorites for its constant energy. &quot;Walking in Your Footsteps&quot; and &quot;Oh My God&quot; follow, their lyrics are the only thing keeping these songs from being throwaways, though their bass beats are almost irresistable to not skip. Next come the real throwaways if you're just looking for pop. &quot;Mother&quot; has a fantastic guitar solo in the middle while Copeland's delivery of the lyrics rock your senses into madness. &quot;Miss Gradenko&quot; is another track less likely to appeal to pop fanatics. It does, however, have a great rallying cry, &quot;Is anybody alive in here? Is anybody alive in here?&quot; if anything, more of a soundcheck song or stage filler to get the crowd revved up. On the album, though, it actually proves to be good filler as the next song is &quot;Synchronicity II.&quot; <br />Finally, the album starts to gain atmosphere as the story of a man slowly going insane is told. At the same time, a deep sea monster (Loch Ness, anyone?) readies to attack a nearby cottage. Jung's synchronicity theory is illustrated beautifully in the lyrics and hard drive of guitar. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; follows. If you have never heard of this song before, then you must be completely oblivious to the pop music radar. The most popular song of Sting's career, certainly the best song he's written on that album. &quot;King of Pain&quot; is also a beautiful atmospheric track, taking instances of different types of pain and combining it into one song. Powerful and dynamic, never given music video treatment, which is unfortunate. &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; is the last great Synchronicity single to top charts. Again, lyrics and music combine perfectly to form a great pop song. Then comes &quot;Tea in the Sahara.&quot; A little too atmospheric for pop, but folky enough to be appreciated by music-lovers. &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; is the last track, a funny song with good lyrical content if you ever wondered what it takes to be a murderer. Rather awkward end, but nice, nonetheless.<br />All these songs seperately do not hold a candle to the magic they are together as an album. Synchronicity showed great promise for the future of The Police, but as we all know, it was not meant to be. What a way to stop, right at the top. It's not Sgt. Pepper, but for its time and its timeless pop contributions, the album is vital toward any music lover's, and pop lover's music collection.
0375501851|5.0|I was about 1/2 way through &quot;White Teeth&quot; when I read some of the reviews posted here, and I thought, &quot;Did they read the same book I am enjoying so much?&quot;  I approached the ending with trepedation, wondering if I would be disappointed, as I was with the ending of &quot;Corelli's Mandolin,&quot; so good for the first 3/4, and then with such an abrupt ending.  But no!  The ending was perfect, all strands tied up, and all in character.  I highly recommend this marvelous tour de force to any readers with a sense of humor and of history.  To Zadie Smith, &quot;You go, girl!&quot; Can't wait to see what you come up with next.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I usually keep an itinerary to purchase CDs that appear on everyone's top 100 list. The Clash's London Calling came up one week, and it became my favorite album for a month. It's not an album of all punk, as I first thought. Instead it's actually a collection, like an outward observation, of different types of musical genres, all circling around the hoarse voice of Joe Strummer and the musical talent of The Clash.<br />They cycle through punk, pop, raggae, ska, rockabilly, hard rock, and other subgenres, making each song different from the next, while adding in Clash style to unify it all. Not one song can be agreed on as filler for this album, as it really depends on what type of music fan you are. At least one or two songs on this album can appeal to anyone, which is an incredible feat for a double album.<br />&quot;London Calling,&quot; &quot;Hateful&quot; and &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; demand your attenion with full instrumental arrangements and steady beats and may inspire you to set them on a repeated playlist.<br />&quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; and &quot;Clampdown&quot; will fulfill your hard rock desires, featuring heavy guitar and bombastic Strummer vocal.<br />&quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; and &quot;The Card Cheat&quot; are excellent pop songs (Card Cheat sounding more like a Bruce Springsteen direct rip) with &quot;Train in Vain&quot; finishing the album with its excellent pop sensibility.<br />Songs like &quot;Jimmy Jazz,&quot; &quot;Revolution Rock&quot; and &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; can be quick listens and skippable, but they're still catchy melodies, good enough to keep you listening.<br />Too many tracks to mention in one review without going endless, but in summary, The Clash really deserve the &quot;only band that matters&quot; credo (given to them by their record company) because they don't try too hard to stay punk like their earlier albums, but instead surrender to the atmospheres of other genres around them and make it accessible to all different types of people. Their later albums could never duplicate the magic of this one.<br />A terrific album for all-around music lovers. If you know any friends with really specific tastes, find their preferred genre in this album and entice them into hearing the entire thing. If they have interest from just one song from London Calling, chances are they will be able to savour the rest. It was voted Rolling Stone's best album of the 80's for a reason. Its musical diversity certainly has staying power with music lovers today.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|It's about time this came out on DVD, and this version does not dissapoint.  The new English dub is much better.  You'll find out just how much they changed the dialog in the old dub.  The new one is pretty close to a direct translation plus the names are pronounced correctly, the kids have kid voices this time and the cuss words are back!  Nothing dumber than a rated R movie with PG dialog.  They did it right this time.
B000024D4R|5.0|It's hard to call anything of Pink Floyd's underrated. The band has two entries in the 'Top 20 Best Selling Albums of All Time' list, matching the Eagles and the Beatles for two albums in the chart. Their best-known album, Dark Side of the Moon, spent 741 consecutive weeks (14+ years) in the Billboard 200 Album charts. Their devoted fan base includes millions. And that's not even half of their achievements. So to call anything of theirs underrated is rather unbelievable, but in the case of Animals, it's total truth.<br />For an opener, Pigs on the Wing (Part 1) is a rather fitting start. It's short, cynically romantic, and simple; just an acoustic guitar with vocals with an animal metaphor from the get-go.<br />Then comes Animals' most notable track, the seventeen minute 'Dogs.' Seventeen minutes is a rather long time on one subject, but in Pink Floyd style they make it count, with plenty of David Gilmour's wonderful guitar solos. For those who view rock and roll as guitar solo heaven, Gilmour is your god. Also add to the combination the lyrical genius that is Roger Waters. His imagery with the album-long metaphor of animals to humans is striking and fantastic. The dog in this song is a greedy businessman, who is always first to pick up stray meat, first to make a kill, etc. My favorite line is 'You have to keep trusted by the people that you lie to, so that when they turn their backs on you, you'll get the chance to put the knife in.' Even more incredible imagery fills the song as the lyrics describe the painful, lonely death of the dog, specifically from cancer.<br />Next on the album is 'Pigs (Three Different Ones).' Roger Waters' lyrics describe pigs as the overweight, overpowered authority of the 'farm.' This song spends more time criticizing authority figures like Mary Whitehouse (The Brit equivalent of Tipper Gore), than it does maintaining the pig metaphor. The song features plenty of grunts and voice box to decorate the song as it hops from one pig to another. You may have seen the South Park episode where Cartman tells his new fourth grade teacher 'ha ha charade you are, teach-a!' I say no more. Drummer Nick Mason keeps a great rhythm going through the slow track, certainly able to keep the beat.<br />The last opus of a song is the ten-minute rocker 'Sheep.' This is my favorite of the album. It features the trademark Pink Floyd 4/3 jumpy rock beat (as also heard in 'One of These Days' or 'Money'). Richard Wright gets his moment of shine with this song since his solos decorate much of the middle. Waters again delivers a powerful vocal as his lyrics describe the most submissive mammal, the sheep. They are pictured as mindless lemmings that do whatever they are told with no objections. They do rebel, however, as you can barely hear the satirical version of the 23rd Psalm, rewritten to include karate and meat grinders in the middle of the track. Do your research, it's funny. My favorite part of this song is the ending, the crushing guitar is as hard a rock as you're going to get out of Pink Floyd and its anthem-like tone will stay in your head long after the song ends.<br />The last track, Pigs on the Wing (Part 2) closes in its simplicity, ending what is a terrific album.<br />Apart from the music, the artwork of the cover is fantastic. That flying pig is actually an inflatable that was brought into the air above the power station. Its dream-like cloudy sky looks more like a painting, but ask cover artist Storm Thorgerson yourself and he'll tell you, it's photograph.<br />Just because you see two songs just over a minute and three songs averaging over ten, this does not mean the album is a messed up project or a throwaway. This album has such great consistency with defiant, symbolic lyrics, powerful guitar crush and Floyd cynicism. It was never appreciated when it was originally released, but it's totally worth reconsideration today.
B000058983|5.0|With any underground classic, it can be easy for fans to overstate the brilliance of an album. In the case of Forever Changes however, there can be no understatement: this is a brilliant album. It blends folk, nascent punk and heavy metal, baroque strings and flamenco all into a seamless whole. The obscure lyrics and odd rhythms and times take a while to get used to, but, as withy any great album, its worth infinitely more.
B0000027F3|5.0|I have read the reviews on this board, and I agree with every single one, except several that only rated it with four stars instead of five.  I could go into detail here and explain why it so deserves 5 stars, but many here have already done an excellent job reviewing it.  My additons would only be redundant.<br />I bought this album back in 1990 when it was first released. 11 years later and I still consider it is one of metal's all time champions.  <br />I have always liked Priest, and Rob Halford is one of them truly original singers that stands head and toes above all others, and as all metal fans know, there is lots of great metal vocalists out there.<br />I like most, if not all of JPs releases, but Painkiller has got to be arguably their crowning achievement, or magnum opus.  All previous releases have at least two really creative songs on them, but this album is simply KILLER from beginning to end.<br />I just played it in my car on the way to work this morning.  I hadn't heard it in about 16 months.  It sounded just as fresh today as it did 11 years ago. I had my stereo cranked as LOUD AS IT WOULD GO, and found myself speeding way beyond the speed limit, head banging,  and singing at the top of my lungs the best I could to Halford's scorching vocal passages.<br />Listening to this album VERY loud when in need for a metal fix, is just as satisfying as consuming a large, thick, New York strip, or T-bone steak with a tall, cold brew when you are two-days hungry.<br />SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!<br />Heavy Metal worshippers unite: THE PRIEST IS KING!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Its albums like this that let you know just how brilliant some music can be. They also let you know that even brilliant bands write bad songs.  On one hand we have &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, which could be the single best song they've written. A deceptively simple piano figure with a soaring melody, its a pinnacle achievement of Radiohead's gift for rendering emotion in sound. In fact, most of the best album tracks play off that same gift: the lo'fi doo-wop of &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot;, the '30s big band closer &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, and electronically orchestrated managerie of &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;. On the other hand we have songs like &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;, which is a brilliant exercise in studio technology that has no musical value whatsoever. Other problems include the completely inconsequential &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; and the horribly pointless instrumental &quot;Hunting Bears&quot;. Still, even the weaknesses in this album set it levels above most of whats being recorded today.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Its always been the common belief that music has unlimited potential. It can make you cry, rise you up, save your life, make you laugh. And we always believed that, in the end, music would save the world. Ok Computer is the result of four decades of hope, and four decades of being let down.   The album's second track, the multi-sectioned &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is confused, full of rage, but full of apathy, not sure which side it will take. That question is answered by the beautifully languid &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;(title's a nod to Dylan), with its longing for and hope of an escape. The plans made there are immediately rendered impossible by the  breathtakingly desperate &quot;Exit Music(For a Film)&quot;. By the time the arpeggios begin on &quot;Let Down&quot; you feel like you've been through something. Through the next track &quot;Karma Police&quot; to &quot;Lucky&quot; you fully explore the implications of those emotions. Finally, on &quot;The Tourist&quot;, the only conclusion that can be reached is: withdrawal.  Radiohead faces you with failure, and with helplessness, most uncomfortable emotions. But hidden inside all the tehcnology and the pain is a core distinctly human, and still perhaps with a hope of salvation.
B00005JIZA|5.0|This is absolutly my favorite CD that I've bought in a long time. My friend first introduced John Mayer to me last fall and ever since then I've been hooked on his music. I've passed word of him on to many other people and they all thank me for introducing them to it. Once you hear him for the first time you'll be dying for the CD. Room For Squares is really good... &quot;I like to think the best of me is still hiding up my sleeves...&quot;- No Such Thing
0515123447|5.0|...Hooray! A first class mystery! The plot is thrilling, but this is not to say it doesn't have its flaws: written in the first person, it sort of comes off as a daydream of Child's that made it to print.  Also, Reacher is a bit too much of a superman (what can't he do?).  Otherwise, the well-written, fast-paced, exciting novel is a surefire fun read.  Child gives action and a mystery that offers a lot to literature.
B000002J1Y|4.0|I didn't think that Yes' supra-complex, textured studio recordings preceding this live set would be translated effectively to the live setting. It's not perfect, but the inadequacies created by the limitations of playing live are part of Yessongs' charm. And while the songs are occasionally missing small ingredients that flesh them out so well on the studio versions, the band's heaving energy more than makes up for it. You can especially hear it in Jon Anderson's singing. His voice is often delicate on studio albums, but here he's surprisingly powerful, singing full-force over his equally lively buddies, who jam with fervor exploding from their instruments. And man, there are lots of jams! Songs are often extended by five minutes or so for soloing, and although many would find it tiring, I think the intensity makes it totally exciting.<br />The songs cover three of the band's best albums: The Yes Album, Fragile, and the progressive monster Close to the Edge. This is the best lineup the band had (Anderson, Howe, Wakeman, Squire, Bruford/White), all of whom clearly feel the deeply spiritual, stirring nature of their music. Their most recent studio album, Close to the Edge, is especially well-represented, which is a marvel given the complexity of the music. The 19-minute title track is as beautiful and moving as the studio rendition. \\"Siberian Khatru\\" has tenfold the zeal. Disappointingly, \\"And You and I\\" is notably weaker than the studio version because Howe uses an electric guitar throughout, not the acoustic, which [...takes] away some of the original's subtle textures and simple charm.<br />Perhaps the most exciting songs come from The Yes Album. \\"Perpetual Change\\" blasts off after a lengthy jam interlude in the middle, returning to the exciting verses and impelling on Squire's rumbling bass lines. Wakeman's solo on \\"Starship Trooper\\" is killer, and when Howe came in with his lead, the crowd must have been slain. Fragile too gets covered well. After a stunning excerpt from Wakeman's \\"The Wives of Henry VIII,\\" the band moves into a high-energy version of their biggest hit to that point, \\"Roundabout.\\" \\"Heart of the Sunrise,\\" with exciting drum & bass interplay and emotional vocals, makes for one of the best moments on the album.<br />Certainly the best live album from this era of progressive rock.rpt from Wakeman's \\"The Wives of Henry VIII,\\" the band moves into a high-energy version of their biggest hit to that point, \\"Roundabout.\\" \\"Heart of the Sunrise,\\" with exciting drum & bass interplay and emotional vocals, makes for one of the best moments on the album.<br />Certainly the best live album from this era of progressive rock.
B000002H2Z|5.0|I bought &quot;Head on the Door&quot; last month for Close to Me.  I listed to that song about 20 times and then listened to the whole CD...about 20 times, and it's still in my CD player.  The music is GREAT...and I'm not what you'd call a huge Cure fan!
B000002UAR|4.0|This is not the best of the Beatles but it is very good indeed. IF you are not familiar with the Beatle's don't get Revolver first. Start with &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; Revolver starts out with the excentric TAXMAN. this one is way overrated. Then the haunting ELEANOR RIGBY that makes me cry when i hear it the 2nd best on the album. Next is I'M ONLY SLEEPING a great one. John's voice is also very haunting. the third best. LOVE YOU TO follows, it sounds kinda oriental like WITHIN WITHOUT YOU on Sgt. Peppers. Then is HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE , the best on this album. It is at the same level as IMAGINE by John Lennon and that is a great feat. YELLOW SUBMARINE is next. what can i say about this one it is a classic. SHE SAID, SHE SAID follows. same rating as TAXMAN. Then there is GOOD DAY SUNSHINE, the third best tied with I'M ONLY SLEEPING. I love this song and the piano. very happy. After YOUR BIRD CAN SING there is no other songs worth my writing because they are just average beside FOR NO ONE<br />THANK YOU
0790729628|5.0|This is my favorite sci-fi movie.  It is self contained and doesnt sell out (unlike starwars).  It is never boring (unlike dune).  It ages well (unlike Logan's Run). It has just about everything you could want going for it: Interesting idea, cast, charachters, plot, action, etc.  If you havent seen it you owe it to yourself.  Only one word of caution, it is violent and probably should not be watched by young viewers.
B00005LB50|4.0|Buffalo Springfield is more of a legend than a band.  They belong to another era, a time when Neil Young and Steven Stills could be in the same band, before each went on to bigger and better things (although Stills seems to have peaked with &quot;Manassas&quot;).  The new Buffalo Springfield box set recounts it all: the legendary meeting between Stills/Furay and Young/Palmer on a crowded LA street, their residency at the Whisky A Go Go, the trials and tribulations of a rock and roll band that lasted just two years.<br />The four disc set finally does the band justice.  The Retrospective album that came out decades ago did a good job of capturing their hits, but the scores of unreleased treasures here show five musicians in search of something bigger.  One must remember that Buffalo Springfield only released three albums during their career (hey, lots of bands with more hype had careers about as long during this period: Cream, for instance, or Jimi Hendrix, and can anyone say &quot;Blind Faith&quot;?), and the extensive liner notes to this collection claim that the recording of their second album-Buffalo Springfield Again-was an effort akin to the Beatles' White Album, not a cohesive band at all, but one of three songwriters using the other guys in the band like session musicians.  Nonetheless, the results were remarkable.<br />I decided that the best way to listen to this set was to pop in Disc 4 first: a remix of Springfield's first two albums.  &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; is presented in Neil Young and Steven Stills' preferred mono mix, but the album was still recorded poorly, and on some cuts the band sounds a lot like the Monkees.  This is what I paid for?  However, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; is as progressive as its predecessor is flat.  That album opened up with the remarkable &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; and closed with &quot;Broken Arrow,&quot; still a great song decades later.  In between, there is &quot;Expecting to Fly,&quot; &quot;Bluebird,&quot; &quot;Sad Memory,&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman.&quot;<br />Still, the first three discs do a better job at presenting Buffalo Springfield.  Dozens of unreleased gems, including many solo acoustic recordings from Stills, Young, and Furay.  Disc 3 is especially full of acoustic offerings from Neil Young, who rightfully became the biggest thing to come out of this band.  His 30+ year career is justification alone for his genius, and here we have sparse versions of &quot;Round and Round&quot; (later to turn up on his first album with Crazy Horse), &quot;Old Laughing Lady,&quot; and &quot;Down, Down, Down,&quot; which would appear on the CSNY album, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.<br />If you are a fan of Neil Young, this box is for you; both adding to wealth of his career and showcasing the talents of a band he seems to have a love/hate relationship with.  This box set resurrects the brief careers of a great band.&quot;Sad Memory,&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman.&quot;<br />Still, the first three discs do a better job at presenting Buffalo Springfield.

0393038912|4.0|The 28 page annotated bibliography, alone, would make Professor Diamond's book worthy of the purchase price.<br />As an additional, priceless benefit he convincingly demonstrates for us the determining impacts of geography, environment, agriculture, epidemiology, and &quot;just-plain-dumb-luck&quot; upon history.  By doing so, he cuts through racist explanations of history, as cleanly as Alexander cut through the Gordian knot.<br />In Dr. Diamond's world, there is no such thing as manifest destiny.  There are only people who are more, or less, blessed and joined together by their common humanity.  That's an anthropology to which we can all subscribe!

B00005AFVR|5.0|Being a big boss fan, I was at the June 15th Concert at MSG (unfortunately not used for the concert nor CD).<br />This album highlights Bruce and Co. at their peak.  I had all the songs (except Mansion, which I have never particularly liked and is probably the one flaw on the album) on mp3 prior to hearing them live.  If you don;t have Land of Hope and Dreams and 41 shots, a must buy (although Further on up the Road, Another Thin Line, and Code of Silence could've been included as well, not to mention My City of Ruins).<br />Youngstown is revised and harsher than ever; Badlands has more energy to it than possible; The Born's rock and there are other classics revised.<br />Overall, tape the concert and get the CD and you will be update with the latest in the best of the E Streeters!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Just think about it.  30 years after the break up this CD enters the charts at #1 and remained there for 8 weeks keeping today's artist from getting to number one.  The only problem with this album is that there is just so much missing.  The Beatles are the only group where the public, and I mean everyone, new their names.  They are the only group to have so much material that wasn't number one but everyone knows the music.  You could make 3 more CD's of non &quot;number one&quot; songs and still have a greatest hits package.
0486414124|5.0|Jane Austen has created an immortal being in the heroine of the book: Catherine Morland. While at times Catherine is naive, her charming innocence and bright, engaging personality captures your affections. She is easy to sympathize with as she goes through a stay of 6 weeks in Bath, England, and as she is whisked away to an old abbey, the home of her new friend Eleanor Tilney, and also the home of the hero, Henry Tilney. Jane Austen has written a short novel that draws out your attention so you become completely involved with the characters and the plot. In my opinion, it is the best book by Jane Austen! I would highly recommend reading Northanger Abbey.
B00005BJPO|4.0|O.k. here goes nothing.I've seen Akira about eight years ago actually i bought it on VHS and as you know the quality gets degrated through time so i've prayed and prayed for it to come out on DVD...fast forward to somewhere around 6.?.01 i thought i was gona explode with joy when i heard that my prayers have been anwsered. Ofcourse i bought the special edition tin can(being a fanatic isn't easy.) Everything is awsom they totally went all out on restoring the movie to its original state. But here is where my fanatic mind has uncovered something strange. On the 2nd disc with all the special features there is a feature about the restoration process, they talk about removing dirt and these white spots which occur with time?(im not fully sure), well anyways they go on saying how they have removed all those white specks and dirt so that the movie is nice and smooth...WRONG!!!!!!!!! They missed some of those spots which kinda sucks because here i am dishing out cash for something that was supposed to be well perfected.b.s. i HOPE i'M not the only one who noticed this...the spots occur towards the end of chapter 17 right when they enter the sewers and also towards the end of the movie.please e-mail me if you see it or not.I will try and contact pioneer about this maybe i got the fluke dvd or something. Still a four out of five stars movie.( because of those damned spots)arggghhh...dammit.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is the best put together album ever. The ones that will follow will only be a cheap imitation of it. It has everything, creativity, music, art, etc... Just look at NSYC's Celebrity, it has the same cover concept as Sgt. Pepper. That's only one example. Billy Shears rules!!!
0446310786|5.0|This is one of the most popular books of the 20th century: it is in the top three. And with good reason, it is an excellent story, but it is a bit slow-paced. This book describes the trials and tribulations of a young Southern girl and her family during the middle of the century. It is told from the point of view of Jean Finch, whose father Atticus is representing a black man in a rape case. She is threatened and called names, just to name a few, but she never loses hope. It is one of those books that everybody can take something out of, it is an inspiring and invigorating book.
0060975768|5.0|I first heard about this book when reading Mel Gibson would star in a movie based upon it. I decided to read it and am very glad I did. The battle of the Ia Drang valley is told graphically and well. The heroism of the soldiers there is astonishing. Many soldiers in the battle were veterans of WWII and Korea and state in interviews that this battle was the most vicious fighting they had ever seen. <br />The battle scenes are retold by the soldiers who fought there, and as harrowing as these passages are, I was able to read them with fascination and admiration for the soldiers while not becoming overly emotional. But as some other reviewers have stated, the emotional part of the book is what happens to the families back home. It is reading through these heart-wrenching passages, that I too, broke down in tears reading about the feelings of loved ones who lost family members there.<br /> Lt Gen Moore and Joseph Galloway are to be commended for writing a wonderful book about some very brave soldiers who fought as valiantly in those few days in November of 1965 as any American soldiers have ever fought in any war in the service of their country. I salute them all.<br />The director of the upcoming movie has written an open letter to the men of the 7th Cav telling them he will respect their valor in his depiction of them. I hold him to his word. Many Hollywood movies have portrayed Vietnam soldiers in very demeaning or cynical ways. May this movie be a rare exception.
079213690X|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite movies. Mel Gibson does a spectacular impression of a Scottish warrior. The basic theme is one we can all relate to--freedom from an oppressive government. The battle scenes are realistic and very gory for those of you with bloodlust(You know who you are). Great story, wonderful cast, all the action you could ask for. The ending is heart-wrenching but at the same time leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction. This is definitely a movie you gotta buy. I have seen this movie many times but I still enjoy it each time.
B000002I2M|3.0|It was at this point in their studio-recording career that Doors' producer Paul Rothchild left the Doors to fend for themselves; he wasn't interested in any of the songs they were working on. And they went ahead and recorded anyway without Rothchild, with the help of engineer Bruce Botnick.<br />It seems to me that with the meticulous and tyrannical Rothchild out of the way, The Doors released the music that they really wanted to play (or that Morrison wanted to sing): a more blues-oriented sound. <br />The result is a mixture of the very best songs and the worst songs I've ever heard from The Doors. (Yes, I am a Doors fan, but I really could do without &quot;Been Down So Long&quot; and &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot; - sorry, but it just doesn't work for me as well as &quot;Back Door Man&quot; did from their debut album.)<br />Side One: &quot;The Changeling&quot; is a good, upbeat, and loud song that gets the album going and then it moves on to another upbeat tune, &quot;Love Her Madly&quot; which became a hit. Morrison belts out &quot;Been Down So Long&quot;, sounding like he's forcing himself to sing. &quot;Cars Hiss By My Window&quot; is such a boring sleeper, I can't believe they released it on an album. Then comes the notorious &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, now this is a GREAT song - with Manzarek's unmistakable keyboard playing, thrashing away on his piano solo; Krieger sounding superb with his guitar solo, and Densmore's drumming - now this is more like it! It's one of my all-time fav's.<br />Side Two: &quot;L'America&quot; - what is this song about? It's just too weird for me; it starts out slowly, then picks up, and then it just ends with a crunch. Not too interesting. &quot;Hyacinth House&quot; is a slow, sweet song with Morrison's portent lines &quot;I need a brand new friend who doesn't bother me&quot; - very sad, but a good tune nonetheless. Then another sleeper, &quot;Crawling King Snake.&quot; &quot;The WASP&quot; isn't really a song, with Morrison talkingthrough the lyrics rather than singing, and the band plays funky kinda sounding music to it. It all ends with the epic, the masterpiece, the classic, &quot;Riders On The Storm.&quot; It is a haunting song that begins with thunder clapping against Ray's tinkling piano-playing, sounding like raindrops (very effective) with Densmore's drumming that reminds me at once of Native American music. Morrison's singing is haunting as well. Just a beautiful song. <br />Throughout it all, Jim Morrison sings in a very low voice, almost baritone. You can tell his voice has lost it by this time: just compare his singing from the debut album to this one and you can instantly tell the difference. Nevertheless, it hasn't lost all its charm, judging from &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and &quot;Riders On The Storm.&quot;<br />Overall, I am ambivalent: the very best songs and the worst.<br />But judge for yourself - get it, and listen! You might enjoy it all!
B000007WNN|5.0|This is it.  When the little green man lands on earth and comes up to me and says, &quot;I want to rock,&quot; this is the album I'm going to hand to him.  If I have to be stuck on a desert island for 10 years, I want this album, something to play it on, and a guitar to rock along with it.  It got stuck in my car's tape player (a red '65 Pontiac GTO) for 3 years when I was a teenager, and i didn't mind.  I just played it over and over again.  It never got old.  It never went stale.  It continued to rock me all through high school.  Ian and Billy and that crazy drummer dude rock perpetually, from the opening chords of the romantic &quot;Wild Flower,&quot; to the single smash party tune &quot;Li'l Devil,&quot; to the cynical and so-necessary &quot;Love Removal Machine,&quot; to the Robert Johnson themed &quot;King Contrary Man,&quot; to the awesome guitar riff of &quot;Bad Fun,&quot; to the very last dirty ugly nasty cranking power chord of &quot;Memphis Hip Shake,&quot; this album will rock your world, then burn it down, build it up again, and rock you some more.
6303182577|3.0|For an historic event as Woodstock, the concert footage is lousy; why didn't they show the entire songs on this film instead of cutting them off or just showing shots of artists on the stage? Just take a look at the performances of The Who, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane for example. Instead, entire footage is shown of John Sebastian and Sha Na Na (ugh!).  <br /> You see a lot of how the stage was built and people trickling in before the event started, which is fine, but equal time should have been devoted to the important and big artists. What's more, there is no footage of The Greatful Dead, The Band, The Allman Brothers Band, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and others.<br />Furthermore, the interview of the young blonde couple was overdone; too much time wasted on them. It is obvious those two just jumped on the bandwagon of the hippie movement. Also, wasted time was spent on the young dark-haried girl in the plaid shirt working in some booth - who cares?<br />However, I like that they showed interviews of the people who lived in the area - what they thought of the event (positive and negative responses shown equally)and the kids, as well as Yasgur himself. This really captured the mood and mentality of the time (even if it was only a small part of New York out of the whole country). The entire film captured the essence of 60's. But the concert itself, well . . . the footage was just terrible and disappointing. There just should have been MORE footage of MORE artists performing ENTIRE songs, not cut up or cut off. (I know, I know . . . if entire footage was shown of ALL the artists that appeared at Woodstock, it probably would have been a six hour film, but still. . ) <br />The Hendrix performance is classic, as well as Santana, Joan Baez, and Joe Cocker, but I only wish I could have seen Janis Joplin sing and many others who were there but not shown in this film.
0064407667|3.0|Lemony Snicket, whoever he is, has written some darn funny stuff here in this series.<br />Before I praise, though, I'm going to complain.  The plot is reasonably predictable, and the characters are one-dimensional.  These books, unlike the Harry Potter series, only need to be read once through and you've got it.  They are written to be strictly episodic, with no carry-over from one book to the next of anything but the basic plot device and the 6 main characters (Violet, Klaus, Sunny, Mr. Poe, Olaf, and Olaf's minions).  A re-read of the first after finishing the first four, as I did last night, revealed no new information.<br />At the same time, the books are tremendously funny for a once-through read, and I will probably pick them up again every year or two and give them a look.  I also look forward to sharing them with nieces and nephews, as amusing read-aloud chapter books.  Sunny adds a highly comic note with her interpreted shreikings, and the narrator (presumably Snicket himself) provides frequent lessons in idiom and general vocabulary.  If I were between 8 and 10 or 11, I could picture reading these stories again and again.<br />In spite of the series' relative weaknesses, I continue to buy new books.  It's become an addiction - the cost is well worth it for a few hours amusement.
B00005LB9O|5.0|&quot;The Invisible Band&quot; was the first Travis CD I bought, and it is the reason I am now in love with the band.  They provide a fresh new sound that the music world has been waiting for.  Though their songs aren't as fast moving or energetic as their previous work, it is still wonderful to sit back and enjoy thier unique and satisfying sound.  The best songs would have to be &quot;Sing&quot;, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;, and &quot;Afterglow&quot;.  So if you're looking for hard core rock, or slow and mellow sappy stuff, this isn't for you.  But if you want good music that you can use to drown your problems and worries in, this is the perfect choice.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|OK so the earlier reviewer who complained about this not being as good as the movie cuts didn't listen close enough to the film. ALL the songs on this CD are in the movie the only difference is that some songs only have a small portion of their song in the film. It is great to hear the whole song. They also complained about the Ewan/Nicole love medly being not from the film...WRONG! IF it isn't from the film it sounds like it is and I have seen this film more than once. I do however hope they do a second CD with the all the songs they didn't put on the first CD like the Like a Virgin rendition and others. This is an amazing CD and I have played it over and over. So if you loved the movie, buy this!!!!

B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator has all the makings of an extraordinarily entertaining film: intense action, thrilling sound track, solid acting, and, of course, Russell Crowe.  Ridley Scott put together an awe-inspiring film of epic proportions.  The recreated Rome is stunning, especially the Coliseum.  If there is a downside to this movie, its that the action sequences are just too exciting, leaving the audience a little bored with the dramatic aspects of the film.  But no worries; there is always an action sequence lurking around the corner.<br />Russell Crowe puts in a great performance, and he handles the action sequence with the same ease as he handles the dramatic sequences (Anyone who's seen &quot;The Insider&quot; knows this man can act).  Lesser-knowns Connie Nelson and Joaquin Phoenix put in solid performances as well.  Joaquin Phoenix seems especially well suited as the evil emperor Commodus.  <br />Historians are bound to have problems with the inaccuracies of this film, but &quot;Gladiator&quot; isn't meant to be a lesson in history.  It's meant to excite, and it does that extremely well.  <br />The DVD edition of the film is exceptionally well done, featuring a documentary of the history of the gladiators (that's where you can get your lesson in history), and a great assortment of parts that were cut from the film with director commentary.  If you're looking for a great film to add to your DVD collection, you can't go wrong with &quot;Gladiator.&quot;
B000059QY2|4.0|This is the only version I've ever seen of a movie version of Rigoletto and certainly one for Pavarotti fans.  Since I'm a Domingo fan, I rarely appreciate Pav in an opera performance because he just stands and mugs and is incapable of acting and signing at the same time!  However, that being said, this is one of the best performances of Pav on video, the production is traditional (which I like), costumes fine and the rest of the cast is credible.  More importantly, if you want a Rigoletto, this is probably the best video version available.  I can't stand Italian opera in English! It's the only one in my collection as I haven't found a better one yet. I've seen it on stage many times, like it, and enjoy watching this version at least once a year.  I recommend buying as there are few available and this movie is certainly is worth the asking price.
1878574590|5.0|Based on the excellent reviews posted here, I picked up Frank Miller's Sin City and yes I am pleased if not completly amazed!  Though the plot and stroyline may be simple, it's the way Miller weaved the web that makes this one so great.  The difference between Sin City as opposed to say Marvel or DC comics is the fact that the characters you fall in love with as the story unfolds die soon afterwards, making it a really difficult book to get through.  I guess it was Marv's persistence and unquenchable thirst for revenge on those who had done him wrong that made me continue reading.  Sin City is a dark place, a place of despair where there little hope yet no not no hope, as you'll soon find out.  It took me some time to get used to the art but once I did, it seemed only fitting that this dark tale be done with alot of emphasis on the black rather than the white heh heh.  After reading this one, I think I'll pick up another one by Miller, I only hope I know what I'm getting myself into...

B000002IWH|5.0|Why do so many many people rave on and on about how good this soundtrack is?  Because of the excellent songs and the amazing variety of talent.  Heck you go from moshing with Pantera to falling asleep with Jane Siberry, add in my favorite Cure song (Burn) sprinkle a dab of violent Femmes (what a great song!), too many great songs to name 'em all.  Listen there's at least something for every rock fan here and you'll discover some great music by bands you've probably never heard of before, for example: For Love not Lisa's Slip Slide Melting, you have got to hear it.  So take my advice get this one now, perfect for any day of the week, rain or shine.
B000003TAR|5.0|Man...everytime I listen to this albumn, I want to bawl...not necessarily because it is sad, but because of the shear amount of emotions and feelings crunched into it. It is such a tragedy to think about where Nirvana would be now if they were still around...this albumn clearly demonstrated the growing genious of Nirvana...I like a lot of bands, some more than Nirvana, but there are very few albumns that I like every song, and In Utero is one of them. &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; is a great beginning song, with a great opening line &quot;Teenage angst has paid off well..now I'm bored and old&quot;  Kurt's frustration with fame is definitely noticeable.  The albumn continues with &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;, a song going back to Nirvana's earlier punk sounds.  &quot;Heart-shaped Box&quot; is simply great, along with &quot;Rape Me&quot;, &quot;Frances Farmer&quot;, etc.  This albumn has a great variety of sounds, and yet they all fit Nirvana.  All of the songs are sad, but the two that affect me the most are &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot;  If you have a heart at all, how can you not hear the sadness and desperation that Kurt is radiating???  I don't know ::shiver::  all I can say, if you want to know what was at the heart and soul of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, listen to In Utero....you will never be the same...We miss you deeply, Kurt!!!
0425180638|4.0|Despite having never read any previous stories in Patricia Cornwells Kay Scarpetta series, I was in the mood for a good old-fashioned best-seller type of murder mystery and decided to give The Last Precinct a try. The promise of a good mystery supported with fascinating forensic science was too good to pass up. <br />Being unfamiliar with the previous adventures of Ms. Scarpetta, I had some trouble following the story at the beginning. Undoubtedly, things wouldve come together faster had I already been familiar with characters such as the grotesquely disfigured wolfman-like murderer Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, Diane Bray (one of Chandonnes recent victims), and Anna (Scarpettas trusted old friend). However, a little perseverance on my part paid off and I was able to quickly become engrossed in the story. <br />It starts with Dr. Scarpetta, chief medical examiner of Virginia, having just survived a horrifying attack by Chandonne. From there, Scarpetta investigates other seemingly unrelated murders and finds herself all too closely involved in one of them. Like all good murder mysteries, the heroine must figure out which of her associates she can trust to help her solve the mystery and escape danger and which she cannot. Although the formula may be familiar, Cornwells ability to hold the readers attention throughout (especially by the use of graphic autopsy details) makes it an exciting read.<br />Having gotten completely caught up in the story, I anxiously awaited the end so all of my questions could be answered and I could relax again. Of course, I shouldve known better than to expect a nice neat ending in the 11th installment of such a popular series. Some of the questions were answered but answers to plenty of others will apparently have to wait for the next installment.<br />All in all, The Last Precinct is fast-paced and enjoyable, even for Scarpetta newbies.
B00005B6N8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is certainly the best sci-fi movie to come out in years.  The story, the plot, and the actors are all strong.  The setting and the cinematography add to the overall effect.  There's nothing predictable about this movie from the very beginning.  There's no telling who will live or die.  Therefore, I will reveal none of the plot.  This is a great movie.  I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi or scary movies.  I loaned the video to my sister, a movie buff who has seen everything.  She liked it so much that she's watched it at least five times without finding a flaw.  Before concluding, I must say that I fell slightly in love with Vin Diesel's character in this film.  He was so sexy.
B00005BJPO|5.0|If you have never seen this Film then shame on you. This IS the Film that set off the revoulution in International Animation. Superb translation from the comic, Exquisite Cell Animation , Fast past futuristic action that only the japanese seem to have perfected. I have waited Long enough for this film to be put on DVD in america. and they have actually done a great job putting this limited tin edition together, the bonus material is some what mind boggaling with over 4,500 stills of production materials and the like, Overall a great job for an Animation Classic. Please IF you can Find One BUY IT. you wont be dissapointed.
B00003ZKRM|5.0|Besides being a superb interpreter of Delius, Elgar and Vaughan Williams Barbirolli shows himself in this set to be a most worthy Sibelian. Some may complain that his tempi are slow at times but Barbirolli never fails to make these symphonies interesting and often  gloriously inspiring. A big plus is the crystal clear sound; you can really hear those woodwinds (so important in Sibelius) and what an impact those cellos make at the beginning of the bleak and somber 4th symphony. There is also a generous allotment of some of the shorter pieces. Whether this is a top choice will depend on the listener but I think it holds its own against some of the top choices out there including Davis--Boston Symphony (Philips Duo) and Ashkenazy--Philharmonia (London).
6305657939|4.0|This movie made me appreciate that a woman can be darn hot after 40.  Russo could be the role model of what every gal out there should aspire to be - she's smart, witty, and ambitious.  She also has a better body than some chicks half her age.  Way to go, Rene!!
0385501560|5.0|but it's the first one that comes to mind.<br />I've read all of Chuck Palahnuik's novels, and I eagerly awaited _Choke_.  I wasn't disappointed.  _Choke_ is the story of Victor Mancini, a sex addict who stages chokings in order to milk his saviors of enough cash to pay his mother's medical bills.  But is Victor himself a savior?  All of Palahnuik's novels deal with the fact that our current society has sunk so far into absurdity that we need some sort of savior to shake us up and see what we're doing to ourselves, but the question remains -- does anyone have what it takes to be that savior?<br />I can't help comparing this novel to _Survivor_, which is still my favorite Palahnuik novel, and, as an earlier reviewer mentions, the best way to review any Palahnuik novel is to compare it to his other novels.  _Survivor_  has a bit more of an edge to it than _Choke_ does.  Still, any Palahnuik novel is definitely worth reading, because there are no bad Palahnuik novels.
B00000ILDF|5.0|Alien 3 is maliciously underrated, contains heavy melodramatic content, and digs the deepest of the four Alien films. Alien 3 could best be described as a science fiction tragedy. It's dark, dreary, offbeat, and I love it.<br />Alien 3 takes place two years where Aliens left off. Ellen Ripley and her friends made in Aliens (Hicks, the only surviving marine, Newt, the only surviving colonist, and Bishop, an android) are floating through space in a military spacecraft, when an &quot;electrical disturbance&quot; makes the four survivors shoot out in an escape hatch and crash land on Fiorina 161, a bleak wasteland inhabited by former inmates pf the planet's maximum security prison.<br />The ship is found, with everyone dead except for Ripley. Ripley, after shaving her head due to head lice, begins to think that there was an alien onboard her ship. There's a scene where an autopsy of Newt is performed, which, despite many misinterpretations, is in no way meant to be masochistic.<br />There's also a new breed of alien in this film. An alien face hugger snatches onto the face of a dog, causing the canine DNA to create a faster, sleaker, better alien. Ripley's fears of an alien aboard her craft are confirmed when ex-cons begin to be picked off by this four-legged beast. Soon she discovers that there are not one but TWO aliens amongst them. One of them is a queen... that is inside of her.<br />Alien 3 was the end of a legend, before movies that took themselves seriously became extinct. The ending is very powerful, even after it was mangled by the whole cloning thing in the unneeded Alien Resurrection. Alien 3 is a brilliant edition to the Alien saga, and in my opinion, the second best, after 1986's Aliens.
0375420525|5.0|On the surface, the book is an academic study of _The Navidson Chronicle_ -- a film about a house that's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside --  written by the mysterious Zampano and with an introduction and footnotes by Johnny Truant.  All too quickly, however, Johnny's footnotes begin to tell their own story of parnoia and fear.  The story of _The Navidson Chronicle_ itself is intriguing and creepy.  Even though the action is dictated and analyzed by Zampano, there's still a great deal of suspense and tension that comes through to the reader. For example, in the section entitled &quot;Tom's Story,&quot; Zampano describes a scene in which Navidson's brother Tom is left alone in a section of the house.  Tom's fear is so palpable, that even though the events are filtered through Zampano's narrative, I got goosebumps.<br />Another of my favorite parts in the novel is the section entitled &quot;What Some Have Thought,&quot; wherein Navidsons's girlfriend asks several celebrities what they think of _The Navidson Chronicle_.  Not only do these segments show Danielewski's great sense of humor, they showcase his ability to take on specific, unique narrative voices.  When he takes on the voices of Camille Paglia, Harold Bloom, Anne Rice, and Stephen King, he completely captures their narrative styles to great comic effect.<br />One of my favorite things about this novel is that even though I read it over a year ago, I'm still thinking about it.  Is it all in Johnny's head?  Or is it one of his mother's delusions?  Or could it all be Zampano himself?  Read it and decide for yourself!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is, by far, bar none the best CD I have ever listened to. Ever. I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on tickets for one of the 4 US shows before they took off to Europe to tour (I was at Detriot), and to say the least: Wow. I have been a Tool fan for about 4 years now, and must say that I think this release easily dwarfs any other &quot;rock&quot; albulm,... that's if you can group Staind, Slipknot, Papa Roach, or any other crappy/interchangable anger/depression band in the same catergory as Tool. If Lateralus is opening a wave for the new future of rock and roll, then Im in. From the first track, being the Grudge, you can feel how much energy this albulm is going to have (i mean, there is a 31 second scream in the song, 31!), yet after the song, it slows down quite a bit, only to be picked up again 3 minutes later. Thats when i realized I wasn't partitioning the album into songs anymore, but into time segements, or movements. Its nuts, and I love it. This is the only CD I have listened to everyday at least once since i got it... and that was a while ago. Anyways, I have done enough praising of my gods of music.  Learn to swim, Mike
B000056K04|5.0|this is a great cd, just beautiful!!! Angel is a great song, and what about the others like Space in between, everyday. a great cd, if you don't have you gotta buy it
B00003CXRP|5.0|I'M A FAN OF BOTH HELEN HUNT, AND TOM HANKS, THEY WERE GREAT, REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE, ALTHOUGH THE ENDING WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE, I THOUGHT ALSO THERE BE MORE SCENES WITH HELEN LOOKING FOR HER LOST LOVE. BUT I'D RENT IT AGAIN, IT WAS ONE OF A FEW MOVIES THAT DON'T DWELL ON [...]...BONNIE
0793518326|4.0|While I really like the content, it's quite apparent that the book needs to be bigger, i.e., larger page size.  In order to fit everything (vocal, piano, guitar tab for three guitars etc.)on one 8x11 page, the guitar tab is bordering on microscopic.  I need the Hubble telescope to read it which really detracts from its usefulness.  I can't believe they would make it this small.  I'm sure most of those who bought it would have gladly paid more to get it in a useful size.
B00005BJPO|5.0|I purchased the VHS version of Akira (original dub) about a year ago when it was re-released and thought it was pretty cool. But... the DVD version blows it away. You haven't seen Akira until you've seen the DVD version. The picture quality is amazing in comparison to the VHS version. It's enough to make your jaw drop. Also, both the English dub, AND the original Japanese soundtrack come in full Dolby Digital surround sound. <br />Combine all this with a copious amount of extras and you've got a must-buy for any fan of Japanese anime, or anyone who can appreciate a good film. Fantastic.
B00004XONN|5.0|First off I want to let you know that I have heard of Radiohead before, but became a fan of their music when &quot;Optimistic&quot; came out as a &quot;single&quot; when it was getting airplay on the radio.  I am a fan of modern vocals with symphonic instruments, so of course &quot;Optimistic&quot; would appeal to me, so I downloaded the song on to my computer, and loved it, it's one of those songs I never get tired of.  I remember listening to the radio not to long ago (about a month ago) and listening to this great song, when it was over the radio DJ announced the song as being &quot;Creep&quot; by Radiohead.  I was now begining to see what a great band these guys were and why they were pretty much everywhere (TV, magazines, etc.)  So with a gift certificate I recieved, I went out and got a copy of &quot;Kid A&quot; reading reviews on how it was so great, I was expecting songs like &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Creep&quot;  when I left the mall I popped it into my cars CD player, and was in awe about the piece of crap, I had just spent someone elses money on.  I got home and popped it into my stereo skipping tracks, and playing the ones that sounded promising, which only turned out to be &quot;Optimistic&quot;.  I was angry.  I went to work asking people what they thought about Radiohead, and their comments ranged from &quot;They're awsome, &quot;&quot;Creep&quot;&quot; is awsome&quot; to &quot;Who?&quot;  I asked a co-worker of mine if he owned &quot;Kid A&quot; and he said &quot;No, but I should.&quot;  And I told him, without hesitation and I quote &quot;It's a piece of junk.&quot;  When I came home after work, @ 12:30 AM I popped it in and listened to it while going to sleep (I wanted to know what &quot;everyone&quot; was talking about, B/C the CD just didn't make sense to me), and the songs all came together perfectally, it took me for an emotional roller-coaster ride; and to tell you the truth it scared the hell out of me.  Releasing emotions I never knewI had, (It gave me chills)  I couldn't wait for the CD to end.  Yet...I wanted more.  I haven't listened to it since then and I was just watching MTV and I saw the video for &quot;Knives Out&quot; and it was eerily beautiful to me (The song), so I decided to put the &quot;Kid A&quot; CD back in my stereo and no joke, I have listened to it 3 times full length and I think it's the greatest CD ever created.  And I began as a TRL-ish type of Radiohead fan.  I can't wait to get the new CD and get my hands on &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as well as the others.  Trust me, this CD will disappoint those at first, but Radiohead is to be experienced and listened to over and over to appreciate their work.  Those who don't like it, haven't gotten it yet.  Try sleeping with it playing into the night.
B000059XY3|1.0|OH MY GOD, ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE! THE ACTING WAS VERY BAD AND THE GADGETS CAME OUT OF NOWHERE! IT COST LIKE A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HE USES IT ONLY ONCE. AND THE IDEAS FOR THEM ARE SO STUPID. STICK WITH 1AND2 THATS IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it is very unique and different. Nof this era, in terms of hollywood doesn't do musicals anymore. I do recommend it for that reason and I think people will, moreorless, enjoy it.<br />It's a sad tale, but not so much a tear jerker (close though). Very hip and upbeat. Sad in a sense as well, simply because Kidman's character was torn between the one that she loves and her career. As well as, she's struck by an illness, inwhich she doesn't know about for quite awhile.<br />I recommend it. And I will surely buy it on DVD or VHS.
038533348X|5.0|I am a disc jockey and this past week I read a news story on air about the US government dropping powder onto thunderheads which dried up the clouds and greatly lessened the strength of the storm; now our government is planning on testing the powder on hurricanes.  This actual event drove me to search out my copy of Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and re-read this hilarious, thought-provoking, doomsday tale.  It's filled with eclectic characters: a dwarf with an ugly sister, a mad scientist, spiritualist, bicycle manufacturer, South American dictator, losers and misfits.  It's peppered with cliches that only Vonnegut can get away with.  It introduces a fantastic religion that makes perfect sense.  He even creates a new language.  But at the core is the chilling fact that the U.S. Marines have induced the scientist to invent Ice Nine, even though he knows the inevitable outcome of this substance. It's a merry ride that Vonnegut takes us on.  One of his best books, and that is high praise indeed.  A very fast read.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I won't get into details, I'll let the 1000 plus positive reviews before me help you out there. I did just watch Braveheart, then Gladiator back-to-back and my conclusion is simply this: For sheer enjoyment of story-making these are my favorite 5 movies - 1. Braveheart 2. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 3. Contact 4. The Godfather 5. Gladiator<br />Ironically, given Russell Crowe's superior performance, it was Lucilla's proclamation of &quot;Make us believe it again&quot; at movie's end with encompassing music score that garnered &quot;most moving moment&quot; in my opinion. She was &quot;tired of being strong&quot; but this was her finest and strongest hour...<br />I scanned hundreds of these reviews and cannot fathom how the one-star and two-star people miss such passion. Maybe their own lives is a reflection of the lack of it.
0800141326|2.0|in this film godzilla does not look like...well godzilla, maybe because this godzilla is digital .the end part is the biggest let down godzilla is killed by missiles!!the old godzilla eats missiles like breadsticks! i gave it two stars becaues i liked the baby godzilla part.
B000002GYW|5.0|Oh my don't the skies look spacious/ With the star's all shining down/ I can hear the night wind howling/ And it's a high and lonesome sound. Thus begin's one of the Eagles most potent and under-rated rock and roll tunes,&quot;Out of Control&quot;. In fact this whole album, with the exception of the well known title track and tequlia sunrise, is the most over-looked album in the Eagles canon. To those of us who have listened to this album for the past 27 year's, there can be no doubt that this is the band's finest hour! In fact I can't listen to this album with-out vision's of sage-brush, bar-maid's, 6-gun's and 6-string guitar's going through my head. Simply brilliant sing, song-writing, playing and storytelling. One of the best album's of all time!!
B00003CY5K|4.0|I had my doubts about this movie when I first saw the commercials for it.  Fortunately my girlfriend dragged me to it, and I had a blast watching this film.  The movie had me laughing for the whole time I was there.  If you are looking to have a good time at the movies, go see &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.

B00003CXDZ|4.0|This is another movie that I was dragged to by my girl friend, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Personally, I thought the movie was great.  I loved the way they blended several different songs into one song; I thought it was very creative how they did that.  I had a lot of fun watching this movie, though it may not be for everyone.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira! The very name shapes the foundation of all anime to come. Akira was probably the first anime movie I ever saw, so of course the title holds fond memories. Now, much like another great animated movie (Heavy Metal) you can own the factory-new release DVD! I highly recommend the tin set, if you can get it ( I heard it was sold-out in most stores). For true fans and even for those still wondering \\"What do they see in those cartoons?\\" ... You owe it to yourself to see this new edition of a classic anime. A new clean print, digitally cleaned, and a new dub w/ a more accurate translation from the original Japanese are all features added to this new edition. For the non-fan, we have just the movie, also highly recommended. For the otaku (mega-fan, like myself ^_-) the limited edition DVD w/ supplemental disc and really neat tin case (only one I've ever seen , and I have a lot of special edition DVD sets). Buy one today and immerse yourself (or re-immerse) in what can only be called a anime legend!
B00003CXS4|4.0|Okay so the title I suggested was cheesy, but the movie was anything but. From innovative camera angles to a great cast, this movie is great. Guy Ritchie is anything but ordinary and this movie, written and directed by Ritchie, is a relief from the everyday drab movies being released lately.
B000007MVM|5.0|This one is not for everyone, and the casual Floyd fan (Waters fanatics as well) or the creatively-impaired will certainly be disapointed.  It may help to explain the circumstances regarding the recording of Madcap Laughs. Syd was in a frame of mind that made recording an album by typical standards impossible. The vast majority of the material was spur-of-the-moment, none of it was extensively rehearsed, and worst of all, Syd never played the same song the same; each take was in a different key, tempo, or had time changes. Excellent studio musicians were brought in to offset these problems on some tracks; on others, it would have to be just Barrett and his guitar. He would up and leave during takes, would show up days later while Gilmore was tweaking the tapes, with or without a guitar, which was often out of tune, at least when the strings were on... This album strikes an emotional nerve. It is dark, ominous, and forboding, however it has a gentle quality that counterbalances , making for one hell of an emotional rollercoaster heading for disaster. And it is all completely honest. This album is not contrived or formulated to be anything other than a man's decent into his own delusion.  Nothing else, not even Piper, sounds like this. This album was not made in the caliber of Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd was more about concept, audio textures, and the endless possibility of studio gadgetry. Not this one. There are tracks on here, like Dark Globe, that are so personal and delicate that no band, not even the Floyd, could have improved on. yes the many flaws are one of the factors that make this album unique. Admittingly, the delivery of the music is compromised. The material itself is extraordinary. This paradox makes for a challenging listen that has undoubtedly perplexed many listeners. That is to be expected! Early Floyd is a challenging enough listen anyway. Syd Barrett out of his mind is opening up a whole new uncharted pandora's box. Those who can't appreciate this album for what it is rather than how it was recorded simply have no aptitude for music from the soul. I think Madcap Laughs forces listeners to search inside their own psyche for some interpretation of whatever point Syd is trying to get across. After all, the man was simply trying to find himself with this music. So you too must find yourself... if you don't like what you find, you will hate this album. Brave enough to take the challenge? This album will make you think like no other. Do not put this on in the car or while washing clothes, you need to set aside time for a spiritual experience and LISTEN.  Syd lived by the sword, he died by the sword. Drugs being the sword. This album is the crossroads, the point where Syd's ill drug habit began to erode his sense of organization and guitar playing ability, his conception of ideas, and his creative ablility as a songwriter. Not to mention his sanity. Madcap demonstates like no other, the true reality of drugs WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE THEM YOURSELF.  This album requires at least 10 or more spins before one can honestly begin to appreciate it. If it's NOT in you, there's no hope for you. Try Barry Manilow or Radio KAOS instead.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I admit, I was weary to see 'Billy Elliot' - it didn't look very original compared to a lot of recent British films.  Props to Stephen Daldry for making what could be a tedious, over-sentimental story into a fresh and emotional movie.  Instead of focusing on the obligatory sexual politics or high risk audition (both are in the movie, but they are actually dealt with intelligently), Daldry looks to the anger, frustration, and yearning for freedom that a young boy expresses through dance.  Jamie Bell is incredible as Billy, as is the rest of the cast.<br />Once again, though, the directing is superb and underrated (with some classic sight gags thrown in).  The great music and visuals complement the story perfectly.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I doubt that anyone will read this review considering that if you are interested in buying this movie, you obviously have seen it already.  However, people who haven't seen it should read on.<br />Akira takes place in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, Bike gangs rule the streets and Incompetent committee members run everything else.  After a motorcycle accident, a 16-year-old gang member named Tetsuo discovers his hidden powers.  As the movie goes on, we find out what happens when the wrong person gets pushed around too much.  All hell breaks loose, and the only person who can stop it is Tetsuo's best friend, Kaneda.<br />All in all, this movie is almost too good to be true, however, you might want to keep younger children away from this movie for a while, it is extremely violent and has one scene of brief nudity.  This ain't pokemon.
0385335482|3.0|By the time I was finished reading the book I really enjoyed it, but I would have never claimed that at the book's mid-point. Nothing really happens until the last few chapters, so be prepared! Nevertheless, it kept interested enough to actually finish the book, so it wasn't all bad. It's a definite summer read.
0792839129|5.0|This is a great Family Movie with great songs for the kids and action for the kids.  I wonder if Leonard Malt...whatever his name is has kids or knows what a good kids movie is.  The key word for this movie is its a clasic disney movie for KIDS.  Both of my kids love it at 6 yrs and 3 yrs old.  Dick van dyke is great in this movie and computer special effects are not needed or required in every movie.  The special effects work just fine for this movie.  I still like this movie for myself at age 38.
6302637899|4.0|I prefer the live-stage of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; which I saw nearly 30 years ago in Japan. It was a very nice and fantastic show ! At that time, I was very young and didn't understand their colloquial English well. But, it was very much &quot;fabulous&quot; !!<br />Maybe many people who saw &quot;the Show&quot; willingly agree my opinion , don't they ?
0553573403|4.0|Actually, I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars...not quite 5, but certainly worth more than 4.  Anyway, I've never read a book quite like this.  The way that each chapter details what is happening to (and from the perspective of) each of the major characters is very, very well done.  Even the &quot;villains&quot; are given a chance to relate their side of the various plot threads.<br />Perhaps the best recommendation I can give is that this is not a page turner, it is a chapter turner.  Night after night I would say to myself: &quot;I'll just read one or two chapters before bed and then lights out.&quot;  Yah, right!  Instead, I would finally look at the clock to discover I had been reading for hours.  Not only was it almost impossible to put down, but I found any excuse to &quot;take a break&quot; and picking it up to read it.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Excellent documentry on motorcycle racing and recreation in 1971.  Although contemporary competition is faster, the footage of 1970-era machines is still exciting to watch in this movie.  Several well-known racers are featured, and Steve McQueen appears in much of the movie, participating in desert and enduro competitions, displaying respectable riding skills.  Flat track, dirt and desert racing dominate the film, but other forms of competition such as hill climbs, trials, drag, and road racing are included.  There's a lot of excellent footage and it's well put together to provide an entertaining film for motorcycle enthusiasts.
0805241183|5.0|Franz Kafka's The Castle is my favorite book. I first read it when I was young at a time when I also read America and The Trial. I enjoyed Mark Harman's excellent translation of the restored text in the autumn of 1999, and I am these days reading the first pages of Villy Sørensen's Danish translation, which to me may very well become the ultimate edition of The Castle. Pretty good for an unfinished work.
B000002UAR|5.0|Fans in love with the moptopped foursome who crafted smiley pop singles in the early sixties should not have been repulsed by Revolver when it arrived in 1966. They should, however noticed change. Taxman? Were the Beatles angry with their government? She Said She Said? Were the Beatles also interested in gloomy, mournful women besides the happy little girls in their smiley pop songs? Tomorrow Never Knows? Were the Beatles using drugs? Yes, yes and yes. While they didn't lose sight of their gift of creating catchy, memorable pop songs on this album (they never did), the boys were maturing, their interests where changing and their creativity was growing and much of Revolver, from George's interest in the sitar and Indian music and philosophy to John's growing intellect and the band and George Martin's experiments (such as replacing the Beatles' instruments for a string quartet in Eleanor Risby) seems to show all that. The result is memorable, adventurous, inspiring and still catchy and fun. Revolver features Beatles songs in a new glowing light.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is Dream Theater's finest moment, creating complex landscapes of sound with stories to tell along the way...Scenes from a Memory is a perfect complement CD to this, as that one picks up where parts of this one leave off...these guys are some of the most talented musicians in the biz today, and perform all the bits (loud or soft) with an flair of experimentation and professionalism all at the same time...awesome.<br />For those wondering where all the great prog sound (with a few tablespoons of metal) has gone, look no further than this CD!
B000002UAX|5.0|What can you say about the Beatles' infamous white album? Every time you think it will zig, it zags. After John ponders morbid strangeness in Glass Onion, Paul sings a merry pop tune with a nonsense chorus in Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, a song called &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; is followed by an encouraging ode and a what sounds like an innocent pop song hides the story of a death in an auto crash while a screeching bit of violence is really about a water slide. There is a duel nature to many of the songs. The dangerous and controversial Communist Russia is sang about in a Beach Boy-type pop song American Beatles fans gobbled up in the early and mid-sixties. The white album makes for four record sides of spit, sarcasm and strangeness and it works. The only thing all of the thirty songs have in common is quality. From Lennon's careful critique of the day's activists to Harrison's OrWellian Piggies the more ambiguous sounds of McCarthy's screams on Helter Skelter, the albums bleeds and steams the anxiety and frustration of its time.
0140185232|2.0|There are far better ways to acquire what this book has to offer.  As other reviewers have stated, it is about a handful of people and the way they live their lives, particularly one young man who strays from the beaten path in search of Truth.  The occassional snippets of philosophy and theology are smothered between long descriptive passages of rather uninsightful people-watching.  If you have a lot of time on your hands, perhaps this book would appeal to you.  If you are looking for an interesting or enlightening read, look elsewhere.
B000002AEN|5.0|Note that this edition appears to contain the same tracks as the Yazoo edition, but with some differences.<br />Listening to samples from each edition, this one here seems to have been sourced from 78s which were in better condition. The Yazoo edition costs more, with the fancy cover, yet appears to have inferior sound.<br />Note also that the Amazon sales rank for this edition is much higher than the Yazoo version. Why pay more for less?<br />Musically, this is close to perfection. John didn't seem to use fingerpicks, or even his nails, and the sound is round and mellow. The tone he produces on the later albums, after rediscovery, is quite different. It's clearer, but it doesn't sound better; it may be interesting in other ways, of course, but you can't go wrong with this one right here.<br />5 Stars is nuts, nobody's perfect, but 4 stars is not enough for this delightful music.
B00004S35Z|5.0|This was the first Stevie Wonder album I owned. I liked the songs I heard on the radio, but listening to this whole album was a revelation. The radio hits are probably my least favorite songs on the album. The variety of pop and R&amp;B styles on this album are amazing. I know a lot of people think INNERVISIONS is Stevie's best album, but I think this one is. If you are a Wonder fan, and you don't have this one: What are you waiting for??!!
B0000203Y5|4.0|I think this is a well done documentary, with excellent music of course and full of nostalgia. This was going to be a gift for one of my parents. I thought it was subtiteled, but it was not, so he could not enjoy this great video, sadly I was vey disaponted.
B000002JSJ|4.0|All things considering this is work is pretty good.  Plant is singing from a wheel chair after surviving a car crash months prior.  &quot;Achillies Last Stand&quot; is a powerful, mystical opener.  &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; is a rework of song Blind Willie Johnson wrote.  Lot's of volume and a great harmonica solo by Plant on this one. I also liked &quot;For Your Life&quot;, it seems like the band is reflecting on their lifestyle here; it's sorta bluesy and sorta melancholy at the same time.  Besure to have your Mardi Gras beads ready when you listen to &quot;Royal Orleans&quot;, I'm sure everyone remembers &quot;that woman from Louisiana&quot;!<br />&quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; is a rockabelly number that Elvis Presley could have sung, over look I think.  &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; is another over looked song, it takes several listens to appreciate this one.  This set ends with a fantastic Chicago style blues number called &quot;Tea For One&quot;.  This one ranks up there with &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;, &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; or &quot;How Many More Times&quot;.<br />This perhaps may not be an earth shaking release but I wouldn't over look it either.  I would recommend this one without question.
B00005N83O|2.0|This is the version of \\"J.Lo\\" with the new \\"I'm Real\\" remix, cleaned up. Wait for a single, it's not worth it, and without the unattractive swearing (which I'm not too fond of), it doesn't even make sense.
B000002JSP|4.0|I would have given this work 5 stars but I didn't get my cd in a brown paper bag - just kidding.  I think &quot;In Through The Outdoor&quot; Picks up were &quot;Physical Grafitti&quot; left off.  It sounds very experimental with the keyboard riffs through out.  The set opens with an ominous into to &quot;In The Evening&quot;, sounds like they borrowed and updated the &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; bow riff and ran it through a keyboard.  Also featured here are two AOR smash hits &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; and &quot;All My Love&quot;, very classy numbers and, again stellar work by Jones on keyboards.<br />&quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; features Jones on piano and, if you listen closely, a thumping bass line also.  &quot;Carouselambra&quot; features Jones and Page doing an 80's style epic.  The set closes with &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; .<br />Page on this work is somewhat lost in the shadows here, but as always superior, he is crisp and clean.  This set was recored after a year and a half layoff due to the untimely death of Plants son in late 1977.  I have read that he wasn't enthusiastic about doing another Zeppelin recording unless something new style wise could be created.  Created it was in fine fashion.  Unfortuniately Zeppelin was only able to play a handful of shows in Europe in 1980 before the untimely death of drummer John Bonham.<br />Perhaps whatever riffs lie between Jones and Plant can be resolved and Jones, Plant, and Page can come together to collaborate one more time.  I think Bonham would have wanted that.
B000056K04|2.0|I love DMB, don't get me wrong, but this is not DMB. This is a Glen Ballard album in which Dave Matthews is the mouthpiece. This is Britney Spears pre-fab rock. Buy this if you must, but only after you get on a music sharing service and download &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;, the actual next DMB record. It is great, this one is just barely okay.
0792838084|3.0|those familiar with david lynch will be hardly persuaded by the the ironic beauty and tragedy presented here. Isabella Rossileni (I thought I had a cool name) sure does look great in cotton shorts and tiled with hickeys. Dream. When school boy \\"Jeffrey\\" finds severed human ear in lot, he takes it police. He is not a suspect (sure!). \\"Jeffrey\\" meets high school girl - her dad is the detective on the case - and they become fast lovers. Flinging into the mystery with an undignified zeal, \\"Jeffrey Beaumont\\", breaks into this [girl's] crib and hides in the closet. Peeping out the slides, he witnesses brutality and humiliation. He des nothing. She discovers im and gives him a lesson in sexual tortue. He acts like he doesn't care. All jaded, etc. Chase to the end>>>>> When someone gets shot in the head, usually they fall down. Right? Not in this movie they don't. They stand there for a bit and gurggle blood. There is no resolve. One cannot figure out who is the good guy, who is the bad guy. chason pour les petites enfants!
B00000592F|4.0|Especially since hardly any of the original US releases are still in print anymore. Except for the disastrous &quot;Something Magic&quot;, their latter day albums might not have been much to write home about taken as a whole, but there was always something on each that made you stop what you were doing and pay attention. This album is no exception--the song &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot; has a Brecht-Weill feel that suggests to me that Brooker and Reid must have just come from watching &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;Strong As Samson&quot; are as topical as anything from Stills, Young or Jim Morrison--except the last verse draws a steel guitar into the mix. Well, Buck Owens did sometimes write with attitude, after all. I go along with another reviewer's negative reaction to the Beatles cover &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;--I've heard school prom bands that did it better. Have you ever noticed that the best Fab Four tributes from other artists are when they do something of their own that's influenced by the Beatles. It's always better than doing an actual cover--Electric Light Orchestra had a great career doing just that. At the moment, this album is out of stock--I hope it's not out of print as well.
B0000584V3|4.0|I think this is one of the must-have lps of this year. Great band, who mix a lot of different types of music.
B00003CXRM|5.0|It's offbeat and wonderful! The music is to die for, I can't turn the cd off. George Clooney at his absolute best. Clooney is a natural ham when lypsynching, you would swear he was singing. And even if you don't like folk/bluegrass music, you will love it when the film is over. &quot;Man of constant sorrow&quot; is a wonderful song, and if you are around 50 you will recognize it from the sixties when it was done at a slower tempo by folk artists. Scenery is breathtaking in the film. John Tuturro is a hoot and so is Tim Blake-Nelson. What a voice he's got. I always love Holly Hunter in everything and John Goodman is perfect as the conman/bible salesman. I want to watch it over and over to see what I missed the first time. The Coen brothers have done it again. I think the film will be a sleeper and soon develop a mass audience, once the word gets out.
B00004X01U|2.0|There are some songs on here I love, and others I could live without. I love &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, but could do without a lot of the others. As a Madonna fan, this CD is a must have, expecially if you liked Ray of Light. But if you are just starting out, not sure if this is for you.
B000003Z6I|5.0|An unusually accomplished debut album that many to this day consider to be Cave's best. Kicking off with their commanding version of Leonard Cohen's Avalanche, the record steadily moves on from there to such classics as the aching Well of Misery, the monumental title track (still a staple at live shows), and the melancholy mini-epics Saint Huck and A Box For Black Paul. Much is made of the Cohen cover, but I find the cover of Presley's In The Ghetto to be one of the album's standout tracks. It and the aforementioned Black Paul show the piano-laden musical backing that would come to dominate Cave's later albums. In reality, there's not a bad song on here, and everything that we love about Cave-dark, gloomy lyrics, Bibilical and goth references, dramatic musical backing, his commanding vocal presence (he truly becomes the character he is portraying in each song)-is present here. In truth, the second, live version of the title track tacked onto the end of this album is unnecessary; it's shorter than an inferior to the original studio recording. But anything added to this album is just icing on the cake, anyway. A fine record.
B00005B36H|5.0|First off, Let me say that I hate alt-rock.  I cannot listen to America's radio for more that 5 minutes without going crazy.  I listen to lots of underground stuff, from The Avalanches to Dave Clarke. <BR><BR> I was brought into Tool-land by a group of friends, and all I can say is this album is amazing.  Incredible.  I listen to it all the time (HEAVY ROTATION), because I cannot get enough of it. <BR><BR> The lyrics are mind-blowing also. <BR><BR> While Schism is a great song, it is definatly not the best.  Everyone must buy this.  A contender for Album of the Year.
B000002UR7|4.0|Although it doesn't tread the same experimental grounds that Radiohead's subsequent albums do, Pablo Honey is a very good album in it's own right. Something of a traditional album in British Pop, but featuring a sound and style that, even then, separated them from the rest of the pack. The band's potent three-guitar army is alternately pleasantly quiet and embracingly noisy. The quaint acoustic revertebrations of Thinking About You are a nice contrast to the noisy burst of feedback that precedes the chorus in the classic Creep. The album is pure BritPop, and very good too, but also features long instrumental sections with punchy guitar solos and feedback-drenched atmospherics that the band hasn't returned to since. They weren't the greatest of songwriters at the time (some songs, such as Anyone Can Play Guitar display a lyrical naivety that would no doubt embarrass Yorke now), but the band's sound is impeccable, and when they hit, they really hit. Radiohead will probably never return to this sound again; and while more recent experimental masterpieces like OK Computer and Kid A are unquestionably better albums, it's often nice to go back to this debut and know that Thom Yorke really CAN sing when he's not busy looping himself or singing backwards, and that he in tandem with Ed O' Brien, and (especially), Johnny Greenwood really are good guitar players in the traditional sense. And that's not to discount Phil or Colin (who puts in some really good bass parts)'s contributions, either. A very nice album that you shouldn't overlook.
B000021XR5|4.0|Stone Temple Pilots takes us back to their first release, hard rocking / metal with just a touch of alternative vocals. This entire CD spells out hard hits, from Down to Atlanta! Down is a banging heavy guitar track. Heaven and Hot Rods is vintage STP, with a solid drum / guitar combination with singer Scotts beauty of his voice. Sour Girl is a standout song on this CD, it is a very soft song built around the lyrics and it tells a story of love and leaving. Church on Tuesday is a solid track focusing around Scotts vocals and lyrics accompanied with a big guitar. No Way Out is always a fun song, its a song you sing when you have someone that you do not like and they have trapped themselves. Sex and Violence is another fast paced alternative rock marvel, with brief pauses between guitar riffs to catch your breath. I Got You, has a spicy country twang to it and it is totally how you feel when you have someone during a tough time. Good Album.
0618084746|5.0|A truly amazing book, an outstanding achievment.  At times it was dificult to read, dipping as it does into feelings of profound sadness, grief, and loneliness.  In some ways I can understand why we don't read it in high school-not many books, if any, illustrate the absurd, self-defeating egotism of human beings.  There's so much going in this book it can dizzy you.  Is the deaf-mute a Christ figure, full of compassion?  Or is he essentially a simpleton, beloved because, like the family dog, he can't talk back.  Singer the mute seems to be the hub the other stories revolve around, but Mick is also a central figure. (Representing the author perhaps?)  Her brief liason with her Jewish neighbor is absolutely heart rending.  They had so much to tell each other, such capacity to heal one another but instead he flees, from his own need, before Mick can sing &quot;Will you still love me tommorrow?&quot;  And then there is the severe, dignified black doctor who wants to teach his people, lead them to a sophisticatation and nobility equaling, even surpasing, that of whites, only to be viciously beaten by cops outside of the courthouse when he tries to inquire about his jailed son.  A beating which convinces those who he attempts to educate that shuffling and smiling is their destiny. &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; is about the inadequacy of human communication.  So many people, with such intense wants and needs who can only unburden themselves on a deaf-mute.  A deaf-mute who likely is indifferent to their suffering.  Is the human experience so lonely?
B00000JZC4|4.0|Filter's second album is the average man's ordeals with alcohol, problems, and the law as seen through the singer's eyes. This CD is much better than their debut and one of the best releases of 1999, more commercial hits such as Welcome to the Fold, the Best Things, I Will Lead You and Take A Picture. The Best Thing is a rocking partying or just cruising in your car song, solid lyrics, beat, guitars and its just great. Welcome To The Fold is a standout rock track that will forever be a classic. Take A Picture is a softer swaying ballad, which everyone has heard from the radio. There are other similar softer songs on the CD including Cancer and Miss Blue, which will set you adrift to a musical version of heaven. The rest of the CD is very solid, with lyrics and guitars that simply pull you into listening the entire CD without a moment's boredom. Bottom line is this is a fantastic must have for alternative / rock fans.
0780626478|5.0|We've watched this movie again and again and it's always entertaining.  Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken give some of the funniest performances I've seen, with so many subtle actions blended in.  Brendan Frazier and the rest of the cast are wonderful.  It is truly one of the more entertaining movies that has been released recently and I highly recommend it.
B00004TDUV|5.0|First off, this is a double disc. This is one of the only Japanese Imports that I can say is worth its price, not only is this CD a great collectors item, beyond the usual single bonus track, but there are five bonus tracks, which may be found on various other releases. The live version of Take A Picture is great because it is different using a simple hand drum for the background to the as always beautiful vocals. Hey Man Nice Shot, sounds great as well, but the standout live track is Welcome To The Fold, a seven minute melody that somehow stands out from the other tracks. Jarrassitol comes off of the original Crow Soundtrack and is sounds typical Filter from 1995 starting silent and building up into noise and cluttering drums. Cant You Trip Like I Do, is the same hit from the Spawn Soundtrack, which is actually Crystal Methods song. To top it all off, there are two videos within the CD Extra of the second disc, amazing!
B00003CXN4|5.0|I loved it! I don't make a habit of purchasing DVDs unless i've seen the movie. Well, I've seen the movie... twice as a matter of fact. Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors. There was drama, there was action, there was intrigue. What more could you ask for? If you're looking to add a good, and I mean good, movie to your collection, I'll say that you won't be dissapointed. This is one that you can put on for friends that have different tastes, but all will enjoy. Take the plunge.
B00001ZU4D|5.0|You have two choices here, if you want just a normal Japanese release with two bonus tracks, go right ahead, BUT if you want to put an extra $10 for an extra bonus disc featuring three live tracks and music videos of Welcome To The Fold and Take A Picture in a CD Extra, then you should look at the other Japanese release of Title Of Record. Jarrassitol comes off of the original Crow Soundtrack and is sounds typical Filter from 1995 starting silent and building up into noise and cluttering drums. Cant You Trip Like I Do, is the same hit from the Spawn Soundtrack, which is actually Crystal Methods song, featuring Filter over it. This song is very electronic, and about seven minutes long it is a great song, but you should buy the Spawn soundtrack if you want to hear it. Otherwise, the CD itself is great, but you should go for the Japanese Import with the bonus disc.
0316776963|4.0|This book was recommended by one of my brightest friends so, despite its weird title, I picked it up and started reading. I quickly found that Mr. Sedaris has an incredible gift for writing straight from the heart and telling it like it is.  As a former foreign language teacher, I especially connected with the hysterical accounts of his struggle with French - which is where the weird title comes from, by the way.  The format of this book is a refreshing break from the novel genre, especially for someone with time constraints that don't always allow huge chunks of reading pleasure.  While there were a few essays which I could have done without, overall I found reading Me Talk Pretty One Day to be a wonderfully entertaining way to spend my time.
0385335482|5.0|The title grabbed me. How could it not? Once I read that title, I knew instantly that I must have this book.  Along with the five other books, two cds, and multiple cards of hair accessories that were all in my hand and all must-have's.<br />If you ever find yourself in a store, completely and insanely justifying buying that new black sweater or pair of boots (because none of the five other black sweaters in your closet have a boat neck or the two pairs of boots you own are square toed, so these items must be added to your closet...), then you will completely relate to Rebecca. I understood the dread of picking up the phone, fearing it was a creditor, or the need to buy when the tag has that beloved red-line; and I completely understood Rebecca. Thank god I have never run into one of my creditors face-to-face. Rebecca's trials of being obsessed with buying and having are humorous, if not, completely accurate. And the irony of the situation, Rebecca is a reporter for a financial magazine, and with that in mind, getting out of debt should not be a problem for her, but it is.<br />Ms. Kinsella was on target in her writing of the life lived by shopaholics. I should know, I am one!!
B00003CY5K|3.0|Legally Blonde is fun if you dont mind taking your comedy with a lot of tongue in cheek. The story in Legally Blonde is preposterous but knows it but asks you to go along for the ride anyway. Reese Witherspoon makes the film work with her unsinkable upbeat spirit.  Often films like this win me over with the secondary friendship even more than the central story.  In this case Elle Woods (Reese) helps her painfully bashful trailer trash manicurist Paulette Belafonte (Jennifer Coolidge) find love with the brutally handsome UPS guy. Its little stuff like this that infuses some heart into the picture that leaves you with a little more affection for the story after you leave the theater.  I do classify Legally Blonde as a chick comedy that the dudes will enjoy but a few will probably secretly wish was about something else.  The three star rating of the film is more because as a guy, accessorizing and fixing my depression with a manicure and a new handbag isnt something I can relate to. But it does not reflect that I didnt have a good time. If possible I would give it three and a half stars.
B000002L61|5.0|This album rocks! The guitar and drums are superb. Dio's vocal's are great as always. Also, Dio kept his unique mixing quality, so you can hear all the instruments the way they are made to sound. A great classic all the way around. The songs that carry away the awards are We Rock, The Last In Line, and One Night in the City.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic is a great movie that should have beaten Gladiator for the Oscar.  It is thrilling and disturbing and artsy and accessible.  I loved it.  I have read some negative reviews, and not one review mentioned anything specific that I can agree with or even relate to.  however, i can respond to notion that caroline prostituting herself for drugs  with a black guy is like a racist's worst nightmare, and therefore pandering to the racist audience.  To me, that scene didn't try to make any racial point at all.  75% of people in the Over-the-Rhine district of Cincinnati are black, and the script called for the man to be black, since it would be kind of weird for all the other street shots of the city to have black people in them, except the character that caroline gets involved with.  And besides Caroline prostitutes herself with a white business guy too later on and it's just as disturbing to the white audience, so what's the big deal?  The film is more offensive to the Indian Hill community than the black community.  It portrays teenagers in Indian Hill as snobby punks with no direction in their lives and with nothing to do but snort cocaine.  It didn't have to be portrayed with such contempt.  Like, haha, they're the ones who are screwing themselves up!  Personally, I don't feel angry about it because in a way, it's kind of funny, and plus I thought it was cool to see the vans driving around my friend's house and know that in them were a bunch of famous people.  The fact is, if you didn't like the film it was because you thought it was stupid, not because of a racial thing that doesn't even exist.  But if someone IS to argue about the ignorance of the film, there is a heck of a lot more contempt directed at my community than at the black community, not that it really even bothers me all that much.
B00000K31V|5.0|I have seen several reviews of eXistenZ that all seem to labour on the same point, the acting and speech at times are a little 2D.  But that is the exact point, all FMV adventure games are like that. All I can suggest is you invest in a PC, get one or two games eg Gabriel Knight - Beast Within or any of the Tex Murphy series, play them through, and then watch this film again, I think he got it just right.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|The 2-disc DVD set of AKIRA surpasses in many ways even the excellent Criterion's laserdisc edition from 1992.  The brand-new video transfer is noticeably better: colors, especially the primary reds and greens, look more brilliant, flesh tones are more realistic, and there is a bit MORE picture at the bottom (in particular, the shot at time 1:16:23 reveals part of Kaneda's crouching body that was not seen on old transfers).  The 5.1 English track, though not state of the art, is highly active and satisfying.  The new English dub and subtitles are better written and spoken, making the characterizations more real and the story more comprehensible.  In the scene where the colonel meets the senator (Chapter 8), the old English dub had the senator sounding concerned and supportive.  On the new dub, he sounds cold and indifferent, in keeping with his subsequent body gesture of fiddling with his plants.  The new dub also has characters speaking in correct pitches -- Kei's voice is now lower, and Masaru no longer sounds like an old man, but like a child, just like on the Japanese track.  Also welcomed are the correct pronunciations of Japanese names: AH-kee-ra, KAH-nee-dah, KAH-oh-ri.  Last but not least, the new dub makes more frequent uses of strong language to enhance reality.  The DVD supplements include interviews of the voice actors for the new dub, who certainly deserve to be mentioned.<br />Here is one thing that this DVD pales in comparison to the Criterion LD.  The LD included still-frames of the entire first issue of the original Akira comic novel.  It is a shame that this DVD does not include even one screen shot of the actual comic strips that inspired this movie (it does include shots of the COVERS of the comic novels) just to benefit those who have never seen them or do not own the LD.<br />Other DVD supplements include an excellent 48-minute making-of documentary (the Criterion LD had excerpts of it).  It has plenty of behind-the-scenes footage: artists drawing pencil tests, actors recording their lines, musicians composing a score with wood xylophones, photographers taking shots of finished &quot;cels&quot;.  We are told that it was not the norm in Japanese animation films to record the dialogs before drawing the pictures, as it was done for AKIRA.  The youthful director Katsuhiro Otomo appears in his own 30-minute interview segment (not on the LD), where he recalls various processes of making the Akira comics and the Akira movie, and speculates on what he will do next.  Yet another half-hour segment, &quot;Akira Sound Clips&quot;, explains how the movie's score was conceptualized and recorded.  The most prized supplement on the DVD is perhaps the mammoth collection of the film's storyboards, character designs, and background designs.  The storyboards, done by Otomo himself, are the most meticulously designed ones I've ever seen; each of them is denoted with Scene/Cut number (under &quot;S&quot; and &quot;C&quot; on the left), notes, dialogs, and time of duration of the shot.  To help locating a storyboard among the 4500 of them, the printed chapter index is cross-referenced with Scene/Cut numbers of its corresponding storyboards.  Rather disappointing is a short featurette that tersely describes the new video transfer of the DVD with only interviews of 3 technicians and no demonstration of the restoration by way of before-and-after comparisons.<br />There is also an interesting feature called &quot;capsule option&quot;.  When it is enabled, a capsule icon pops up on the screen from time to time while the movie is playing, and when you activate the icon, the screen pauses and shows you English text translation of the Japanese words on the screen -- traffic signs, graffitis, postings, etc.

B00004U2HK|5.0|I have been so fond of this movie 'The Sound of music' since I first saw it ten years ago.   The breathtaking scenery, perfect voice of Maria by Julie Andrews, a remarkable handsome Captain by Christopher Plummer (who then became my favorite male star), the children's singings, the beautiful dance by Rolf and Liesl, the wonderful classical music,....every part of the movie made me can't forget it for the rest of my life.  <br />&quot;..my heart wants to sing every song it hears&quot;, this came into my heart so deeply and now it's what I would say.  I liked music when I was small, but after watching this movie, I became not only like music but couldn't stopping loving music. What a magic by 'The sound of music'! Now I still keep watching this film occasionally, and always listen to the soundtrack, it's so relaxing.<br />Thanks Robert Wise, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, without your efforts, we couldn't have such a favorite movie. I probably will introduce this movie to anyone in the world.

0066620694|5.0|This is the best book on strategy I have ever read (and I've read a few in my time). In his book, &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot;, Clayton M. Christensen, business professor at Harvard, explains why established firms fail, more often than none, when confronted with disruptive technologies.<br />Disruptive technology is different from radical innovation. Such technology initially proposes attributes that are not valued by current, mainstream customers. The technology is initially attractive to a small market segment -- making it unattractive for larger firms. Therefore lies the innovator's dillema: how to allocate resources to developing a technology that will target a smaller market and at lower margins.<br />Thoughout his book, Mr. Christensen develops a framework for managers and executives (also valid and valuable for consultants and analysts) to be able to resolve this dillema.<br />If you are to read only one book on business this year, the Innovator's Dillema should be it.<br />The reviewer is a certified management consultant and earned his MBA from the Schulich School of Business at York University and completed the Wharton School Multinational Marketing and Management Program. He is also a Professional Engineer and holds a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering from the University of Toronto.
0553106635|5.0|The Song of Ice and Fire series is by far the most complex and intriguing fantasy series since Tolkien's LOTR and Zimmer-Bradley's Mists of Avalon series. Martin's plots and subplots entertwine masterfully and unfold unpredictably in the rare format that keeps the reader clueless as to resolution and yet unbearably curious. <br />Martin's multi-faceted characters are definately one of the strong points of his writing. Unlike the typical format of the fantasy epic--most particularly Goodkind's SoT series, constant at best if not monotonous, in which the characters are single faceted, predictable and purely black and white, good and evil--Martin's characters are unpredictably facecious. Even the Starks, whom most would probably concede to be the protagonists, for the first two books at any rate, have been known to be cruel and capricious quite often, and the previously wicked Jaime Lannister is seen in the third book to have a greater depth as the story is told through his perspective.<br />Another common folly of the fantasy novelist,i.e...Kate Elliott, Jordan, Goodkind, is to write a string of self sufficient novels which could well stand alone, containing a exposition, climax, and resolution, tack on an ending which leads into the next novel and call it a series. I cannot get over the disappointment of finding myself in the middle of a series with no end in sight and coming to the conclusion that every book hertofore has essentially been a retelling of the same plot with different names, locations and details added into the mix. Perhaps the most refreshing quality of Martin's work is that in the true Tolkienian sence of the fantasy epic his series is just that: a series, rather than a series of separate novels in which the same characters play a starring role.<br />One final reccommending factor of Martin's work is that the plot is as deceitful as the characters. Halfway through each book the reader will discover that every circumstance he has counted on as a givenis really yet another clever misdirection. With all the expertise of the master magician Martin displays through this series that all is not as it appears and that those characters whom we count on as heros...or villains if you like may be precisely the opposite of what we have surmised. or perhaps it is simply that in a story such as this; one true to life, there are no heros or villains, only people who taken as a whole will protect the intrests of themselves and their loved ones without pausing to worry what kind of light this sheds on them. Martin is truly a master story weaver and I eagerly anticipate the next install ment of this masterful saga. My only regret in regard to Ice and Fire is that I didn't stumble upon it at a later date, when I might not have to wait so long for the next book!

If you think that Acoustical sets should all be heavy and loud, this your mistaken, Scorps finally have a way of showing us the raw talent of Rudolph and Mathias, and of course Klauss vocals are flawless.<BR>Some new songs and some new versions of old songs of course,<BR>and some delightful suprise covers of a few of the greats like &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot; Both songs respectably done with taste and original depth.<BR>Over all......Scorpions have put together something very original with their talents, and I am very pleased!!
6304233639|3.0|The earth is attacked by aliens who must be defeated by Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum (with a virus Machine)??<br />A little too over the top for me.<br />No real explosions just lots of gasoline flareups.<br />The President is after-all a pilot too! And a pretty good one at that. Mary Whitmore plays the first lady and is very beautiful too.<br />The White House sure gets blown up. ((With gasoline?))
4893580914|5.0|I have been studying Japanese concurrent with Korean for the past few years. I picked up this book while I was in Japan because I wanted to learn all the Kanji that native Japanese speakers use in their writing. The book is perfect. There are exercises throughout each chapter that force you to use each character in context. Halfway through the book you find yourself reading a simple letter with quite a bit of Kanji in it. Do yourself a favor and at least learn Hiragana before you attempt to learn Kanji. It's also informative to know that the 1st volume teaches about 72 of the 80 characters that are testable when taking level 4 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.
6305627401|5.0|Being a big fan of the show, I expected a lot from South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut. Trey Parker and Matt Stone certainly know what they're doing with the show and I wanted to see their talents on the silver screen. Boy, they impressed me! This comically ingenious film is dead-on fabulous.  The hilarious story and endlessly entertaining gags will stick in your head long after the final reel. South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut is certainly not for everyone but all the viewers who are prepared to watch a brilliant animated film that makes fun of Canadians, animals, Satan, Brooke Shields and even the President, get your popcorn a-boilin' because this movie is just for you. South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut dares to go places no other movie has gone before and succeeds in jokes and subtlety out of those areas. What really gives South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut the injection of amazement is its full-bodied characters. Kenny, Cartman, Stan and Kyle and all the other characters (there are so many I can't name all my favourites) are frankly unforgettable and you'll be quoting their memorable lines to your friends at the pub, your worst enemies and hopefully not your grandmother.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|I compare Rufus' first album to a 19th century love affair that will never happen...But &quot;Poses&quot; is the same theme, but in the 20-21st century! His sound is much more pop-y and with more beats than the first. My favorite song is definitely &quot;Poses&quot; , the title track. The song is pure, pessimistic imagery: &quot;Now I'm drunk and wearing flip flops on Fifth Avenue&quot;... Incredibly beautiful. His sister, Martha, provides a background voice only heard in heaven! Her voice gives this song (and all the rest) a soft, angelic touch.<br />Listen to his first album and this one back-to-back. You'll be sighing all the time, wishing for that myth-like love to come to you :)
B00005BJPO|5.0|After years of waiting for Akira DVD we got this cool special edition. In this pack we got two gold DVD - one with movie, and one with special bonus. Movie - I think it's greate, and I'm not talking only about contents but also about copy. Menus are great (but I think sounds of bike are cuting sometimes) and movie looks so good. On secound DVD we've got lots of stuff, but I think the most interested is movie about how they made it. And I think that's all and don't forget about special tin box.<br />( sorr for my english, I'm still learning ;-)
B00003CX95|4.0|Yes, this isn't historically accurate, and yes, the common laymen shouldn't use this as historical reference, but I think this movie does show medieval warfare quite well, not just medieval warfare in Scotland, but just generic warfare. It is horrible close combat slashing, and actually, this movie gets yer adrenaline up better than SPR. Yes, it's patriotic, and I dont like patriotic stories, and yes, it has (as usual) a cheesy love story, but what do you expect?? This is a hollywood movie DIRECTED by a Hollywood star! How could you possibly expect better? This is still a great movie in that it shows medieval warfare better than any other movie ever made.
B000001GXJ|5.0|Genoa has been in the news a lot, lately.  I was there as a travelling student, once, many years ago.  Soon after, I discovered this amazing recording of &quot;Simon Boccanegra.&quot; Some Verdi operas blow it on local color; except for O Tu, Palermo,&quot; for instance, there is nothing in &quot;I Vespri Sicilani&quot; that screams &quot;Sicily.&quot;  Yet &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; is drenched in the air, sea and cityscape of Genoa.  It is a deep, heartfelt opera.  &quot;Verdi for adults,&quot; someone called it long ago. This is not only the best &quot;Simon&quot; ever recorded..it is arguably the best Verdi recording ever.  Carerras and Freni as the young lovers, Cappuccilli as Boccanegra, Ghiaurov as Fiesco, Van Dam as Paolo.  I believe this  recording got a rose in the Penguin Guide, and deeply deserves it.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Once again Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Forrest Gump) proves that he is perhaps the best actor of the last 50 years with a tour-de-force that takes him around the world in 1500 days.<br />The movie begins with Chuck Noland (Hanks) going to Moscow to teach the FedEx way to the Russians.  He leaves his girlfriend Helen Hunt (Twister, As Good as it Gets) with a promise to return for New Year's.  It will be four years before he sees her again.<br />After surviving a plane crash the movie follows Hanks attempts to cope with life alone.  He befriends a volley ball, whose death is perhaps the only time I have cried over an inanimate object in a movie.  But that shows you how wrapped up you become in the film without realizing it.<br />Although the film is just under two and a half hours it goes by quickly.<br />Collateral material is excellent.  This is the kind of information I really like to see.  Director Robert Zemeckis  (Forrest Gump, Romancing the Stone) tells the story of the &quot;real&quot; Wilson, a volleyball that floated to shore as he was researching the movie.  A good part on the creation of the plane crash and lots of footage of Tom Hanks just clowning around with the cast, crew and locals on the set in Russia, where very few people know the talented actor.
B000002BE9|5.0|I bought this CD back in 97, and all I have to say is this: i would not be the person I am today if it weren't for Fiona Apple and this album.<br />That's how great Tidal is. Go buy it, it's not outdated in any way!
B00000DC10|5.0|I got first turned onto punk in the late 70s, while in high school, after hearing the first two Ramones records. I then tried to listen to and read about punk, and particularly favored bands that had some originality or a style all their own.<br />In the eighties, as punk went in at least two directions (i.e., postpunk/noise and hardcore), there were many bands but few standouts; Husker Duh, Black Flag, the Flesh Eaters, X, P.I.L., Gang of Four were among the standouts.<br />So here it is, early in the 21st century, and what is punk, now? Some would argue that its glory is largely a thing of the past, and what passes for punk now is basically a rigid formula and a pale imitation of what once was. While that may be largely true, I know that its also always possible to over idealize the past and to not see it as it actually was. In fact, there were mediocre punk bands in the 70s and there are at least some excellent ones in the late 90s/early 00s; Refused are one such band.<br />I recently got turned onto this band, and this record in particular, and boy is it good, really good in fact. Sounding a bit like a combination of Fugazi, the Rollins Band, and a number of punk-metal bands from over the years with just a sprinkling of jazz and techno thrown in to enhance the recipe, Refused play really tight, have a wide variety of arrangements to keep things from getting monotonous (a problem with a lot of bands), and offer sharply satirical lyrics containing a sort of anarchist rage at global capitalism and forms of repression. All in all, a complete package on a record which will likely wind up on a lot of critics lists of the best punk of all time. What this all proves: punk lives!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I can't believe how much I like Gorillaz!  I'm so happy with this CD and I can't stop listening to it!  Hip hop, indierock, 70's supermarket keyboards, old skool beats, there's something for everyone with Gorillaz.  If you like Blur, The Clash, the Beastie Boys, BDP style rappin' and Latin music, you'll be happy with this CD.
B00003CXFG|4.0|This is truly a great sci-fi feast for the eyes!The scenes on the planet are awe inspiring and make you feel small and helpless as you are plunged into total darkness!Vin Diesel is definately making his mark with fans of this genre,I look forward to seeing him in other films,as he really makes an impression in this movie.Although they purposly keep the creatures barely exposed,you see enough of them to know they are BAD and UGLY.If you love sci-fi,definately see this one!I've watched it several times and still enjoy it as much as the first!
B00005BJPO|5.0|I just got my Limited Edition Tin and I have to say that it it the most awesome DVD I have ever even seen.  The tin case has a good gauge and is solidly built, the graphic is textured and has an awesome finnish.  In addition, there is some cool stuff inside as well as a high quality menu and both DVD's are set in there own side of the tin and are attractive as well.  I haven't listened to the English version yet so I don't know how good the new English dialog is, but I have to tell you that there is an interesting special feature on this DVD that will impress you and makes this movie even more interesting.<br />If you love Akira, you must own this!
0671578855|5.0|I LMAO (can I say that?) I laughed so hard, my eyes teared and I had to stop reading till I could dry them.  THE BEST BOOK I've read this Summer--no, this YEAR...and LAST. (THE NEXT BEST were KOMARR and Cordelia's Honor. I haven't read the rest of the series...YET but I'm workin' on it.) I ached for Miles but I could sympathize with Ekaterin.  And those bugs!  Oh God! And that dinner party!  Ms. Bujold, please, please don't let this be the last of the series!  You could start another whole generation of Vorkosigans.  At any rate, please let Miles live on!   I'd give this 10 stars if I could!
B000002NJS|4.0|Well this day and age it is hard to find originality in the music business but Madonna reinvents herself time after time. I think Ray Of Light is her most unique and far out album. Madonna scored 4 singles such as the first hit &quot;Frozen&quot; which I really enjoyed, the biggest hit for the album and the title track &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; which is a fun danceable track, then there are the other 2 singles which didn't do as well but I loved both &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;.I really enjoy ths album because it stands all by itself nothing compares. I feel the stronest tracks on the album are &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot;, and &quot;Frozen&quot;. I think the opening track &quot;Drowned World/ Substitute For Love&quot; is a really great opening track. I also think the track &quot;Swim&quot; is another amazing track on the album. &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; is a good song for lovers who believe in true love. &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot; is by-far my favorite song I love the chorus and the message. Well I recomend this album to all Madonna lovers and to music fans who like something different and original. But this album is not for everyone believe me.
0553108034|5.0|Please do read the first book, A Game of Thrones, if you haven't already; it's wonderful.  For those who have read it or for those still not sure whether to invest their time with this series, good news: the second book is every bit as good as the first.<br />Given that A Game of Thrones left many plot lines completely unresolved, A Clash of Kings reads less like the second novel in a series and more like the next chapters in a much greater work.  It continues the stories of all our favorite (surviving) characters, as well as adding two more.  George Martin thus continues to work his magic, telling his story from the perspective of characters from no fewer than five factions vying for control of the Seven Kingdoms.  Part of his gift is the ability to craft so many wonderful characters: many members of his supporting cast seem strong enough to be viewpoint characters in their own right (Sandor Clegane, Brienne, Osha, Jorah Mormont, Cersei).<br />If this novel has any blemish, it's the pacing, which seems definitely slower than in A Game of Thrones.  Some plot lines do not seem to develop as much as they should in this volume.  In particular, the story of Daenerys, which takes place half a world away from the rest of the action, seems somewhat tacked on.<br />Also noteworthy is the growing influence of magic in the saga.  Part of the great appeal of A Game of Thrones was its deft mixing of an epic fantasy style with a realistic world where magic seemed on the wane.  With the rebirth of dragons, magic now seems about to return with a vengeance.  However, George Martin so far has handled this reawakening skillfully, and given the quality with which he has imbued every other aspect of these books, I am not worried.<br />Simply put, A Clash of Kings proves that George Martin is for real.  I can now say with confidence that A Song of Ice and Fire is the best fantasy currently being written, period.
B00003CY5K|5.0|This Movie was the best!!! It's about a girl who go into harbort law school.  Her boyfriend dumped her because he wanted someone smarter. See the movie to find if he wants her.
B0000026NC|5.0|As a16 year old, it may be considered peculiar for me to appreciate the music of Pink Floyd. However, I can think for my self and managed to pick this up for £15 brand new. I had heard a taped version beforehand. DO NOT listen to the so called Floyd fans giving abuse, this is amazing, every track stands out, (except perhaps Money), my dad was at one of the Momentary Lapse Of Reason gigs during the making of this recording in  August 1988. To see Pink Floyd if they ever considered another tour would be an ambition achieved for me. Buy this CD, its a classic!
B00003CXN4|1.0|Traffic proves conclusively that the &quot;the war on drugs&quot; is alive and well and playing at a theater near you. This stunning artistic achievement has been endorsed by members of the US senate, the motion picture academy and the nation's movie critics.  What more validating acclaim do you need to see this film over and over, and believe everything that it puts forth? Well, I'll give you some more reasons to believe: 10) Candy colors help the medicine go down. 9)  Being part of the La Jolla gentry and being a ruthless drug baron go hand in hand. 8) The ends justify the means. 7) If we would just listen to our children they would never even think about smoking crack. 6) Mexico is more corrupt than the US. 5) Drug czars, Hollywood filmmakers and DEA agents are motivated by the noblest of intentions. 4) People from the ghetto really are responsible for corrupting innocent rich white girls. 3) The use of different types of film stocks, hand held camerawork, the narrative &quot;jigsaw&quot; technique and political cameos mean great art (but only when respectable directors do it in the service of a higher cause). 2) No one in this film ever suggested that the US army start spraying paraquat on tobacco fields in North Carolina or start bombing distilleries in Kentucky. 1) Catherine Zeta-Jones really can act her way out of a wet paper bag.
B00005LB9O|4.0|Great dynamic music. This is classy rock with haunting melodies and awesome lyrics. Sing just makes you feel so glad to be alive!
6305426651|5.0|In that I mean Benigni and his family included also the times and hardships endured.  I was taken aback by the emotion, the happiness within this man.  It is a beautiful film; the characters portrayed are equally that.  I recommend subtitles instead of the dubbed version.  It be best that one hear what was meant to be heard.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is the best movie of 1985!  At the movie theater, the octopus scene, the snack and shop scene, and more funnier, quirkier scenes with Sloth &amp; Chunk were included, making it the best movie I ever saw...until 1997 when TITANIC came along.   ;o) <br />When I was given the video a couple of years ago, I was disappointed to see that they had cut out the more &quot;daring&quot; shots, making it into a PG film, instead of the PG-13 it really was. The DVD version I hear has it all, including the &quot;missing&quot; scenes!!!!  I am so excited and can't wait to get a hold of it...to watch it over and over and over again! I had a HUGE crush on Sean Astin (Mikey) after watching the movie (braces, asthma and all!) and then Ke Huey Quan (Data - Mr. Double &quot;O&quot; negative). This movie is a real &quot;Treasure&quot;! Great family FUN FUN FUN!!! My nephews want to see it everytime they come to my house!  :o) Can't wait to see The Goonies II in 2 years!!! The sequel!!! YES! Finally!!!
0064407667|5.0|Though the mood of the books is dark and dreary, Snicket's witty, clever style brings light upon the subject. While the sett and cast of characters seem unreal at times, it just adds to the laugh-out-loud air of the book and it successors in the series. In this tale, orphans Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to live with their cruel uncle who is after their fortune and attempts to get it by marring the preteen Violet. Snicket will keep you laughing until you get your hands on the next book in the series...an excellent book!
B00004YM0D|5.0|&quot;Remember the Titans&quot; is a fantastic collection of popular songs from the late '60s and early '70s.  There's not a single track on this CD that I skip ahead when it comes on. That says a lot, since we all skip through at least some of the songs on most CDs. Not this one, it's great.<br />The first track &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot; is easy to sing along with and is a great feel-good song. &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; by Norman Greenbaum is another instantly recognizable tune, and one that you'll turn the volume up for. Cat Stevens' &quot;Peace Train&quot; is much more folksy than &quot;Spirit&quot; but it too is a great song that is very catchy. The obligatory one-hit wonder Steam's &quot;Kiss Him Goodbye&quot; is another one that's good - but not to be over-listened to.<br />The Hollies' &quot;Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress&quot; is an upbeat rock tune to tap your foot to. And well you can read the other tracks listed. What else is worth noting: Eric Burdon &amp; War's classic &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; at Track 8 and the only original piece of the soundtrack, the nearly 7:00 selection from the Boaz Yazkin's original score.<br />The only disappointment is that some very good songs used in the movie--most notably, &quot;The Time Has Come Today&quot; (The Chamber Brothers), &quot;Fire &amp; Rain&quot; (James Taylor), and &quot;Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (Marvin Gaye)--are not included on the disc. So if you're looking to get these ones, be aware that they're not here. But everything that IS here is great. So definitely pick this one up anyway!
B000001DTM|5.0|This is U2's finest album.  I don't believe they can top it.  U2 has a great body of work (all you can't..., a little too poppy), but this is the best: deep, brooding, dark, very meaningful and mature, but still quite energetic and cathartic
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Not being a particular fan of musicals of any sort, I was suprised by my enthusiastic embrace of this one. Nicole Kidman is incandescent in her performance as Santine, a dying courtesan who finally has found someone who loves her for her herself. <br />McGregor is spectacular himself and emotes incredibly well as Christian, an idealistic young poet who has fallen in love with the Bohemian lifestyle and with of course Santine.<br />The rest of the cast is unbelievable especially the actor who played Toulouse, he was also Benny Blancho from the Bronx in Carlito's Way. He is a great very overlooked young talent. <br />Moulin Rouge is visually stunning and an emotional rollercoaster with lots of over the top humour and a beautiful love story.  Highly Recommended.
B0000028UK|1.0|this album stinks, really bad! i don't like this stinkin' album! no!
0441003257|5.0|This brilliant and humorous take on the Apocalypse is just wonderful to read again and again. The Apocalypse fails because the Anti-Christ grows up human incarnate instead of evil incarnate, how intriguing is that? What amazes me most about this book (now that I've read it a couple of times) is the precision of the social commentary which is still relevant, and the moving ending where the reader is left with such a sense of love for the world in all its everyday-ness. Now that's gorgeous storytelling. It's just unfortunate that the horribly ungrammatical &quot;could of been&quot; is so rampant in this book. It was so jarring every time I saw it.
B00005N5S5|4.0|In my life time I believe I have watched this film about 100 times, so I was pleased to purchase it after about a 2 year break from seeing the movie.  I was instantly impressed by the layout of the menu selections and the sound has definitly improved which all adds to the 'Terminator' effect!<br />The one thing I was startled by is how dated some of the special effects look! and this is enhanced by the good quality of the picture on the DVD, check out the bit's where Arnie is looking in the mirror and repairing his eye, and also when he's been burnt down to the endo-skeleton and he's chasing Sarah at the end, Pure Comedy effects!<br />This film is a classic and I would recommend this DVD to anyone that has seen it before.
B00004XONN|5.0|Enough has been said about the experimental nature of Kid A, Radiohead's fourth album.  The reaction to it seems to be of the love-it loath-it variety, as some were amazed by it's inventiveness, while others (particularly hardened Radiohead fans) were less than impressed.  I was a newcomer when I first heard Kid A (I was familiar with some of The Bends but didn't think much of it at the time) and was totally blown away!  It had a huge effect on me, and since then Radiohead have officially been my favourite band.  Despite the fact that Kid A is not very &quot;Radiohead-esque&quot;, it still served as a wonderful initiation.  The sound may be different, but the wit, ambition and originality that Radiohead have exibited throughout their career is ever-present here.
B000000JO3|5.0|THIS WILL START UP ANY PARTY.IT'S HAD HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS SO LISTEN TO THEM.
B00005J6T0|5.0|&quot;True Blue&quot; was my first exposure to Madonna's music back in the late '80s. Ten years and plus some I relieve those days with a remastered version of &quot;True Blue&quot;. I almost forgot how much I love the title track. &quot;True Blue&quot; has such a '60s pop feel to the song. It's upbeat and catchy. &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; is my other all time favorite Madonna song pre-&quot;Ray of Light&quot;. I love how Madonna incorporates flamenco guitar and an overall latin feel to the song long before that wretched latin movement in the past couple of years. Madonna was way ahead of her time, long before Christina Aguilera decided to put out a spanish album. &quot;Live to Tell&quot; is classic Madonna. The ballad is probably one of the best ballads Madonna has ever done in her career and back then the song was a foretelling of her abilities to put out great ballads.  A lot of people interpret &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; as a pro-life/anti-choice song but I don't think so. I think Madonna's intentions were to make people think and decide what she was singing about. The remixes of &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; are excellent too.
0783230702|4.0|In the world of the mind and in the realm of the imagination, anything is possible-- even the ability to transport someone through time.  So suspend your disbelief for awhile, check it at the door, and launch yourself into \\"12 Monkeys,\\" an adventure directed by Terry Gilliam that takes you into the past by way of the future.  It begins sometime in the near future, a time in which the inhabitants of the Earth are forced to live underground, having been driven there in 1996, when a deadly virus was intentionally released into the atmosphere rendering the air unbreathable and ultimately killing five billion people.  Now scientists believe they have attained the capability of developing a way to make the air breathable again, in which case mankind will be able to return to the surface of the planet and rebuild a new world.  But their plan is contingent upon first acquiring a sample of the virus in it's original, pure form, rather than the mutated strains currently available to them.  This means that someone must be sent back to 1996 to collect data and locate the source of the virus, which would then enable them to send a scientist back to procure the needed sample.  <br /> Thus far, though they have successfully implemented a system of time travel, their efforts have been for naught.  Using \\"volunteers\\" from the penal system, they have failed time and again for any number of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the lack of cooperation and effort put forth by their \\"chosen\\" few .  Now, however, they feel they have just the man for the job, a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who has agreed to collect their necessary data in exchange for a full pardon.  The biggest problem seems to be that their \\"time targeting\\" isn't exactly precise.  They have information that will help Cole once he gets there-- a cryptic message they uncovered points to a high profile group known as the \\"Army of the 12 Monkeys\\" as being responsible for unleashing the virus-- and if they can just land Cole sometime before December of `96, he'll be able to track them down.  So, Cole suits up-- and the adventure begins.<br /> As he did with his 1985 film, \\"Brazil,\\" Gilliam here has created a bizarre world that seems to have been dropped through the looking glass.  He presents a future that comes through as something of a subterranean version of the world in \\"Blade Runner;\\" a bit darker and with the definition of a reflection in a fun house mirror.  And it's all quite effective, especially in contrast to the \\"real\\" world of the past in which Cole finds himself.  But what really makes it interesting and keeps the audience involved is the fact that you know everything that Cole knows, which allows you to share his frustration in dealing with an unimaginable situation, and it makes it a tense and exciting experience.  It works because Gilliam has created a very real fantasy world, as well as a believable \\"present\\" that for the purpose of the film is actually the \\"past.\\"  The plot becomes fairly complex at times, but after a couple of twists and turns, it all comes together and makes sense in the end.  <br /> Bruce Willis does a good job in this one, creating a character that is actually quite unlike any other he's ever done.  Cole is certainly heroic, but not in the same straightforward manner as John McClane in the \\"Die Hard\\" series, or the more subtle, understated hero of \\"Unbreakable,\\" David Dunn.  And the emotional character development you see in Cole is credibly realized, for which Willis and Gilliam both deserve a nod of recognition, as it's a good piece of acting by Willis and a demonstration of Gilliam's ability as a director.  It all comes about quite naturally through the narrative of the story, which makes it believable and very real.<br /> Brad Pitt, meanwhile, practically steals the show in his supporting role as Jeffrey Goines, the well-to-do idealist with sensibilities that are just a notch off center.  It's a memorable character, created with nuance and detail, and he deservedly received an Oscar nomination for it.  Also giving a notable performance is Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who meets up with Cole and attempts to sort out his psyche while trying to find out just who he really is and where he came from.    <br /> The supporting cast includes Jon Seda (Jose), Christopher Plummer (Dr. Goines), David Morse (Dr. Peters), Frank Gorshin (Dr. Fletcher) and Michael Chance (Scarface).  With an ending worthy of M. Night Shyamalan, \\"12 Monkeys\\" is an engrossing action/suspense/drama that will keep you going until the very end.  And in retrospect, few movies fall just outside of a specific genre or category the way this one does, so for the sake of argument, I'll create one and call it \\"Gilliam Noir\\"-- a new genre especially for Gilliam's films (and others like them), including \\"Brazil\\" and \\"The Fisher King.\\"  Unique films that deserve their own unique place as paragons of cinematic achievement.  It's all about the artistry of film, and the magic of the movies.
0920668372|5.0|The first time I read this book to my child, I had a hard time not crying.  The wonderful description of a new mother and her child and what lenghts she'll go to to be sure they are safe and sound!  The ending shows the role reversal from parent taking care of the child to the grown child taking care of the parent....and in a VERY touching and heart warming way.  I sugggest this book to every parent and as a gift to expecting parents.
B000002VMH|3.0|I picked this one out of the bargain bin way after it had been released.  I liked most of the Eurythmics stuff before they split and was a little disconcerted that they were dropping most of the electronics their sound was based on.<br />Annie released Why as the first single, and while I like it now, the video imagery and song put me off buying the Diva album forever as I was scared that this style might be prevalent.  The second and third singles Walking On Broken Glass &amp; Little Bird are good examples of what can be achieved if Annie tries to move up-tempo.<br />Sadly on this album, that's about it.  About 80% of this album is ballads and that's too high a percentage to make a good album in my view.  There's nothing wrong with the voice, and the album is mostly electronic but the number of ballads slows this album right down.  One saving grace is the  30's-style track Keep Young And Beautiful as this album's epilogue complete with mock vinyl scratches, it totally contrasts with everything before it but is a fitting finale.<br />Outstanding tracks: Walking On Broken Glass, Little Bird, Keep Young And Beautiful, Why.
B0000524E5|4.0|Coyote Ugly is a sexy &quot;feel good&quot; movie.  We get a nice introduction to Piper Perabu, who may well be the next Alicia Silverstone or Cameron Diaz.  It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.<br />When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name.  Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish.  She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.<br />The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average.  It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language.  I don't believe the &quot;F&quot; word was used at all.  All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family.  I recommend it.

B00005ATQ8|4.0|I bought this on amazon.com before seeing it.  I watched it the day it came.  This is a powerful film and easily the most beautiful as for costumes and scenery, but it wasn't his best.  This to me was great and meaningful but it doesn't really qualify of Kubrick films.  When I think of Kubrick I think of THE SHINING or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Not BARRY LYNDON.  Although I really liked this film, it doesn't have the Kubrick touch that DR. STRANGELOVE, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SHINING, FULL METAL JACKET, EYES WIDE SHUT, or LOLITA brings to the screen.  Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent film, but very unlike Kubrick films. This in a way falls in the catagory of 1956's THE KILLING and 1960's Spartacus.  Those were both great films but they didn't feel like Kubrick.  But do see this movie!  I liked the first video better than the second (BARRY LYNDON had two tapes because it's a little over 3 hours).  But if you enjoy good cinema, rent or buy this!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Like the new film &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; its soundtrack sets a new standard in movie music, full of modern flavors and past delights, a deluge for the soul. Many will find the groove behind the beat of &quot;Lady Marmalade,&quot; redone in hip-hop and R&amp;B rhythm and style by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink. But the real showcase for the soundtrack are the tracks featuring the singing of actors Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, who are very impressive in their ability to turn their acting career into one of song and magic. Kidman's cover of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; is a vision in its own right, while the duet ballad of &quot;Come What May&quot; captures the very heart of the film's central love story. Be sure to experience all the magic that is the &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; including the elegant, magical soundtrack!

1577311523|5.0|Don't let this book's seeming simplicity fool you - it takes you to the most profound depths.  Eckhart Tolle could well be the most significant spiritual influence of this century because he is so un-affiliated with any one tradition, yet represents the essence of them all.  For those who thought A Course in Miracles couldn't be summarized, or the Gospels understood without parable or Buddhism explained without paradox, then read this book.<br />If you have any doubt about that Eckhart Tolle has fully awakened to God consciousness, then listen to his tapes and all doubt will be removed.  His tapes can take you deep into presence.  Go to his website &quot;eckharttolle&quot; to see his speaking schedule.  You will not want to miss seeing him in person.

0060934700|1.0|I once thought that Neil Gaiman, the master of story-telling, could do no wrong.  I have been corrected.  This collection of short stories leaves the reader unfullfilled.  Gaiman is known for creating fantastic characters and places.  Gaiman does not seem to be able to build these characters and places within the few pages of a short story.  The stories in this book range from a werewolf/Baywatch story to poems about vampires to murder mysteries in the heavens.  There were a few rare gems in this book, but overall, I recommend reading 'Good Omens' or 'Neverwhere' to get a good taste of Gaiman's talents.  These stories were consistently disappointing.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A tough gig, you would have thought, watching a film about an old geezer who drives his lawnmower halfway across the USA to see his long lost brother. Especially if directed by David Lynch. But he pulls it off, and then some. This is one of the most coherent, positive films I've seen in a long while from anyone - it's even more remarkable that David Lynch directed it, hard on the heels of his celebratedly unfathomable &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.<br />For all its difference in outlook, like Wild At Heart and Lost Highway it's an unshamed road movie. Rather than carrying the story, though, here the road (literally and figuratively) IS the story: sweeping shots of the road, the headlight view, turning wheels, highways of corn, rivers of rain down the window and even the the dead straight path of the sun in the late afternoon sky reinforce this idea of an inevitable, pre-ordained journey, which Alvin (the old buzzard on the lawnmower) personifies.<br />With a beautifully framed sense of fatalism, Lynch takes the ostensibly absurd and makes complete sense out of it: tripping from Iowa to Wisconsin on a lawnmower isn't, you might think, the most commonsense thing to do, but in the context it's the right thing to do; it's the inevitable thing to do - and if you analyse it, it's no more pointless than a lifetime spent smoking and contracting emphysema, or for that matter not speaking to your own brother for ten years - both of which Alvin (and half the rest of us) are guilty of anyway.<br />The characterisations of the supporting cast are incredibly humane and real - in place of Lynch's usual cast of misfits and weirdoes, Alvin encounters a succession of decent, Middle American folk, who do decent things, whilst giving Alvin the intermittent opportunity to share some hoary old pearls of wisdom, and confront one of two of the demons in his past. This aspect could have easily devolved into sordid sentimentality, but Lynch handles it very deftly indeed. The same could have been true of the final scene, but (without giving away too much), it is done with a beautiful lightness of touch, and it left me with that all-too-rare sense of complete satisfaction as the credits rolled. This is an outstanding movie.true of the final scene, but (without giving away too much), it is done with a beautiful lightness of touch, and it left me with that all-too-rare sense of complete satisfaction as the credits rolled.

B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem for a dream, in my opinion, was the best movie in Y2K.  Sure, there are powerful performances, but what's makes this film even more special is that you actually feel for the characters.  Also, I thought the score throughout the film was haunting, and all the editing (esp. the fast forward parts), was very fun to watch.<br />This DVD is the unrated DVD that was shown in theaters.  Basically, the film is rated NC-17.  But you can also buy the movie in an R-Rated version.<br />The only difference between the unrated and R-rated versions is that Marion's party scene at the end (which is explicit), was cut shorter.  WOW, that's a really big difference, yeah right!  One big difference between the two DVDs is that the Unrated version has a lot more features, and the R-rated only has theatrical trailers.<br />I totally recommend this movie and DVD, and it ain't for the kids, but anyone who is addicted or plans to be, should consider watching this movie.  It will definitely change your life.
B00005B36H|4.0|A simple of that....it´s not good, because ANY TOOL MUSIC is excellent....is just that i was expecting a change of direction...i mean, i thought that after the masterpiece &quot;Aenima&quot; something new will happen to Tool...A Perfect Circle make me think about a new Tool....i dont Know!, more electronic, more comercial, more rock, more hip hop, I DONT Know What!, but i was expecting something with a little bit of changes....OF COURSE,Lateralus is a brilliant cd, beautiful, precious, musically big...Really music...<br />    ....But with had that with Aenima...i hope Maynard and the boys realize that we want to get surprised again for new textures, and new experiments, that can only be made by Tool....
B00000INEX|4.0|My 2 yr. old son loves all the Baby Einstein videos equally, but I especially like this one for pre-nap, or bedtime if he's having a meltdown--somehow it's more soothing than the others. Oh, yes, I find the creator's obsession with filming her own kids annoying, but it doesn't bother my child! Anyway, I definitely recommend buying this particular one for those times when a toddler needs to wind down. P.S. If your child likes this series, you might check out the Bilingual Baby series.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Great....They´re laughing at our faces....but, with great sounds...so, it´s ok...This album its the perfect example about various artist that did what they wanted to do, without a blindfold...<br />    I can´t say what is the style of this project. Some say &quot;hip-Hop&quot;, other &quot;electronic pop&quot;, other even say &quot;punk&quot;.<br />  It´s too easy: Souns like all the above, but its really something new....if i have to say it....i would say:<br />         DARK-NEO-COMIC-MISTYCAL-PSYCHO CIRCUS-MUSIC!....<br />.....something like that, but in the following minute i will think: &quot;what a silly name&quot;...             So, my reccomendation: Buy It....in fact, no matter how style it is....you will listen over and over again...because musically, its the best and original of this year....
0440219078|5.0|I read this book because other teachers at my school were using it in their curriculum, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I read it straight through in an afternoon, then read it three more times over the course of the following week! I tried to get everyone I ran into to read it, bought a few copies to give away and kept loaning mine out!<br />The story of Jonas, and what he learns about his community, is riveting. Lois Lowry presents a future dystopia that is so disturbing simply because it is so terribly possible. Her straightforward style, with surprises unfolding at every turn, is easy to read, but has many levels that give depth to her tale.<br />As a teacher, I recommend this book for the effect that it had on my students (after reading it I decided I just *had* to teach this book), but as a lover of literature I would recommend it to anyone of any age.  This book might be listed as \\"teen fiction,\\" but it falls into the same category as \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984.\\"

B00004SCX6|3.0|I didn't buy this CD expecting great musicality. Therefore, I was not disappointed with the twangy-voiced teen pop I found. Britney Spears' music sounds basically the same on all the tunes, and so I can't fathom why people would be so BITTERLY disappointed. Both albums are basically the same. Song listing:  1. OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN--We've all heard it. Frothy pop...it was nice to dance to the FIRST 50 billion times. Then it got old fast.  2. STRONGER--Considering some of Britney's outfits, I appreciate the fact that she put an &quot;I-don't-care-what-boys-think-cuz-I'm-an-independent-woman&quot; track on the album. But Destiny's Child did it a little better. Nice beats, though.  3. DON'T GO KNOCKING ON MY DOOR--this was too far out of the box for the album. The lyrics aren't really thought-provoking, but it's sure to get a few feet moving on the dance floor.  4. (I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION--To paraphrase a reviewer in PEOPLE (paraphrase!), she shouted &quot;the life out of&quot; this one. It SOUNDS like a pop queen pretending to be a hard-rocking woman: essentially, that's what this is. I respect the effort, though.  5. DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW--If you're feeling this way about YOUR boy/girlfriend, this is a good song. Britney and ballads don't quite mix, though, and this video was HORRIBLE.  6. WHAT U SEE (IS WHAT U GET)--This is a little too poppy even for me, and I'm pretty tolerant of all types of music. The lyrics can sometimes stray to the ridiculous, but the dance beats are all right. An altered remix might be cool.  7. LUCKY--This is sweet...well, it WAS the first billion times. Then it got over-played and sounded like Miss Spears was, uh, complaining a little about her lifestyle. Not exactly in the lines of BSB's &quot;Everyone,&quot; where they say they're BLESSED to be living like that, but I'm sure Britney didn't mean it the way a lot of people thought she did.  8. ONE KISS FROM YOU--A filler song. Pretty fluffy...skip it.  9. WHERE ARE YOU NOW--There's something about Britney and ballads...this is just a little too drawn-out.  10. CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME--I know, I know. One side of my brain tells me this is a silly, shallow pop song. But I still sort of like it (and it just doesn't seem to be as &quot;complain-y&quot; as LUCKY does).  11. WHEN YOUR EYES SAY IT--They should have cut the spoken part in the front, but this is an awesome song. I was really surprised to find this, because it is a genuinely sweet and cool song. Worth a listen (it does go uphill after the spoken part in front).   12. DEAR DIARY--This is pretty silly. I can understand why the younger set, who are getting involved with their first crush, could like this. The older set, though, might want to skip this (unless they're so in love that they feel like it's their first crush again...how sweet).  You can dance to this album for a workout. It's good for that. It's nice and fast, and some of the tracks ARE very tightly produced. It's teen fluff--this isn't the place to turn for insightful lyrics, but maybe #3 will be nice and deep...I hear Britney is out to shock the world who had her pegged as a teen pop queen. This is worth a listen, at least, unless your CD collection is mainly comprised of, say, Jill Scott or Alicia Keys.
B00003CX8J|5.0|this dvd wuz really awesome! It had good story line and had great special effects and good suspense. This is surely a movie I would see over and over.
0790742780|5.0|Well first of all this movie had touched me in a way that was very frightening and sad because Douglas was the exact character as my father in real life.  this movie was like history repeating its self all over again because in the movie Michael Douglas had looked exactly the same as my father had the same name(Bill)and has the same problems as he does(similar personalities).  In the beginning of the movie when he was in the car that is when Douglas had the anxiety attack and stepped out of his car and decided to go home(exactly like something my father would do!).<br />The part where he was talking to the worker sitting down on the road telling douglas that they were fixing the street; and Douglas told him:\\" there isn't anything wrong with the street!\\", and shortly after he told him: I'll give you something to fix\\", that's when I knew that this movie was exactly like my fathers own life, I was shocked...<br />This movie was very well done Michael Douglas did an excellent job playing the role of Bill Foster (A.K.A., my dad). this movie had real good parts and the suspense left me hanging for more.  this movie maid me cry, laugh, and made me think, but I was sad at the end when he killed himself because he finally knew that he was sick and there was nothing he could do about it, so if he died his little girl would get the insurance, so it did not matter for him anyway.  there is much more that I could say but which I cannot, the last thing that I want to say is that this is the best damn movie I have ever seen.<br />Greg Przyk
B00003CXRM|5.0|This film is a depiction of the plodding persistence of human wants, needs and temperence in their pursuit, manifest within an American culture as permeated by insidious commercialism, political deceit and pretention as it is melodious, colourful, and corrigible.  All the fundamental elements and instutitions of the contempory American experience are on exhibit in Mississippi in the 1920s.  This film is an invaluable contribution to the Ethan and Joel Cohen lexicon of American culture.  And damn is it funny.
0140434089|4.0|I am not usually a big fan of detective novels. I find that the Sherlock Holmes stories, while entertaining, do not give the reader enough of a hint as to what is going on. The Moonstone on the other hand, on which the Sherlock Holmes stories are based, is entertaining to the end, and the reader is let in on what is happening most of the time. When this is not the case, the mystery just gets better. Towards the middle the book does get slow, but that is made up for by the excelent beginning and finish. The language also tends to get a bit tedious, but the captivating storyline makes up for it all. It is a smart, and at times very funny detective novel that I am very happy to have read
B00005B36H|1.0|I was fooled into thinking along with the rest of the world that this would be Tool's best album and blah blah blah... As soon as I pushed play I knew I had made a big mistake by buying this album.  This cd is one long song drifting along with the same riffs and chords over and over and over pretty much all in E minor.  All the vocals are the dying whispers of Maynard with the exception of a few screams.  And the lyrics are far from genius: &quot;I know the pieces fit,&quot; &quot;I think I'll go watch the weather&quot;  How could anyone say that those lyrics took any thought at all?  Hell I am a Tool fan but not of their new material.  Aenima was by far their greatest album and always will be their greatest album.  There is just no way a band can release an album of the magnitude of Aenima and release one that is just as good or better.  My overall summary is that this music makes good sleeping music, or don't even bother listening to it in your sleep; just slap it on a table and use it as a beer coaster.
B00003Q438|5.0|James Cameron's The Abyss is an outstanding movie,and it is even better with this DVD.It contains both the original theatrical version along with the director's cut that adds 28 minutes of extra footage.I actually preferred the director's cut as it added greatly to the story in my opinion.There are loads of special features including an hour long making of special that was very interesting.The sound quality is absolutely stunning and the picture is very good as well.<br />As for the movie itself it is very exciting,with a great cast(including Ed Harris,Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,and Michael Biehn),exciting story,great(and very cutting edge in 1989)special effects,and a fine musical score by Alan Silvestri.<br />Overall a great DVD and not to be missed!
6302054982|5.0|I first saw this film in a movie theater and later saw it a couple of times on video.  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is not only one of Martin Scorsese's very best films but also one of the most realistic and convincing crime movies in film history.<br />Based on a true story, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; chronicles the rise and fall of Irish-Italian American gangster Henry Hill(Ray Liotta).  Hill goes from slick mob dandy to drug-addicted paranoid and eventually winds up in the Federal witness protection program.<br />Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of the greatest crime movies in film history.  Scorsese's masterpiece is a successful blend of the satire and crime genres.  The ultimate result is a realistic portrayal of organized crime in the United States.  Scorsese's key players are perfect: Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.  Robert DeNiro is the last of the great screen actors and is both menacing and convincing as murderer-thief Jimmy Conway.  Although DeNiro is a strong presence, most of the story's emphasis is placed on Ray Liotta's Henry Hill.  The story is told through Liotta's eyes and he gives the best performance of his career.  Joe Pesci is great as the almost psychotic Tommy DeVito.  In a very tense moment with Liotta at a mobster get-together, Pesci utters a great and unforgettable line that is vaguely reminiscent of DeNiro's now-famous &quot;You talking to me?&quot; one from Scorsese's &quot;Taxi Driver.&quot;  Future superstar Samuel L. Jackson briefly appears as a robber.  Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi should also be praised for an outstanding screenplay.  The film has a great dialogue that is both creative and realistic.  Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; also possesses a powerful sense of realism that is sorely lacking in even Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Godfather&quot; masterpieces.  Scorsese's characters talk and act like everyday people.<br />I plan to see &quot;Goodfellas&quot; again.  Well-recommended.
B00003CXB6|3.0|The Lost World,directed by Steven Spielberg,is not as good as the first Jurassic Park. I thought the story was kind of thin,and some of the diologue kind of silly,although most of the performances are pretty good. Even with it's flaws I couldn't help but find myself entertained.It was pretty exciting in places,and you have to love those dinosaurs. Even Spielberg makes a subpar film once in a while,and if a person doesn't expect TOO much,then they should find this one entertaining.<br />As for the DVD,it is quite good,with a lot of interesting special features.The sound quality and picture are very good as well.
B00005HU32|3.0|If you hear the first track of this album by DIDO resting at your home, you think it would be the perfect day just hearing all the next tracks, buy when you start hearing the next and the next all start hearing as the first one, but not in the lyrics nor the music, but by the way DIDO sings all the tracks, its the same all the way.  Even some tracks sound as she is bored, they are not full filled by the force she expresses in Here With Me or Thankyou, maybe thats why they are the best in this Album, or the best known.  If you want to have an album with a variety of styles but with the same melodic and strange voice, sometimes bored, this is for you.

B00003CX5A|4.0|Director Tim Burton excels at developing moody, dark atmospheres for his films, and it is the milieu of Sleepy Hollow, with its severe architecture and dark, creepy forests that stands out.  However, there is more to this film than that: Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci turn in fine performances, as do an expert cast of seasoned character actors.  Washington Irving's classic story has been reimagined successfully by Burton and his screenwriters, Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker.  In this version, Ichabod Crane is an iconoclastic New York police inspector who is an early believer in the value of forensic science.  Exasperated by his insistance on adhering to scientific method, his superiors send him to Sleepy Hollow to solve a series of decapitation murders.  Crane is a reluctant hero with a weak stomach--he is afraid of spiders and his first encounter with the Headless Horseman causes him to lock himself in his room for three days!  All of this makes for a supremely entertaining mix of thrills and humor.

B00000IGGA|4.0|I can't convince myself that Mule Variations is a great Tom Waits album, Swordfishtrombones, Bone Machine and Rain Dogs are all superior. Still, this is the one that sticks with me. In the summer of '99 I was in love and travelling through Europe with some great friends. This album became the soundtrack for all our adventures. It is more romantic than the previous mentions and does a great job of establishing a rapport with listeners. It helped me to see the humanity in Tom Waits, and it gave me something to relate to in someone who I had previously seen as a wild Uber-hipster. I don't know if it was the timing, or what, but I hope others can enjoy this album the way I have.
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk have made cheesy cool again.  Discovery isn't about deeper meanings or self-reflection; there's only one absolute truth here and that's having fun.  The album grabs you by the shoulders, slaps you in the face and shouts:  \\"Don't stop the dancing!\\"  And everyone's dancing here - ravers, punks, classic rockers and disco queens are all having a good time together.<br />After \\"One More Time\\" sets the celebratory mood (isn't the loud sigh reminiscent of John Travolta, aka Danny Zuko, in Summer Loving?), Discovery only gets better.  \\"Digital Love's\\" exaggerated guitar solos are a toast to glam rock and \\"Crescendolls\\" transforms a one-person-before-a-mirror party into a stadium of enthusiasts doing the wave and collectively screaming \\"hey!\\"  The last half of \\"Superheroes\\" is the perfect soundtrack for a Disney World laser light extravaganza and \\"Verdis Quo\\" makes us cheer for the underdog; we can all picture Rocky or the runners from Chariots of Fire training to the song.  <br />While the lyrics throughout Discovery are elementary, the sounds are the exact opposite.  Daft Punk melds church bells, 80s synthesizers, clashing cymbals and drummers in marching bands, and sprinkles it all with some glitter and lights.  We can breakdance to \\"Short Circuit\\" and profess our love to \\"Something About Us.\\"  In that song, we don't even have to do the pleading because the whining sound of the keyboard does it for us.<br />By the time \\"Too Long\\" comes around, Daft Punk have brought us to a new, liberated place and you wonder why you couldn't have made it their on your own.<br />Discovery is one of the top five albums of the year thus far.  You don't have to take my word for it.  At Madonna's recent Madison Square Garden show, she remixed her highly anticipated oldie \\"Holiday\\" with \\"One More Time.\\"  \\"Holiday\\" has never sounded better.
B00005B4GU|5.0|What a great album! A theme that seems to generate through Radiohead has been their ability to change from album to album. <br />I would have to say that this album in between Kid A and OK Computer. There is a sense of experimentation like that of Kid A however most of the songs a very palitable.<br />One of the positive features of this album has been the band's use of different instruments like the piano and orchestra. This makes the music interesting because they have made a very different sound from most bands.
B000009QPE|1.0|the krunch of the guitar would not be there-in this album by this band titled slayer. todays metal bands (2001) from norway do deliver a punch a strong set of punches when it deals with music in all aspects. the keyboard has been implemented along with the wizards on the guitars who have flourished with their compostions. the band slayer has really lucked out because their stuff has really no meaning when it deals in playing great guitar music. they have no keyboard music at all. and their crunch rhythms are just too slow. .
B00004XONN|4.0|I must admit that I had a lot of difficulty rating Kid A. I can't listen to the whole album - some of the songs are just too much for me, in fact I don't understand them at all. When I bought OK Computer I didn't like this album however after a couple years my view has changed - perhaps Radiohead were just too advanced for me and I will eventually understand Kid A; OK Computer is now one of my favourites.<br />I did give Kid A four stars because of a few songs which are just brilliant. They are very different and intriging. I would suggest you have an open mind if you listen to this album.
B000059HAI|2.0|When I first heard about this film, I had thought that an hour of the film would be devoted to attack on Pearl Harbor. Instead, I watched a thirty minute fight sequence (exciting, but not as visually stunning as the visual effects work and masterful camera work used in the BETTER 40-minute sequence of the massive action epic PEARL HARBOR.) that was preceded by over an hour-and-a-half long introduction that features dull characters and boring talks. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the Japanese sequences involving the plans of attack, and some funny sequences involving oneliners. I also didn't quite agree with their portrayal of Dorie Miller, the mess attendant who shot down two Japanese airplanes, and won the first naval cross for an African-American. The character was only given about ten seconds of film time. I was very upset. The portrayal in PEARL HARBOR was 100% better, given that the role was given to a great actor, Cuba Gooding, Jr. I was also very dissapointed with the way they ended the film. It was too depressing. Nothing was said of what happened after the attack, except for Yamamoto's famous line: &quot;All I fear that we have done is awaken a sleeping giant.&quot; Please, if you want to see a film that takes you back to that time, see PEARL HARBOR, an miss this waste of money. Trust me, you'll save a good amount. Grade: D+.
0767827015|2.0|There are no surprises here in this redundant dud about life in one of the most dangerous places in America, South Central. The characters here feel contrived and even unsympathetic, and the movie tries too hard (and fails) to shed light on a topic that everyone knows very well about.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Only every once and a while does a rap masterpiece like this come out (i.e. Biggies &quot;Ready To Die&quot;, Eazy E's &quot;It's on 187um killer etc.). This album was Tupac's first with Death Row and he did not dissapoint with songs to get you're head moving, or your brain thinking he did it all on two discs of pure west coast goodness. And I know this is going to get me alot of negative votes but...please let the man R.I.P., no more of these ... &quot;hes alive&quot; theories, he's gone and you have to accept it,sorry.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I'm sorry to single out a reviewer, but PLEASE offer an opinion without commanding somebody to buy something over something else. Each can think for themselves to a degree and I believe the men of Radiohead have been reasonable in their actions (ducks to avoid nuclear warfare).
0446604844|4.0|Good plot, lots of twists and turns,likeable heroine(albeit pretty dumb for an attorney)and if you skip all the extraneous detail about the computer programs, it moves along quickly.Would make an exciting and pacy movie.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Sinatra, Basie and Quincy together at the Sands...what a swinging album!  In my book, &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; and the &quot;Tea Break&quot; monologue are worth the price of the album alone.<br />Enough said, because the other reviewers said it all!!!
0792156684|4.0|I've never understood why some small minds need for a film to be so overtly self-conscious. It's  simply a great story. Every writer of great fiction I am familiar with laughed at so much analysis by people too small to write for themselves.<br />Fate hands itself to great and small, no matter what they think about it. The two characters who know that are the only ones really living. There's your heavy idea. Happy now? Oh, wait, you're so smart the movie needs to beat it's ideas into you with a hammer or it sucks. Over and again it needs to first revel in it's own importance, harping on how important it is with ideas. This one doesn't.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Peppers is one of the greatest rock albums ever. This albums showcases the Beatles at their best (also with Revolver, and Rubber Soul of course).  The songs are all very different and there is only one song that is average in my opinion and it is Within Without You. But even Within Without you is a great song. On Sgt. Peppers there are songs liek they would fit on the White Album. There are song s that could go on Abbey Road, Revolver, and Rubber Soul. Whoever produced the Beatles One cd made a huge error they forgot to put some songs from Sgt. Pepper's on it. This is probaly the best Beatles album you can buy. Buy it today!<br />Thank You
0425107469|5.0|This was my first foray into Dean Koontz novels and after having read nearly 20 of them now, MOST of which I thoroughly enjoyed, I think this was by far the best. I've seen his prose get better over time--he's definitely grown as a writer and it's obvious when you compare his recent entries with one like Funhouse. I must admit, however, several of his more recent entries sacrifice the compelling action that got me hooked on Koontz for long-winded descriptive banter that had me skipping paragraphs ahead. Regardless, when it comes to a wonderfully intriguing plot, non-stop action, and a central character that makes you think twice about man's best friend, Watchers is about the best there is.
0446677450|4.0|Excellent motivator! I read 'Cashflow Quadrant' (same author) and instead of spending money on alcohol and 'doodads' I started investing and saving money for my own home. Rich Dad Poor Dad is more of the same. Unfortunately, the information it provides on commerce, finance and investment is based on the system in the USA, which has not yet been instituted in the rest of the world (whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is beside the point...) Many of the ways that R. Kiyosaki suggests that a person can make money is not viable in many parts of the world, and only the general idea is relevant. If this were not so, if R. Kiyosaki wrote for a global community, then this book would have gotten five stars without a question.
0141301120|3.0|It's not as good as the orginal book.And it had phases used in the movie,that were never used int he first book.And it takes place right after they arrive at Charlie's home to go back to the factory.There is no Veruca,Violet,Mike or Augustes in this book.Violet is mentioned a couple times though.There are aliens trying to take oer the world,and Willy Wonka and company stop them.It has explores Charlie's family,unlike the book.
B0000508U6|5.0|My CD collection is extensive, ranging from Punk to classical and I must say that this album has to be one of my all time favorites. I truly believe that this debut album will either take home best new artist or album of the year at the Grammys. The only problem what so ever with this CD is... however will this band be able to top an album such as this. Personally I can't wait till they follow up with the next one, as I will be the first in line to buy it the day it comes out. BUY THIS CD, you won't regret it.
B0000524E5|5.0|If your into the 'chick flick' type movies, then you have to see this movie. Its awesome. It shows real girl power. Girls can have a great time running a bar, too! Its a great movie if your having a girls night in or whatever. Its about a girl whos trying to get a career in writing songs for singers. She moves to New York to try and pursway her career. While shes there, she looks for a job and becomes a Coyote. If you wanna know how the movie ends, you'll have to but it yourself. :) I highly recommend it.
B000002OX7|5.0|In 1971 Pete Townshend attempted to create another rock opera in Lifehouse. However Townshend could not bring the masterpiece, and so Lifehouse went up in smoke. Surviving from the ashes was Who's Next, one of the greatest rock albums ever. The Who are like nothing else you will find in hard rock. Roger Daultrey sings about real things such as the teenage waistland that was the hippie world. Keith Moon creates thunder on the drums that would make him legend. And synthesizer lines on Baba 'o' Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again would also fall into legend. They would only further cement Pete Townshend's genius in rock and roll history. All the way through this edition of Who's Next, it is hard rock. It is at times enlightening, at times forceful, and at times angry though never boring. The album is The Who's moment of perfection. All great artists have such a moment. (The Beatles had Sgt. Pepper, The Stones had Sticky Fingers, Dylan had Blood on the Tracks, Jimi Hendrix had Are You Experienced?, and so on.) The album is also all poetry, with Pete Townshend having composed some of his best work. Simply put the album is hard rock perfection. You can't have a rock 'n' roll collection without it, so get it NOW!
B0000214F3|3.0|There is really nothing special in the plot of this movie, nevertheless, it is a soothing love story.  But, considering the simplicity, length, and slowness of the plot, it is very full of itself.  The director thinks he is directing some great classic worthy of the audiences' time.  He wastes too much time on trivial things, thinking they are important.  Take for example the scene where Joe Black eats peanut butter for the first time.  I'm sure to Joe Black this was a exciting new experience, but the audience does not need such a borefest.  Maybe the director should step down from this seventh heaven and realize this is &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, not &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.  I know the analogy is not parallel, but one gets idea.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|One of the best animation I have even seen. Even I haven't saw Fianl Fantasy: The Spirits Within, I think they are of equal stadard. Best of the Bests.
B00005BJPO|5.0|The new digitally mastered version of Akira is truely a masterpiece in the making.  The picture looks better than ever its crisp and clear with absolutely no blurs!!  It totally blows away the old VHS, Laserdisc, and VCD versions of it!  Most people were upset by the fact that the movie has been Re-Dubbed but my opinion is that the new dub is in fact better than the original.  First of all in the original Dub many things were not stated very clearly due to poor translating such as the jail scene where the Canada and the girl (forgot her name) were in the prison and she was explaining the subject of Akira.  In the original version it was very unclear what she was trying to say and many people were confused saying &quot;Huh what in the world is she talking about&quot;.  In the newly dubbed version everything totally makes sense!  So if you are one of the many Anime fans who saw Akira originally I stongly suggest you to buy the newly remastered version of Akira and if you can try to get this limited edition because it comes in a killer tin case and has a second dsic with a ton of suplimental extras.  But if you cant the regular re-release is still cool.
B00005B36H|5.0|First off, I've been reading other reviews here, and the ones that rated it 5, didnt really seem like they realized what a 5 is. Oh well..Anyways, on with my Reflection on Lateralus. This disc changed my outlook on music altogether. All of the songs are remarkable (even Schism, although the local hard rock radio station overplayed it the way they like to). I must say that I walked around for weeks after the release saying that Lateralus (Track 9) was the best song I had ever heard. I have just never heard a song that sounded like it should. Recently I read an interview where band members mentioned a movie that was \\"Wall\\"-like in a Floydian sense. I will say that 1)It was the most rewarding [price] I have ever spent. 2)It is truly an epic, lyrically and musically. 3)From Floyd to Soul Coughing to DJ Shadow and so on, it is the best CD in my collection. <br />Overall Rating : 10.
6300214370|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre on opening night. I still enjoy watching it. The acting in this movie is great, and the storyline is top notch as well. I think the movie represents the attitudes in small town America as they were. I know of many cases in real life that were a lot like this plot, but in real life the protagonists faired worse than Kevin Bacon. I have heard a lot of bad reviews about this movie from people who watch it today. Mostly because it is a &quot;white&quot; film with almost no racial diversity considering the subject matter. Well, you have to look at the social and cultural context in which the film was made to begin with. I happened to live in a small colorado town during my teen years and HELLO we only had 1 black family in the town. That was reality, as it was in many small towns. And as for the music, mind you, this was about 4 years before the forthcoming of the rudimentary forms of rap and hip hop. Micheal Jackson had more white fans than black, and most blacks listened to rock and roll. You cannot judge this film by modern standards and do it justice. I think that if you keep an open mind you will enjoy this film a great deal.
B0000024SD|5.0|oh how do i explain one of the greatest albums ever created.I remember when this album came on the market a little bit before i was shipping off to vietnam.it really moved in a spiritual sense that i had never felt before(or maybe it was those joints that i had the day i bought the album).The day i bought this album i clearly remember coming home poping on to the record player and just goin off into a trance like state and it wasn't till nearlly the end of the album when my girlfriend came into the room and said something to me did i realise how long i was out of it just lisnening to these great songs of peace and love.this isone the greatest of all times and every person who doesent yet have this piece of art does not yet have a complete collection of music and has not yet really tottaly opend lifes vast horizons .ENJOY
B000002L9M|5.0|Depeche Mode have made yet another wonderful album. And Black Celebration in particular is just fantastic. The album is full of unique classics. Each song is worth listening to. Black Celebration will definitely not let you down, Depeche Mode are real musicians with real talent and Black Celebration will give you a huge taste of just how incredible Depeche Mode are.
B0000029DD|5.0|I was introduced to Jeff Buckley by a program on our dutch music channel. The singer from Live was on tv, and he was picking his favourite songs. After a while, he announced &quot;Grace&quot; from Jeff Buckley. I was mesmerised by the vocal abbility from Jeff, and bought the album later that week. It's one of the best purchases I have ever made. From the opener, you are sucked into a beautiful musical experience. The music style is kind of bluesy, with some rock and ballad added. Jeff's lyrics have a depressive tone, mostly about love and relationships, but it's the way he brings them that make it so flawless. He is in my humble opinion the best male vocalist. He uses his vocal range optimally. His high notes on for example Cohen's cover Hallelujah and Corpus Cristi Carol give me every time goosebumps. The way he brings all the songs intrigues me very much. It's such a shame that the most talented artists die far to early, just like Eva Cassidy did. She and Jeff both had a gift with there voice. They really can MOVE people with their voice. Atleast, they move me.
B00004YMVG|5.0|Henri Salvadors Chambre Avec Vue is a masterpiece. Listen and enjoy!
B00001SIES|5.0|theyve been billed as radiohead for too damn long and maybe this will shut the critics up<br />this is an absolutelyt awesoime album<br />sunburn is truly an awe inspiring song and muscle museum continues this perfectly<br />every song on this album is a classic<br />MUSE RULE
B00000F1D3|5.0|What will be around after the nuclear holocaust? Cocaroaches, and.......CHER!!! The BEST Diva Ever! I love the entire album deeply, and enjoy listening to it whenever Im in a great mood, or need to get into a great mood!  The lyrics for every song were intillectual and intelligant, yet much closer to earth than Madonnas similar tracks.  Cher has not only kept up the beauty that is her and her voice, but she has lit a fire in the hearts of her fans again.  I dont know one Cher fan that isn't expecting her new album in November with every bit of anticipation.  &quot;Believe&quot;, the title track...is great...i never get sick of it, &quot;The Power&quot; is also good, but none of the songs i love more than &quot;Strong Enough&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing.&quot;  Other good songs include &quot;Love is the Groove,&quot; and &quot;Taken Back my Heart&quot;.  &quot;Taxi Taxi&quot; gets somewhat annoying after the 3rd minute passes by, but its the only &quot;below avg&quot; song on the entire album.  &quot;Dove'Lamore&quot; is absolutely spectacular, and i liked the tie to her original music roots by adding in &quot;We All Sleep Alone,&quot; though most say it was filler, I comend her for finding a decent song from her past to fit into her new music.  I beleive &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; is the glue that ties her past music career with her present music career.  I would strongly recomend Believe to any fan of Madonna, also.  Enjoy!
B00005KFUM|5.0|im not sure how the enhanced stuff is supposed to work considering my email doesnt fit into the space so i cant say anything about that but this cd doesnt need any of it. if it cam in a paper bag with nowt else it would still be one of the best cds of the new millenium.<br />there are a few strange tracks on this album but the majority are just mind blowing.<br />new born is like a modern day bohemian rhapsody<br />bliss is an awesome song<br />space dementia, a rather weird offering but showcases the bands ability to pull of any type of music they feel like.<br />hypermusic whoa there just aint enough words to describe this song. no kidding but i think music reaches PERFECTION for about 20 seconds after the 2nd chorus. <br />plug in baby is a great song, the quality riff throughout makes it a good party song and one to shut up all your pop n dance loving mates.<br />citizen erased is another experimental song, starting off with a rather excellent bit of guitar work the song swings from the ends of the spectrum for about 8 minutes before it ends.<br />micro cuts a good one! sounds a bit weird to hear a man singingf like that but who cares, the lyrics are good and so's the tune.<br />im getting abit bored of goingf through the songs now but 'feeling good' deserves a mention too, most modern covers dont work very well but this one does.<br />the album cover and internal artwork is very good, and im sure if the enhanced alemt would work it would be good too.<br />BUY THIS CD<br />best live act ive ever seen too
B00003CXIP|5.0|OK,  my friend Carlos, told me about this film, once in a while, so then he called me and he told me that they were going to broadcast it, in a local chanell, so i watched some scenes, because i forgot, so then believe it or not, just 10 minutes ago, i just saw it, they broadcast it, on TV,on a mexican chanell, and well i simply love this film, it has a wondeful story, wonderful acting, also great music, i plan to buy it TODAY!.
076783819X|5.0|thuis is a good film<br />great acting all the way through and the plot is damn fine too<br />the twists in the stroy kept me hooked throughout and the ending is absolutely mind blowing<br />what a film
B00005B4GU|4.0|I had previously said that this was derivative. Now I've gotten to the point that I'm actually used to it.<br />Kid A was one of the best albums of all-time. This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.<br />It starts out with &quot;Pact....&quot;, which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Door&quot; is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song. &quot;Life In A Glass house&quot; happens to be my favorite track, a dancy tune that has decent vocals. If you're not already interested, get The Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. This isn't their best, but I like it.
6305807043|5.0|With Hollywood cranking out more mindless films each and every year, it's important to take some time to stop and appreciate those rare films that combine strong writing, inventive direction, fine acting and a unique story.<br />&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; fits the bill. But don't go into it expecting standard Hollywood fare. The movie twists your understanding of the movies and leaves you wanting more. Is the story possible or believable? Nope. Does it require the viewer to suspend disbelief? Absolutely. Of course, that's also what makes it so much fun.<br />The film is director Spike Jonez's debut, but he makes the transition from music videos to cinema seamlessly. The acting is top-shelf, with John Malkovich brilliantlty playing himself, the always excellent John Cusack and Cameron Diaz leading the way.
B00005JG6Q|2.0|I, like many others, am a Akira fanatic.  After watching the old dubbed vhs for some many years, I could recite the words like it was the latest trendy pop song.  And maybe that is why I gave the DVD version 2 of 5 stars.  The video, to me, looks no different.  A little brighter in some areas.  Some of the new sounds are good, but not much more then that.  My biggest problem is the new dialog.  I can't stand the sound of these chumps.  I couldnt watch the movie after hearing the sound of some of the characters.  They took the voice of kaneda that sounded like an overconfident punk and turned hmm into some confused kid.  It probably would sound better if every character was voiced by Eddie Izzard, at least then it would be a comedy.  They need to put out a dvd version that has the old dialog on it.  I have yet to watch the dvd all the way through, instead I watch a little bit then throw in the vhs to keep my sanity.  So imho if you are looking to buy Akira, I would get a vhs and hope it is the old dialog or can be returned.  Then again, if you dont own Akira yet, you probably wont care much....
0140186409|3.0|I admit to approaching the reading of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; with some preconceived negative notions.  Having it be a &quot;required&quot; read was also not encouraging.  However, about 100 pages into the story, I became captivated by the Joad family---particularly Tom, a man of great moral integrity, and the strong-willed but loving Ma Joad who provides the family's source of strength and courage in the face of overwhelming adversity.  While some parts may make you flinch in horror, others will make you sad to realize these events really happened in the land of plenty.<br />&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is an engrossing tale of one Oklahoma family seeking not their fame and fortune, but just the hope of putting a few scraps of food on the table.  Join them in their clunker of a truck as all 12 of them pile in to make the long and arduous drive west to California in the hopes of finding work picking fruit.  They lose family members along the way, some by death and some by choice, but they learn a lot about friendship and taking care of not only their loved ones but also the strangers who find themselves in the same dire straits as the Joads are in.  Steinbeck's descriptions of the hunger, the hardship, the futile search for work, the disappointments, the hostile environment the migrants faced in California,  all make for an eye-opening read. This is a great source of information on how it was for one group of people during the Depression.<br />It may not be one of the great novels of the twentieth century, its characters are often overly-sentimental, and its theme is relatively simple, but it is a landmark of literature for the way it portrays the Depression in the western United States. This book has been proven to be an accurate portrayal of the victims of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.<br />Steinbeck alternates plot-driven chapters that feature the story of the Joads with chapters that focus on the large-scale problems of the economic history of California and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners. These large-scale chapters provide background information and a broad world view that gives weight to the Joads' struggle, while the story of the Joads gives the large-scale chapters a sympathetic human face.<br />Whether you love or hate the book, you will probably never forget this story of one family's valiant fight to survive while the world around them collapses and disintegrates.<br />The novel was made into an excellent film in 1940 which starred a very young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad.and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners.

B00000DFTH|5.0|I can't believe this! WTF?? Some of you guys are some fickle fans. Out of all the cds, this one (&quot;Reunion&quot;) is the one I see in the used bin the most...? I just saw Sabbath at Ozzfest a couple of weeks ago and they were AWESOME!!! I WISH they had played all the songs featured on here and for the duration that it appears! If it wasn't for Sabbath and Ozzy keep trying to put out records a LOT of you fans would have ZERO diversion from all the pop crap NOW!

B000000P17|3.0|Like Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zepplin suddenly referring to themselves as The Honeydrippers, Guns N' Roses take a punk vacation on &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; covering a bizarre choice of covers that include punk kings The Dead Boys and The Damned, a doo-wop 50s classic, &quot;Since I don't Have You&quot;, and an uncredited murderer Charles Manson song. The album begins with guitarist Slash doing a spaghetti-western guitar bit in the intro of the doo-wop classic and then the music gets very British and very punk with a genuine anti-social anger stemming from god knows where. Spaghetti westerns, punk classics, doo-wop, profane lyrics, England, Charles Manson, put it all together and what do you got? I don't know. But like what Peter Townsend once said, &quot;There's a message in here somewhere.&quot;
B00005LLKT|5.0|This was an astonishing movie.  One of the best ever.  The casting was perfect, the acting wonderful, theplotline following the book nearly exactly.

With motivation, she tries to make him jealous by becoming a top student. She gets in a program where she helps with real court cases. When they have to defend one of her role models, she proves she's not just a dumb blonde. Go see it now!
B00001X590|5.0|This is an incredible album, showcasing Joe Cocker's unique soulful vocals and brilliant song interpretations. The musicians are first rate, including Henry McCullough, Albert Lee and Jimmy Page, Guitar; Chris Stainton, Tommy Eyre & Steve Winwood, keyboards, and Procol Harum's organist and drummer: Matthew Fisher and the late B.J.Wilson. For me, the highlight of this exceptional set is the title track which was released as a single prior to the album and of course was a huge hit, remaining a classic today. The Joe Cocker biography by J.P. Bean (Omnibus press, 1990) describes how Jimmy Page and B.J. Wilson were last-minute replacements on the track, and Wilson, especially, was credited by Joe with saving the session after 35 unsuccessful takes with Jim Capaldi. In the sound sample on this page, you only hear a few seconds of Wilson's wonderful beats, but I think they're enough to illustrate how instrumental he was to the success of the song. There's fantastic musicianship throughout this CD, a must-have for fans of big, soulful exciting rock.
B00003CX5P|2.0|What can I say? Episode One is now two years old but still I have trouble watching it and not frowning at the whole atmosphere of it. It just isn't Star Wars. Sure, it's 30-something years before A New Hope and things are bound to be different, but what was lacking in mise-en-scene should at least have been recreated in style or tone. The style is all wrong because none of the original designers or artists were invlolved. And just how much CGI can one squeeze into a movie without it hitting overkill. Lucas as created here a behemoth of a movie that is both inconsistent, unengaging and unintelligent. His problem is that back in the 70s he, along with Spielberg, Coppola, de Palma, Scorcese et al had something significant to contribute to cinema at an artistic level. They all accomplished that, and all we have left are the assimilated remains of their expended genius. Luke Skywalker, the dreamer that every boy wanted to be, racing off on wild adventures away from ordinary life, is not substituted with an equally accessible character here. Everyone is already special. That's too bad.<br />As for the DVD and it's multitudes of extras - who gives? Sure, all the supplementary material is a shrewd move on the part of Lucas but please, how far can he milk his fanbase before they all wake up and give him the collective finger. My fingers are firmly crossed for Lord of the Rings; even though this trilogy is destined to be CGI-hell also, we can rest more easily in the knowledge that it is at least a character-driven story, one about courage and spirit, and one that Lucas himself has forgotten how to write.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I don't have this CD but I heard all of the the songs in full version on a website. I must say that the songs are better,MUCH BETTER than the ones on ''...Baby One More Time''.  The songs are upbeat and you don't have worry about cursing or sex ,so it is something everyone can listen to.  Oops! shows that Britney's voice has matured and has gotten much better.  The  song that proves this is ''Where Are You Now''.  Near the end, she hits this note that you would expect from Jessica Simpson or Christina Aguilera . That surprized me.  So all you grandparents out there, go pick this up for the kids!
B00005JY1B|4.0|I loved this movie. I thought it had some comidy some drama lots of romance and a lot of sadness/drama. But it was really good, and i loved the acting. Charleze Thron was the best Kenue Reeves was a little rusty in the biggining but in the middle got really good.
B000002BQK|5.0|The first line of &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;honey got me hooked on you&quot;, says it all. From the instant you listen to the first track you will be hooked on this fabulous album. Continuing with her own tradition of one word album titles and one word first singles, Butterfly is simply the best albums Mariah has written, produced, and sang on. <br />Track One &quot;Honey&quot;- The first single off the album, this became Mariahs 12th Number 1 hit. This is the song that put Mariah into the pop record books. Whenever you watch a countdown that has Mariah on it, this is most likely the song you will see on it. <br />Track 2 &quot;Butterfly&quot;- My personal favorite track on the record, Butterfly is one of the most underated songs sang by Mariah, as she didnt make it one of the singles off the album. I love it and I'm sure anyone who listens to it will too. This song shows how after breaking up her marriage with former husband she if now free to to fully grasp her new found freedom<br />Track 3 &quot;My All&quot;- Mariahs 13th number 1 hit. I love this song &quot;My All&quot; is all Mariah. She uses no background singers, which only enhances her voice more. One of the most sensual songs shes ever written/sang  <br />Track 4 &quot;Rooftop&quot;-LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! Definetly one of the best from the album. My favorite part is during the bridge when her voice soars high and low as she sings the beautiful lyrics shes written<br />Track 5 &quot;Fourth Of July&quot;- Mariah really showcases her voice on this track, right out from the beginning she hits that unmistakable high note that has made her 5 octave voice famous. My fav part being the bridge again<br />Track 6 &quot;Breakdown&quot;- another underrated song on this album, Krazie Bone and Wish Bone lend their vocal and rap skills to this track. Its delightful and can also be found on the MY ALL single<br />Track 7 &quot;BabyDoll&quot;- for some reason this song has always reminded me of &quot;crybaby&quot; from rainbow. though its quite the opposite. on this track mariah speaks of waiting for her lover to call. another classic, can also be found on her &quot;valentine&quot; cd only released at wal mart(one of the best 5.99's i've spent)<br />Track 8 &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;- Not one of my favorites, though the song is quite exceptional she speaks of her troubles of her childhood. i happen to like the chorus which isnt words, just &quot;da da da...&quot; its really quite lovely<br />Track 9 &quot;Whenever You Call&quot;- though it is quite lovely with mariah singing by herself, i found the remake with brian mcnight is much better, you can truly understand the song and its meaning better when its a duet (the remake is on her #1's lp)<br />Track 10 &quot;Fly Away&quot;- most people dont seem to like this song all that much, but i think it only enhances the beauty of the song &quot;butterfly&quot; i loved it, but you may have your own opinion<br />Track 11 &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;- i have to say that this is my least favorite song on this album. it just doesnt do anything for me. her voice just isnt featured on this, and i really miss it. it could be a great song but its lacking something<br />Track 12 &quot;Outside&quot;- quite a lovely song though i never seem to listen to it all that much its another of her underappreciated songs and should really be sooner on the album this is mariah speaking from her soul, and it one of her best ballads <br />What I'm trying to say is that THIS IS MARIAHS BEST PIECE OF WORK YET!! go buy it(i own two, one for the car and one for the house) its truly the cd to put on after a long day, the quiet tones and powerful vocals with soothe you and make you feel tons better. listen to it once and i promise this will never leave your cd rotation.
B00004Z459|4.0|I am usually not a fan of the nu-metal/rap-rock movement at all, but this is a good CD. This is much more than Limp Bizkit garbage, these guys actually have lyrics that are...somewhat meaningful. The idea of having two vocalists sets this band away from the crowd, both vocalists are good, and they both have different strengths and weaknesses, which makes this album rare in the fact it has good rap AND good screaming in it. One thing about rap rock that is dissapionting is some vocalists can be great singers, but their rapping voice is horrible, which can greatly degrade an otherwise decent album. All of the songs on this CD are at least decent, except I really dislike track 10. Besides that, this is a great CD and it can be enjoyed by alot of people.
0783208227|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I first saw it when my grandmother brought it over from my cousin's house, where she was staying at the time. I was a little hesitant to watch it at first. As a matter of fact, when I looked at the back and saw the dancing people, I actually thought it was a musical!! Now this movie is among my favorites of all time. Robert Downey Jr. is a great comedian and one of my favorite actors. I rewind back to see the group of friends singing &quot;Walk Like A Man&quot; over and over. My favorite ghost is Milo. Tom Sizemore is very charismatic, and he shouldn't have taken so many serious parts (in Bringing Out the Dead and Red Planet) afterwards. Or I guess I should say &quot;parts in serious movies&quot; because his character in Bringing Out the Dead wasn't that bad and I haven't seen Red Planet. But the long and short of it is, rent the movie. It's hilarious, wonderful, and inspirational, and I highly recommend it.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Blink 182's fourth cd, Enema of the State, was a big dissapointment to most &quot;hardcore&quot; blink fans who owned their first three CD's. After this was released, the band began making TRL appearances and where victims of constant MTV airplay. Now, is this CD as bad as most hardcore punks say it is? Not really. Blink has a more professional sound to the album, which can partly be attributed to the new drummer, Travis. You can really hear Travis' influence in thie first track, Dumpweed. The music style for Blink is not alot different from Dude Ranch. They still play pretty fast and their lyrics...well...they aren't much different either. All in all Enema is a decent offering, not nearly as good as Dude Ranch or Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, it is still the weakest off Blink's CDs. Better tracks include Dumpweed, Don't Leave Me, Going Away to College, What's My Age Again?, Dynestery Gary, and Mutt.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I resisted seeing Cast Away for months. I heard that for most of the movie, the only onscreen action was Tom Hanks. On an island. Alone. No snappy dialogue, no car chases through San Francisco. No ostensible villains. What kind of decent film is that? An excellent one! I was so wrong not to see this earlier. Tom Hanks is riveting in an Oscar-worthy performance. Hanks is Chuck Nolan, a Type-A Fed Ex manager whose life is run by the minute hand. At one point, he even shouts &quot;Tick Tock! Tick Tock!&quot; at a lethargic Fed-Ex'er. When the Fed Ex plane he's riding on crashes in the Pacific, he gets his toughest assignment ever, forced to discover his real resources. It's fascinating to see what happens to a man who was once defined by the shortness of time, suddenly forced to grapple with more idle time than anyone could want. The ensuing battle of wit and survival held my attention completely (contrary to my expectations). The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is that the ending seemed a little rushed.<br />The promos, part of the DVD bonus disc, ask, &quot;What happens when everything you are is taken away?&quot; Another take on this movie is that almost all of us will sooner or later be in a situation where we feel that this is indeed the case ... loss of a relationship, job, health, etc. can lead to the encroaching sense of isolation and despair we see Nolan fighting. The movie is inspirational in showing how strong the human spirit can be.<br />There are also fine performances by Helen Hunt and Chris Noth (Sex And The City's Mr. Big!)<br />The bonus disc is terrific. It will answer just about every question you have about the movie's behind-the-scenes. It even includes interviews with the very interesting &quot;primitive technology&quot; experts consulted during the movie's production.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is just an incredible piece of work from start to finish.  Once everything is all said and done, I believe this will be recognized as the best example of Tool's greatness.
B000002ITW|5.0|4 Way Street by CSNY is quite an essential bit of listening for fans of this supergroup. The first disc, which is entirely acoustic, consists of the four members of the group each taking turns in the spotlight. Unfortunately, there's relatively little of the guys performing as a group, hence, there's not much of their excellent harmonies. The performances are terrific, though and there's some excellent acoustic guitar playing. I just wish that Stephen Stills had more songs on here. Stills gets fewer songs than any member of the group. 49 Bye-byes/America's Children is a dissappointment, as is Suite Judy Blue Eyes. It's just the doo-doo doo doo doo part and only lasts about thirty seconds. Love The One You're With and Black Queen are very good however. Even if you don't like CSN, there's plenty of good stuff here for Neil Young fans. On The Way Home, Don't Let It Bring You Down, Cowgirl In The Sand, the Loner/Cinnamon Girl/Down By The River medley, plus a jam-filled live version of Southern Man and an excellent Ohio. The second disc is electric and the main course is two long jams, Southern Man and Stills' Carry On, both of which feature great guitar deuling between Neil Young and Stephen Stills. Pre-Road Downs and Long Time Gone are pretty good, but don't match the album versions. Finally, the album ends on a high note with Stills' acoustic Find The Cost Of Freedom, a wonderful conclusion to a very good album. <br />4 Way Street will be of interest to anyone who likes CSNY or Neil Young, it's definitely worth picking up.
B000007T1M|5.0|SYSTEM OF a DOWn's debut is def. one of my personal all time favs.. just a great debut, such a distinctly awesome style, a great lead singer.  This is def. one of the most cutting edge albums in a long time, id just hope they follow this up with a nice sophmore effort, and not catch the Staind disease!
0060934913|1.0|I could not put this book down.Having worked in the restaurant business for many years, I was taken by the way Mr. Bourdain captured the down to earth grittiness and fun of behind the scenes.A great read!
B00003CX5P|5.0|I am very excited to be seeing this DVD.  I only hope that Lucasfilm is hard at work on the originals as well. I liked &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; a great deal. The key...an open mind.  Lucas was making a movie for a new generation, and he had at his disposal a variety of tools that he could only dream of with &quot;A New Hope.&quot; If you look at the movie without trying to read a ton of stupid nonsense into it, he has made a great start to a new story based on a previous story in HIS universe. If he wants to explain the force as a relationship with a symbiotic lifeform, let him. As far as Anakin being &quot;too nice,&quot; that is only going to further help create the tragic story of his descent into the dark side under Palpatine. Remember, the only positive ending to this trilogy will be the twin children of Amadala and Skywalker. The third episode will truly be a Shakespearean level tragic story of star crossed lovers divided by forces larger than themselves, set in one of the grandest universes ever created. Think about that, and suddenly Jar Jar doesn't seem to matter all that much. So, in the meantime,&quot;Bringzee ona zee DeeVeeDeez!&quot;
B00004STJD|4.0|The French have always had a way with farce, going back as far as the Middle Ages and again, they show they are the masters of this genre, with a wickedly funny movie of idiocy, mistaken identity and frenetic shenanigans - a must-see for anyone who loves comedy.
B00003CXSP|4.0|We saw what Hannibal could do with his mind in the silence of the lambs, now it is time to see what he can do physically. We needed to see what put him in the asylum in the first place which this film does well. Because where the story began about Dr. Hannibal Lecture in the book Red Dragon he was already in prison. Then comes Silence of the Lambs which did well in showing the mind of a monster he was still in a cell. And when they mention what he did to the nurse they didn't let you see the picture so we never got a full idea of why he is in a cell in the first place. I believe thats what we needed to see in the movie Hannibal and I believe thats what we saw in Hannibal. <br />Dont get me wrong I thought the book was great and better than the film but that was only because it gave a better view of the elegance of the character Hannibal. It showed that hannibal only killed the rude. But the book did not give a good enough depiction of why he was thrown in a cell. The movie showed what happened to the nurse. It showed the true monster Hannibal is. It showed how evil he is and what placed him in a cell.<br />The movie needed more scenes of the elegance of Hannibal. That is the only thing that is missing really in the movie. As in for the ending I believe that I like the movie ending better than the book ending because the book ending didn't leave room for another book. Which is not usually a problem but I believe that the book Hannibal did not explain everything that needed to explain. I believe that it didn't complete the story of its main characters. So the movie ending left it open so that it could explain the rest of the story.<br />The movie with its small special effects really sealed a four star rating. They brought out the true emotions in the important scenes with flashes, slow motion, and through the sound track music. <br />There were a couple of parts in the book in which I wished were in the film for example why didn't they mention the sixth finger that hannibal had? And there are many other things that I wished were in the film.<br />I did not believe that the film was scary nor gory. I belive that the film was not supposed to be depicted as a scary film. Yes I believe that it was possible that it could have gotton a higher rating than R for like the ending scene with Hannibal on the airplane. You know what I am talking about. But with me growing up in an age of violence I have seen worse. There are some graphic scenes such as when they show you on video what happens to the nurse but I believe you needed to see it. <br />My overall view is that it is a good film. It dipicted the evil side of Hannibal In which we have never whitnessed before. The only flaws were that it didn't show his nice side to people who treat him with respect as well as it should have. It didn't show enough of his elegance as it did in the book. He shouldn't have tried to meet clarice as he said in Silence of the Lambs. The book made it as a coensedence that they met.
B00005JKGI|5.0|Great Film, Great chases, Great British Humour, classic lines!!!. <br />Michael Caine is, well, Michael Caine but the film could have been written for him.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The greatest kids film ever made -that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages.   This film has everything treasure, adventures, bad guys, chunk & sloth and corey feldman! I love this film and finally we've got the dvd we all wanted. I cannot wait until this comes out!!
B00004XQP4|1.0|OK for all of you O-Town, errr, Green Day, groupies that say how Green Day has NOT sold out, you could not be more wrong. Green Day used to be an incredible band...in fact, 'Ker-Plunk' is on my top ten punk albums list. However, when you start a punk band, you pledge not to give into the commercial music industry. You pledge not to do it for the money or fame, but for the love of music and for the fans. Green Day may now consider punk rock and all these ideals which go hand and hand with it 'a joke', but the joke is on them. Just listen to this crap! Green Day certainly did mature with this album...mature as in senior citizen. I doubt that my grandparents would even find this music fast enough. Here's an idea: Why don't we start a punk band, make three incredible albums, sell out, and then start playing elevator music! And to cover up the fact that our music is awful, we can make fun of punk and our loyal punk fans, because MTV will like us more that way! We may become sellouts but who cares, we'll be rich! Give me a break.<br />For those of you that do think punk is a joke, perhaps you should study up on the genre a bit more. Punk is about being yourself. It's about not caring what other people think; not trying to be someone that you're not. And the lyrics written by most punk bands are nothing short of incredible. The music is actually good, like Green Day used to be. Do yourself a favor. If you are not a boy band groupie, buy yourself some real music. Osker, NOFX, Pennywise, Less Than Jake...all real bands. Buy Green Day's older stuff, even...just not this.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!  This movie may have been criticized as being not only bad but just plain horrible!  That's because people compared this movie too much to 'The Silence of the Lambs'.  'Hannibal' is not like 'Lambs' because 'Hannibal' is a thriller but I'm not saying that 'Lambs' is bad because it certainly is not.  'Lambs' is more drama and dark while 'Hannibal' is a thrill-ride and at some times funny.      People were skeptical about Julianne Moore replacing Jodie Foster not because they thought Julianne can't act but just because Jodie was in the first one and wasn't in 'Hannibal'.  Julianne Moore did a great job to make us forget about Foster which is what was needed.  Also, in this movie I just couldn't picture Jodie Foster being in it.  Julianne Moore stole all the scenes she was in and really did a great job acting that she was being stalked by this cannibal who is obsessed with her.    Speaking of Anthony Hopkins, he did a great job as Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter.  Like with the movie in general, his role was not like the role in 'Lambs'.  If it was possible, he seemed more calm in this role.  He has been living the great life under a different name in Italy for the past several years which must be a lot nicer than that glass jail cell from the first movie.  It was great to hear him utter lines like, 'Goody-goody', 'Okey-dokey', and 'Well, let's gets this thing going' right in the middle of drama scenes where you think he's going to do something like kill the person but then takes you away.      The movie was really a thriller and kept you on the edge of your seat.  You really can't say whether this movie was better than 'The Silence of the Lambs' because they are 2 completely different movies.  So if you're wanting to see 'The Silence of the Lambs Part 2', this is not it.  'Hannibal' is a great movie and completely recommend it because it's a lot of fun to watch and for parents unsure about their kids seeing it, there's only a little bit of profanity.I didn't find any of the violence offensive or gross and their was no sexuality of any unless you count some of the Italian sculptures/statues.  This is a great movie.
0670824399|3.0|I read half of it, and didnt care for it too much. I saw the movie a long time ago and have been wanting to read it but was dissapointed. i only got to the chapter called \\"Lavender\\" then stopped becos i had to go on vacation and return the book. IMO, i think the movie with Danny Devito as Mr. Wormwood is WAY better. more entertaining and funny and cute. The book was just too childish and farfetched compared to the movie. Hmm, i'm twisted. Ok. there's my 1 cent.
B00004X01U|5.0|Music-Could there be a more simple title?? This is a fun album. I love it. It's fun to listen to, it's fun to dance to, it's fun to do anything to it. I think it's a great album because it's simple. The best songs??? Well.... Don't Tell Me-It was all over the radio when it came out and the video was popular. The guitar riffs were easily memorized as were the words &quot;Tell me love isn't true/It's just something that you do&quot;. Music-Come on. It's catchy!! It revives the music, partyer Madonna we know from Everybody, Holiday, and Express Yourself. I'm still surprised that it didn't win a Grammy. The use of words like &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; and &quot;boogie-woogie&quot; are great. Those deep bass sounds are awesome. I Deserve It-Here's a true folk song which is what about half of this album is all about. It almost sounds sad but also she seems to resent the press since she's probably singing about husband Guy Ritchie and &quot;deserving&quot; him. And those synthesizer sounds at the end sound really cool. What It Feels Like For A Girl-This song sounds the most perfect of the whole album. The flowing of the music synth sounds in and out through the seconds are sound truly professional (and that's what she is). This is yet another 'Power to the Women' to add to the list. And of course the rest of the songs are exceptional. 'Music' is right at the top or 2nd for great Madonna albums. I recommend it completely.
0399208534|5.0|A very hungry caterpillar hatches out of an egg one Sunday morning and eats different foods each day of the week.  When it is full, it makes a cocoon and transforms into a butterfly.  This picture book will delight as well as instruct younger children, teaching them days of the week, some numbers, and the life cycle of the butterfly.  I liked the book because of its appealing text and colorful pictures on die cut pages.  The illustration on the last page will amaze you!
B000002AGB|5.0|This album is an absolute must for any fan of The Who or early 70's music. The Who perform arguably their greatest live performance ever. In addition to doing the complete album of &quot;Tommy,&quot; there are vintage versions of &quot;Magic Bus,&quot; &quot;Water,&quot; and &quot;My Generation,&quot; with Pete Townshend in top form. If you're a Who fan, you simply have to buy this set.
0790736314|5.0|This is the one movie I refuse to have in my house because it scared the %@#! out of me both times I saw it.  Once as a pre-teen when it first came out and most recently for the &quot;extra footage&quot;.  I probably will never see this movie again.  It's that scary.  Any movie dealing with something that may actually happen in real-life is serious stuff.  <br />Just look at how many reviews are in here.  Almost 400? Is that a record? That in itself should tell you something. If you don't want to spend the rest of your life with disturbing images burned into your head from this film, don't watch this movie.  Of course, having read that comment, you're just going to get it, aren't you? I don't scare easily but I'm telling you.  When I saw the &quot;spider walk&quot; I screamed and grabbed the person next to me. In fact, just about everyone in the theatre reacted loudly.  Nuff said. <br />My only advice is: Don't watch this alone and don't sit near a staircase if &amp; when you do.
6302994063|5.0|Being that this movie is my all-time-favorite, I am probably a little partial to it.  If you are fan of any of Baz Luhrmann's other works (i.e. &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;) you should be prepared because this work is different.  The jerking camera angles are not present in this film nearly as much as in the other two.  As with the other two films, Mr. Luhrmann uses music to keep the story going.  In this movie, you will find a beautifully and solidly told story.  It's a different kind of love story in which our couple is brought together through dancing.  No, this isn't &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; in Australia.  This is a truly original story that will leave you laughing (at times maybe even rolling on the floor) and you will finish the movie with the wonderful warm-fuzzy feeling that you can only get from a truly fun movie.
B00005BL2A|1.0|Since Alan left, DM has gone down hill.  Martin may still write the songs, but he relys on &quot;Tim and the Team&quot; (a bunch of producers in the studio) to create their music.  I've listened to every track on this new POS album and found it all to be even worse than &quot;Ultra&quot;.  <br />Listening to the songs, I thought &quot;Would someone PLEASE put some drum beats &amp; good synth grooves into this stuff?&quot;<br />It is sparse, Way too over-vocal (David was apparantly told to abandon his baritone singing in favor of his equally awful &quot;Ultra&quot; era high-note vocals which are way too forward in the mix) and it lacks any kind of brilliant musicianship/melodic pop brilliance that albums like &quot;Violator&quot; and &quot;Songs of Faith &amp; Devotion&quot; had.<br />Don't let this new CD fool you.  This is NOT Depeche Mode.  It sounds like Gore worked with some horribly inept producer in the studio for a week, then invited David to sing for a day, and eventually invited Andrew to come along &amp; learn the easiest keyboard part possible so he could play something on the tour.<br />Take my advice.  Do you like Depeche Mode?  Then buy &quot;Songs of Faith &amp; Devotion&quot;, &quot;Violator&quot;, &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, and &quot;Black Celebration&quot; right here at Amazon.com.  The purchase of those incredibly-done albums are all that Depeche Mode is worth anymore.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Baz Luhrmann has done it again.  With his innovative use of camera angles and abrupt, drastic movements this truly remarkable director has brought the Moulin Rouge to life.  Mr. Luhrmann has used music to enhance his past shows and this new work is no exception.  The breathtaking scenery and amazing costumes are feasts for the eyes.  The storyline is simple and yet very beautiful and touching.  If you have not seen it yet, by all means, find a theater and go....as soon as possible!
B00001QEE9|5.0|This might've been the very first Disney Animated Classic I ever saw in my life, and definitly the best of the &quot;old&quot; Disney animated fatures (Lion King is probably the best of the &quot;new&quot; ones).  Those first few lyrics during the opening credits just give me the chills every time.<br />&quot;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are...&quot;<br />Upon hearing that song, your mind goes PURE DISNEY.  It's great.  It's the same feeling you get when you ride Pirates of the Carribean (&quot;THIS IS A CLASSIC!!&quot;).  I saw it many times as a kid, and then I didn't watch it for several years.  The other day I decided to rent it, and watching it as a 19 year-old is alot different then watching it in the single-digit age years.  Back then, I didn't pay as much attention to plot as I do now, and this movie has a great plot, even for adults, along with great visuals for the kids.  If you haven't seen this version, go rent it or even buy it!  You won't be disappointed in this great Disney Classic.
630575067X|2.0|I am being rather generous when I give this 2 Stars. I keep on hearing all this stuff about how it being impossible to beat the original trilogy and how true Star Wars fans will like episode 1.   Yeah right.  The true Star Wars fans will be the ones who like a good story and great acting (original trilogy) rather than watching all the neat stuff George Lucas can do with the technology making weird looking aliens and neat looking ships (episode 1). It boggles my mind to see how true fans would like episode 1 the most. Maybe I have different tastes. Sure, there were great fighting sequences, great ships, neat planets, neat costumes, weird aliens and much more! But does a great movie rely on just that kind of stuff. I have taken polls on the people's most favorite star wars movie, and almost all the time The Empire Strikes Back was the most liked. I am not saying this should be everyone's favorite. I am just trying to get this point across. The Empire Strikes Back DID have the least amount of weird creatures, it also used the least amount of big technology, the people were real, and it also had a great story. So do the next two movies that are coming out really need to rely on all the digital stuff or can't George Lucas remodel off of the trilogy. People's expectations might have been a little high on episode 1, and it might have been impossible to mount to the original trilogy. BUT to me George Lucas seemed like impressing the audiences with the high flying, loud, technology cities, which is all a special effects show.     I have noticed that I can feel I have a special bond with the characters of the trilogy, because they are GREAT actors and have good, interesting personalities. It's hard to get aquainted with stupid characters like Jar Jar. Also to me the main cast seemd quite weak and boring. I just couldn't get in with the movie.    Lastly, the story was really weak. Anakin was esp. weak. I mean him having no idea what he is doing in that ship and somehow managing to blue up that space droid control station is weird to me. To wrap it up, the TRUE star wars fans will be watching it for a GOOD STORY and a GOOD CAST, NOT A SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOW WITH A FEW HUMANS MIXED WITH TONS OF WEIRD CREATURES. That's all!
B00000J6AG|4.0|After hearing this album OVER AND OVER I eventually began to like it and finally purchased it.  Although some of the songs are really just mixes of other songs, the art isn't lost.  There's alot of creativity to be found here.  Enjoy it.
B000031XCR|5.0|Now today people we are going to listin to some real cool stuff do u know what i am saying oh ha ha ha i crack myself up.  Well anyway i just really like her and all that.  Oh my she is just wanderfull how she sings and all that.  The first time i heard it I fell in love with it.  Thats all i have to say about precious.
B00004XONN|5.0|In the abandoned film set of Kubrick's The Shining, the ghosts of Stravinsky and Anthiel sit listening to an old scratched Van Der Graaf Generator album.Off in the distance, a diamond dog howls at the icy moon, as the two phantoms, startled, decide to discuss the current music scene.&quot;Kid A&quot; says a cantankerous Igor to a slightly drunk now shape-shifting Charles Ives-George Lygeti-Edgar Varese, &quot;A--a funny thing occured to me this morning.&quot; &quot;What's that?&quot; says Scriabin, suffering the bends from the hotel's mountaintop altitude. &quot;I think we've charted&quot;
B000006NUW|5.0|...or at least an excellent start.  This set packs together virtually all of the Motown classics you'll remember from the radio throughout the 60's, many of which are extremely hard to find anywhere else.  <br />The complaints about the mono mixes doesn't wash with me - I've listened on headphones, on tapes made of these in the car, and on a giant stereo system, and they all sound great to me.  These are directly from the masters, so they sound as good as possible - a stereo remix would've required substantial restructuring.<br />The only complaint I have is that I prefer other artists' versions of a couple of these (and I do mean only a couple), but you can't blame them for putting out primarily the original artists' versions.<br />The music itself is vibrant, catchy, and full of emotion.  It truly reveals the musical genius exhibited by the classic songwriters and arrangers in Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy.  Their contributions to modern music cannot be overestimated.<br />In all, this is an absolutely *essential* set for any fan of popular music (or of music in general).  Throw these in a four or five disc changer and get housework, homework, or just a nice relaxing afternoon of reminiscing on old memories done.

B0000399WI|5.0|This movie, despite what the critics had to say about it is the best movie I have ever watched.  It showed and brought to life so many emotional struggles and discoveries.  Friendship, trust, love, betrayal.. just to name a few.  It to me showed the true power of friendship despite the worlds/systems influences. It is a must buy.. must watch film that is truly one of our nations best dramas!
B000059MPH|3.0|Fans of murder mysteries, especially those of Agatha Christie, will want to check out this mystery about the murder of an American heiress (played by Lois Chiles) on board a boat sailing down the Nile.  Almost all the passengers on board have a reason to do away with her, and someone does the deed.  It's up to passenger and sleuth extraordinaire Hercule Poirot, this time played by Peter Ustinov, to exercise his little gray cells to find the answer as the bodies begin to pile up.  The mystery itself is quite entertaining to try and solve, with enough surprises to more than keep your attention.  Ustinov brings humour to the Poirot character, and is amusing in a different take on the famed fictional detective.  The supporting cast is filled with terrific actors, but unfortunately, they're not given much individual screen time to establish their characters.  However, Angela Lansbury as the drunken author of steamy romance novels has a field day with her character, staggering from scene to scene to great effect.  Mia Farrow also gets some juicy scenes.  Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, as wealthy, jewellery loving old woman and her much put upon nurse, have a great chemistry together, insulting each other with style, but they aren't given much else to do.  It's not often you see Davis blending into the background!!  Others, like Jack Warden, David Niven, George Kennedy, and Olivia Hussey, are effective in underwritten roles.  Victim Lois Chiles is quite stiff and doesn't deliver much of a performance at all.  But apart from not fleshing out the characters enough, the film maintains the suspense, is great to look at (great scenery and costumes), is well scored, and the climax of the mystery is quite satisfying.  Also, as an aside, it is unusually violent for a Christie story/movie, with repeated shots of murders.  All in all, it's good, but not great mystery entertainment.
B000050XEI|2.0|After thoroughly enjoying her previous releases, I found this cd a little tiring and not as imaginative.  Obviously, a cd you like you keep nearby and at-hand.  Unfortunately, this cd has been banished to that big tall cd tower in my living room after less than a dozen listens.
6304711891|5.0|Just a comment/correction about your critique on the fact that Sean Connery's charcter John Mason would not be able to know about the Kennedy Assasination of 1963 because he was imprisoned in '62.  <br />When the FBI Director Womack first arrives at San Francisco with Stanley Goodspeed(Cage), Womack tells the Bay Area leader Paxton that &quot;Mason was imprisoned in 1962, ESCAPED IN '63...&quot; <br />I've seen &quot;The Rock&quot; about 40 times without exaggerating and wanted to clear that out.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I love trains. After \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" I realized why I had so much passion about trains storied away, especial a David Lean train, those long winding black serpents that cross the desert like hells messenger. I love trains, because they carry me off to another place, another time. \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is no different from the trolley I wrap around the Christmas tree. The movie is its own personality. <br />The personality of \\"Lawrence\\" is locked inside the cinematography, acting, and directing which is neatly sealed in the DVD. The personality of the movie parallels T.E. Lawrence's ego. A man who elevates himself to a God like status by crossing and rampaging the desert. The movie builds up as well, from the first minute to the last it transforms to one of the greatest films ever. <br />What we learn for Lawrence is not about a man at that stage in his life but more on how he went so far in his short time. Peter O'Toole has the blue eyes of man gazing at his destiny; he takes a long look into the future, his death, and the journey he has embarked upon. Those blue eyes that always seem to be burning like the desert and the imaginative camera work creates a sort of archeology out of the movie. It teaches us so much about the hard times of World War I and as I stated before, T.E.'s rise to near perfection.<br />One of the most interesting things is that T.E. Lawrence blows part of the famous train away. He does this so that he can raid the train. It is certainly one of Hollywood's most memorable moments. If the train represents a certain fragrance of freedom to me, I tend to think that Lawrence might have been on the same train in that thought. Whereas I expand on the dream of freedom and, Lawrence choose to take down the train for personal gain so that he could walk towards the Sun for a brief moment. That is what we must understand in the end. It is better to travel on the train, watch the train as cuts across the desert ... or place it in a particular spot fordecoration. This is so much better than tearing the train apart for personal gain. Make a great gain by purchasing this wonderful film.
B000000OUE|5.0|An incredible Album! The musical assault never lets up.  Rob Zombie and the rest put on an incredible performance.  It is too bad the band broke up before they could do another one.  The use of technology in the recording is intense.  Makes for excellent driving music, or music to do homework by.  Would highly recommend this album for any fan of White Zombie, or of high intesity metal.

0393317552|2.0|Although the subject of GG&amp;S is interesting, and does shed some light on why, when and how different civilizations originated/developed, the book is so repetitive, that I did not bother to read the last 50 pages.

B000002LIM|5.0|If there is one score that has done it, not only for me, but for hundreds of other people out there, Batman the original score has to be THE one.  It is true I purchased this score after Star Wars, but this is so much more complex and opened up a million different doors into the world of movie scores.  It is such a complex, amazement that I listen to over and over again.  I've owned this score for about 5 years now, and still cannot not listen to it at least twice a month.  <br />It is true that most of the album is dominated by the dark-heroic theme of its name, but there is far, far more to it than just the theme.  If you plan to purhcase this CD, you must listen to everything in its entirety.  There are so many beautiful pieces in this cd that it's quite complicated in describing a favorite. <br />The general synopsis of the way the music follows on this CD is very close to a story in itself.  The opening three tracks offer a grand introduction to the hero and also to the creation of a maniacal monster.  The First Confrontation is probably my most listened track.  It's gradual rising in action from the initial cellos to the strings to the brass is quite a cool track to listen to.  To me, it is a very complicated piece and perfectly encompasses the feeling of the chase throughout the chemical plant.  And when Batman enters the scene, the piece moves in a more intensified scenario.  Very good chase music.  There is also a 'falling' theme towards the end of the track, which is also used in effect during the Final Confrontation.  Take note of the lone strings around 3:30 and compare it to the Finale Confrontation.  Just a good example of some of the subleties to this score.  <br />After these first three tracks, everything slows down as it seems well, and gradually grows as the plot unfolds.  Tracks four to fifteen are the main chunk of the movie, and are expressed through mystery, discovering secrets, and unfolding madness of the joker.  The Descent into Mystery hasto be a classic Elfman piece, and is definitely a must have even on mp3!  But unnoticed goes the track proceeding it, The Bat Cave, which perfectly accentuates the sense of mystery Batman has.  The subtlety in this piece is quite a fine example of much of the unmentioned music that goes on for Elfman.  And now for the finale.  I consider the finale to be tracks fifteen and up.  If there is one thing that I'd want to see (or hear) in my lifetime would be to just hear these seven tracks played in concert.  The variations in all these tracks offer some of Elfman's grandest, most powerful music he's done.  These tracks sum up the movie's music; ranging from heavily heroic flights through Gotham to the most beautiful track I believe the Cd has to offer.  Up the Cathedral has to be one of the darkest pieces I have heard from Elfman thus far.  It is not flamboyant Elfman here, but rather a very gothic nature it takes.  It truly resemble scaling a centuries-old cathedral in the pale twilight of the moon.  I have used this track a few times when learning monologues to get 'in the mood'. <br />Then, the finale shifts to the a complete shift in gears from the cathedral to that of joker's 'waltz to the death'.  Whenever I ask someone about what they remembered from Batman, the one answer I receive 99% of the time is 'the crazy part at the end where they're dancing and fighting'.  A really fun, kooky side to the movie, reflecting the joker and his 'violent mood swings'.  After the waltz, it goes onto the the Final Confrontation, which actually contains a heightened version of the First Confrontation.  (When you notice that similarity in the music, then you know you've been listening for a long, long time!) The Final Confrontation is a very good climax piece as fate shifts from Batman to the Joker, and of course, bringing Batman out in triumph again.  Then there's the real Finale; a good representation of Batman winning the day, but even moreso.  It is a classic movie ending piece that is quite memorable.  Suppose that's why they use it in the Batman ride in Six Flags Magic Mountain.  The reprise offers a more upbeat variation to the opening piece that is very robust and just one last treat to the score before it finishes.  <br />Overall, you can see that this requires in depth analysis for all major film score listeners.  If I were you, and I didn't own this score, I'd leave my computer right now and buy it asap.  Or even better!  I'd just buy it on Amazon.com and save gas!  This is the one score that people must own, even if they don't really like movie music.  Fun, exciting, dark, heroic.  Containing all the elements for a wonderful listening experience!<br />Favorite tracks:  Batman Theme Roof Fight First Confrontation Descent into Mystery The Bat Cave Chage of the Batmobile Attack of the Batwing Up the Cathedral Waltz to the Death The Final Confrontation Finale
B00000ILDE|5.0|I first saw this movie some time after the &quot;Aliens&quot; action figure franchise took off.  I had bought several of the toys and later a friend told me that they were based on a movie.  You can imagine my surprise, and I was not at all disappointed with the movie, despite severe distortions in both the action figures and the profile cards on the back (with the exception of Hicks), but that's another story.        The special effects are superb, the sets are intricate and impressive, especially the cruiser's interior and the atmosphere processor turned alien lair.  I had a previous suspicion that Wierzbowski and Crowe were played by the same person since they are basically throwaway characters but now I know better.  The aliens are truly frightening and convincing, especially the queen.      Awesome performances are given by Sigourney Weaver as the confident leader type Ripley, Michael Biehn as the cool-headed marine Hicks, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic--excuse me--artificial person Bishop, Bill Paxton as the pessimistic but tough marine Hudson, and Paul Reiser as the sneaky (and eventually evil) corporate businessman Burke.      &quot;Aliens&quot; is easily the best film in the four-part series, although &quot;Alien&quot; holds up strongly too.  Great story, great dialogue, great performances, great action, great movie.  Buy it.

That alone would've earned Machine Head classic status, but this was much more than a one-riff pony and its boys-only attitude helped create a British heavy metal blueprint that lasted for most of the decade. Sod your elves and wizards, Purple were only interested in long solos, methods of transport, women and the miniscule grey area that separated the three. &quot;Nobody gonna have my girl,&quot; growls Ian Gillan on Highway Star, &quot;she stays close on every bend.&quot; Jeremy Clarkson, eat your heart out.

B00002R0MC|5.0|...you can guess I listen to a LOT of music. From classical, jazz, blues, electronica, ska, reggae, punk, rock, pop, etc. I have come across many discs that were fantastic and worth more than one spin. Today, July 28th, 2001, I bought Mr. Robert Nesta Marley's &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot; box set and I was BLOWN away. This is the first and probably only box set I will ever own that is perfect from disc 1 all the way to disc 4. This music is revolutionary and evolutionary. Mr. Marley was a genius. There are not enough superlatives in English to do justice to this man's music, his character and what he achieved in his short life on this planet. Please, reader and fellow music fan, buy this box set. You will NEVER regret it.  Thank you Mr. Marley.

0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is a beautiful book that has amazing descriptions of characters, places, thoughts, objects, and especially emotions. I have NEVER read a book that seemed more complete. But if you are going to read it I will guerrentte that you will not understand any of it if you don't read the others in the series first. This book really makes you think. After I finished it, I just sort of sat around thinking about it. I really wish I could give this book more than five stars, because it deserves way more. The Amber Spyglass is better than the best. To this book, Harry Potter wasn't even close. (I thouroughly enjoyed Harry Potter don't think I hated it or anything.)<br />Also, I have read a few reviews saying that this series was extremely sacrilegious. This is not true. Metatron was not the authority AND the authority himself was not God, but an IMPOSTOR. The true god was not questioned at all. Also I saw one that said something about somebody tossing her crucifix into the sea. That is true, somebody did do that and she did not believe in God. BUT Philip Pullman never even came close to suggesting that was true.<br />If you enjoy reading great books, read this one, but the others in the His Dark Materials trilogy first. I can assure you, you'll love them.
6305358613|5.0|I thought this movie was a captivating look at a sovereign queen's struggles and triumphs in Elizabethan England.  The history is loose and inaccurate, but the drama of the movie's own story are sufficient enough to warrant a re watching.  Cate Blanchett shines in the role of Elizabeth with a mix of steely determination and an undertone of vulnerability.  She is at once confident and uneasy, shifting unresisting from the role of a country residing princess into the queen of a death and sex filled domain.  <br />The romance is present in &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; but it is pure human emotion that takes center stage.  Her trials and tribulations merit beautifully crafted scenes, complimented by Blanchett's acting and by Shekhar Kepur's allowance of solitary scenes with Elizabeth.  These scenes not only build up her character, but they also allow the audience a peek into the aforementioned vulnerability that underscores her public decision.  <br />&quot;Elizabeth&quot; is a ultimately a classic drama.  It combines all the elements of drama, with a historic setting and sweeping characterization that at once intrigues and mystifies.  It also has elements of feminism, and if you are so inclined as to enjoy a depiction of a strong woman with human weaknesses, I would highly recommend this movie to you.  I would also highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good biography.  In the end it is a period drama that does not lose itself with a mass of supporting characters, and instead has a heart and soul in the form of its lead actress (which for once truly describes the role), Cate Blanchett.  If you decide to watch this movie, I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  I for one, went into it thinking I would dislike it, but was thankfully very wrong.
0684867621|4.0|\\"The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon\\" was a pretty good book. I only gave it four stars because I got lost alot in the book and could'nt figure out what he was talking about. Otherwise it is a great book. And it really isn't King's normal blood and gore book, it has a small part with a monster. But the book seemed to center more around a girl getting lost in the woods and struggles for survival.
6303340830|1.0|Dolph Lundgren stars as a Mercenary sent to kill a Tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation,Dull and just plain pointless (And Stupid) action film suffers from Inept Action scenes and logic lapses. Lundgren is Imposing but can't act.
0451160916|5.0|&quot;The Shining&quot; is an example of how Mr. King can get his readers absorbed into a story with his excellent story-telling techniques. This is an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; book with page-turning horror. This was the first book I really got scared from, although unrealistic, which is his style, but for some people, that may make it a non-enjoyable experience. It also had well developed characters who were interesting. King fascinates me with the personalities in each book because they seem real, although his stories are unrealistic his characters are, this is a good example of it (except for Danny's talent).  I recommend this to anyone who has seen the movie, because from what I hear the movie was a poor interpretation on the book, and you miss alot of things. &quot;The Shining&quot; is a fast paced action packed book, readers who enjoy &quot;get to the point&quot; books will like this one. Short and sweet, definitely a classic.
B00003CY5K|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable comedies this year.  Reese Witherspoon was perfect for the role.  It is a wonderful mix of laughter and intellectually well written.  Would highly recommend this movie.
B00003CXPD|5.0|With all the garbage in the movies now, it is nice to know that this movie came along.  It is a wonderful story about a boy who does everything to achieve his dream of being a ballet dancer.<br />The only setback is the language.  It was completely pointless.  That is the only bad thing about this movie.  Kids at the age of eight could see this movie if you don't mind them hearing the F word every two minutes.<br />This movie is an excellent example of people going after their dreams.<br />The DVD is all ok, but not the greatest, special feature wise.
0131103628|5.0|This book really delineates the outset of my career as a software engineer.  I'd hacked around with pascal, basic, and assembly language, but had heard a lot of good things about C.  I wasted my time with several other books on C, but never made much progress until I found &quot;good 'ol K&amp;R&quot; (i.e. this book).<br />It's a true classic that stands the test of time and is probably the only book on C you'll ever need.  It has also served as a useful benchmark - since this book I regard any thicker book on a programming language as one or both of the following: a sign of a bad language; a sign of a bad book.<br />I also recommend O'Reilly's &quot;POSIX Programmer's Guide&quot; as an excellent reference to the STANDARD system programming libraries for C.

0316286850|5.0|Aucoin's book provides simple, easy to follow instructions to imitate his techniques. The book begins by walking you through the basics, foundation, concealer, shading/highlighting etc, then on to the treatment of the face.  From brows to lips, his techniques are illustrated step by step with commentary on not only how to do the techniques, but also the differences between different types of make-up (like the properties of matte eyeshadow vs. frosted, who knew?) Aucoin then provides instructions to achieve different &quot;looks&quot; from ultra glamour to simple minimalism, there are over 25 different &quot;looks&quot; to learn. Overall, a great book, I think his personal story and commentary is an added bonus - though I think he could lose the plastic surgery section to keep with his overall 'beauty in us all' theme. I highly recommend this book.  Best one I've found thus far.

0783226888|3.0|Bruce Willis is his usual, dare I say it, mostly boring self and Richard Gere is as pouty as ever, so it's the story that tends to keep one interested in this film. <br />Bruce Willis is a huge star, yet his acting abilities have never surpassed marginal.  This film is no different in that regard.  He tends to play the strong, silent type, unintentially caught up in situations that give him cause to persevere.  Although it is refreshing to see him play the role of a villian, his style of acting doesn't quite take his character in this film to the level of intensity it would have been nice to see.  True, a silent psychosis lends itself well to this character, but Bruce Willis simply lacks the depth necessary to accomplish it.<br />Richard Gere portrays the &quot;every man&quot; - a departation from roles he commonly plays, which are those of successful, educated, professionals of one type or the other.  He continues to have the sense that he's trying to look good on screen - as though he is constantly looking into an off-camera mirror to evaluate his appearance, however he manages the role effectively, producing not a powerful perfomance, but one that is neither bad nor good.<br />Though the story falls short of it's intended mark, it is the strongest point of this film.  It comes ever so close to being slightly unbelievable but still manages to provide for a degree of high-level espionage intrigue, action, and a dash of suspense. The film attempts to be international in scope with it's multitude of locations and plot twists, but the acting is simply not powerful enough to take it beyond an action film with interesting enough events that make you kind of want to hang around just to see what happens.<br />If you're going to buy this DVD, get the DTS version if your system can do it.  The Collector's Edition isn't worth losing out on the superior sound quality.  There's a &quot;Making Of...&quot; on the Collector's Edition which is fair, but other than actor bios, notmuch else to offer.<br />No where near something that needs to be in every DVD collection, but if you're looking for a movie to pass the time on a lazy Sunday afternoon because you just don't feel like doing the lawn, this will suffice.  If you're looking for a film with a high degree of intelligence, powerful perfomances, and riveting plot (which this tries to be), then you've knocked on the wrong door.

B000003TAR|5.0|Although nirvana has changed alot over the years, first with angry angst rock, to polished pop, then to angry angst again, but they have all had two things in common 1) grunge  2)Their sense of humor    in this 4th cd you hear the three some again. Each song has its owm secrete meaning    from a love song(&quot;dumb&quot;) to a song about karma(&quot;rape me&quot;) to a song apologizing to dave and krist(&quot;all apologies&quot;) this  cd gives a very nice touch to the nirvana collection, and a nice going out cd( this being the last nirvana cd made in studios)  this shows you that even at the end Kurt Cobain still had a sense of musical taste.

B000001Y9I|4.0|yes the band is still raging, battling, thundering and monumental on stage. Who are they ? they are DEEP PURPLE, the british hard rock veteran since 1968 until 2001 today! I said tehy are a heavy rock veteran, yes it is right ! the band had thundered us since the 70s hey day and the band screamed us since the 80s reunion highlights PERFECT STRANGERS tour 1984 - 1987 and the band have battled us once again in the 90s era BATTLE RAGES ON 93. I said well thats why the most British Rock bands are generally much much better than the US rock bands. The reason is easy though many people couldnt understand it well. The reason is the most British rock bands have a classical music roots/elements in their bodies and tehy practiced more the classical elements all the time which the American bands are not really interrested.  And especially the british rock bands keep their popularity much longer and traditionally they always tried to reunite their long time ago succesfull hey days until today, which american bands are not having in their bodies.  And the accurate example is The british hard rock veteran DEEP PURPLE which had been beloved by the young and old audiences. This album featuring Steve morse on banjo replacing blackmore!

It's almost as if he lived that story, that's how real it was. His writing touched me like no other before. I read the whole book in one night. And in that one night I laughed, frowned, cried, and smiled. It makes you remember the emotions you felt when you found your first love. And, for a moment, lets those more cynical believe once agian in true everlasting love....And MIRACLES.......
B0000072KY|5.0|What a remarkable album.  Nirvana truly are one of the greatest bands in the history of music (they're certainly my favorite).<br />In Utero takes has a totally different essense than \\"Nevermind\\". Quite a bit darker.  Yet the album is just as beautiful, and like Nevermind is composed of 12 awesome tracks (no filler).  <br />This import does contain the 13th track \\"Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through The Strip\\".  To me this song is kind of a dissapointment.  It's a spoken-word experiement (w/ at times heavy background music and some classic Cobain screams).  Yet this certainly isn't Kurt's finest hour.  It sounds improvised, and leaves a bit to be desired as far as poetry.  Yet Kurt recognizes this, and in the middle of the songs says \\"... it man, this just a waste of time\\" (refering to the song)  before continuing.  He also asks Dave for help during the song.  Which are couple of reasons that this song is so unique (and that's why it must be had by almost every Nirvana fan). Though available on some bootlegs and in .MP3 form on the Net, I would suggest buying an \\"In Utero\\" import to get ahold of \\"Gallons...\\".  I have 4 different versions of \\"In Utero\\", and I cherish them all.  I've heard \\"Gallons\\" was recorded in Brazil, but it sounds awefully Albini-esque to me.<br />Don't even think about not adding this to your collection.

0792844793|3.0|David Lynch's &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; is almost impossible to describe because the actors are so great portraying their roles that reviewing this film might create an anti-climax. But we immediately recognize David Lynch's touch, his obsession for the bizarre and the cruel. The film has a pulp simplicity, but it's self-conscious in its satire. Isabella Rossellini portrays a woman whose husband and son have been kidnapped by Dennis Hopper, and Kyle McLaghlan and Laura Dern are the heroes who try to discover what's behind the small town facade. They whisper corny lines to each other and their characters are purely mechanical, but perhaps it's just an homage to classicism.  Fortunately, there are times when the actors let themselves go and almost pull out from the unidimensional behavior that suffocates all their gestures and words. Dennis Hopper gives a very strong performance as an obsessed and dangerous man, with an homicidal tendency and a sexual crisis but Isabella Rossellini steals all the scenes she's in as we regognize her true suffering and anguish.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Even if I was disappointed that we don't get hardly any of the fantastic score that played through the end credits of the end of the summer money-making Moulin Rouge, this soundtrack is certainly a plausible soundtrack. Many songs are sung by the cast, those songs are the best ones. The tracks I most highly enjoyed on this CD would have to be 2 - Lady Marmalade, 4 - Sparkling Diamonds, 6 - Your Song, 14 - Hindi Sad Diamonds and 16 - Come What May. All those songs and plenty others match the movie amazingly well and are sung clearly and elegantly. This CD at times feels like it is going to burst out of the player because the drums, vocals and guitars are so unusually powerful. Baz Luhrmann certainly knows how to write movies, direct them and pick good songs for a CD. Sheesh! The guy deserves a medal. Although Moulin Rouge's soundtrack certainly doesn't get up to the amazing standards of the film, but it is a great taste of life in night-club that we can remember the movie by. Highly recommended!
0440219078|1.0|I HATED THIS BOOK!!! When I was in fifth grade, my teacher read this book to us, and I didn't like it then. Now, as a sixth grader going into seventh, I had to read it again for summer reading. I thought reading it again would help me like it better, but I still dislike it now. I reccomend this book to NO ONE, unless you want to be bored out of your minds. And if you have to read it for school, like me, get it from the library. Don't waste your money on this book.
0671027344|5.0|Okay, so I'm not a huge reader, but I do enjoy a good book when I come across one.  And I have recently come across this one.  It holds a point of view I've never really seen before in a book, the way that the main character describes everything, and all written as a letter written to someone he's never met.  You really get a sense of the characters and how they feel.  Although the plot is somewhat undefined, it doesn't seem to drag at all, and you get to love the characters through each odd happening.  Basically, it's about a quiet, nameless boy who becomes friends with some interesting characters, and through his descriptions and observations we learn of the characters' lives and situations.  One of my favorite characters named Patrick has a very interesting &quot;problem&quot; which you find out about throughout the book.  If you like character study type books and things then you will definately love this book as much as I do.  I have recently finished it, and have already recommended it to everyone I know.  So get a copy of it, read it, and love it.

B00003CXV4|2.0|I could tolerate most of the illogical anguished drama (hell, I could forgive Charlize Theron anything), but then they lost me completely with the dishwasher!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Not really a sequel to Kid A, but definetly the same band. While some bands ignore stardom, for arts sake, Radiohead seems to ignore for their sake. On Amnesiac you hear a band struggling to satisfy their own art. Ironic, that the first song is 'Packt like sardines in a crushed tin box.'  and the last song is called  'Life in a glass house'.  The motto of the CD seems to be &quot;Nothing to Fear, Nothing to Doubt&quot;.  The songs at times seem to be muffled and incomplete, but the message is always clear--Radiohead is working without a net, and they don't mind falling, in fact they look forward to it...As fans we should just sit back and enjpy the show.

B000002LND|4.0|This is a nice CD with good sound. It simply is what it says it is: a collection of Madonna's greatest hits. I can't think of any reason to warn someone away from it.
0393317552|4.0|I teach world history at the high school level.  Sometimes students will ask me why Europeans were able to so &quot;easily&quot; conquer and take over so much of the earth.  This book attempts to provide an explanation to this question.  The book poses some interesting ideas/theories that really makes one think about the fates of human societies. It made me really think about how a few hundred Spanish conquistadors could conquer empires of millions like the Aztecs and Inca as opposed to those empires conquering Europe.  It's not the easiest reading in the world, but sustains interest for the most part.  I would recommend this book, but be prepared to sit and read it in a quiet place without any distractions.
B00005MAM2|4.0|This ground-breaking film set new standards in animation when it was first released over 11 years ago and, thanks to it's meticulous attention to detail, complex and imaginative action sequences, and creative special effects, still manages to hold up among today's CGI-filled cinema. The over-the-top action sequences and darkly intense sci-fi storyline have even influenced live-action Hollywood movies such as &quot;Dark City&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;.<br />Pioneer has done a wonderful job porting &quot;Akira&quot; to DVD, using the same attention to detail as the filmmakers. The remaster is excellent, with little, if any, of the visual problems that sometimes crop up in animated movies tranferred to DVD format. The sound is well done, although, to my disappointment, the original Japanese soundtrack did not receive the 5.1 dolby treatment. The number and quality of the features included with the special edition are top-notch and should satisfy all but the most critical of DVD enthusiasts.<br />In all, an excellent package of a marvelous film that should not be missed. Highly recommended.
0790744759|5.0|I cannot believe I waited this long to see this movie.  This is Judy Garland at her best.  Everyone should see this movie.
0425180638|3.0|I have a friend who once had a popular but tiny hole-in-the-wall lunch counter. As his customer base grew, so did he..to a bigger restaurant, and finally to a posh themed giant. Unfortunately, as the size grew, the quality lessened, and before long he was out of business.<br />Same with Cornwall. Those first tightly-drawn novels were the best. But The Last Precinct is a weighty, themed giant. The plot goes nowhere except down the worrisome, twisted paths of Kay Scarpetta's self-indulgence and ego-centeredness.<br />In the end, it's a bust: mediocre food on fancy dishes. Not much of a novel, I'd say.
B000002MJR|5.0|I bought this CD because it had almost every Dire Strait song that I love on it. If I had known just how good this album was I would have bought it alot sooner. From the opening rifs of Calling Elvis to the middle and quiet of Romeo &amp; Juliet and Private Investigations to the end and happy Brother in Arms it is fantastic. If you like Dire Straits it is a must have. When I pop this in the CD player I know I will listen to it at least a 3 times. As a friend of mine said when he heard this for the first time.....&quot;Where the hell was I when Dire Straits was making records?&quot; Enjoy.
0380002930|5.0|Richard Adams' \\"Watership Down\\" is an amazing book that richly deserves all the kudos it has received.  This great novel should be considered an all-time classic work of fiction -- of any genre (i.e., fantasy, allegory, science fiction, political), and for any age.  As with almost any great novel, \\"Watership Down\\" can be read on many different levels, and at many different points in one's life.  And, contrary to what a few VERY misguided reviewers have claimed, this book is \\"just a bunch of words about rabbits\\" only if you think that George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" is a lighthearted tale of pigs and cows, or JRR Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is just some stupid adventure story involving weird creatures like elves and hobbits.  Uh... I don't think so!   <br />At its most basic level, \\"Watership Down\\" is, as described on the book's jacket, \\"a stirring tale of adventure\\" by a group of rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by humans, then running into many more \\"hare-raising\\" adventures as the book proceeds.  If you read the book only on this level, what you have is an exciting book which you won't want to put down until you have finished it...which isn't bad!  But if you never looked beyond this level, you'd be missing a lot.<br />For instance, you'd be ignoring (to quote the book's jacket again),  \\"a timeless and powerful parable about society and its relation to the natural world,\\" plus (this is NOT a complete list by any means): 1) an anthropomorphic, highly believable battle between Nazi/Stalinist totalitarianism (the Efrafa warren of General Woundwort) and a Western, liberal Democracy (Hazel-rah's Watership Down society), with a detour to Cowslip's decadent, cynical, soft, and deceptively dangerous warren (Weimar Germany of the 1920s? The United States today?); 2) a generally (but not totally) unflattering look - as seen through the eyes of Nature -- at humans and human civilization (senseless cruelty and destruction, stupidity, suburban sprawl, but...the potential for redemption through significant acts of kindness, at least by a child); 3) an illustration and examination of various leadership types, and specifically, what makes a leader? (size and strength? cunning? vision? ruthlessness? caution? organizational skills? ability to provide economic/material benefits to the masses?); 4) a look at the place and importance of mythology and religion in society; 5) an inquiry into the meaning of friendship, fear, courage, etc.; and 6) the creation of a unique culture and language (\\"Lapine\\"), a la Tolkien, which is highly effective (although not nearly as extensive as Tolkien's languages).<br />In sum, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read (and I've read \\"hrair\\").   Fascinating, complex, moving, beautiful, unique.  Hop right out and get this book!!!

B000002UAX|5.0|In 1968 the Beatles went to India to meditate. Several months later they were back and had brought a crate of great songs with them. This led to the double masterpiece The White Album. The White Album is far different from anything the Beatles did before. For one it abandoned the psychedelica of Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour. It also did not have much ensemble but instead all the members performing with their backing band. Next it appeared to have no focus. This is because the individual Beatles simply wanted to cram all the stuff they had into an album. This time around the objective was not to reach greatness, though they did. The White Album is a showcase of almost all the musical styles of the era. This makes it a roller coaster filled with much variety. It begans with an upbeat Beach Boys parody followed by a pick-me up chill down songs in Dear Prudence. Such a trend continues until the end. On Disc One of the ride you will see reggae (Obla Di-Ob La Da), humor (Bungalow Bill, Wild Honey Pie, Why Don't We Do It In The Road) accoustic guitar based music(Blackbird, I Will, Julia), country western (Rocky Racoon, Don't Pass Me By) and haunting somewhat Indian George Harrison (While My Guitar Weeps with guest Eric Clapton) Disc Two is inferior though still a magnificent CD with more variety. It features the Beatles first attempt at blues and hard rock (Yer Blues, Helter Skelter, both of which could have been done by Led Zepellin),blues/jazz (Sexy Sadie, Revolution, Cry Baby Cry), hauntingly avant guarde (Revolution 9), simple rock (Birthday, Savoy Truffle), more accoustic music (Long, Long, Long), and corny Hollywood music (Honey Pie, Goodnight). In conclusion the White Album is different from anything else you'll find out there. As I said it has every musical style out there. Every song is at least good and unique from the rest of the album. This collection represents almost all of music within, and you will probably fall in love with new tastes of music if you listen. Stop reading and Buy! Then consider Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Revolver, A Hard Day's Night, or Rubber Soul by the Beatles
B00005B36H|3.0|***1/2 stars<br />It's nice to hear that even nowadays there are mainstream bands that deliver good music. It was quite refreshing to watch the Schism video in MTV, where crap is king usually.<br />Being an avid fan of classic 70's progressive rock and progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater, the album results very appealing, with moody passages, the use of odd metrics, lenghty compositions and intelligent lyrics, along with the killer artwork. There are some low points in the album also, as it is a little bit too long and with some repetitive riffs. Perhaps it's not the best album for some since Tool music can be analized from very different, even opposed perspectives, depending if you analize it from the progressive rock view or from the contemporary metal view.<br />What cannot be discussed is that the band has more talent and musical chops than almost anything else in the mainstream, sure beats Bizkit, Papa Roach, Korn, Kid Rock... you name it.
B000002I25|5.0|1967 was a golden year for rock. That year produced the Beatles Sgt. Pepper, Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?, and The Doors. To put it simple The Doors is simply some of the best (possibly the best) psychadelic rock out there. The highlights are the haunting lyrics and singing of Jim Morrison and the equally haunting organ work of Ray Manzarek. The Doors is different from anything else in rock and roll. Few acts have such prominent organ play as the Doors. (Most would replace the organ with a guitar) Then again most music fans love to hear something fresh and new and different. Welcome to the Doors. Ray Manzarek's organ would be very important in the opus Light My Fire. This 7 minute masterpiece is what is great about this group. However the best song would be the first song Break On Through, which is some of the closest this album gets to straight up rock (and back door man). The album also stretches into slight polka with Alabama Song. The psychadelica continues with Twentieth Century Fox, The End of the Night, and Take as it Comes....  In short The Doors is some of the best of the psychadelic movement of the late 60s and it is the best the Doors ever did. No rock collection should be without this album. If you are new to the Doors I would recommend The Best of the Doors for an introduction to their music. You will not be disappointed.
0671027573|1.0|Linda Howard used to be one of my favorite authors. I loved \\"Heart of Fire\\" and \\"Son of the Morning.\\" But this story is a total failure. The premise is totally ridiculous. No silly list like the one the women make up would ever make it to the national or local news, and any media organization that used these women's names without their permission would get the ... sued out of them. Furthermore, the \\"List\\" itself isn't very controversial or even very funny. I've seen much funnier \\"Mr. Perfect\\" lists circulated on the Internet, written by people who aren't NY Times bestselling authors like Linda Howard.<br />Here is my list for \\"Perfect Novel\\":<br />1. Grabs your attention on the very first page (this book doesn't) 2. Gets into the hero's POV as well as the heroine. 3. Is accurate and realistic in its portrayal of the characters' environment (Ms. Howard knows zilch about corporate life in Motown.) 5. Even if the plot isn't realistic, the author makes you believe it is (no way could I believe this STUPID list would generate so much attention)
B00005JK93|5.0|Even if &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; was only a witty and brilliant 'anatomically incorrect' pastiche of Bowiesque glam-rock and Hagenesque teutonic punk--with the most electrifying musical performance since Tina Turner's Acid Queen cameo in the otherwise forgettable &quot;Tommy&quot;--it would be an exceptional achievement. But this film is so much more. Hedwig herself defiantly spans the divide between East and West, male and female, innocence and experience, comedy and tragedy, creation and destruction. And when she sings, she's like a force of nature. The songs are outstanding, John Cameron Mitchell is captivating, and an extrememly talented cast of actors and musicians--including Miriam Shor and Andrea Martin--provide tremendous support. With its wild combination of scathing social commentary and moving personal struggle, &quot;Hedwig&quot; is a triumph on every level, and is sure to be among the very best films of the year.
B000002U82|5.0|What can you say about Dark Side of the Moon? It is one of the few albums I have ever heard that is symphonic in its harmony.  Each song smoothly transitions into the next - making the album a seamless artistic creation.  I only discovered the album at the age of 20, two years ago, and I do not know how I truly loved music before it.  Nothing I have heard since can even touch Pink Floyd.  The music, the words, even the sound effect transitions are so stirring that the album haunts me.  I think &quot;Time&quot; must be one of the best songs ever written - lyrically, musically, stylistically.  Hands down this album is a must own for anyone who loves music.
B00005B602|5.0|This album inspired me a lot. At the end of each track, as the cd player goes to the next one, you have something in your chest, mixed feelings, just like when you're in love. Listen to it, you'll understand. Go ahead and laugh at me, but when I was listening to it in the store, amid the huge crowd of a Champs-elysees cd store, I felt I was gonna cry in front of all these people.    The main instruments present are the accordeon, the piano, the flute, and a whole bunch of very expressive instruments; no singing. It represents a blend of french rythms and melodies, and classical licks. You can go Amazon.fr to hear some samples, or go to a cd store and listen to it; amazon.com imports it, so there are no samples here.  The film in itself is revolutionary. You get immersed into the &quot;fabulous&quot; world of Amelie. <br />You'll laugh, you'll feel sad, you'll feel a whole array of feelings. Don't miss it. I recommend it.
0792156684|5.0|In about ten years after all the hype and ferver around its release is over and forgotten, people are going to go back and watch this again and realize how mistaken they were in saying it was bad. Not that any of the critics (people who actually know movies and know what they are talking about) gave it bad reviews, in fact they gave it great reviews, and rightly so. Everything about this movie is great besides somes occasionally silly dialougue, but hey, these two characters (Winslet and DiCaprio) are supposed to be young, sometimes young people don't use the most sophisticated dialouge.

0800141660|5.0|Even though I really liked Braveheart I was very surprised when this movie didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture of 1995. I thought everything from the performances to the excellent cinematography was dead on. I can't believe Ang Lee wasn't nominated for best director. The story is deep and you start to really care about the characters. It should have been a toss up between this and Leaving Las Vegas for best picture of 1995.
B000002AV5|5.0|I'm not normally a huge fan of r&amp;b music. I find it cluttered with too much hip hop beats and cliched lyrics. Sade is an artist I can enjoy listening to and that's because she manages to make r&amp;b a sensuous listening experience. She blends r&amp;b with smooth jazz and hints of bossa nova together and the end results is this incredible music that I don't hear from any other artist today.<br />The only Sade songs that I am quite familiar is is the songs off &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; (her current album), &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, and The Sweetest Taboo&quot;. As I am currently listening to Sade's best of compilation, the music itself has already confirmed me as a fan of her music, well maybe not so since I do own and love &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; but now I get a broader sense of her catalog of songs. Her best of compilation cd gives me a good idea what to expect from her earlier albums. Sade's music can never sound dated no matter how long she has been away from the music scene.

0375704027|4.0|Like a crow flitting from one power line to another, Murakami moves the story from one situation to another in sudden movements, oftentimes leaving me with a feeling of disorientation.  Likewise, many times the description of the setting seems forced and contrived, at least at the outset of the story.<BR><BR> In the end, the story and the writing satisfy.  While not quite as hard-hitting and insightful as South of the Border, the story that Norwegian Wood tells is a familiar tale of overlapping loyalties and the dichotomy of purest love and realistic, dirty, wart-covered love.<BR><BR> Like the beautiful morning fog, youth and dreams give way to a maturity that is warmer and more exciting than the cool stillness of the morning.

B0000047CX|5.0|This is, quite simply, a lovely CD.  It has a wonderful peaceful feeling and is deliciously romantic as only Portugese can be when it is sung. It is a classic and you'll never get tired of it.  It is a treasure.
0553278398|5.0|I was never a science fiction fan, and still am not for that matter. I came across this book by accident and absolutely loved it. This was the introduction to Asimov that prompted me to read the entire series 2 different times. This book, being the most recent, is the easiest to read of the series and seems to progress better. That, combined with a more compact timeline, keeps the reader married to the story and suspense. If you have never read Asimov, I highly recommend the Foundation Series. This book is you starting point.
014028902X|3.0|maybe it's just me. well, but I am the one who gives it 3 stars and not 4 or 5. why? I am not into this kind of novels and the only reason why I read it was for school. The plot is so-so. Animals don't interest me. everything was so slow and boring. the plot is tooooo slow for me. I get bored. But what I realy really love is the author's descriptions. oh mi gosh, they have gotta be the best I've ever read. They are so lively. That I found myself writing down all the nice phrases that I like on my notebook. Wow, I never knew that One could like a book and hate is so much at the same time. well, here's the book I've found. Cheers.
B00005JK93|4.0|John Cameron Mitchell's &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; proposes the age-old question:  Who Am I? and &quot;What is My Place on this Earth?&quot;  How Mitchell answers this question is at the very nature of the brilliance of this story told through 70's style &quot;hair&quot; rock.  The world of Hedwig runs much deeper and is examined more thoroughly than say that of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show,&quot; which this film resembles.  But in reality Hedwig is more like the rags-to-riches story of Fanny Brice in &quot;Funny Girl.&quot;  Mitchell not only directs but is the star and he does a bang-up job creating a world and then inhabiting it.  Mitchell is such a whirlwind and major force in this film that all the others fade into the background but Michael Pitt(lately of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) has the appropriate boy toy look and makes a good impression as Hedwig's protege, &quot;Gnosis.&quot;
1895565669|1.0|I know myself to be in the minority on this one, but this book has given me the willies ever since I first discovered it while working in a children's bookstore.  Unlike 'The Runaway Bunny', a book which comforts children in an age-appropriate and metaphorical way, 'Love You Forever' seems to be written to comfort parents.  The book only details the negative things that the son does, seemingly implies that the mother loves him 'anyway'.  The pictures are distinctly odd, giving one the impression that the illustrator has never looked on a living teenager.  While the idea that a mother loves her son no matter what he does is very sweet and comforting, the idea of an old lady driving across town with a ladder strapped to her car in order to climb into her grown son's window is not.  There is no father in this book, making the obvious Freudian assumptions a little too real for comfort.  Books like 'Guess How Much I Love You?' and 'Emma Bean' show just as much love, but in a gentler, more subtle way that I think children can appreciate better than the literal message of unconditional love of in 'Love You Forever'.  Although I've had this book recommended to me many a time since my son was born, I think I'll stick to books that both of us are comfortable with.
0446677450|5.0|I read this book and most of the other books from him... They are all awesome! They are written in easy to undestand style and help you understand the true concepts of real wealth and passive income. Unlike so many Get Rich type books this book will not tell you to save every nickle and recycle plastic bags... It teaches you how to see ideas all around you and opens your eyes to make a real change! Since buying this book I have purchased 2 income propertys that are netting me a extra [...]a month (Passive income)and I have restructured our buisness.. It has also helped my put these same Ideas to my children and I have now stopped giving my kids allowance and they both (on there own) figured out buisness to earn income! My son is 14 and is now selling Glow stick necklaces both wholesale (passive inclome as you will understad in the book) and direct! He started this after me making him read the book! If you buy 1 self help book this year buy Rich Dad... His thinking style is quite diffrent from all the Get rich authors!
B00004XONN|3.0|Sounds like it would make a great soundtrack for a Japanese anime film.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|First I was so excited that this was one of Madonna &quot;Remastered&quot; series.  It's  not well-promoted, though.  Warner should put a larger sticker on the cover to denote it.  Nevertheless, it is just great!!  The amazing, powerful remastered sounds, coming out of the speakers as if they were recorded today.  All the nuances are heard.  The artwork is beautifully integrated.  One of my favoirte tracks on this album is actually &quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo.&quot;  It's an often-missed gem.  The two re-mastered dance tracks made this CD worth the $$, eventhough I think Warner could've priced it down a little, or produce a Madonna CD-Box of these 80's CDs.  Anyway, I'm going to collect all of these remastered CDs.  Now I remember I didn't buy any of the originally-released CDs back then (after owning the LPs) because I didn't think the recording sounds were good.  Now I have no excuse NOT to buy!
B00003XACV|5.0|The film &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a ground-breaking film that discovers the unusual joys of life through the eyes of a simple man gone mad in the eyes of those around him. His wife is repressed, his daughter distant, and all he can think about is getting a job at a local burger dive and purchasing pot from his daughter's boyfriend. The movie captures unique snapshots of everyday life, but gives it such a vivid flourish that it becomes more than just life, but a vision of dreams and hopes, fears and tears, and overall, what life is really all about. <br />The soundtrack for &quot;American Beauty&quot; is just as diverse as the film itself, exploring the many nuances of score-composing, whether it be a slightly perky tune, such as the movie's opening track &quot;Dead Already,&quot; to the many influential and emotional pieces, &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Still Dead.&quot; Thomas Newman has a unique gift for capturing the moment of each film through his compositions, and &quot;American Beauty&quot; ranks as one of his best works to date, along with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot; He is able to give us a score full of wonderment and confusion, in a movie that needs just that.
B00003CXP0|5.0|This disturbing film, creatively directed by Darren Aronofsky of &quot;Pi&quot; fame is about drug addition. For Ellen Burstyn, cast in the role of Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely Brooklyn housewife who is trying to lose weight to appear on a TV show, the drug of choice is diet pills. For her son, played by Jared Leto; his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely; and his pal, played by Marlon Wayans, the drug is heroin. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., who also wrote the screenplay, the setting is a run-down and sad Brooklyn neighborhood near the beach, where buildings are old, people are poor and the American dream is a far off taunting illusion. The time period is unclear because the TV set, which is the center of Sarah Goldfarb's life, is of 1950s vintage; and yet the characters all use cell phones. But these details really don't matter much. There are enough other fantasy elements in this film to hurl it into the age that created music videos.<br />Using creative film techniques, the director has managed to bring the audience right into the mental states of the addicts. There are extreme close-ups, slow-motion and fast-motion sequences and split screen effects. We go on the fantasy trip with the characters and then we crash with the reality. We watch the effects on them as their personalities change as well as their physical appearances. The result is chilling. The script calls for outstanding acting jobs and Ellen Burstyn's work is perhaps the finest of her long career. The other actors also shine in these very challenging performances. Jared Leto is more than just a handsome young actor; Jennifer Connely, who is almost too pretty for her harrowing role, is excellent; and Marlon Wayans, who we usually see in comedies, proves here that he handle a serious part. This is not a film for the squeamish. It is deeply disturbing and sad. But the discomfort is worth it for those who are willing to explore this underbelly of a perverse American dream. Recommended.
B0000524E5|5.0|Everyone has one of those movies. One of those movies they can watch twice a day every day and never get bored of. For me, this and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; are those movies. What makes Coyote Ugly so special? To be honest, everything. When I went to see in in theatres, I was expecting it to turn out a fun party movie for the guys to enjoy, and for us girls to laugh at. Instead, I found the most likable romance-comedy I've ever seen. It was marketed all wrong. Everything about this movie is perfect. Piper Perabo is my favorite actress to date, despite having done little film work before Coyote Ugly, and with a few projects in the works. There's something in her voice that makes every word out of her mouth believable. Adam Garcia is the sexist man I've ever seen in movies or music, hands down. To top it all off, he has an Aussie accent. (Is there ANYTHING sexier?) He's a dancer before an actor, but I don't care how well he dances, he was born to act and I hopt to see more of him as soon as I can. Ignoring the fact that both my favorite actress and favorite actor are in this movie, the plot and script could practically not have been imporved on. This is a feel-good movie, and the ending is a typical one for a romance, but the characters are so easy to attach to that no other ending would have been satisfying. Even though you might not love the movie to point I do, If you want romance, comedy, or even just to see girls in skimpy clothing do a table dance, you'll see it all here. Don't bother to rent it, put that 3 bucks towards buying it. See that botton that says &quot;Add to cart?&quot; Click it.
1878424319|4.0|Don Miguel Ruiz is a Mexican native elder in the Toltec tradition, and reading this book is like sitting at his feet and listening to his words of wisdom.  It's a small sized book and has only 138 pages, but the essence of it is simple.  I couldn't quite follow every single nuance of the spiritual background that led him to his conclusions, but that doesn't really matter.  What matters is the message.  And the message rings clear and true: (1) Be impeccable with your word, (2) Don't take anything personally; (3) Don't make assumptions; and (4) Always do your best. Of course I agree.  How could I not?  How could anybody?  That, of course, is what is making the book so popular.  The beauty of it is that these are not impossible goals for anyone.  There's a practical message of hope and inspiration here.  And a feel-good feeling after reading it. Recommended.
B00000G3PA|2.0|watch this movie if u absolutely have no intention of using ur brain and u just want to see mindless unrealistic action for an hour and a half. under those situations, this is an amazing film. otherwise this is difficult to sit through. its ur typical american patriotism action sappy film. throw in unlikely heroes, in this case oil drillers sent to space to drill a meteor, (that idea in itself is just ludicrous). throw in a difficult decisions between the cast. throw in ur sappy manipulative dialougue. the list goes on, but apparantly this is what entertains the public. if u want to see a disaster movie like this, ur better off with the mediocre deep impact. how many times can u really watch bruce willis and his typed casted hero role?
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is a stunning album with six breathtaking songs. If you are  not a heavy  Floyd fan you won't like this album. In my opinion it's one of the best Floyd albums.
6301966511|5.0|I'll never forget how much I was taken by surprise when I first saw this film. (Gotta remember to AVOID promos and trailers as they taint our expectations.) This is a chance to see actors not &quot;acting,&quot; but rather being real people with realistic emotions and concerns. How two scientists can be intimate without it being sexual, while being absorbed in their work often times to the casualty of their private lives. The realistic scientific theories just blew me away. Casting Walken was genius as he's able to show us he's really not weird, and paired with Wood's undertones creates great chemistry. You've got to watch the movie just to focus on Louise Fletcher's role. WOW! Wonderfully rich and thoughtfully explored, this film continues to reward the viewer with subtleties and warmth that merits watching it again and again. Warning: this is a strong commentary on how gov't can step in to stymie research (true to life in my experience) and muck it up. This continues to rate in my top 5 movie picks. It's not sloppy or corny; it's believable sci-fi; it's commentary about how short life is and to remember to tell those special to us that we love them - and show it!
0790741520|5.0|Where do I start? First of all, Executive Decision is definitely NOT an action movie. Everyone who didn't like it is probably just bitter because they expected non stop fighting between soldiers and terrorists. If that's what you want, try Die Hard or Passenger 57. Executive Decision works more on suspense. In fact, the terrorists have no idea the soldiers are on the plane until the last 20 minutes! Until then, they hide out above and below the passenger area while trying to come up with a plan for taking the terrorists out. Also, they can't risk fighting the terrorists until they defuse a bomb in the luggage area, because one of the terrorists is masquerading as a passenger and would instantly set it off. The thrills are delivered non-stop in a very realistic Tom Clancy like fashion. In fact, the only thing I think could make it better would be if Clancy was actually an advisor or writer.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Stating that this is the greatest album of all time will puzzle some people who then expect to hear the fireworks of the end of &quot;A day in the life&quot; on Sgt. Pepper or some other pyrotechnics which are usually associated with &quot;great&quot; albums. This album is great in the sense that it is the best work of one of our greatest songwriters and producers, Brian Wilson. It is great in the sense that it can match the best songwriting of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, Holland-Dozier-Holland. It is great in the sense that its production is the product of Wilson's very careful and tasteful musical sensibility. It is great in the sense that it is so deeply heartfelt and tender that its humanity makes it universal. Looking for an album that will blow your mind on first listening and then grow old very quickly after the cheap effects wear off their novelty? Don't buy this one. If, on the other hand, you are looking for an album which never ages and should be packed for your entire journey through life along with some favorite photographs and books, this is the one to bring. I can't imagine ever growing tired of this album. I bring it out to listen to every few months and expect to do the same when I am in my 70's. A wonderful album.
B000002H2H|5.0|This CD is classic Metallica.  The new stuff is great, but you can't beat classic Metallica.  Fight Fire With Fire is the fastest song I have ever heard in my life!  Ride the Lightning is a great song, but James's voice sounds like he was kicked in the nuts.  For Whom the Bells Toll is a musical masterpiece with wicked guitars and slammin drums.  Fade to Black is one of Metallica's best songs.  It was never a single, but it is amazing and the best on the cd.  The rest of the songs are also awesome but the first 4 are what I listen to the most often.
0061002747|5.0|As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I've been thinking quite a bit recently about MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, the first adult mystery I read--too many years ago.  I thought then, and I still think today, that MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is the perfect classic mystery.  Christie created a murder in a stranded railroad car--a murder her sleuth Hercule Poirot must solve.  She has a classic collection of suspects, and a crime supposedly impossible to commit.  Poirot, of course, solves the crime, and I still admire this book decades after I first read it.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Metallica S&M is a great cd.  The band doesn't over power the symphony.  The symphony adds a lot in some of the slower songs like \\" Nothing Else Matters\\".  When you listen to this album you really feel like your at the concert, that what I love about it.  On the first cd my fav songs are \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", \\"Fuel\\", \\" No Leaf Clover\\", \\"Hero of the Day\\", and \\"Devil's Dance\\".  On the second CD my fav songs are \\" Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"One\\", \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Battery\\", and my absolute favorite \\"For Whom the Bells Toll\\".  There is so  much more energy in this cd than there any of their studio albums.  The only bad part about this is if you are a true Metallica fan, you have most of these songs already.
6303327982|4.0|This movie does not as people say glorify violence. It shows the amamture careless nature of people in the 20th century. That's all. The way Oliver Stone shows it is interesting. The film techniques are great. Love the camera angles and B/W. That's what brought me on to it. There is a huge difference between Tarantinos version and Oliver Stones version. Director: Oliver Stone Cast: Woody Harrleson, Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Sizemore, Julliette Lewis and Robert Downey jr.
B00003CXRM|5.0|It doesn't matter to me whether it combines the Odyssey and Wizard of Oz; it was just a great one!  Our whole family actually sat together to watch this, and we all loved it.  For us, it was a screamer, with one scene skillfully leading to the next crack-up.  I mean, I was in stitches.  We lived in South Carolina for eight years and loved the culture and people.  But hey, somebody did their homework!  Loved the radio station.  The soundtracks were excellent, and George Clooney sings?  All right!  If this was a satire, &quot;they done good!&quot;  Helps me to laugh a little at real life.
B00000I9P1|4.0|this was an exceptional pop cd! very powerful songs but it appears some of the tracks were too pop for some fans! needless to say they don't seem to play any of these songs live in concert these days! missing on here is burning heart! it should have been included on here instead of just the rocky4 soundtrack and their greatest hits! man against the world is an emotional crystal ball full of passion, is this love was a top 10 hit , and rebel son rocks! the song in good faith is a very good ballad kind of a twist of the search is over a desperate cry to someone saying i will give you everything that i got! all in all a great cd ! jim's voice showcased again full of emotion and heartfelt intensity! how much love was also a hit single!
B00005BJ2O|1.0|Cant any of these people write their own music?  The opening track is a bad cover of a bas song. . . Learn to write your own music
B000051VWW|5.0|I heard this CD a little bit in the Spring. My mother had it. I am a bit of a rocker and don't usually listen to Sade kind of music, but after my mother lent the CD to me and now it is August, I must say that Lovers Rock is the best Artistic Album since Billy Corgan's Adore. It has a tightness, a focus, and a soul that rescinates behind every note and every voice over. Song for song, lyric for lyric, and note for note the is the best album of the summer.
B000002JAX|5.0|At first listen I thought she was just ripping off Billie, but  she is still very fun to listen to on this CD.  Her varying styles keep it interesting. I just got back from Paris and saw Madeleine singing on the sidewalk for change! She fronts a great little 3-piece jazz band called The Lost Wandering Blues Jazz Band from New York. She is introduced by the band every few numbers as the woman who sang the Jaguar commercial, and they plug this CD, while she passes the hat.  They said that she is on a new label now and working on a new CD. She sounds great and draws a big crowd of Parisiennes and tourists in front of the chapel St. Germain de Pres.
B000002NHN|5.0|I am not, and doubt I will be, a longterm fan of Loreena McKennit. That in itself should make a strong implication as to the preciousness and uniqueness of the album. Although I can appreciate the haunting chimes of Celtic Folk music, I am not interested in it enough to purchase much of it. &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot;, however, is the exception... Although it seems that more of her die-hard fans are disappointed, I think it is her transition to that uncharted and neglected space between her Folk roots and Popular Culture (tread successfully by the now-familiar Sarah McLachlan), and since the album is extremely neither (Pop nor Folk), she is exposed to an entirely new audience and shunned by her usual comaraderie.<br />&quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; seems to be the accepted draw to this album's success, however my first experience of McKennit was not to hear her, but to read her. I read the lyrics to &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; and was enchanted, never had a piece of writing so vague and simple say so much to me about my own concepts of Love and Devotion. To finally hear it was a double blessing, I was so pleased with the bittersweet route the melody had taken, and the slow pace of the song, it was just as I had imagined it to be. &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; in itself is reason enough to buy this album, it is truly a privilege to experience such a glorious unity of art, sound, and word. To be familiar with Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; only enriches the experiences because it tugs on familiar images that readers of the Classic have already established. The style is more lyrical and more modern than a ballad you'd expect of a Celtic Folk singer. &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; deserves so much more publicity than it has recieved... perhaps being a theme song to a proper movie would give it its rightful fame. I can't help but picture a tragic scene from some historical romance with this song softly but clearly playing in the background and through the credits...<br />Her voice is as sheer as gossamer yet rises to a wanton wail at times, which keeps one riveted to the music rather than be lulled to sleep. In a mysterious way there is so much Soul in her music, a skillfull listener can detect real expressiveness and emotion in her singing... she uses but the subtlest emphasis to communicate a wealth of impact.<br />A breakthrough was her interpretation of &quot;The Highwayman&quot;... I remembered it as a sad, but unremarkable, poem I read in school. Yet she uplifts the piece entirely with her unique blend of American Country and her trademark Celtic Folk... The rest of the album is beautiful... traces of Indian percussion are everywhere... &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; of fame lives up to its notoriety. All in all, I'd say this album was a masterpiece; it is unfortunate that McKennit fans were so disappointed, because this album is one of those rarities in music that reaches people across the boundaries of society, culture, and normality... and in music the lines can be SO defined between different genres. It is something airy, mystical, fluid, exquisite, and a little divine.<br />- Marcel Reyes
B00003CXS4|5.0|The editorial review really hit the nail on the head in this one...this film IS enjoyable in the vein of &quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,&quot; if not for the simplest of changes. Ritchie's first film invloved a few brits in deep trouble with a dodgy hustler, and in this film...a pair of brits in deep trouble with a crooked boxing promoter. Add a jewel thief with a penchant for gambling, several small time crooks with the worst luck, a rich american who tolerates his hate of London in search for the diamond, a dodgy russian with seemingly matrix-like ability, a hitman who is dragged along for the ride, and a very mysterious gypsy who is hired to fight for the two brits in trouble after he knocks their prized fighter senseless.<br />And then watch their delicate wishes get thrown into chaos.<br />However enjoyable this movie is, in comparison with Ritchie's first effort, there isn't a whole lot of new material to fairly distinguish this movie into a class of its own. But, based on cast and execution, it almost doesn't seem to matter.
0553573403|5.0|I am not much of a fantasy fan, but wow!  This guy weaves an engrossing tale.  I was warned by a friend who gave me the first book not to get attached to any of the characters.  He was right as Martin has no qualms about killing them off.  A previous reader gave this one star and I would dearly love to know his favorites because I have never read anything better.
B000002GJH|5.0|Not much to say other than a classic. Emotive songs, mostly written and sung by Chris Cornell. His voice is the most powerful around, and in my opinion, this album has his best work on it. If you buy an album in your life, buy this one and the songs will stay with you forever.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|This title is fantastic...the story line is good... and very engaging. It will keep you waiting for what will happen next. In the begining the going is kid of slow.. but once Eddie Murphy's character comes in, the the actions, the jokes, the laughs, and the gags never stop. I have to hand it to Disney they gave the perfect role to the perfect guy. No know could have ever executed the role like Eddie. The Humor of Eddie, which resembles the comedy standard of RAW (but much cleaner) will definately keep the more mature audiance cavptivated. And in the end the whole fable and story is nice and communicates well with the mind of young children. Definately a good movie, and a must buy for collectors. I have to take my hat off to the makers for this. Keep up the good work !!
0452282152|5.0|Some books seem to improve one in the best of ways. Girl With A Pearl Earring is one such. Besides feeling that I've experienced a perfectly authentic view of the era and an enhanced appreciation of the picture, I feel a sense of being better for having been in the heroine's company during my reading of the novel. Of absolution, almost. What a lovely book.
1559408898|4.0|one of the best blockbusters from the 1980's , robocop was a refreshing sendup of all the ridiculous reaganism (say no to drugs etc.etc.)that this country was embroiled in. This film is a credit to the sheer prowess of verhoven, judging by how the script presumably looked before production.
B00003CY5K|4.0|If your goal this Saturday is to see deep philosophical issues pondered for 3 hours on screen, skip this film.  If you want to have some fun and a lot of laughs, see Legally Blonde!  Reese Witherspoon is once again on the mark as a deceptively bright and motivated college student who doesn't know what she's not supposed to be able to do and then goes ahead and achieves even more.  All the while, she maintains her integrity and learns to stay true to herself - something we could all strive for.<br />It's not without its flaws however.  Most of the other characters seem stilted and appear to be reciting lines from a poorly written high school play.  I'm not sure why the writers and directors gave only the main character any depth or appearance of acting ability.<br />That aside, the story is cute ( and that's really the best word for it!) and I'm glad I chose it over Jurassic Park 3 last night!
B0000542DH|2.0|when I was 14 I thought this film was a cinematic achievement. But now looking back at it, I don't even really find Bob Richardson's photography that interesting,which is the primary main attraction here as with all of Oliver Stone's films. The Rodney Dangerfield scene however is wonderful, the rest isn't.
B00000099Y|5.0|This cd is Tool's best cd by far.  They are constantly keeping up with different styles of music that they can use in their cd's.  All of the songs on this cd rock, I can't choose just a few.  The song that made me buy this cd was Aenima, and then the rest of the songs on this cd grew on me.  Pick this cd up if you are open-minded on music, but beware, this cd may not be for music fans that like only the type of music that Metallica, KoRn, Limp Bizkit, or other hard Rock bands make.
0780623134|5.0|Morgan Freeman and TIm Robbins best performance. Best movie I have ever seen. If you consider yourself a movie fan you have to own this movie. I wish I could give this movie more stars than 5 cuz it deserves it.
B00005KFUM|5.0|oh......... all said..... just listen to it!  absolutely, completely, indescribably best album ever! don't listen to those who don't like MUSE -  they are not interested in MUSIC at all, and they lie to themselves.
0880389052|4.0|R. A. Salvatore maybe considered a wizard with his ability to create graphical fighting scenes, characters and an exciting plot with many twists. But some, whilst reading, may think the success of his book, particularly the Dark Elf Trilogy, is really down to one character, Drizzt Do'urdon.<br />Don't get me wrong, when someone can do something good, and this clearly is the case, he/she deserves to be praised. but many will be rating some of his books as the greatest of all, so I just want to point out a few facts.<br />This is the first of three books concerning the Dark Elves, and in simplest terms, it's one of the greatest tales of good against evil, with the odds stacked against the one good man, fighting against many evil Elves.<br />It's all very classic, but from the start, you kind of get the feeling that all will end well, when you have a child: &quot;Born with unique lavender eyes that, when switching to &quot;infravision&quot; stay the same colour.&quot; This uniqueness in itself, is an indication of no ordinary child, and it seems the book is really about Salavtore's personal dream that a &quot;special one&quot; will be born into a corrupt world, and still be able to keep his values, and survive the bitterness, greed, and power-hungry monsters that forever try to turn him.<br />It was an exciting read, and I couldn't put it down. He certainly did well, and I congratulate him myself. But it's not the best book ever, and I think a more &quot;real&quot; character would have grabbed more &quot;real&quot; people...
B00003CXAA|5.0|The epic saga so common throughout history, told in the stories of Homer, Dante, etc. transcends our own times, or any time for that matter that it would seem to be hard to measure up to the gradiosity and eloquence of the well-told tale, the epic saga, especially in our post-Palm Pilot, Sopranos, cell phone society.<br />That was until Mario Puzo sat down to create the beginnings, the framework, the characters, the story, the modern epic that we now know as THE GODFATHER. Francis Ford Coppola would use that book as the spark that started the fire that is now The Godfather I, II, and III. <br />We can all agree that The Godfather is a staple, and a veritable classic of the American cinema. With the release of the complete trilogy on DVD, Godfather fans of the past and present, and future can look at the big picture, the modern epic story of the Coreleone Family in all its fully realized glory, not to mention in blazing THX picture and sound for superior quality!<br />I've already preordered the Trilogy on DVD and can't wait to see it. I've seen all 3 films countless times, and it still feels like I've seen them all for the first time. It was the first &quot;Family&quot; that we all grew to love. I highly recommend getting the Godfather Trilogy on DVD, with all the extras, EVERYTHING!<br />Truly, this is greatest modern epic saga of our times. The story of Micheal Coreleone, his power, his responsibility, and most importantly his family, and the ties that bind, despite the strings that must be pulled... Get the GODFATHER TRILOGY ON DVD NOW!
0380788624|4.0|Crytonomicon is a great book about computers, nerds, war heros, and codes.  We're talking solid, well-written entertainment, though there may be a spot or two that seems a little dry to readers more interested in plot than technical details.<br />One of the premises of Cryptonomicon is that your true nerd is both a curious and fascinating oddity capable of incredible and fascinating feats of mental gymnastics, and simultaneously labored and extended single minded concentration of the sort that would drive most humans to insanity, suicide, or sleep.  <br />Cryptonomicon gets inside the mind of the nerd and shows you how, and why, they do what they do.  <br />Even a nerd needs a little outside stimulation now and then though, and Cryptonomicon provides enough blood-and-guts war action and business intrigue on the side to keep you turning the pages.
B00000G3PA|4.0|...this was a fabulous action movie, the one my preteen daughter and I HAD to have first when we got the dvd player, the one we watch again and again (my husband is sick of it).   Anyway guys, don't assume we won't enjoy it, we're not all shallow and hyper-emotional.  I repeat, \\"This is not a guy flick\\"!  Do not leave the girlfriends out, they will love it. I do think most critics expect too much.  Ever hear of watching a movie for fun, entertainment? This is the best kind. By the way I notice an inconsistancy in the cast, there seems to be an extra member of Bruce Willis' crew, he's not ever identified, but he pops up a couple times, around the table, when they are reading their demands and he's even pictured among the dead team members in the final scene...where did he come from and who is he?
B00005B4GU|4.0|They can't help it. Radiohead is a brand name and their website an award-winning marketing tool. And Amnesiac is quite an experience - if I haven't forgotten (just kiddin'). Beautiful and impressive, it touches the heart as well as the mind. And the spirit. Unlike Coldplay and Travis this Radiohead does want to cause Trouble and do more than just Sing, Sing, Sing. And I like that, I like Radiohead for being anti-Blair, and even more so for being against major corporations and dollars and cents in general. Indeed they are. Just as long as the heart matters too (Pyramid Song) I can dig a little piece of Autechre (like in Pulk/Pull). I think of Amnesiac as the bridge between OK Computer and Kid A. Most songs on Amnesiac could well have been written and/or recorded before most songs on their predecessor. Perfect memento - when most bands just want to shut up and dance, this Amnesiac.
0553277472|1.0|For years I have talked to people who told me that this book changed their lives.  Looking for enlightenment, I read it a couple of times and finally realized that there is nothing in it that a thoughtful ten-year old could not come up with.  The book has long been overrated.  For those of you whose lives have been changed by reading it, try something like Nietze or even Karl Marx and get ready.
078401213X|4.0|In &quot;Pi&quot; one encounters a film that is undeniably original.  Shot in jarring black and white, and using a variety of bizarre camera angles to convey the first person, it breaks new ground in the ways that a general audience movie can be shot.  More intriguing, however, is the plot.<br />Simply put, this movie follows a mathematician as he peruses an underlying pattern in the stock market., and later the universe.  Along the way he deals with an undefined neurological disorder, as well as Wall Street thugs and Jewish mystics.  As he comes closer and closer to this pattern, which becomes a representation of some sort of organizing force (God) in creation, he slips further and further into paranoia.  In the end, the director seems to be questioning whether the pursuit of the divine is ultimately self defeating.  Could it be that searching for the pattern in all things is a refutation of the beauty of creation?<br />Most of the reviews of this movie seem to have heaped it with either praise or scorn.  The reality, I think, lies somewhere in between.  On the one hand, this is an intriguingly shot, genuinely original film.  On the other it is somewhat shallow; the viewer is left to draw conclusions that might have been better served by being explicitly spelled out.  I happen to like it when books or movies do this, but that's more of a personality trait than the hallmark of a great artist.  In the end, \\"Pi\\" is a pleasant diversion from many of the mundane films being made today, and it will certainly leave you thinking.  On a related note, if you enjoyed this film, or are intrigued by it's premise, you might enjoy the novel \\"Damascus Gate\\" by Robert Stone, as it explores similar issues.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica, the greatest heavy metal band of all time, writes their 4th album thats is like all their others, A CLASSIC. This is definately Metallica's most structured album of all time. Songs like &quot;...And Justice For All, and &quot;One&quot; show true talent in Metallica's capability as song writers. Although the songs in this album are just a bit slower than the previous albums, you know that Metallica was very picky about what they put on this album. Many people think that this is their last descent album, and others say that it is the beginning of a bad era for Metallica's music, but for me, this is just another album that im proud of owning and listening too. If you are a die-hard Metallica fan, such as me, or a guitarist, such as me, buy this album, or you will regret that you didnt.
6303443214|5.0|this movie is amazing for 3 reasons: #1 it's totally creepy yet sexy, erotic and beautiful. #2 the acting is awesome. #3 tom cruise, brad pitt, antonio bandaras, and christian slater are all in it! need i say more?! one of the best vampire movies ever.
B0000399WI|5.0|All of those people who say that this film is just mediocre (you know who you are): what the hell is wrong with you? This is by far Stephen King's best movie and it is right up there with the 1994 Academy Award winning movie Forrest Gump. Tim Robbins gives the performance of a lifetime. The movie itself might not have been quite as good as Gump, but he definately had a better performance than Hanks (who as you know won best actor). And Morgan Freeman is outstanding. If you think that this movie is just mediocre, then watch this movie again, but watch it closely and pay attention!
B00005A1PR|4.0|india arie enters the neo soul ring with her awesome debut &quot;acoustic soul&quot;. she's not the next erykah and &quot;acoustic soul&quot; shows that. on almost every track she plays her acoustic guitar but the material is more smooth r&amp;b than soul. there are real instruments present but there's also drum loops. india's voice sounds relaxed, confident and smooth on each track. a great cd to kick back and relax to. fave tracks: &quot;video&quot;, &quot;promises&quot;, &quot;brown skin&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;always in my head&quot;, &quot;i see god in you&quot;, and &quot;simple&quot;.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie explores the life of rock stars, and gives an in depth glimpse into their minds, exposing true feelings about stardom, fans, their music, and life in general.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is searching for a break from your normal and cliched movies with the same plot, actors, and music.  Kate Hudson does a wonderful job playing Penny Lane, a band aid, and convinced me thouroughly into believing her character could be real.  The music in the film is also exceptional; I recommend the soundtrack to any music fan of the rock and roll era.  Overall, I believe this movie to be very well made, and I hope everyone will give it a chance.
B00005AQE8|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY OFF THE HOOK. IT'S ESSENTIAL TO ANY FAN OF 2PAC'S MUSIC. WHEN I PICKED IT UP I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN, BECAUSE THERE WASNT 1 TRACK U HAD 2 SKIP OVER. I THINK 1 OF THE HOTTEST TRACKS HAS 2 BE #4 ON THE FIRST DISK , WHERE PAC FEATURES METHOD MAN AND REDMAN FOR ONE OF THE PHATEST SONGS I'VE EVER HEARD. THE BEATS ARE OFF THE HOOK AND LYRICS ARE AMAZING. U BETTER PICK UP THIS ALBUM BECAUSE ONCE U DO, U WON'T BE ABLE 2 PUT IT DOWN.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|This is easily the worst movie of the new millennium.  Horribly acted, written, and filmed.  Anyone giving this piece of tripe anything more than one star is a moron and is presumably amazed by fire.  Angelina Jolie is hideous to look at, and Robert Duvall has been is some bad flicks but this one takes the cake.  The original, though just as poorly acted, at least has some decent car chase scenes.  This is armature night film making.
B00005MAM2|3.0|This movie was one of the first anime that I saw, one I enjoyed.  While this DVD takes the cake for having some nice visuals, the new english dub royaly sucks, talk about the fastest way to ruin a good piece of art.<br />I dont like VHS tapes, and ive stoped buying them, but after purchasing the special edition DVD with the Metal case (Where you nearly have to bend the dvd's in half to get them out of the holders) I would GIVE my copy to anyone who would trade me the english Dubbed version of the VHS. Not only did the original acting sound more realistic, it was worded better, and had better actors playing the parts.<br />I would rate the DVD at 93% for visual quality, and 25% for the new audio translation, all of our favorite screams and laughs are gone.. sound effects/music sounded good on Dolby 5.1, the only good thing i can say about that.<br />The VHS takes the cake with 87% in visuals, and 92% in audio. Until (if ever) they release the original audio dub on DVD, stay away from this DVD.
B00005LLK8|5.0|Billy Elliot is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I watched this film two times in a row and am now ordering it.  The directing, the acting the photogrophy,everything about this movie is perfect. A joy to watch, again and again and again.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Currently, I found a lot of interest in myself for 60's rock and psychedelic music. I love the Doors, I dig Janis a lot and a lot of that hippie-stuff seems to grow on me now. So I wanted to own a Pink-Floyd album from this time as well. I never heard &quot;Animals&quot; or &quot;The Wall&quot;, not even &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. I only knew &quot;Meddle&quot; and &quot;Ummagamma&quot; which I both liked. So then I purchased &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;. For me, this album varies between typical great floydian Psychedelica and Songs that are barely listenable. I'll rate this album song by song:<br />1.Let there be more Light: Great Song, great opener. The vocals fit perfectly with the music and the outro is way trippy. 9 / 10<br />2.Remember a Day: Very mellow, but also great. Has some unbelieveable Piano ( or whatever ) work in there. 8 / 10<br />3.Set Controls for the Heart of the Sun : The trippiest Piece on the album. Fantastic Song but I like the live-version on Ummmagamma a whole lot more. Still, one of the album highlights 8 / 10<br />4.Coporal Clegg : What was Roger thinking? This song starts off quite ok but soon descends into some circus-like music with something that sounds like a plastic trumpet. Just pray it will be over soon. 3 / 10<br />5.A Saucerful of Secrets : Good song, properbly my favorite. Mainly just plain noise at the beginning, this song has a great buildup with fun Drumwork by Nick Manson. It Ends up in a beautiful way but it's also better on the &quot;Ummagamma&quot; album. Anyway 8 / 10<br />6.See-Saw: I can't say much about that song. It seems to go on for very long despite it's really only about 4 or 5 minutes. Doesn't compare at all to &quot;Remember a Day&quot; the other song Rick Wright wrote for this album. It seems like a filler but maybe it will grow on me. For now 5 / 10<br />7.Jugband Blues: I don't really get that song. There is also a few of this circus-trumpet stuff and it's just as nerve wrecking as in &quot;Coperal Clegg&quot;. Not very inspired, I expected more from Syd. Maybe I should listen to &quot;Piper&quot; first. Still, the end of the song kinda got to me. 6 / 10<br />After all, this record goes from good to painful for me. It also seems desperately in Need of a GOOD remastering. I don't know about your copy but mine often sounds like someone taped it over from Vinyl into CD without any sound improvements. In the End, this is a worthwile record but I won't buy anymore Floyd in the near future. Maybe one day, when I'm all grown up, I'm gonna listen to &quot;ANIMALS&quot;.
0767805712|2.0|Why is that the majority of movies as of recent portray the future to be sterile, repressed and somewhat impending? One could go out on a limb and say that they delineate fascism. Is this subliminal commentary in regards to the lessening degree of privacy that only few seem to be concerned with? Whatever the reasoning for this peculiar generalization the sci-fi section of your local video store is flooded with dismal pre/post-apocalyptic glimpses into humanities future. Due to this abundance, I was not overtly eager to see Gattaca; it seemed to be a been there, done that forecast for mankind. After viewing Gattaca I can soundly say my assumptions were correct.<br /> The setting of Gattaca is a bleak (yawn) Marxist-Hitleristic society; Marxist in respect to the idea that everyone has employment and Hitleristic in respect to the ideals of rewarding perfection and weeding out impurities. Predictably, the plot revolves around an imperfect individual named Vincent Freeman who is played by the consistently less-than-enthusiastic Ethan Hawke. Vincent needs glasses to see properly and does not have a desired body structure. His brother, Anton (Elias Koteas) is his opposite, successful and highly intelligent. Sibling rivalry aside, Vincent yearns to join society as a normal individual. Vincent enlists the aid of German (Tony Shalhoub), a so-called DNA broker who sells false identities to the genetically inferior. German sets Vincent up in a partnership with Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a once superior genetic specimen who has been paralyzed in an accident and is now willing to sell his prime genetic material for cash.<br />  For the most part, the story delves into the shallow waters of predictability quickly and never really emerges. The average viewer knows before they press play where this scenario is going. Its fairly obvious that initially Vincent's plan will go smoothly, minor complication will begin to add up, a love interest will have some screen time (Uma Thurman) and itll wrap up with a fairly anti-climactic resolution. Though that doesnt mean Gattaca cant be pretty while doing it. In fact, Gattacas visual presentation is what salvages it from absolutely tanking. Warholesque modernistic landscapes litter the world of Gattaca creating an environment that is moderately visually intriguing.<br />  With characters that are fairly two-dimensional one would figure the star power involved would try to beat some life into the dull characters and flat screenplay. It is understandable that the characters are merely consequences of their environment but some of the dialog execution in regards to tone is painfully monotonous; on occasion Gattaca sounds like a script read-through. Ethan Hawke is his usual underplayed, slightly lethargic self and is happy to demonstrate that anyone could do his job as long as they are teen-dream material. Uma Thurman is effectively listless but oddly enough, has little sexual chemistry with Hawke even though they are married off screen. Jude Law is his usual scene-stealing self but gets very little screen time. I kept half wishing that he had played Hawkes role.<br />  The idea of use of DNA to create perfect children, or clone individuals is extremely interesting material, unfortunately it is trapped in an uninteresting movie. Gattaca tries so hard to illustrate a desolate engineered society that proper character development is neglected for a plethora of elementary DNA lessons that are largely dumb down for public consumption.
B00003CXSM|3.0|This movie is very cute, but very predictable. If you've seen \\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\" you have seen this already. Jennifer Lopez( or J.Lo) does a really good job in this movie and so does Matthew Mccougnhey.  But they have no chemistry whatsoever! ... Anyway, if you like romantic comedies, I recommend this movie if not don't bother it's very predictable like a lot of other people here said.
B00004Z459|5.0|If you're like me, you are probably sceptacle of website reviews because you never know how reliable or mature the source you're reading is. Some people like to comment on cds just to be on the internet. Others &quot;love&quot; everything they've ever heard. I hadn't heard of Linkin Park from the radio, videos, or from screaming teenage TRL fans. I heard them all from downloaded music on my computer, where I soon realized this was one of the best cds of the year, even though the only track that had been released was One Step Closer, which, in my opinion, is the worst song on a cd full of great music (even though it's still not too bad of a song). If you like anything you've heard from Linkin Park, buy the cd. Trust me. Every track is great, and in it's own distinct way. My personal favorite is In the End. I'll be at their concert August 1 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. I've seen Aerosmith, U2, Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, Fuel, Everclear, and Our Lady Peace already this year, but I am looking forward to this show just as much, if not more, than any of those.

0425180638|2.0|I have to say, I was looking forward to a new Patricia Cornwell book so much that I actually forgot what was starting to get on my nerves about her previous books.<br />Fortunately enough (or more appropriately, unfortunately enough), Last Precinct was nice enough to remind me.<br />While I haven't read any of her books outside of the Scarpetta series, it's time for her to either retire this series, or simply retire the same old stale formula.  You know the one.  Build up to big climax, shocking revelation that changes the history of the previous books, and climax all tied up neatly in the last 10 pages.<br />Seriously, this trick of rewriting previous Scarpetta history to insert her new characters retroactively in old storylines just smacks of such laziness to me.  It's nice to have characters that continue from one book to the next, but it seems to have turned into a crutch that allows her to get away with not actually moving and and growing the characters/storylines/etc.<br />I hate to say it, but this is probably the last of her books I will read.  18 months ago, I had all my friends reading Cornwell.  Now I feel like apologizing.
B000002N2P|5.0|I have had the Nimrod and Dookie CD for quite some time now. I also bought the Warning CD 3 days after it came out only to find it sounding nothing like Green Day at all, but that belongs in another review so i won't discuss that. It was just about 4-5 months ago (I think) that I was told that my friend had THIS CD. So i picked up a burned copy of this CD from him and I loved it! This CD is not as good as as Dookie or Nimrod. But sure as hell is better than the disappointing Warning CD. It has a similar sound to Dookie but Dookie is still better. My favourite song is: The Brat. I don't have the Kerplunk or 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hour yet but I plan on getting them.<br />Also, if someone from green Day is reading this then I want to say: come back to being a punk band! I hope their next CD is like this and not like Warning.
0790736039|5.0|This was a good movie. BUT i havnt read the book yet so i cant really say which is better. The book will probably be better becuz the book always is better than the movie. When i found out that it was a TV MiniSeries I did think they could do alot better. In my option i think they should Re-Do the movie, as a MOVIE and not a TV show. It would probably be 10x better.
6300214044|5.0|The Elephant Man is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  The story of John Merrick is based closely (but sometimes, not too closely) on the Victorian Joseph Merrick, who was so disfigured he could not go out in daylight.  Rescued from the life of a sideshow freak by Sir Frederick Treves (masterfully portrayed by Anthony Hopkins), he lives the remainder of his life in dignity and relative comfort, attracting the attention of much of upper-class society, including Dame Madge Kendall and Princess Alexandra.  The black and white cinematography is stunning; the makeup work--and John Hurt's ability to touch all of us beneath layers of latex--should have won Oscars.  The music is perfect.  One of those historical films which convinces you, &quot;yes, this MUST be what it was like to live back then.&quot;  The small details matter, such as a scene where Treves is performing an operation, at a time when surgeons did not wear masks or gloves, and he coughs right on the man's chest.  Germ city--but they didn't know it back then.<br />OK, these were (just) some of the film's strong suits.  Now to review the actual video.  In short, this one screams out for a DVD release.  Even for a mid-priced video of a somewhat older movie, this VHS tape looks dreadful.  The black and white photography appears overexposed (all the whites are too pale, almost blindingly so, and I know it's not my TV because I did some comparisons).  For example, the scene where Treves first sees Merrick, Merrick is in almost total darkness and we must &quot;guess&quot; as to his appearance--this is how I remember it from HBO.  But heck, here everything is so light we can see the guy perfectly, certainly not the intended effect.<br />If this is not enough, consider that the original film was shot in widescreen, and yet most of the VHS is in full-frame, except for the opening credits.  After the credits we have a glorious split-second more of widescreen, but then we go to full-frame and don't get the original intent of Lynch's vision.  If this is not enough, there are tons and tons of artifacts on the film.  Some may think it makes it look &quot;Victorian,&quot; but I have a feeling a DVD release would clear this up as well.<br />So in short, this film needs a DVD with the following features: widescreen, trailer, commentary by the principals, perhaps including a historian who can compare the film to the life of the actual Elephant Man, and even deleted scenes.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd is great! The whole cd is hilarious (except for \\"Stan\\" and \\"Kim\\"), and i especially love the robbery skit in \\"Criminal\\". BUY THIS ALBUM
B000059XUY|5.0|&quot;Oliver and Company&quot; is based on Charles Dickens' classic novel, &quot;Oliver Twist.&quot;  In the Disney version, Oliver is a charming ginger tabby and Dodger is a dog with Billy Joel's voice.  The music is very good, especially Joel's &quot;Why Should I Worry.&quot;  The movie actually parallels Dickens' novel pretty well, but has a great deal more charm.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I remember going to see this movie when it first came out and I was utterly stunned at the amazing detail not only of the actual battle but of the emotions and thoughts of each character.  The excellent portrayal of the men that fought this deciding battle of the Civil War is amazing.  Jeff Daniels is the perfect choice for Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.  He is a wonderful mix of sensativity and total strength.   Tom Berenger is wonderful as Longstreet, showing the moral, ethical and tactical problems he had with the fight at Gettysburg and the fight within himself between military loyalty or morality.  It is almost impossible not to get emotionally involved in this movie and feel the pain of each leader and soldier on both sides.  Other Civil War movies portary one side( mostly the north) as the ultimate good guy.  Gettysburg shows that neither side was good or bad but just fighting for what they believed in and doesn't ask that the viewer chooses a side but instead asks that we feel for everybody on the field.  And it isn't hard to do.  <br />  Whether for historians, Civil War buffs, people who enjoy movies, or anybody that just wants to know more, this epic is worth seeing.

0385474547|5.0|In this compact novel, Chinua Achebe has packed a story on the level of Greek tragedy, of the tipping point in African tribal life when the white man comes, from the perspective of Okonkwo, a man for whom tribal life has worked seamlessly.  Achebe devotes the extended first part of the book to episodic accounts of village life, portraying a very complex agrarian culture with remarkably integrated economic, social, religious and political systems.  Okonkwo is the ambitious son of an unambitious man.  He overcame his inauspicious birthright and lives prosperously with three wives and several children.  Their daily life is rendered vividly in Achebe's rhythmic, economic style.  Misfortune befalls Okonkwo in a moment's accident at the end of part one, but tribal custom has a way of taking care of him, sending him and his family in exile to his mother's village for seven years.  He spends the years anxiously awaiting the time to return to the life he enjoyed, ignoring the harbingers of change that arrive in the person of the first missionary.   When he at last returns to the life he left behind, it is no what he had remembered, understood and cherished.  <br />For this contemporary reader, THINGS FALL APART served as a fine contemplation of character and conflict, of an international historical phenomenon from the individual's experience, of the problems of change and chance.  It also offered a fresh reading of Yeat's poem, &quot;The Second Coming,&quot; from which the title is taken.  I regret this was not assigned in my education; I hope educators are encouraging high school and college students to read it today.  It's the type of book that makes you love literature and reading.
B000002UA9|4.0|Early early stuff here... &quot;Please Please Me&quot; is no experimental album. It's just plain old John, Paul, George, and Ringo rocking out to classic covers such as &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Anna&quot;, and to now Beatle favorites like &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. You won't find any heavy, meaning-ladden lyrics in these songs... just good old fashioned classic rock and roll. This collection of songs provides fun, easy-listening with catchy lyrics and fantastic guitar work. A little rough around the edges (which I find makes the album all that much more appealing), the boys were just starting out down the road to fame. This is a classic, must-have album for any Beatlemaniac, as it was their &quot;hello to the world&quot;.
0553573403|5.0|I bought this book after reading some of the reviews. I was not familiar with the series, but thought I&#8217;d give it a shot. I&#8217;m glad I did. I started reading this on the third day of vacation and finished it 4 days later (800 pages). A Game of Thrones is somewhere between the historical fiction of Dunnett&#8217;s Lymond Chronicles and Tolkien&#8217;s Lord of the Rings. It is largely about political intrigue and battle in a human medieval setting (fictional lands), but with some supernatural parts too. In this first book of the series, the supernatural is not the main player, but there are hints of future events.<br />If you like Dunnett and Tolkien you will like this book. It&#8217;s a good, captivating read.<br />BTW, if you buy this book, make sure you put a bookmark in the appendix, where all the characters and their lineages are listed. I did not realize it was there until I finished the book. It would have helped.
0452281881|5.0|Very funny and superbly written!<br />If you've ever worked in or just had the chance to get at taste of the inside living of an ad-agency you'll definitely recognize the characters in Beaumont's book. If you've always wondered if their minds really work the way you think, 'e' will confirm your worst fears...<br />To all the others: this book doesn't exaggerate at all - it is a unique opportunity for you all to see how things really are in the world of advertising...<br />Five stars!
B00000K32J|5.0|This is even better than The Lord of The Dance. The cast and the choreography is excellent. There is no age group for this video. Is educational as well as entertaining.The music is vibrant and every performance is magnificently done, some of the themes refer to a mythical story others are music performed by different artists. Michael Flatley is outstanding! This great choreographic event looks at Celtic dance at its best. The music is worderful at the end of the concert Michael Flatley recives an standing ovation with the audience asking for an encore!!
B000002LND|4.0|The Immaculate Collection (get it....playing on the phrase, the immaculate conception...just in case you don't) is Madonna's first greatest hits collection, covering from her very first self-titled album to I'm Breathless. Already, the Material Girl had amassed a string of hits....so many that even this CD can't contain all of them.<br />So, a few are left out....like Angel, Dress You Up, Who's that Girl, True Blue, etc. But that is just quibbling. In those early days, Madonna put efforts into her albums, and the Immaculate Collection is no exception.<br />For most artists, greatest hits packages are simply that, just slap your greatest hits onto an album and ship it out. But not Ms. Ciccone. Each track on the album is really an edited version of the song's 12&quot; remix...and re-mastered with what was supposed to be the next best thing: Q-sound. Whatever THAT was. Well, at least we are getting something different, not the same old stuff that we already have. As a bonus, Madonna jammed into two new tracks, Justify My Love, which is probably known for its video being banned on MTV than anything else, and Rescue Me. These two songs featured Madonna speaking the lyrics rather than singing...setting the tone for her next album, Erotica.<br />Anyway, with so much material in one CD, something is bound to get screw up along the way. Well, some songs are needlessly edited, and some are needlessly extended. For example, Like A Virgin faded out like a full half minutes before it was supposed to, while Like A Prayer, we got an extended dance remix (the version from her Blonde Ambition Tour). Into the Groove was an edited version from the You Can Dance remix album, not the original version which became a hit. <br />The package itself is kind of incongruous....While the CD is a celebration of her music, it is not a celebration of the image that accompanied the music. I mean instead of presenting us with a history of the Madonna's many incarnations, we are left with her dressedup like a cabaret singer stranded in a circus somewhere. <br />I might sound over critical, but then, I am a Madonna fan who have pratically all her releases..so I know what is missing and what is not. But overall, the Immaculate Collection is one of the best greatest hits compilation around. But because of space limitation, certain songs will seem rushed.<br />Hopefully, her second compilation will not make the same mistakes.
6300271285|4.0|Can you believe I first saw this movie when I was two years old?  That I used to watch it on averidge at least twice a week untill I was about 13?  It's true.  This is what got me into musical therter, and I'll always love it.<br />The romance between Seymoer and audrey is so sweet and touching, and is really the best part of the musical.  Add in something *really* interesting like a man eating plant, and you've got a great story.<br />Oh, and the music.  It's so good that I recently had to buy a sound track.  &quot;Suddenly Seymoer&quot; and &quot;Down town&quot; are my personal faves.
0380973634|5.0|A great read all around. There's a great sense of fun and the feeling that this world really does exist just beyond the shadows. The characters are by far the best aspect of the book however, the minor ones that are intoduced along the way are often as interesting or more so than the major players. This book also has two of the coolest, most deranged bad guys since Mr. Blond. Just happy little psychopaths. Enjoy.
B00005ASHM|2.0|I know its an unpopular opinion, but I don't understand why this album is so great?  I know it's 1966 and there was nothing like it, but there was nothing like the Beatles when they came out and nothing like the Doors first album(around the same time).  Sloop John B. and Wouldn't It Be Nice are great arrangments/songs, no argument.  I'm not living in a box, I've listened to everything from Love's 'Forever Changes' to the Kinks 'Village Green Preservation Society'.  Granted, there's nothing like the Beach Boys harmony, but I would look to earlier songs which display that talent, 'In My Room' for one...at least they are listenable.  Paul McCartney's favorite album, so what?  Must have somehow reached him on a personal level.  My favorite album is Mr. Tambourineman, and its no masterpiece either...
B0000399WI|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you have too.   Classic.   One of the greats.  No matter who you are or age or anything, you'll love it.  That simple.  I don't wanna give away the story though.

0792843584|5.0|I think Heaven's Gate would rate in the top 5 greatest westerns ever produced. I firmly believed that the movie was way ahead of its time and flopped as such. Lets face it, if Rambo was released today it probably wouln't last past opening night, or go straight to video. But in 1985, because of ideal social and cultural circumstances it was a blockbuster. Likewise I think that Heaven's Gate would be a masterpeice by today's standards only I dont think that Hollywood is up to making such a high quality film nowadays. In any case I think that modern movie fans would really like this movie. It is a &quot;black sheep&quot; compared to the run of the mill 80's cinema that tends to get such bad press these days.
B00000064G|5.0|nick drake, we barely knew ye... ok, well, I don't really know how to capture anything that Nick did with words, but, i'll try... I first heard Nick about 10 years ago, the song ( not on Pink Moon ) was 'clothes of sand', and by the end of the song I was unaware of anything else around me. I had an early morning radio show and had stumbled acroos a sampler CD that Rykodisc had put out to promote 'Fruit Tree'. My interest was peaked because, hey, World of Skin had covered one of his songs and Robert Smith of the Cure wanted to do a solo album of songs that sounded like Nick and hey what's a recovering Goth to do but check it out. Truly I was not prepared. Not for this.  Nick Drake's music is simply beautiful. This album is so quiet, but it RAGES with the blues.(Guess white boys do get 'em.) Some will like because of it's pastoral sound and seeming stillness; others will feel parts of themselves exposed to the light that usually creep around in the dark. Let me be terribly frank: this album kept me alive in the saddest moments of my life because I knew I was not alone.( ..another white boy with the blues)  Thanks for opening the doors VW....
B000001GXE|3.0|While I am generally quite a fan of Carlos Kleiber's work, I find that this recording of the 'Unfinished' symphony misses a dimension. Kleiber seems to have decided to adopt a similar approach to that which he used so successfully in his recordings of Brahms's 4th and Beethoven's 5th and 7th, but the   'Unfinished' symphony is a very different animal to what are generally fast-paced works calling for quite a hard-driven interpretative style. Kleiber emphasises Schubert's marked dynamic contrasts to extremes(the pianissimos are particularly quiet) but, after a while, this becomes wearing and feels a bit inconsequential. Having conducted the symphony on a number of occasions, I have come to realise that grading the dynamic contrasts as each movement progresses lends a much greater sense of cumulative power to the work; rather than blasting the first fortissimo as much as possible, as Kleiber does, I think it is better to hold something back for the repeat and recapitulation. The latter is emphasised by the addition of timpani but, here, Kleiber conveys no sense of this being the final descent into the abyss. That Kleiber's approach does not produce such dramatic results as he might have intended is clear from certain structural details; at the start of the development, for instance, the descending scale on cellos and basses that can sound so ominous is nowhere near as powerful as it can be, simply because Kleiber rushes his fences and doesn't allow time for the sense of foreboding to regster. The second movement is even less appropriately dealt with; it is taken rather faster than the marked 'andante con moto' and, consequently, the resigned beauty of the movement, very much in the spirit of Schubert's B flat piano sonata, is not as moving as it should be. Kleiber does achieve an admirable sense of stillness at the very end but, again, he misses many opportunities along the way; the horn solos just before the return of the main theme, for instance, are not nearly as sensitively shaped as they could have been(and, as in the first movement development, that this is in the buildup to an important structural point makes it all the more important that they should be).  Although Kleiber's view can be seen as a valid one then, taking the music of a dying syphilitic as some kind of nervous and febrile utterance and thus pushing the symphony so hard and calling for such extreme dynamic contrasts every time, the interpretation relies on the dramatic moments rather than driving the work as a whole into one's consciousness. Gunter Wand's marvellous recording with the Berlin Philharmonic does all the things Kleiber misses and, although I realise that this is a matter of personal preference as much as anything, I can't help thinking that Wand- whose tempi are consistently slower but whose whole conception of the work is so much more powerful- gets a good deal closer to what Schubert must have had in mind.       The third symphony fares altogether better with a similar approach, however. Written when Schubert was only 18, it has an inherent freshness and verve that benefits from Kleiber's tempi (which, as the Amazon review suggest, are often strikingly faster than what one expects)and rhythmic spring. Although elegant and polished, Sir Thomas Beecham's famous recording of the third symphony (on EMI) feels a little heavy after listening to the sense of fun that Kleiber imparts here. The Beecham approach is not 'wrong' in any way but, as the booklet notes say, Kleiber's fresher interpretation is perhaps more appropriate to such a youthful work. Three stars, then, for a fine rethinking of a neglected early work; for the 'Unfinished,' Gunter Wand's recording remains a clear first choice.

0064400557|5.0|One of the best reasons for having children is having an excuse to read Charlotte's Web. I just finished reading it to my youngest child, and cried just as hard as a did when I first read it to her brother a decade ago. <br />The story is about a spider who saves a pig from being turned into bacon and pork chops by weaving words to describe him into her web, convincing everyone that a miracle has occurred, and that there must be something very special about this pig. <br />Charlotte, the spider, is kind, noble, and brave  a model of perfect friendship. Wilbur, the pig, is childlike and innocent at the beginning, but he grows wiser under Charlotte's influence throughout the book. The book is beautifully written in simple, graceful language. It's just a pleasure to read from beginning to end.<br />There is one thing that anyone planning to read the book to a young child ought to know.  At the end, after laying her eggs, Charlotte dies. I had actually forgotten about that when I started reading the book to my 6-year-old recently, and when, halfway through the book, I remembered, I was a little worried about what her reaction would be. But as I got closer and closer to Charlotte's death, I realized how skillfully E.B. White handled the scene. For a couple of chapters before, you see Charlotte growing weaker and weaker. My daughter kept moving closer to me, sensing, I'm sure, that something was wrong. Charlotte's death doesn't come as a shock. Even a kindergartner seemed to sense that it was coming. More important, in the scene after Charlotte dies, Wilbur guards her eggs until her babies are born, and while most of them fly away, three baby spiders stay behind and become his friends. He's able to guide them the way Charlotte guided him, which gives a wonderful sense of continuity. <br />I don't think Charlotte's death is a reason not to read the book to a child, but I think if you're planning to read it to a child under 8 or so, you should read it to yourself first to be sure your child is ready for it.

B00003CXQX|5.0|I watched this film in a very small theater in Kyoto, Japan, and  only 20 people were there. (Maybe that was because its rather  insipid Japanese title -- &quot;Rama ni Natta Ohsama&quot; meaning &quot;King  Who Became a Llama&quot;; a pity)  Anyway, after the first 10 minutes, we felt we all were drawn into the funniest world Disney created since &quot;Aladdin,&quot; and its fun never stopped.  And the final reel, the last 15 minutes, was a real audience-rouser.  To be honest, before I saw the film, I was thinking,  like, &quot;Hey, it's another annual Disney production, full of usual format with songs and somthing like that.&quot;  Well, and it was a  surprise.  &quot;Emperor's New Groove&quot; shows that finally Disney understood that without song-dance sequences you can catch the  viewers' heart, even kids', as materpieces like &quot;Iron Giant&quot;  proves.  It is the characters that should move the whole story  on, and the four main characters just testifies to that simple  rule.  Like in a good old tale, you can find your favorite character(s) among them (by the way, mine is Yzma the invincible).  And the picture itself is impressive with its  rather old-fashioned, but colorful and various artifices -- ultra-fast close-up, sudden stop-and-start of characters, flashbacks, unexpected parody, and even character's going out of film's frame and talking directly to us! -- all of which remind me of the crazy movement of lovable characters in classic animations of old days, like &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry.&quot;  <br />So it is fun, and what else do you want? Just enjoy it, just as  we  lucky people did this hot summer in Kyoto. Oh, by the way, I want to ask the people of Disney: Is it because Eartha Kitt played a certain villain in TV's Batman series that Yzma is turned into a --- in the end?
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead's career has had a rise and fall in my opinion, with Amnesiac at the end of the fall.  Pablo Honey was a slightly better than average alternative rock cd, then the group ascended to The Bends, which was an excellent alternative rock cd.  They broke new ground in 1997, putting out a concept album, OK Computer.  That was their height, OK Computer was a provocative, well done concept album, considered by most critics to be one of the best albums of the 90's.  The songs flowed together, the lyrics had meaning, and most importantly, they sounded good.  You could listen to OK Computer and get some deep meaning about the struggle of man vs machine, and the songs were well composed and melodic.  Then Radiohead started a downward descent with Kid A, and stooped even lower with Amnesiac.  These albums are both overly abstract, lack melody, and although both contain a few excellent songs, lack the cohesiveness and melody of OK Computer.  People rave about the creative genius of these two albums (particularly Amnesiac) not because it is genius, but because it is Radiohead.  Amnesiac in particular seems like an album that the band rushed to make and lacks fine tuning and continuity.  Several of the latter tracks sound more like outtakes or b sides than actual finished songs.  If you find the beats don't seem to fit together and the lyrics bizarre and indecipherable it doesn't mean that you don't get the &quot;misunderstood genius&quot;.  I think this album is comparable to a lot of works of modern art.  People will buy into anything created by great artists that have produced great work in the past, simply because it is theirs, regardless of whether or not it is actually good.  They just say &quot;You don't understand it.&quot;  Come on...who really does.  This album is OK.  What it isn't is OK Computer.

Ironically, this movie is about a man who cannot remember...and this is one of the most memorable films around.
0060920084|2.0|Like lots of folks, my first experience of Bryson was reading his genuinely hilarious account of his Appalachian Trail adventures. So, when I found \\"The Lost Continent\\" on sale at a flea market for a dollar, I snapped it up.  Now I'm relieved that that is all it cost me.            I started the book with high hopes not only because I'd enjoyed \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" but because I, too, would love to find the perfect small town. I thought that Bryson might help in that quest.  In fact, the reason for two stars, rather than one or none, is that he does help in that endeavor.           Right from start this book jolted me. [...]. There is some point at which humor crosses the line and becomes just plain nasty. Bryson crosses it frequently; his early chapters are almost unremittingly meanspirited.  As just one example, he continually ridicules his father, for whom he claims to have affection, yet seems unaware that he describes exactly the same qualities in himself - for which he finds no fault, but blames others. Specifically, he laughs at his father's difficulty in finding an access road to a tourist attraction to which thousands of others have gained access, yet, in Oxford, Mississippi, Bryson is unable to find William Faulkner's house, a \\"feat\\" thousands of tourists have clearly accomplished. Instead Bryson pokes fun at the polite woman who tries to give him directions.           There is no question that Bill Bryson has a very readable style and there is also no question that many of his insights are spot-on funny and perceptive. But were it not for my wish to find \\"perfect\\" small towns to visit, I would have quit the book very early. I genuinely hated - no other word for it - the harshness of his not-at-all funny atttacks on countless people and places.
014028009X|5.0|I read Bridget Jones' Diary on a whim, after seeing the movie.  I thought that the movie was an interesting take on singles life, with these little gems of comedic, yet completely right on target, observations about life.  (The whole good vs. bad underwear thing for example)  It might have been these little jewels that led me to believe that there was something more in the book.  Lo and behold, yet again the movie was as deep, at most, as a puddle after a two minute drizzle.  The book on the other hand, really digs deep into the innards of single life.      Helen Fielding focuses on so much more of the isolation that &quot;singletons&quot; feel living in a big city, and the blatant fact that they spend a lot of time by themselves lamenting about their life, weight, lovers, &quot;alcohol units&quot; of the day, etc.  I thought that Fielding presents Bridget's life in a very painstakingly detailed way so as to paint an accurate picture of her life.  Bridget disappoints the reader occasionally with her random stupid mistakes, but at the same time is someone that most people can relate to... who hasn't been on a date, met someone in a bar or done something so completely ascine that your friends are still making fun of you for to this day?  While that may be ordinary, Fielding does a great job of crafting Bridget's dilemnas as being just as screwed up as everyone else's yet with such a brilliant comedic tone that it crafts a wonderful novel.  Frankly, what singleton (female anyway) can't relate to your mother wanting you to &quot;find someone&quot;, your lovely gay male friends, the constant flux of men that you meet, the trouble of finding one you actually LIKE, and then of course the trials and tribulations and joys of your girlfriends.  Life is pretty crazy, and I think that Helen Fielding does a superb job of describing just how crazy, desperate, lonely, passionate, conflicted and joyous life can be all at once.
B000050FEN|5.0|The best thing about this film is the atmosphere it creates.<br />Very riveting, and provides so many areas to explore.  The characters in the story give us enough personality to say we know them at the end of the movie, but not enough to make the film predictable.  Morgan Freeman again shows his ability to add true intelligence, wisdom, and feeling to a character, and fits in well with Pitt's ability to create a strong personality.<br />The connection to Mideval poetry and literature is also an excellent medium for Morgan Freeman's character to dwell in.  It gives depth to the murderer's personality without ever having to see a scene with Kevin Spacy in it.<br />Imagry is dark, dirty, and worn.  Colors are flat, and scenes are crowded with people.  It gives the viewer a sense of depression that's required to grasp the killer's motives (notice that it's always raining except for the end!)<br />Excellent film.  Watch it.
6301174240|1.0|The MoonWalker video is very disappointing.  I can promise you that I am the number one Michael Jackson fan.  The smooth criminal video is incredible but the entire film is unnecessary.  The video appears on History Volume II, so buy that one instead.  The Dangerous Short Films and History Volume I are also both a lot better than Moonwalker. Even if you are an avid fan, I suggest buying all other M.J. videos before you even think about buying this one.
B000002HJD|5.0|I'll admit, I don't really listen to my other Doors CD's that much anymore...but &quot;An American Prayer&quot; is an exception. Jim Morrison will be recognized as one of the most important (and certainly the most imitated) frontmen in the history of rock/pop music, and deservedly so...but as most knowledgeable music afficianados (Rob O'Connor need not apply) will tell you, Morrison was a great deal more. As compelling (and disturbing) as his lyrics were, it was with the medium of poetry that Morrison truly felt his place to be; his desire was to use popular music as a means of presenting his writing to a greater audience. Having three of the most talented and versatile musicians of the 1960's in his band certainly didn't hurt, and this as much as Morrison's own talents as a lyricist and indominitable charisma as a frontman helped to achieve this end. The reading that he gives on this CD (recorded on Morrison's birthday in 1970, I believe) is first rate. And though it must be allowed that Morrison probably never intended for musical accompanyment to be added to his words (this was done by the surviving Doors members years after his death), it was likely Schiller probably felt the same way at the time he wrote his &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;...and Beethoven's use of Schiller's piece in his 9th Symphony finale certainly can't be seen as a dilution of that work by any stretch of the imagination. Nor is the subsequent Doors instrumentation (as well as the addition of previously released music) to be seen as a lessening of the experience of &quot;An American Prayer&quot;. This is an extremely well-conceived production; the music compliments Morrison's reading perfectly. Morrison himself reads in a soothing, engaging, and intimate manner (similar to Charles Bukowski's &quot;Run With The Hunted&quot; expanded CD session), and, if indeed he was &quot;Stoned Immaculate&quot; at the time of the recording, the clarity of his voice lays more to inspiration rather than inebriation. This CD finds all participants in finest form, and the result is an extremely natural progression of sound. This recording may be considered &quot;spoken word&quot; due to its vocal delivery (and as such is unsurpassed by Bukowski, Henry Rollins, William Burroughs, or anyone else to whom I've compared it), but as with the work released by the Doors as a band, the music here is not to be underestimated. This recording was well ahead of its time, and in my opinion represents the Doors as Morrison had intended them to become through an evolution he was unfortunately unable to see through; I believe he would have approved of this work, and I can't recommend it enough, either to fans of poetry, music, and of life itself.his CD finds all participants in finest form, and the result is an extremely natural progression of sound.

0025002007|5.0|A friend recommended Watership Down as a great book to read and she was right. I could not put the book down. I even set my clock to get up early before work to read this book about rabbits. The characters Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and all the animals seemed human, and I kept forgetting that these are fairy-tale rabbits and not humans. The only thing that was wrong with this book even though it was 400+ pages was that it was too short.  Watership Down is a book for young and old alike.  Great Book
B000001GRE|4.0|Boulez's logical approach to this piece works well, bringing out the clarity of the rhythms and textures.  The Cleveland Orchestra also helps out with solid playing, although the sound is sometimes a little thin, especially in the low brass.  I prefer the sound of the Chicago Symphony or the New York Philharmonic in that regard.  Either way, this performance is a good choice, as are the other Boulez recordings of Mahler symphonies in recent years.

B00005BJPO|2.0|I was looking forward to this DVD release and the new dubbing, but about 30minutes into the movie I had to pull out my VHS letterbox copy from 1989.  Later I went back and watched it Subtitled which was good.  <br />The artwork looks outstanding, but the new dubbing (although it is a more exact translation) is horrible.  Most notably the voice acting.  The actors are the worst I have heard in a long time.  It sounds like they are reading their script to you not acting.  The actors were also miss cast, the voice tones don't match the faces with the exception of Kei.  <br />If you enjoyed the origonal dubbed version the dubbing in this one is going to make your stomach churn.  If you can get a copy of the 1989 letterbox version dubbed I would suggest it.  The dubbed voice acting is outstanding in that version.<br />The capsule modes are neat and if you prefer Subtitles anyway (I generally do but just happen to be fond of the origonal release of this movie) I would recommend it.  But don't be fooled by the promise of the re-done dubbing it is sad, almost shameful.
0671027573|3.0|I did enjoy this book (as I've enjoyed all LH books), but it was a quick afternoon read with a very weak premise.  <br />The plot of &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; surrounds a silly, lighthearted list 4 friends have written outling the attributes of a perfect mate. Cute, but the ensuing outfall is unbelievable.  First of all, it's unbelievable that such a list would ever receive national media attention.  Also, the lists authors' families/boyfriends/husbands completely overreact to the list.  Any intelligent person would realize what a joke the list is and act accordingly. In this book, boyfriends break up with their girlfriends, sisters say they can't show their face in public and a divorce is almost caused - over a pretty lame list.  Give me a break.<br />The book was a good light read, but I'm hoping LH returns to the deeper stories I fell in love with (After the Night, Son of the Morning) soon.

B000051VWW|4.0|It's been a long seven years, but the cafe au lait queen of &quot;le jazz nouveau&quot; is finally back!  This CD was worth the wait.  Sade's smooth, sweet voice is tinged with a worldly husky richness now that she's a mom AND a diva.  She also provides a refreshing heavy-bass sound on almost every track that gives a nod to the worldwide hip-hop phenomenon.  We have a nice mix of emotions here, from Flow, which is a very sexual, sensuous piece that showcases Sade's soulful femininity (&quot;See me [within the light]/ flowing [take me to you]/ like the river to the sea/ you come down [I'm in the light]/ you cover [pull me to you]/ and the waves rush over me...&quot;), to Every Word, where Sade's singing becomes a primal cry of desolation, sorrow &amp; betrayal because of a love turned to hate through perversion of trust.  The African background singer provides a haunting refrain.  If you're looking for the perfect song for your first dance at your wedding, look no further than All About Our Love, where Sade uses a reggae beat to underscore what she thinks real love is all about (&quot;It's all about our love/ so shall it be forever/ never ending/ after all this time/ after all is said &amp; done...&quot;).  Sade never misses an opportunity to further her quest for social justice.  She gives us Slave Song &amp; Immigrant, which are beautiful, haunting &amp; consciousness-raising.  It's sometimes harrowingly isolated &amp; difficult being a wife &amp; mother, &amp; Sade addresses the sunny side &amp; the darker side with The Sweetest Gift &amp; King of Sorrow (&quot;And all these remnants of joy &amp; disaster/ what am I supposed to do?&quot;), respectively.  I didn't want this CD to end.  One steamy sultry summer evening very soon, sit in your favorite chair in your living room, turn out all the lights, get a mango- or lime-scented candle, light it &amp; press PLAY.  Let Sade's hot &amp; cool rhythms feed your soul again - at last.
B00003CXRP|3.0|&quot;Castaway&quot; simply has no repeat viewing value. Tom Hanks does very well in a difficult role, and the movie handles the ancillary aspects of a long-term disappears ably, but this is a movie that is really only good the first time you see it. <br />What more can I say without ruining it? The direction is very good and the movie is not burdened by uneccesary musical scores or hammy special effects. Everythign is shot in a very documentary style and the few special effects are all used only to advance the story, so the direction is good.<br />Tom Hanks turns in his usual materful textured performance, and Helen Hunt takes a welcome departure from the &quot;strong woman&quot; role into someone more like the rest of us. The film's ability to deal with very ordinary people is really where it is at its best. I enjoyed it, but I won't watch it again

6304493681|5.0|Oshii Mamuro began his career working on the animation series Patlabor and continued to direct several films. Recently two new movies (Jin Roh and Blood:the last vampire) have been made based on stories and screen plays by Oshiisan and he directed the live action film &quot;Avalon&quot; (not available in the US to my knowledge). Ghost in the shell is the last Anime film directed by Oshiisan and it stands as the apex of his directing ability. The story has many complex philosophical levels that deal with;(bear with me) the nature of individuality (Practicallity stressed over romance), the desire to find &quot;self&quot; (the origins of romance), the apathy created by human expansion, future-shock (the flood), and the nature of experiences (simultainious reality and fantasy). The animation, directing, and musical score are all masterfully blended into an experience that goes beyond simple movie watching and becomes a profound pyscological debate.  On top of that, the mundane plot (as opposed to the thematic progression) is ultra complex, dealing with politcal intrigue and high technology. The downside of the film is that appeals to a very select audience. long time japanese cinamatography  meathod was to use paced plots, in which the story progressess through several very slow moving and overly detailed scenes. American audiences will often find the movie slow, or feel that &quot;nothing is going on&quot;. Their complaint is justified. To enjoy this film you have to &quot;argue&quot; with the screen, atempting to passively absorb the message will result in a very boring experience, broken by examples violent deaths and instances of nudity. I like paced plots, because they feel rewarding to me. The very legitimate opposition says that paced plots are on a lower level than normal western paces that can convey the same message without requiring a huge attention base. I can`t decide for you, so I recomend you rent before you buy. Good Luck!
6300181456|5.0|When I was thirteen, this was my favorite movie. I tried to see it every time it came on TV. I was thrilled to find the VHS and the CD here on Amazon, but I sure would like to have it on DVD! Julie Andrews is perfect as a &quot;modern flapper&quot; who has the idea that being the most efficient secretary will get her married to her handsome boss. She and Mary Tyler Moore are hilarious in a movie that makes fun of just about everything!
B00005AAFS|3.0|It's a pity American music is so bad that I have to resort to listening to German music. That said, Tracks 1, 3, and 4 aren't too bad.
B00003CXS4|2.0|The movie wasn't gripping and seemed really weird and incomplete.
B00000G3Q4|1.0|This movie stinks the graphics, sounds, and whole just story stinks.  If you want a good movie get ARMY OF DARKNESS.  It is the sequel of the sequel of this movie.  It is very very funny.  And it isn't one of those movies you get bored of after you watch it once.  You can watch it a hundred times and still laugh your head off.  Literally
B000000H42|5.0|I always has been a Mercyful Fate (MF) fan since the very first legendary EP (\\"Nuns Have No Fun\\"). The \\"Melissa\\" is an amazing album which started bring us all the MF atmosphere with black lyrics. In these days I can't remember too much bands playing black music (Venom, Witchfynfer General, early Slayer,...), but I only remember one which played not only noisy metal but true music with amazing musicians and an unique singer: Kim Bendix Petersen (aka King Diamond). \\"Don't Break the Oath\\" was the last of their 1981-1984 era. Why is this my favourite album ever? There's my fave track (\\"The Oath\\"), my fave intro (\\"The Oath\\"), my fave guitar riffs, my fave lyrics, my fave artwork, my fave album name (I never break up the oath with this album...)... PERFECT! Okay, I'm suspect, cause I'm a devoted fan, but don't hesitate to try it... unfortuantely, after the re-reunion in 1993 the sound lost that mystical atmosphere....

B000005J56|5.0|As the Wim Wenders' film goes, Ry Cooder (he of the slide guitar) shows up in Cuba with his son, Joachim, simply gathers together the Country's older and greatest musicians and incredible things and incredible music happens.<br />I wasn't too familiar with Cuban Son music, but this CD transcends unfamiliarity as well as potential language barriers. You'll find yourself singing the lines regardless of what language you call your own.<br />One of the great things about this CD is the exhaustive liner notes that explain the history of the artists, their contributions to individual songs, the song history, plus a great bilingual scripting of all the words.  It truly enhances the listen.<br />If you have been waiting to jump into the World Music fray, what are you waiting for?  Start with Buena Vista, get socialized, and join the club, preferably smoking a big huge Cuban stogie.
B000002C2E|5.0|I just recently got into Bob Dylan, and listened to a lot of his songs, new and old.  However, some of his albums in the early 90s were very bad.  I listened to this album recently and I must say, it is very good.  I especially like &quot;Love Sick&quot; because it has a good tune, and I love the cynicalnes of it :).

B00004VWAF|5.0|'On The Corner' is probably the most controversial work of Miles' career but its hard to see why.  Traditional jazz fans will have alienated immediately by the clumsy drum loops, slippery bass lines that are sometimes difficult to pin down and the oftn atonal soloing.  Closer inspection of the LPs four pieces reveal that 'On The Corner' is a logical extension of the highly reverred 1969/70 recording 'B*tches Brew'.  1972's 'On The Corner' is not as dark, but no less experimental and the soloes are just as 'difficult'.  The most contentious issue surrounding 'On The Corner' must be its seminal use of looped percussive samples as a rythmic framework.  For many this will have produced a sound too artificial for a record produced by a jazz artist.  Well documented is the fact that the drum loops were the fruit of the influence of legendary German avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen of all people.  Krautrock played by a black American jazz artist anyone?  Well, not really.  Beside the Stockhausen influence strains of the sort of psychedelic funk that the likes of Sly And The Family Stone, Funkadelic and Parliament were producing at the time can be heard in what is a crazy mix of sounds from different cultures.  By fusing these elements, throwing in some electric sitar and tabla and getting a stellar cast of musicians that include Dave Liebman, Bennie Maupin, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Jack De Johnette to play it, Miles created something compelling and utterly unique for 1972.  The confusion of the old guard of jazz critics in the early 70s at the sound of a musical revolution should not cloud the judgements of modern audiences wishing to investigate not only one of Miles' most exciting works, but also the roots of 90s and 00s jungle, drum and bass and trip-hop.
0802130208|4.0|There is very little to like about Ignatius J. Reilly. He believes he is always correct despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, his personal grooming and general behavior is blatantly anti-social, and he treats his confused mother horribly.  He takes on a \\"Don Quixote\\" quality when attacking what he perceives as social injustice; usually making matters infinitely worse. Yet for all of this, you are compelled to finish this book about this very odd man, the particularly inept policeman whose actions start the book's action, a young man who is trapped in a modern form of slavery by events beyond his control, and a host of other New Orleans denizens who are all particularly bizarre but somehow very real. This work is a true original that probably could have used some editing ( some plotlines take far too long to develop); I don't know if I would categorize it as a classic, but it definitely shows an author who had talent and it is a shame that this is his only major work.
0385493622|4.0|This book provides the layman with an excellent introduction to the almost inaccessible realm of higher mathematics, with lots of interesting anecdotes, both miraculous and tragic.  A large portion of the story is dedicated to the development of mathematics through the ages, loosely woven around the famous topic of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Perhaps a little bit surprisingly, the main story of Wiles' quest for the ultimate solution covers only a small part of the book.  Nonetheless, somehow the author has magically transformed a tedious research subject into a gripping and thrilling adventure.  Though no fault of the author, it is regrettable that the mathematics in this book is really beyond the understanding of the average reader.  Hopefully, this popular account of the little understood field of mathematical studies may eventually inspire a new generation of geniuses following on the footsteps of great mathematicians of the past...
0380973650|3.0|In American Gods, Neil Gaiman revisits some of the territory he touched upon in his \\"Sandman\\" series. If belief is the food of the gods, what happens to them when no one believes anymore? Gaiman takes a long, hard look at this idea in his book.  Shadow, a recent parolee, finds his life in total disarray after his wife's death; in this confused state he enters the employ of Wednesday, who hires him to act as a bodyguard.  This begins an epic journey into the concepts of belief, commercialism, death, and why America is so different from the rest of the world. I enjoyed the book, but I sometimes felt Gaiman had bitten off more than the reader can chew. By filling this book with so many diverse characters,and by assuming the reader understood their relative mythologies, Gaiman leaves the reader with the difficult task of understanding their motivations and actions. Maybe that is intentional, as man isn't supposed to know the way of gods, but I found it annoying. I have read many books of mythology and still felt left out by some of the references. It was a good read and Gaiman raises many valid points throughout, but it seems like the target audience was too small; the book seems like a missed opportunity to really take on America's cultural and religious ambiguity.
B00004YKUX|5.0|He shows no signs of backing down.  As far as the fasionable array of contributors, let me say I've never been blown away by Tom Petty and U2 just gets on my nerves. I am, however a fan of Nick Cave and Will Oldham (a.k.a Palace a.ka. &quot;Bonnie Prince Billy&quot; or whatever he's calling himself), but more importantly, I AM JOHNNY CASH FAN. Nobody and I mean nobody sings a song like the Man in Black. His past few records have been pretty impressive. One could say it's all Rick Rubin's doing but that would be selling Cash short. Based on their previous collaborations, Rubin seems more like a  photographer, seeking to capture the essence of a subject rather than garnish it. SOLITARY MAN keeps the ball rolling.<br />On the title track, a piece of Neil Diamond schlock is transformed into a bitter lament ending in resignation. WON'T BACK DOWN &amp; ONE are less impressive, but I'll take the Cash versions over the originals any day.<br />He makes up for it though with Oldham's I SEE A DARKNESS. The song seems tailor-made. I'll even venture to say Cash's take manages to surpass the author's own. Though MERCY SEAT  may lack Nick Cave's savage intensity, if you give it a chance, Cash puts his stamp on it. In place of Cave's gut-wrenching paranoia, we get a weary man whose been waiting on Death Row far too long, yearning for the one thing that's going to set him free. To me, these two songs are a testament to Cash's originality.<br />FIELD OF DIAMONDS and a terrific David Allen Coe tune featuring the lines &quot;will you lay with me in a field of stone&quot; figure prominently, but I'm  especially drawn to the self-penned, BEFORE OUR TIME. I think it's one of the more moving pieces on the album.<br />COUNTRY TRASH &amp; I'M LEAVING NOW (featuring Merle Haggard)lighten things up a bit but like all the songs on this collection, death and loss are always lurking beneath the surface. Towards the end, the sentimentality of MARY OF THE WILD MOOR is avoided by the sparsenss of it's arrangements. WAYFARING STRANGER comes on like an old friend and is a fitting send off.<br />I doubt Cash plans on going &quot;into that good night&quot; anytime soon, but this record shows he's certainly aware of the dusk creeping in  on the horizon.

B00000ILDF|2.0|David Fincher was not meant to direct this movie.  His obsession with death sunk to a new low and made &quot;Alien 3&quot; the least successful installment of the four-part series.  There are also numerous plot holes and laughable creature effects.<br />     The movie begins with a facehugger that mysteriously materializes onboard the marine cruiser Sulaco.  If you paid attention to &quot;Aliens&quot; you should know that the queen CANNOT lay egg pods without growing a large birth sac.  It is also unlikely that a facehugger hitched a ride with the queen back to the Sulaco since its behavior dictates that its purpose is solely for procreation and not its own protection.<br />     Long story short, the facehugger starts a fire and the Sulaco's computer automatically puts Ripley, Hicks, Bishop, and Newt into an EEV and jettisons it.  While drifting in space, the facehugger implants an alien embryo inside Ripley.  The EEV crashes into the ocean beside a half shut-down penal colony, and is shortly rescued by the custodial staff, made up mostly of convicted felons.  Hicks is impaled by a life support console, Bishop is smashed beyond repair, and Newt drowns in her hypersleep chamber.  A prisoner's curious dog prowls the EEV and is attacked and impregnated by THE SAME facehugger that implanted Ripley.  (Facehuggers die immediately after one implantation.)  Soon, Ripley discovers that a new &quot;dog alien&quot; is loose in the compound and she must rally the prisoners to destroy it before the Company arrives to take it captive and exploit it as a military weapon.  (Another mistake--the dog alien takes a considerably shorter time to burst out of the host than Ripley's despite the fact that it was implanted later.)  <br />     Creature effects utilize early CGI and make the alien look cartoonish.  The mixture of trained actors, articulated costumes, and animatronics works much better (&quot;Aliens&quot;).  The chase scenes from the alien's point of view are a little ridiculous.  Fine performances are given by Sigourney Weaver (as always), Charles Dutton, and Charles Dance, however, it is not enough to sweeten the sour aftertaste of the movie.
B000001U3K|5.0|Transformer is a charming &amp; legendary lp, containing many legitimately classic songs that indeed make it like a greatest hits but w/ the flow of a proper album which makes it even better, witness Perfect Day, Wild Side, Satellite of Love, &amp; Vicious. Andy's Chest was a then unreleased Velvet Underground song &amp; whilst I prefer that version [found on 'VU', 1984] this is just about as enjoyable. 1 song that I wasn't familiar w/ before but instantly loved is Make Up &amp; it's a shame it rarely gets mentioned, not actually being gay myself doesn't stop me singing along w/ &quot;yeah we're comin' out, out of our closets, out on the streets&quot;, as Lou goes &quot;w/ all those things that you do to yr face, you're a slick little girl, such a slick little girl&quot;. It's worth mentioning that most of the lp has a laidback middle of the night atmosphere w/ Herbie Flower's bass &amp; tuba, Mr Bowie's production &amp; occasional background vox [glorious outro of Satellite, an oft-covered tune, I like the Love Positions a fair bit, it also gets cross referenced in Smudge's Scary Cassettes, a song about getting yr Lou Reed &amp; Lou Barlow tapes mixed up, &quot;I've been told that you've been bold w/ Harry, Mark &amp; John, well that's my 2nd favourite line from my 5th favourite song, hope you like Lou&quot;, yes I like digression], Transformer unexpectedly would sit more comfortably on the shelf next to Kind of Blue than any sleazy 70s rock, although the famous live lp from a couple of years later Rock &amp; Roll Animal certainly would [I don't much care for it though]. Overall 1 of those essential records of all time alongside that there Banana album of course.
B00004WGYA|5.0|Here's &quot;Rio&quot; again on cd- but this is the definitive version of the album that Duran Duran always wanted us to hear!  (Other versions of the album exist that used different mixes of various songs.)  The cd packaging is terrific.  It comes in a gatefold sleeve with the front and back covers restored to their original brilliance.  Inside the gatefold is the color picture of the band (taken on a rooftop with a blurred nighttime skyline behind them).  Both sides of the gatefold sleeve open to hold something: the front being the lyric book which uses a different Nagel painting as the cover on a black background (not the maroon background that is on the cover); the back gatefold sleeve houses a pink sleeve that pulls out and the cd is in there.  (This pink sleeve sort of looks like the &quot;Rio&quot; 12-inch cover although it is pink and not maroon!)  The cd has the &quot;Rio&quot; cover painting printed on it.  <br />The cd is the same one that was reissued in a regular cd jewel case at the same time as this release.  (It looks the same and has the same enhanced stuff.)  The enhanced portion of this cd contains a photo gallery with 30 photos- many of which I had never seen before (and I've seen A LOT of Duran Duran pictures in my life!); the three videos from this album; a Duran Duran &quot;Rio&quot; discography (all of the various singles and promos that were released from this album; it's NOT a definitive Duran Duran discography), and lyrics to each song.  The song &quot;Rio&quot; plays on your computer as you peruse the lyrics.  If I had to make any criticism it would be that it would have been nice to be able to listen to each track as you read that tracks lyrics, but you can't- only the &quot;Rio&quot; song plays.  The main menu of the enhanced portion is sort of awkward- a 3-D box twirls around and you click on what you want to look at.  It looks GREAT and keeps in with the original design of the album, but it functions sort of clumsily (at least it didon the two different computers I tested it out on!)<br />Do not get rid of your old &quot;Rio&quot; cd if you buy this because it contains different mixes!  <br />This is a MUST HAVE cd purchase for all Duranies!
B000002LGQ|4.0|First, I have to say it--normally I loathe Madonna's music.  I acknowledge her genius at continually reinventing herself imagewise (and even going respectable when necessary, as evidenced in the monstrously overpublicized christening/marriage thing last year), but with her it's always been 95% image, 5% music.  However, in 1989 there was one bright shining moment when I believed that Madonna could truly be an artist, and that was &quot;Like A Prayer.&quot;<br />In a lot of ways, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; is typical Madonna, with the bouncy Jellybean Benitez beat showing up everywhere.  But somewhere, sometime, somebody actually paid attention to the music and lyrics, as well as got on Madonna's case to do a little better than carry a tune.  The result is an album that is a lot of fun to listen to.  The title track has that great gospel-choir-fueled break that still sounds terrific, and my best friend and I drove around all that summer singing &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Express Yourself&quot; constantly.  The non-singles, for the most part, are also good, especially &quot;Keep It Together&quot; and &quot;Spanish Eyes.&quot;  Nothing ground-shaking, just really good pop tunes that Madonna sounded like she actually cared about doing well.  <br />Unfortunately, this glimpse into what Madonna could have been was fleeting, as she then pretty much went into the I-wanna-be-a-movie-star thing full time and has never really recovered (the song &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was okay, but I guess I'll just have to agree to disagree with everyone who thinks the album is a masterpiece).  &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; seems to be the album that non-Madonna fans are drawn to--precisely because she broke the mold with this one.

B00003CXRM|5.0|For some reason, I avoided renting this film (now, I think I'll buy it!). I hate to think that I'm swayed by critics, but,in this case, I guess I was. What we have here is a wonderful narrative of three very individual prople, escaping from prison (but &quot;nice guys&quot; so it's OK). Most of their collective motive is greed, but some great bonding ensues, friendships develop (new &amp; old), conflicts happen, etc. Put it in the hands of Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and you have (another) unique blend of movie-making and thought-provoking controlled insanity. I loved this film! What a pleasure to see John Turturro in a somewhat under-control performance. I'm not sure that I've ever heard of Tim Blake Nelson, but he's a brilliant actor (best in the film, I think), truly supporting an incredible performance from George Clooney. The two were a real &quot;pair&quot;. Another reason I avoided this film was it's Oscar nomination for screenplay in the &quot;adapted&quot; category (suggesting its basis as Homer's Odyssey!). How presumptuous, I thought. Well,leave it to the Coen's. I don't know any mistake they've ever made in a movie: &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, best murder mystery ever, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, second best comedy ever; &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot;, second-best gangster movie ever; and &quot;Fargo&quot;, their best &quot;everything&quot; movie. I love the Coen's (though I admit I still don't understand &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, though it was a wonderfully scathing comment on the Hollywood movie-making process).There's a continuing, innate sweetness about this film, though it pulls no punches. The Ku Klux Klan is presented as too organized and with political overtones...which may be true, and which may be the Coen's idea to expose this group as heartless and evil as they are (and, especially, were back in the 30's). Tackling some outrageously seriously themes, the Coen's have once again succeeded in making the ugliest of reality seem to be amusing and utterly entertaining. It must be very tough to make light of some of the most horrible moments in history...Mel Brooks did it and so did Benigni; Billy Wilder (Stalag 17) &amp; Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove). One must admire the creativity &amp; control involved, so as to not offend, present your material and have it accepted. It's called &quot;Entertainment&quot;, and the Coen's deliver this up with side-dishes and garnish on the plate.ntertaining.

B000001F3C|5.0|From their auspicious appearance on Tom Snyder's show in 1981 to their latest release(All That You Can't Leave Behind - finally they got it right again), U2 is a timeless band that has given us such classics as &quot;War&quot;.  Already a fan from &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;October&quot; - &quot;War&quot; was simply a masterpiece from these Dublin music artists.  New Year's Day is one song that will always move me from Edge's amazing guitar riffs and piano work(multi-talented guy) to Bono's emotional, heartfelt vocals.  Other standouts include the anthem-like Sunday Bloody Sunday, Two Hearts Beat As One and the melancholy cut - Drowning Man.<br />War is one cd that holds up to this day and is a must have.

B00003CXN4|5.0|Right from the start I knew that this was going to be a great movie, its nice for once to see a movie that deals with a hot topic and can be entertaining at the same time.

B000000993|4.0|I consider this Tool's &quot;worst&quot; album because it was their first long-player, and they did not yet know how to make a song long without dragging it out. They also stuck to a formula of straight alternative music throughout the album. Don't get me wrong, I like it; but it gets a little monotonous by the time you get to &quot;Flood&quot;. Those comments being put aside, this is still an excellent album from a great band, and it is actually this or &quot;Opiate&quot; that I recommend you to start out with for Tool, before you go deeper into the band with &quot;Aenima&quot; and finally &quot;Lateralus.&quot; Below is a track-by-track review:<br />1. Intolerance 9/10 A pretty good track to start out the album....where did they get that noise at the beginning? 2. Prison Sex 10/10 Excellent...maybe that's why it was a single. 3. See 2 4. Bottom 9/10 Excellent spoken word passage by Henry Rollins, but it feels dragged at 7 minutes. 5. Crawl Away 7/10 An OK song that just falls right into the mold of the album. 6. Swamp Song 8/10 Slightly better than your average because it has a message to deliver. 7. Undertow 7/10 see &quot;Crawl Away&quot; 8. 4 Degrees 7/10 see &quot;Crawl Away&quot; 9. Flood 8/10 The intro at the beginning is long and creepy! 10. Disgustipated 2/10 An ode to carrots that turned into a serious time-waste and album filler. Probably the scariest song that Tool have ever done, but also probably the most wasted sixteen minutes on any of their albums.

B0000025F7|5.0|I was 8 years old when Michael and his brothers first appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show. Like a lot of my contemporaries, I wanted to be like him. When it comes to performing, Michael Jackson is still the man .... hands down!<br />Off The Wall is an album that benchmarks Michael's transition from boy/teen/R&amp;B/ idol to pop &quot;godhood&quot;. All of the bubblegum &quot;soul&quot; that put Michael &amp; his brothers on the map was notably absent. Like a lot of people his age (self included), Michael came of age in the disco era, but not necessarily the &quot;Studio 54&quot; brand of disco that everyone seems to be hearkening back to nowadays. The disco was a metaphor for the lives we were living back then. The dancefloor was the arena where we all acted out our life's dramas. It was perfectly fitting that Michael's rite of passage into musical adulthood, take place in his white-hot, disco dance tracks on this album. Michael's R&amp;B sensibility was definitely infused in the sheer polyrhythmic funk of all of his dance tracks on this album. The percussion and horn arrangement are the most attention-grabbing element of his songs in this album, apart from the sheer sonic energy of his voice. Michael and Quincy Jones went and got the best (and the funkiest) studio players on the planet. For this album not to have been multi-platinum is unthinkable.<br />Michael's musical energy has always been on the level of near nuclear meltdown even in his Jackson 5 days, but this is the album where he reaches critical mass! As a matter of opinion, I think every young artist since has had to make an &quot;Off-The-Wall&quot; type release wherein they make a &quot;coming-of-age-statement&quot; (ala Janet Jackson .... &quot;Control&quot;). Rather than go into analysis of each and every track (they're all superb), I'll simply say that musically, Michael lost his musical &quot;cherry&quot; with this release. As an artist, he and his audience would never be the same afterward. Every release since, has been an effort to outdo or re-create Thriller. However, Off The Wall is the album that should really be the template for Michael's work. It is Michael's artistry in it's purest adult form.
B00005LMBK|3.0|Another good production from Dan 'the Automator' Nakamura. This hip-hop/rock/electronica/classical/latin musical pastiche is worth a listen. The best track has got to be Sound Check (gravity).

B000002MQ9|5.0|This album touches my soul. Deeply philosophical and highly emotional overtones make me think about my own life. Brendan Perrys wounded vocals and life weary lyrics speak to my like no one else. Lisa Gerrard turns emotions into music. Listen to her vocals and then to so called divas ruling over todays pop charts. It hurts how fake and emotionally dead they are. For me personally this album is a tragic ode to humanity and our dying  mother Earth. Bleeding, struggling remains of beauty are disappearing in the decaying world of ugliness. Like reviewer Paul said before me this album is not for everyone, but if you want to try something different then you have my warmest recommendations.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Don't you hate it when you follow someone's recommendation and end up buying something you hate? That didn't happen here! I have watched this movie 5 or 6 times now and I will thoroughly enjoy watching it more. This movie is probably my favorite of the genre. Vin Diesel absolutely ROCKS as  a villian with a heart. I can't wait to see future works with him.
0140277447|5.0|This book exposes the atrocities committed by the Japanese that was often ignored by the world for political reasons.  This book is also more interesting than a normal nonfiction book, because it contains first-hand accounts.  Despite the criticism from Rape deniers, this book is very well researched.  Other recommendations: A Gesture Life by Chang Rae Lee, written in the perspective of a Japanse veteran tortured by the death of a comfort woman.
0780622553|5.0|The commentary from the director, the puzzle solving video game of Shell beach and the amazing sound from the DVD version of Dark City are three main reasons to purchase this movie. The other would have to be the fair price that Amazon is charging. If you loved this movie then buy this dvd.
B00004XONN|3.0|When cubists started deconstructing nature in the early part of last century, most people saw a bunch of unconnected, random shapes- much as most \\"fans\\" of Radiohead heard a jumbled, synthesized mess of an album, definitely not a worthy follow-up to OK Computer.  Of course, Radiohead knew this would happen- and they were OK with it.  Radiohead is not trying to trick the fans into buying [crud]; they are trying to take the ideas presented in OK Computer and tear them apart- revealing an even more interesting picture.  We caught glimpses of this in 'Fitter Happier'- a schizophrenic world of multiple personalities and sharp jerks, a dark world full of 'Paranoid Androids\\"- the Blade Runner of rock music.  The machines of OK Computer have become the juvenile humans of Kid A, and their worries about ice ages and order are darker and closer to the subconscious than anything on the previous record.  Not that everything hear is doom and gloom- Thom Yorke allows some uplifting moments to invade \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" and \\"Treefingers\\"- all darkness needs some contract.  But, even though \\"Kid A\\" was a bold step, it's not yet there.  The angles York and the boys cut through \\"Kid A\\" are not yet precise.  We often feel muddled and incomplete after listening to the album, even after 10 or 20 times.  Kid A is essential- but it is a step on a path to the \\"perfect\\" post-modern rock album.
B000002WYT|5.0|Listening to the Dave Matthews Band's &quot;Crash&quot; is like listening to soft rock, jazz, folk, and those nature CDs you can buy at museum gift shops all rolled up into one 12-track CD.<br />From the opening track, the bouncy &quot;So Much to Say&quot;, to the epic 9-minute masterpiece &quot;Proudest Monkey&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot; is the perfect album for people who are just getting into the Dave Matthews Band's sound.<br />Every track is a keeper, but the best ones, by far, are &quot;Two Step&quot; (which is performed live in a 14-minute version on &quot;Listener Supported&quot;), &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; the wonderful single that has carried the DMB to commercial success, &quot;#41&quot; which blends into &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; two tracks with such ambience that it's almost impossible not to take the album with you to the beach.<br />My favorite track is &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot;, which build up, dies back down, and then explodes in an array of instruments. Listen and you can hear conversations taking place in the background.<br />I also own &quot;Everyday&quot; and I borrowed &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; and &quot;Listener Supported&quot; from a friend. All of these are excellent DMB efforts, but &quot;Crash&quot; is always a winner in my book. Oh, I have yet to listen to &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; but it's not going to stay absent from my DMB list for long...
0451450523|5.0|An unusual and quite lovable fairy tale, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; captures a certain eerie and mystical quality that sends shivers down your spine, and adds alot of enjoyment to the book. I sometimes found myself quite frustrated with the unicorn, wondering how she could be so callous and unfeeling, but her emotional as well as physical journey is a main theme in this book. Her companions are quite far from perfect, an unusual concept in fantasy, and one which I enjoyed very much. You can't help but grow quite fond of the fumbling Schmendrick, or the tough, practical Molly Grue, both of whom add a bit of diversity to the story. I was also fascinated with the wierd, witchlike Mommy Fortuna, who knows the limits of her own power but lets her covetous nature of all things immortal be her downfall.  Written with a dreamlike quality, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; isn't as much fantasy as it is a story about beauty, and the search for it, and how magic is a very tangible part of our lives.
078322558X|4.0|Bruce Willis' role as an assassin in &quot;The Jackal&quot; will give you goosebumps.  A well-made cat and mouse film, you will struggle with who to root for in this film, the evil Bruce Willis or mysterious FBI ally Richard Gere.  The movie is very suspenseful and only weakened by Gere's attempt to be a cool con.  Overall, a great movie that every Willis fan should see.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I'm sorry, this CD is incredible.  I love it.  The first song I ever heard by Creed was Higher, and I just fell in love.  The incredible vocals and passionate music keeps me reaching for it over and over when I need something good to listen to.  The passion they put into their music you can hear all the way through the album.  One song I think really stands out, if only for the message it sends is Wash Away Those Years.  It's a great song for -anybody-, not just for those affected.  People can be stripped down to nothing, by anything, and the music on this CD is just right for any type of mood.  One of my favorites, if only for the music, is Beautiful.  Is it just me, or is it like the drums and guitar are fighting each other?  It's incredible to just close my eyes and follow the music in my mind.  I also especially love What If?  That, I think, is a song too many people -need- to hear.  Creed's music is fascinating, and I love every bit of it.  This is definitely worth looking in to.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Tim Burton is a visual genious.  Simply put, his films are a joy to watch (except for the miserable Planet Of The Apes).  Watch this movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.  From start to finish, this movie is captivating.  You get sucked into the twisted, creepy world of Sleepy Hollow and are held there until the end credits roll.  The plot is nothing special; it's pretty straightforward.  Ichabod Crane (Jonny Depp) who is a police investigator instead of a school teacher goes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders.  When he gets there he meets all sorts of odd characters that may or may not have anything to do with the killings.  All of the characters are wonderfully real, even the ones you know aren't going to survive very long.  On that same note, the acting is wonderful.  Depp does a nearly perfect job as Crane, and Christina Ricci is good as Katrina Van Tassel, Crane's romantic interest.  Overall, the movie is great, with excellent sets and special effects (that creepy tree with the nasty surprise comes to mind).  The plot isn't all that great, but you'll be so caught up in the dream-like visuals I doubt you'll mind.  I know I didn't.
B000002OZY|3.0|Tommy gets a lot of attention because it was the first real rock opera.  The Who, or more precisely Pete Townshend, took the next step and put together a whole record- or more like two records of material- and told a story with it. The story is primitive and new- evoking Sophocles at much as it does Gravity's Rainbow.  The melodies Townshend uses to piece Tommy together have become familiar due to exhaustive play on classic rock radio- from Pinball wizard to I'm Free- you've heard this album before.  So how great is Tommy, on its own, absent radio overplay and the &quot;first mover&quot; advantage?  The story is not nearly as compelling as either of its offsprings'- the masterpiece 'Quadrophenia' or the uncompleted 'Lifehouse'.  At times, we grow tired of Tommy's incessant silence- and can't answer that all important question- &quot;what's the point?&quot;  Of course, Townshend redeems himself with a crashing, uplifting finale &quot;hook&quot;- but we can't forget that most of the record is quite dull.  As far as the music goes- there are three or four songs that would have made it onto vanilla Who albums here- and two amazing ones, of course.  Compare that to Quadrophenia, where every song, it seems, could have been a top ten single a few years earlier.  The verdict- Tommy is great, seminal stuff- but it would be doing Townshend and the Who an injustice to put it on the same plane as their later work.
6301016289|3.0|Bud Fox (Martin Sheen) is a young, naive, wall street trader who will do anything to get to the big leagues.  This means showing up every day to Gordon Gekko's (Wall Street mogul played by Michael Douglas) office to beg Gekko's personal secretary to let him inside.  Finally, she takes pity on him and lets him in to see Gekko.  Amazingly Bud has little to offer but the same spiel he uses for his cold calls.  Then he remembers - a piece of inside information about his father's airline.  Gordon finds Bud a bit green but takes a liking to a reminder of his younger self.  After the first deal Gekko trains Bud to be the ruthless expert inside trader. &quot;Information&quot; is what Gordon has a monopoly on.  And novice traders, company employees and their management are &quot;victims&quot; of Gordon's insider game.  Of course here is where Oliver Stone shows his own naivete.  Is this the only way to make money on Wall Street? <br />One would think that like Bud Fox we would have to secretly shadow a billionaire investor to the ends of the earth and engage in industrial espionage to get in on his next deal before it went public.  Well would it not be easier to have walked around a few cities in the western US and witnessed people lining up for Starbucks coffee.  Had you acted on this observation six years ago and purchased the stock you would be quite wealthy today.  Perhaps a little honest effort and common sense might be a more effective strategy.<br />Really though the movie is a feel good film for Stones liberal audience - which is apparent in many of the reviews.  It is certainly nice to believe that the only way to make money in this world is to assume a ruthless posture and evil plan for taking from others (unless of course you're from Hollywood and your money is the sweetest smelling on the planet).  That way Stone's liberal audience can feel good about themselves.  Imagine having to think that many wealthy people exhibit strong personal disciplines like hard work,courage, and initiative and that these people have created wealth for themselves and others through legitimate means.  Of course then you have little excuse for your own pathetic life.  You might have to get up off your lazy rear end and actually do something for yourself.<br />I certainly don't apply these comments to Stone.  Stone is simply a hypocrite.  He works hard and makes money capitalist style by selling a movie that attacks capitalism.  In any case the movie was entertaining.  So three stars to Stone who talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk (to his credit).<br />P.S. If you want to see a good movie about Wall Street that fairly treats both sides of the issue try &quot;Other People's Money.&quot;
B000002MQ9|5.0|I was only recently introduced to Dead Can Dance, and this album absolutely hooked me. As other reviewers have rightly commented, Within the Realm of a Dying Sun is just about as goth as it can get.<br />My favorite song on this CD is the Summoning of the Muse. It is haunting and etherial, with both uplifting tones and tones of absolute despair. The clear chimes of the bells, and then the addition of Gerrard's soaring, mournful, emotional voice makes the song an absolute necessity for anyone who likes DCD, or music that will focus your emotions. It is so beatuiful...<br />Xavier is another transfixing song. Perry's voice blends with the music so well, and the lyrics are very interesting and profound, if you are patient and listen carefully enough to figure out just what he's saying, because he does mumble sometimes.<br /> Anywhere Out of the World is the 1st song, and the dark piano/chime (I don't know what it is, only that it sounds perfect) sets the mood perfectly. The Perry comes in, and you settle in for a time of dark(but not depressing), beautiful music.<br />Cantara starts out slow, and then speeds up with a fast, more middle-eastern style song. The voices start out a little harsh, but then you just get caught up with it. It's enthralling.<br />If you are new to DCD, Start with this CD or Aion. If you have some DCD albums, and are considering getting this one, I'll join with the other viewers in saying that this album is a spectacular piece of work, and one will not be sorry after listening to it. I think that The Summoning of the Muse makes the whole CD, but all of the other songs are excellent, too.  You will not regret it.
B00000K2SC|3.0|&quot;Dark City&quot; and &quot;Strange Days&quot; offered intriguing motivations for villainy. &quot;Matrix&quot; is more like a superhero comic book in which the fate of the world comes down to a titanic fist-fight between the designated representatives of good and evil. It's cruel, really, to put tantalizing ideas on the table and then ask the audience to be satisfied with a shoot-out and a martial arts duel. Let's assume Neo wins. What happens then to the billions who have just been &quot;unplugged&quot; from the Matrix? Do they still have jobs? Homes? Identities? All we get is an enigmatic voice-over exhortation at the movie's end.<br />Still, I must not ignore the movie's virtues. It's great-looking, both in its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it. It uses flawlessly integrated special effects and animation to visualize regions of cyberspace.<br />And it has performances that find the right notes. Keanu Reeves goes for the impassive Harrison Ford approach, &quot;acting&quot; as little as possible. I suppose that's the right idea. Laurence Fishburne finds a balance between action hero and Zen master. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls that she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode. Hugo Weaving, as the chief Agent, uses a flat, menacing tone that reminded me of Tommy Lee Jones in passive-aggressive overdrive. There's a well-acted scene involving Gloria Foster as the Oracle, who like all Oracles is maddeningly enigmatic.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; did not bore me. It interested me so much, indeed, that I wanted to be challenged even more. I wanted it to follow its material to audacious conclusions, to arrive not simply at victory, but at revelation. I wanted an ending that was transformational, like &quot;Dark City's,&quot; and not one that simply throws us a sensational action sequence. I wanted, in short, a Third Act.
6304082428|5.0|I've heard much about this movie before seeing it. My friend always mentioned her six tapes of pride and prejudice that she never got around to seeing. However, another friend and I dedicated a whole afternoon and part of an evening to watch this 5 hours movie and I daresay it wasn't a moment wasted. <br />I really enjoyed the movie. The dialogue is witty and amusing. I've only tried to read one of Jane Austen's novels and I absolutely hated it because it seemed so long winded. The movie didn't seem to drag at all. Some of the lines were very memorable and I would like to use them in my own dialogue except I can't seem to remember them. After seeing a movie like this, I wish everyone talked in Victorian english. It has such a elegance to it. And in this movie, it really didn't sound fake and artifical but perfectly natural. What happened to that language? <br />The acting was definitely amusing. The leads, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, possessed great depth in their acting even though at times Colin Firth's role as the taciturn Mr. Darcy seemed to require very little acting at all. Jennifer Ehle as Eliza Bennet was lively and lovable. Susanna Harker as Jane Bennet was also just as lovable and I really enjoyed her exchanged with Eliza. The subtlety in the acting made the movie worthwhile, the little glances that they throw to each other and small smirks and grimaces. All the other characters provided wonderful comic relief. Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet was terrific! Her face looks like a cartoon and her voice just calls for laughter. <br />But overall, the movie had that effect of dragging you in emotionally. You know that the main characters will end up marrying each other at the end (it's Jane Austen) but you nevertheless worry the whole way through about how it will happen. And at the end, after all the hoping and wishing, you finish the movie feeling nicely satisfied :)<br />The five hour time span didn't seem to drag at all. In fact, it seemed to pass quite shortly and I really enjoyed every moment of it.
B00004WG2F|1.0|Hollywood has devoted far too much time to maudlin love stories full of emotion.  For as much emoting as done in these movies, it is completely unable to rise above the most banal of sentiment.  Legends of the Fall is a fine example of this disease.  It is a love story to be sure, as it is set in the most picturesque wilderness possible (could love occur in the city? no.).  There is the obligatory war in the background (could love occur in peacetime? what are you, some kind of dovey pinko? go back to russia.).  Of course the war has tragic consequences, during which you can hear, if you strain, the director urging you to cry.  If you cry at hallmark commercials, you may be undeterred by the stupefyingly predictable plot.  If you desire more from a movie, check out Welcome to Spring Break.  There is a love story here too, but it is set in Miami Beach.  The war here is a battle of revenge fought by the ghost of a biker gang leader.  Also, it frequently uses the word &quot;beaver&quot;, which does not appear in Legends of the Fall.  I love animals as much the next Dick or Peter, and think the paucity of beaver references in Legends of the Fall is inexcusable.  However, the discriminating viewer can look at Welcome to Spring Break to avoid this injustice.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I  found Bagdad Cafe on DVD three days ago and have watched it twice since, each time with a big smile on my face. It's difficult to explain why this movie is so haunting;  if you try to tell a friend &quot;You've got to see this movie because...&quot;, you'd be stuck for a definable reason. It's a very gentle character study of two women, different as can be, who come to understand and even like each other. They are both frustrated with their current positions in life. Jasmin (Marianne Sagebrecht), the stranded German tourist, is willing to start repairing her life, even in this bleak desert setting. Brenda (CCH Pounder) has led such a hard-knocks life that she can't understand or accept anyone trying to help her.  There's a wonderful supporting cast surrounding them, but the heart of this movie is the way the two women learn to be friends.  You're either going to love this movie or be totally bewildered by what I (and other reviewers) see in it.<br />This movie was shot in Newberry Springs, near Barstow; the restaurant is still there (originally called Sidewinder Cafe, now renamed the Bagdad Cafe, of course). This is the favorite movie of one of my sister's friend who lives in Brazil. When this friend's daughter Paula visited recently, we stopped by the Bagdad Cafe on the way to Vegas; Paula's mom shed tears of delight when she saw pictures of her daugher making a pilgrimage to this high desert Mecca.
B00001SIES|4.0|Buying an artist's first effort, especially one from a band that is not well known, can be risky. However, I find Muse's Shobiz to be a fairly consistent album and the band itself musically talented. You will not find the typical CD formula here, where 2 or 3 tracks are radio-worthy and the rest of the album is fluff or &quot;filler&quot; material. If you find yourself enjoying the sample audio, you can expect the same quality on all tracks. I hesitated using the term &quot;radio-worthy&quot; to describe Showbiz because these tracks will never ride the American airwaves. The only downside to Showbiz is that it's one of those albums you tend to get bored with if you listen to it too often. However, I just dusted mine off and am currently enjoying it again.
B00003CWTI|1.0|I have thrown money away before, but this really hurt. I don't want my 8 bucks back nearly as much as I want those 3 and one half hours back in my life. I was at the movies staring at the screen with incredulity, and all I could think was that I wasted 8.50 on this piece of celluloid refuse. I felt more sorry for these two elderly women who looked back at me with confusion, seeking an explanation of what incontinent drivel they had just witnessed. I could not help these poor women and felt really bad for them since I know they must be on a fixed income and shelled out cash for this THIRD effort by a talented writer director, who has two awesome films under his belt. WHAT HAPPENED???? <br />I can only hope that Anderson wakes up and goes back to making a really good film like he did with Boogie Nights and Hard Eight. Either one will be worth owning.
B00003CX6P|4.0|The only reason why I wanted to see this movie was because Jude Law was in it and I'm a big fan of his. But before seeing the movie, I've heard lots of negative things about and so I wasn't too open to liking the movie when I first saw it.<br />It's better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.<br />My first impression of the movie was that it really dragged on. It seemed too long and moved too slowly for me. Or maybe I was just being impatient because I really wanted Mr. Ripley to get out of the country. But the more I think about the movie, the better I think it is with all its intricacies in character development.<br />Personally, I thought the greatest weakness in the film was the dialogue. Although they were some wonderful comparisons and motifs (the dark basement without a key), many of the encounters came off as too direct and too unnatural. The odd comments of Mr. Ripley (whether they were intentional or not) of 'You love me so why don't you marry me' and 'Can I get into the bathtub?' just seemed really strange. Mr. Ripley always seeme dto have some homosexual tendencies but I really couldn't figure it out. The movie was capable of being horribly confusing.<br />On the bright side, Jude Law and Matt Damon were brilliant :) Jude Law's character, Dickie Greenleaf was fairly simple. However, I'm reluctant to comment on Jude Law's performance since I'm extremely biaised on that matter :P As far as I'm concerned, I could absolutely see him as the carefree and inconsiderate person of Dickie Greenleaf. Matt Damon was equally brilliant in his role. And I absolutely loved the characterization of Mr. Ripley, the center of the story. I loved how he slowly becomes more and more obsessed with Dickie's lifestyle and how his crimes increase as his mental stability breaks down. The basement just gets darker and darker. The darker it gets, the harder it is to open. <br />The secondary characters were decent. I found that most of them provided comical relief. Gwyneth Paltrow (why does she spell her name so unconventionally) was a bit melodramatic I find but her character was breaking down as well so I'll forgive her :). But I've never been a big fan of Gwyneth so ignore me on that comment :P<br />As the title suggests, the movie centers around Mr. Ripley who is an intriguing and dynamic character. Despite the slow pace at times (relieved by a few comical characters), the movie provides decent entertainement and provokes plenty of food for thought :)
B000002UUX|4.0|It's that simple. If you're into the classic thrash of yesteryear sported by Merciful Fate, Accept, Slayer, Anthrax, etc, few will tickle your fancy better than Megadeth's &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;. The lyrics are quite original (for metal) and the guitar work is as tightly woven and melodious as it is massively head-bangable.<br />Killer tunes: Holy Wars... The Punishment Due (A MASTERPIECE), Take No Prisoners, Poison Was The Cure, Rust In Peace... Polaris.<br />Nuff said. I guess.<br />Buy it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I am not a fan of country-western music.  Probably the only music on here that I've collected myself is blues.  The remaining music, made up of country, bluegrass, folk, and gospel, I don't own a single CD from those genres.  However, I now own this one.  After seeing the movie, I thought the music was so outstanding that I just had to buy it.  I also know none of the musicians on this CD but they all do exemplary jobs. The Coens made a 5 star movie and commissioned a 5 star soundtrack to go with it.  You can't go wrong with either.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000031XCR|5.0|This cd is the ultimate. It is extremely enjoyable and relaxing to listen to. Her voice just sends you to LaLa Land.  Thank you Celine!!!
0060278234|5.0|Most sequels aren't as good as the originals, but this one was great! It is about Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr, but a misfit even among her own people. No one knows who her father is and even her mother was considered a little strange. The worst part is that she is the oldest girl in the Clayr without her powers. She is so frustrated that she goes looking for trouble and eventually ends up creating her only friend- a dog made entirely of Mage marks. Later, after overhearing Sabriel and her husband talk about the troubles in the Old kingdom, she embarks on a boat trip where she meets the prince of the land.<br />The book ends rather abrubtly, leaving everyone yearing for the next book, to tell about the evil magic that is to come. I know that I can't wait!
B000002J09|5.0|Lord above. What can I say about this band that hasn't already been said exactly forty-six billion and nineteen times before?<br />Nobody can write songs as articulate, instrumentally vivid, or original like Led Zeppelin has. I'd like nothing more than to see the naysayers try.<br />If you don't like Led Zeppelin's music, you have to respect them as musicians. It's the law. And if you don't, in all sincerity, the world would be a better place if you killed yourself.
B00004XONN|1.0|I loved both OK Computer and The Bends but did not get around to listening to Kid A until this month.  I did not like it at first and thought after and number of listens I would &quot;get it&quot;.  Not so.  Having heard it a dozen times I have to say I found it boring monotonous and pretentious.  I traded the cd in on the weekend.
6305949980|5.0|This film caught me by surprise.  Although I enjoy animated movies I am not a huge buff.  I decided to see this one because it was done by Tim Burton, who directed Batman Returns, Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.  This is his best film to date.  It manifests Burton's usual creativity and eccentricity.  The vignettes of Halloween town and Christmas town are awesome.  The music won me over compeltely.  Every song is entrancing and beautiful, the characters are likeable and sweet.  The special edition DVD is awesome, delivering great picture and sound as well as a whole lot of extras, including deleted scenes, etc.
B00005614M|5.0|It was during the 1940s that Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were responsible for the bebop evolution/revolution that changed jazz forever. As that decade ended, Miles Davis (formerly from Parker's band) founded one of the two distinct styles that resulted from the &quot;splitting&quot; of bebop - the other, of course, was hard-bop. With this recording, Miles showed the world what &quot;cool&quot; jazz was supposed to be. The contributions of Gil Evans and Gerry Mulligan were absolutely essential to that, and the final result was this album filled with astounding compositions and marvelous arrangements. (Kenny Hagwood's singing in &quot;Darn That Dream&quot; sounds pretty odd, though. I guess Johnny Hartman wasn't in town. A pity.) The fact that Miles Davis, who &quot;created&quot; cool jazz, also became a major hard-bop star is not ironic at all: that's just how complete his talent was.
B000001ELP|5.0|I have been a KISS fan since 1975 or so, and have had this record since the day it came out (nice gatefold cover and unique satin/clear plastic sleeve with the credits on it). I was 11, and I thought it was great then, and I still think that now! Anyone who thinks that Unmasked is a great record needs to check into a mental ward. I guess the problem is that people dont think of it as a &#34;real&#34; KISS record, but some bad attempt at &#34;branching out&#34;. I never had a problem with it, but sometimes you can't like everything a group or artist does, and I guess that this record falls into that catagory. I found every record since then until Revenge (what an apt title!) was just OK or even alright. I would of seen them on one of their recent tours, but I knew they would not be playing anything from that album (that and they are just a bunch of tired old men now, as I've seen some bootleg shows). Oh well.....
B000005RHR|5.0|My only experience with Richard James had only been through Windowlicker and Come to Daddy, music that is ANYthing but ambient or relaxing. When I found this I thought it was maybe some kind of ironic title. No. This is simply the best ambient album I have ever heard, even though it's not all that ambient. Whenever guys try to make music that lets your mind wander, they seem to think that it has to be tepid and boring and very very cheesy. That is not the case with this compilation. If I close my eyes and chill to this music, I have a very intense experience and don't really think about going to sleep. ... One last thing, I have a hard time believing this is really from 1985...it sounds as contemporary as anything done today...clearly ahead of its time.
B00000K31V|5.0|The art of making cool movies has been forgotten.  Here is one from Croneberg: a nifty story with a layered plot that you have to watch carefully and more than once.  This movie presents a video game designer as an artiste and players as her loyal followers in a world that values facscimiles over reality.  They are just more fun and liberating.  The story manages to have us questioning reality and the idea of free will.  The acting is pleasantly peculiar and un-American.  The art design is nauseously original.  The DVD is very good, giving us director and scpecial effects producer commentary as well as a look at the art used in the film.
6305718954|1.0|this film is not worth  your time and money first of all the only good thing about this film is that it shows the hypocrisy of the catholic church And as a catholic I was shocked to learn that the church would deny such historical documents. such as the gospels of st thomas, anyways that is the best parts of the movie the performances by arquette and bryne are so bad that everyone who saw this movie with me fell asleep watching it need I say more, and we were all in our teens in early twenties, so you have been warned about thiss dvd buy at your own risk
6305263248|5.0|Nice action, some intelect. Great sound (try a rocket launcher at convoy attacking scene :). Perfect driving scenes.
0743200799|4.0|Using his extensive files (over 7 file cabinets) and numerous sources, Gene Kranz  reviews each launch and narrates his participation in the space program from Mercury through Apollo. An amazing amount of detail is given for the numerous difficulties that were encountered in each phase of the space program. The recognition of problems, troubleshooting them and quick resolution is the driving force in this text. Readers remember Apollo 13's fuel cell crisis and the excellent job done by both Mission Control and the crew to safely return the space craft home.  However, while not as dramatic as Apollo 13's potential for astronauts being lost in space, several other incidents that could have resulted in tragedy are detailed along with the actions taken to overcome each difficulty.<br />The text is an account of Gene Kranz's career from procedure writer to Flight Director and details the history of the development of  NASA's Mission Control  organization. There being no previous experience, the book outlines how the Mission Control organization was developed from scratch. The text illustrates that in space, team work and training was mandatory to be able to evaluate a problem and initiate action often within 60 seconds. This required a high degree of commitment and competence for all persons involved.<br />Kranz's accounts of training through simulation is fascinating.  Malfunctions were programmed into the training without prior knowledge of the persons in the training session. In one case the simulated collapse of the mission doctor was so real that after the training session others had to be told the doctor was fine. Such detailed and stressful training  and the actual mission performance required a detailed knowledge of systems by each person for their area of responsibility plus knowledge of adjoining areas. This training frequently revealed problems where such knowledge later paid off in successful missions.   <br />The author briefly outlines the background of each person as they appeared in the narration. They were basically a mix of young engineers and aviators some having test pilot experience. All parties had to live by a time line whether it was during planning, training, launch, flight or recovery. The text clearly states that participation in the space program demanded discipline, commitment and risk. Some readers may criticize Gene Kranz for his strict military attitude, discipline and unwavering commitment but the question must be asked what other alternatives would have worked in situations where decisions had to be made in seconds for malfunctions involving life and death?  I am reminded of the old saying  \\"A camel is a race horse designed by a committee.\\" As the author clearly illustrates, in space there was no margin for error or time for debate.<br />Also covered are several non-flight activities such as upper management, debriefings and press conferences. Each debriefing was critical to the success of the next mission especially if critical malfunctions had to be addressed. The text states that the space program was covered by a dedicated, well-informed, and highly professional press corps who \\"....knew the difference between objective reporting of news and hyping things up to entertain the audience....\\" Kranz notes that \\"The press conference was almost as much of an ordeal as the mission\\" and further states \\"They asked the tough questions, but they respected us and the work we did as long as we didn't try to mislead them.\\"<br />Flight directors worked rotating shifts. Gene Kranz was a flight director for Apollo 11 during the actual first lunar landing and later led the team that developed the program to recover Apollo 13 after it suffered the fuel cell explosion. The text gives much interesting information about both flights. The last moon landing was Apollo 17 where once again Kranz was a flight director.<br />The book concludes with the usual chapter Where They Are giving an update of the history for the major players. <br />The book provides a tremendous amount of information. Readability may be a minor weakness of this work, but a most helpful appendix Glossary of Terms defines the many acronyms used in the text and helps the reader to move ahead. While not difficult to read, at times it is slow reading unless the reader is just skimming.  <br />While some may take issue with Gene Kranz's stern, disciplined, military approach to the challenges faced, the results confirm the effectiveness of this approach to life and death situations where decisions must be made in seconds and there is no turning back once a decision was made. <br />A must read for those interested in a time when the United States successfully met a major challenge.
B00003CXBK|4.0|The movie is pretty interesting.. but it is hard to sit through.  This movie depicts a timeless tale of man Vs nature.  It starts with a young man who is wounded by a demon spirit and goes to find  a cure in the west. He finds a cure while learning the need to be in tune with nature.  The movie cleverly weaves a number of Japanese fairy tales/fables together.  I personally liked the Japanese sounds tack a lot better than the English.  And for those wondering what the translation of the Hime is.. it goes:<br />In the moonlight I felt your heart, Quiver like a bowstrings pulse. In the moon sphere light you looked at me. Nobody knows your heart.<br />When the sun has gone I see you, Beautiful and hunting but cold, Like the blade of a knife so sharp so sweet. Nobody knows your heart.<br />Lord of your sorrow, grief and plea, Locked away in the forest of the night. The sacred heart belongs to the world, Of the things that sigh in the dark, Oh the things that cry in the dark.<br />I think that is right.. Well it s the best translation I can give!  Anyway.. It was a pretty good movie so I gave it 4 stars.
0805062971|4.0|Yes, another review by someone moved by the movie and now has gone back and read the book.  And, as usual, the book is better.  Palahnuik's book is a great social commentary on the spiritual void of today and his views on how people can find self fulfillment in self destruction has an uncanny appeal to it.  Who wants to die without any scars?  People want to do something with they're lives, and waiting tables is less than something.  So, through self infliction you can find self identification.  Palahnuik's book is full of humor such as Joe and his various organs and where/how they make the soap, just a big smirk the whole way through.  Also there's a final irony in that a book that talks so much about being more than your possessions, you 'chuck' out over $10 for it, and it's a little more than a short story (200 pages, fairly large type, simple sentence structures and alot of the stuff you read at the beginning is repeated later) which is a final kicker, laugh at yourself.

B00005BCPC|3.0|I rented this movie along with &quot;Emma&quot; one night in my goal to absorb nearly everything Jane Austen. So far I've read and seen the most recent BBC version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;--a bit of a slow start I'll admit lol I did get most of her books from the library though and am actually reading &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; right now. It's definitely slow compared to P &amp; P, but good enough to keep reading. The movie is kind of chop-sockey, incorporating things from the book in random order with no real point, especially the whole slavery thing. In defense of the movie though, at least it moves a lot faster than the book and while I'm only half way through, it's amazing what Frances O'Connor has down with the character of Fanny Price. I actually liked the Fanny in the movie, the Fanny in the book on the other hand is such a simpering goody-goody moron I want to slap her. Sorry, but she feels evil about the stupidest things, and while those around her ARE corrupt at least they have fun. Example : When Edmund asks for her opinion on something, Fanny gasps and goes &quot;My opinion&quot; like it's the grandest honor next to being invited for tea with the queen. Must admit that my favorite character in the movie was Henry Crawford; I felt sorry when Fanny rejected him, and I'll probably hate her in the book for it, but in the movie I could see why she did it. She had no way of knowing whether his affections were truly sincere or would stay that way. Worth watching if you're an Austen fan and not nearly as boring as the book, but not great. I have no idea why Fanny Price was one of Jane Austen's favorite heroines though; Emma was a little irritating in her over-perfectness, but not nearly as annoying and Elizabeth Bennet is definitley my favorite thusfar. The whole reason her and Mr. Darcy were perfect for eachother was because they saw the superficialness in their society and what they said wasn't as important as the underlying meaning of their words. Fanny Price on the other hand would NEVER say or think anything bad against anyone without feeling that she should get down on her knees and pray intensely for forgiveness.
0385486804|5.0|A great biography of a young man living his life in the mirror of his beliefs. Fueled by the need to become his own man and by works of earthly-existential writers such as Tolstoy and Thoreau (to name a few), McCandless is poetry in motion. I think that what we see is a rare human being with his sights set far beyond where many will dare to explore. Any critical stance against McCandless' decision to live his life in the way in which he chose to live is, in actuality, jealous of an achievement that most fall short of... self-actualization. I would have been proud to known and walked with such a man. My regards to those left behind, but we all must admire the light in which he shed upon not only those who knew him, but those who will read of his life.<br />Peace!

The film has great images of a land that is fading, and was wonderful on the big screen.

B00005MAM2|5.0|&quot;Akira&quot; is not my favorite anime movie by any stretch of the imagination--that title would have to go to &quot;Mononoke Hime&quot;/&quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; the greatest accomplishment of anime's greatest film director, Miyazaki Hayao.  But there is no way that Miyazaki's imagination, as expansive, intelligent, and vivid as it is, could ever come up with something as visually and aurally striking as Otomo Katsuhiro's &quot;Akira.&quot;<br />First, even with a five star review, &quot;Akira&quot; in terms of contents has some storytelling problems--the oft-noted fact that there were thousands of manga pages to condense into a two-hour film production obviously did not help in clarifying the story, especially for newcomers to anime and manga.  However, I am happy to report that the new dub and subtitling job has made many elements much clearer than the old Streamline release.  The explanation of the psychic powers in the children and the ending have been clarified a great deal, though not entirely (the movie simply couldn't condense the manga that much).<br />Also, contrary to most of the reviewers who have panned the new dub, I personally can't see on any technical standard how the old dub is in any way superior to the new one, which I found a lot less irritating and overacted.  I actually do agree, however, that they might have added the old dub as an extra audio track for nostalgia's sake and it would add to the value of this already excellent package.  &quot;Akira&quot; was the first anime to become popular in the mainstream American culture, and so perhaps the memories of those early fans should have been taken into consideration.  Nevertheless, I don't consider it a huge loss, especially since the dub is definitely clearer in explaining the story and is more accurate.  (Me?  I still prefer subtitles, of course. :)<br />The storytelling problems I mentioned above, however, definitely are overwhelemed by the fantastic visuals, of which just about every reviewer has spoken.  The video restoration on the DVD is nothing less than astounding, considering the film's age.  Details like tiny lamps and desks in the thousands of lighted office windows are now clear.  The hyperkinetic racing sequences are even more glorious in their energy than before, as the colors have been restored and the dark color palette, which made VHS releases look fuzzy and muted, is now sharp and distinct.  The soundtrack is one of the most thrilling and innovative ethnic soundtracks used in film, anime or not, and it too has been digitally restored.<br />&quot;Akira&quot; is an absolute aesthetic triumph in anime, and despite its less-than-perfect storytelling qualities (and, for me, excessive bloodletting), it is the defining visual statement of what cel animation can accomplish.  The DVD release also sets a new standard in audio/video quality and also in the wealth of informational material included on the Special Edition's second DVD--for me, it was a fascinating first peek at the actual production of a feature anime.  First, &quot;Mononoke&quot; set THE standard for quality audio/video transfer, though it lacked in extras and was a recent film in either case; now, &quot;Akira&quot; takes my top spot for technical and aesthetic excellence for a Region 1 anime DVD release.very reviewer has spoken.

B00003CXA6|3.0|This movie is a very accurate and complete depiction of the events prior to and involving the civil war conflict that was Gettysburg.  Although very accurate, the movie could have been shortened dramatically and still been very entertaining and realistic without losing its edge.  The repeated scenes of monotonous dialogue bring the movie down from the splendor that is really there.  This was a horrific and important time in our country and for that, I salute the producers of this film for such a fine documentary.  However, if you're looking for a quick paced action/adventure film of the Battle of Gettysburg, this ain't it.
B000002NHN|5.0|When I first heard this album I was struck by it's exquisite music and unique content.Although I have enjoyed alot of celtic and Irish music, I have never heard anything like this before. This album of ancient celtic and middle eastern music is incredible. In a world with so much copy-cat music it's nice to hear music with old primeval instruments. I love the way Loreena uses her voice as an instrument going high and low with the music especially in Prologue and Marco Polo. Those two songs are excellent examples of middle eastern music. They are better than the authentic songs i've heard from that part of the world. La Serenissima is a beautiful instrumental harp piece. Skellig, Night Ride Across The Caucasus and The Highwayman are the best celtic songs on the album. They are more like stories than just songs. The Mummers Dance (about ancient tree worshippers)was released as a single,though it's not the best song on the album. The best are La Serenissima,The Highwayman and Dante's prayer a captivating church like song. If you love celtic and world music you should give this superb album a try.
B0000025WQ|3.0|I know my header contradicts itself somewhat.  However there is some method behind my statements.  The first few tracks are definitely the cream of this crop.  Money Changes Everything is a sure fire rocker with hard hitting lyrics.  Girls Just Want To Have Fun is light hearted song that just bounces along quite nicely.  When You Were Mine is an underatted piece(written by Prince) that bops to a nice disco flavored beat while Time After Time is touching, reflective, and maybe Cindi's strongest song.<br />The record goes downhill after this.  I know there's some important hidden message on She Bop but the words are somewhat undecipherable that its a strain to even bother with any analysis.  All Through The Night, has a nice chord progression with some descriptive imagery mixed in.  The synthesizer gets a bit annoying here bu the beauty of the song remains fairly strong.  The remaining tracks aren't bad by any means.  But the special effects from the synthesizer and Cindi's undecipherable/odd vocal style wears thin on one's nerves. In general, its OK every now and then but there are some significant drawbacks and annoying moments.  Mostly for big fans of eighties rock.
B00003CXCS|5.0|The movie is my all time favorite.  Interviews, commentary and extra video footage on disk 2 make the production even better.  I have worn ot four videos and am enjoying the DVD.
B00001OH7M|4.0|'space oddity,' is perhaps one of the most bizarre david bowie albums ever made, and that really is saying something. unlike the glam-rock bombast that would be ziggy stardust or the cold, funky thin white duke, bowie presents us with major tom, an astronaut who is lost in space.<br />the songs on, 'space oddity,' veer from one musical style to the next. the title track displays bowie at his most dreamy and loose, but then, 'unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed,' explodes as a dylan-esque blues romp (this is also the song that features bowie's immortal line, 'i'm a phallus in pigtails'). but after the short and forgettable, 'don't sit down,' 'cygnet committee really displays beautiful songwriting. it's sort of an extended jam which goes over 9 minutes.<br />the next few songs are very forgettable, but once, 'wild eyed boy from freecloud,' comes on, you realize that his cheesy lyrics and subject matter can in fact be profound. this is perhaps most evident on, 'memory of a free festival,' a wandering, isolated song.<br />so get this album if you like any of bowie's transformations. it's hard to tell which character of his could make such an unpredictable album.
630438551X|1.0|Oh my god.. How can I describe the utter atrocity of this half-baked attempt at bringing Shakespeare to the movie screen in less than 1,000 words? *takes a breath* I'll try to,though.. Okay,the major problems were: 1. Keeping the Elizabethan dialect. The reason this was so bad was because *none* of the actors knew how to say it to where it sounded belivabale. (The balcony scene,which should have been renamed to the &quot;gratuitous sex in the pool with something vaugely resembiling Shakespeare&quot; scene). 2. Mercutio was re-written as a crossdresser. *No*! In the play,Mercuito was eccentric (and for the better half of acts 1 and 2,comical relief) but he was not and should not have been a crossdresser. I saw varied clips of R+J (and dosen't that title just scream &quot;High school bathroom grafiti!&quot;?) in the Garbage music video &quot;(My) Number One Crush&quot; (....Why was pop music introduced into this insepid mess? To appeal to the teeny boppers,of course!) most noteably,a clip with a black man wearing a cotton candy pink afro-wig dressed in something that could pass for a skimpy bathing suit,singing (or was it screaming?) in front of fire works. *That's* supposed to be Mercuitio? Ri--ight.. Please,if you like Shakespeare,don't waste your time on this insiped,drippy-eyed garbage. You'll be doing yourself a favour.

B00004VVNC|5.0|Brad Pitt proves once again he's not just a pretty face.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching this movie!  I'm not going to get into details of the movie since so many have done it already.  But this movie made me laugh and it made me cry and not too many movies can make me do that esp. one movie, it made me realize the importance of families sticking together.  It's amazing watching this great family when life was simple and nearly perfect for them fall apart and then in the end come back together again.  I loved Pitt, Hopkins and Quin's acting.  Julia Ormand was wonderful.  I know some reviwers complained about the Tristan and Susannah love affair saying it wasn't true love, and I agree somewhat, it wasn't really true love cause it wasn't meant to be. IMO  I also have to say that the whole cast was good in this film, the young girl who played Isabel Two was great and I agree watching her wait patently for Tristan was very moving.  I don't want to give away too much but I highly recommend watching this film,  I can't get enough of it.  Also for Pitt lovers-he looks so freakin' hot in this movie!!!  Best hair movie for Pitt as well.  I had to get that out of my system.
B00004YTZE|5.0|The Heartbreakers were among the true pioneers of the mid 70's New York punk scene.  Their debut album &quot;L.A.M.F. was released in 1977 on Track records.  Impossible to find even at the time the album featured a terrible muddy mix that destroyed any hope for this brilliant album.  Add to the poor sound the self destructive behavior of the band members and the quick bankrupcy of the record label and L.A.M.F. quickly sank into obscurity.<br />This new release on Jungle Records miraculously rescues the sound on this album. I have owned this album for 22 years in three different versions and the sound difference is day from night.  This verson is also far superior to the LAMF Revisited release from 1984.<br />Now to the group and the album.  For the uninitiated the Heartbreakers were formed by Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan(both sadly deceased)in 1975 after the breakup of their first band the New York Dolls. They travelled to England to play on the Anarchy tour with the Sex Pistols etc.  I saw them live twice and if they were in the right frame of mind they were terriffic.  Check out the Live at Max's '79 album.<br />L.A.M.F contained 12 songs originaly and this version adds the wonderful &quot;Can't Keep My Eyes On You&quot; plus a concert favorite a cover of &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;.  Great cuts include the too aptly named &quot;Born To Lose&quot;,  &quot;All By Myself&quot;,  the first version of &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; written by the Ramones for the Heartbreakers,  &quot;Get Off The Phone&quot;.  Long time Heartbeaker fans will not recognize these new mixes.  Most improved might be &quot;Baby Talk&quot; that actully has a guitar riff chorus that is the key to the song and was burried for 23 years.<br />If you are a Heartbreakers fan and do not have this version you must buy it.  I know we have all heard and bought &quot;re-mixed&quot; versions of this album in the past only to have our hearts broken again but his version delivers. I would also reccomend thisalbum to fans of mid 70's punk and new wave.  I would put this album in my top 15 of this genre right behind the debut albums by Television, The Clash, the Sex Pistols, Patty Smith, &quot;Come Home&quot; and &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; by the Ramones and a couple ohters.<br />Not many things went right for the Heartbreakers during their brief career but they made a terrific album that can  and deserves to be heard.
B000050IMG|5.0|Some parts are a little gross but overall, it was intelligently written.  I cracked up when Cindy knocked the piano and the grandma downstairs to slow down the killer.  The death sequences were also funny.  The way Drew flew up when she got hit by the car, the way all the moviegoers were jeering and stabbing Brenda, the way she groaned, the way Cindy screamed before she got hit by the car.  Even though there's only one part that really makes you laugh until you cry, the other parts were very witty and enjoyable.
B00000K19E|5.0|I don't usually watch a film more than once. Most films simply cannot hold my attention for a second, third or fourth viewing. The Matrix is different. I have yet to tire of it. It's a good story, the visuals are impressive, and the special effects are simply amazing. It is a bit violent and those who don't enjoy violent films should avoid it. But I think it will go down as one of those timely films that captured a snapshot of our cultures myths at a certain point in time.
B00003CXSM|3.0|The Wedding is a typical comdey romance with nothing really to shout about. The preformances are O.K. and the script is like any others. When talking about just the movie the wedding was not planned. Althought the preformance of Justin Chambers portraing &quot;Massimo&quot; is the about only thing the movie has to show for it self. DVD features is one thing that saves the movie, the minute you here Jenifer Lopez &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; at the end credits, you'll want to to press the menu button right away. So if you have a DVD player go ahead and rent it, but if you saw it in theaters you wasted your time.
B0000024W3|5.0|Here we are in the year 2001.  Thirty years ago I purchased this album in that black plastic format that my son asks me &quot;how do you play this thing, Dad?&quot;.  I have since picked it up in CD format.  Now I observe a quickening of artists vibrating in unison to music of &quot;Americana&quot;.  The fiddle playing hand in hand with the harmonica and banjo, pouring out tunes transplanted form Ireland and England that made appalachia so famous.  Bob was into this over thirty years ago, and Self Portrait is his testimony to it.  <br />Ive heard a lot of whining about this collection of songs, and Ive also heard a lot of praise.  Yes, a bunch of this music Bob did not write, but to sit and listen will give you an earfull of what is now in the year 2001 being refreshed musically.  &quot;All the tired horses&quot; can hypnotize you into the correct mood for listening to this collection and &quot;Wigwam&quot; will keep the mood going for some time.  &quot;The Boxer&quot;  is Dylans version of a popular tune of the time, done in a very nice country format.  &quot;Copper Kettle&quot;, the moonshiners ballad, can stir up images of an illicit trade that supported many an applachian family during very hard times.  &quot;Little Sadie&quot; and &quot;Minstrel Boy&quot; are two tunes that to this day amaze me with their cleverness.  <br />Bob continues to amaze me in his inspiration and creativity in this, one of my favorite Dylan collectons.
1859849296|1.0|Anyone who wants a decent insight into the left's complete contempt for humanity would do well to read this book as well as the following reviews.       Mother Theresa was not a Nation reader. If she were, she might have known that the proper etiquette for an enlightened, socially conscious-secularist would be to disregard the sufferings of any actual people and instead go to the local Starbucks or grad school seminar (or Amazon review sheet) and pontificate to the other documentary film-makers what she could do for the poor. Perhaps she could have gotten a degree in social work or health management and written articles to the Nation about the wonders of universal healthcare and population control. Perhaps she could have joined her local board of skeptics and freed people from the silly illusions of life actually having some sort of purpose.      Obviously, she didn't. What she did was to gather dying people into her own arms and carry them into her home. She cared for real people with real blood and stench, real life and death.  This makes her a natural enemy to the left who love humans in the abstract but maintain nothing but contempt for real people(who has ever seen a socialist leper colony or an atheist home for the disabled?)       I suspect that whenever Hitchens finally falls off his barstool and joins his buddy Kissinger in the great beyond, he might see things a bit differently. I pray as much.

B00003CXA6|5.0|When Gettysburg first appeared on movie screens in 1993, audiences agreed that it was truly one of the great American war films.  Based on the late Michael Shaara's best selling book THE KILLER ANGELS, GETTYSBURG assembled a superb cast including Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, Sam Elliott, C. Thomas Howell, the late Richard Jordan and 5,000 Civil War reenactors.  Filmed on location within the boundaries of the National Battlefield Park and surrounding Adams County, GETTYSBURG is one of the most accurate depictions of a specific military campaign during the War Between the States.  Some have criticized the film for concentrating soley on three main battles, but there is signficant attention to detail and magnificently choreographed battle scenes accurately portray the spirit of the July 1863 battle in the film's four-hour plus running time.  Martin Sheen's portrayal of beloved Confederate General Robert E. Lee has taken considerable flak.  Many Civil War buffs do not like to see General Lee portrayed as an tired old soldier who becomes danagerously over confident, but viewers must understand that this is how Michael Shaara crafted Lee's character in the book.  Confederate General Longstreet and Union Colonel Chamberlain are clearly the story's heroes.  Both video and DVD versions are presented in a modified letterbox edition with Dolby stereo sound.  Both products present excellent quality pictures and sound.  The DVD version contains additional features on the Battle of Gettysburg and the making of the film.  ...
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is such a great cd! I just do not understand these annoying reviewers that are being WAY to critical of Britney. She does  have talent and can sing quite good. Besides if they think that they can do so much better why aren't they famous? Also, what do you expect? Every singer to sound exactly like Barbara Streisand... But if you want to buy a cd that is really positive and fun, this cd is for you. Every song is so wonderful and very catchy. I bought this cd the day it came out and it is still in my cd player. I recommend this to everyone.
B000000993|5.0|This is pretty early stuff but I think it is just as good as AENIMA.  If you like AENIMA you'll love this CD.  The one thing that bothers me is that TOOL ripped off the riff from Sober (UNDERTOW) and used it in Eulogy (AENIMA).  Other than that the two songs are nothing a like.<br />If you a new tool fan start HERE!  You can't go wrong.

She knows who she is and doesn't let the pressures of society sway her from what she knows is right.  We need more role models like her.

B00001ZWBQ|5.0|a Great performance! 31 songs with a variaty of aproach styles.<br />The BGs sounds almost like a studio recording, with a very professional and sharp performance. The center and surround channels are mostly used for the audiance and for the reverb effects but sometimes there are drums and echo there.<br />Bottom line: The DTS sound is huge! Very detailed and clear. The performance is great. and you feel like if you're in the croud.<br />If you want a gerat live DTS production - this is the DVD for you. If you like the BeeGees - this DVD is for you.<br />If both categories apply to you - you should be ashamed not to have this DVD at home ;)
B00004XONN|4.0|This is the future of music.  We, as music listeners, will look back ten years from now at this record and say &quot;Wow&quot;.  Radiohead have set themselves apart from the rest of the music industry by being honest and taking chances.  They have defined for me what is smart music.  Groundbreaking is one word that comes to mind.  Right off the bat, the first track 'Everything in It's Right Place' is spooky, mysterious, and beautiful all at the same time. Also, the first three tracks contain NO guitar.  They pull this feat off by layering sounds together to make music.  Isn't that what music is anyway? Layering sounds together that make songs?  I say yes.  Warning to all &quot;Rock&quot; fans: This is not even close to a rock record.  In fact, its the furthest thing from rock.  It is just flat out good music.  Pick it up and see what we are in store for in the future.  The future is now, and the future is Radiohead.

B00001NFCY|1.0|This is the worst CD I've bought in years.  Purchased to hear one song that received tons of airplay, the rest of this album is horrid.  It's all the same song in the &quot;I wanna be a rock star&quot; style. Arrggghh!!  Really a disappointment.  I'm going to sell it to a used CD store but I expect to find about a dozen already there.
B00003CXA6|5.0|People, this the best war flick I've ever seen by far.  I classify this a Male Tear Jerker!  Being ex-military, one can just empathize with the wounded.  If you have a civil war ancestor this will give you all the feel of what they went thru.  And if that thought don't grip you tightly in the throat, then you must not be alive.  Just remember the prequel is being filmed.  I hope it continues to be as good as this one.

6305095566|5.0|The Evil Dead is one of the best B-movie horror films made. On a limited budget of 350,000, Sam Raimi set out to make the &quot;Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror,&quot; what he got was one hell of a ride. The special efects are great for their time and budget, very convincing. The rapid editing and quick camera cuts makes for some of the greatest suspense seen on film. The 'Sam-Cam' is also first-rate. It supposed to make it look like a spirit out in the woods, and is delivered magnifincently. The acting, though, is typical B-movie fare. Which means they tried to hard, and over-acted. But don't get confused with the second one either. This one doesn't have the humor (but the effects are hilarious, in a good way) and Ash doesn't have a chainsaw stuck to his hand spouting off one-liners to demos. The first film has an emphasis on scares over laughs. <br />I recommend this film for anyone interested in horror movies or someone wanting to make films for themselves. If you haven't seen this yet, then what the hell are you waiting for?!
B000002B30|5.0|The Greatest Hits album is a great beginning for every new fan of the Boss (like my fellow reviewers here have written). He has so many albums ,that you cannot buy them all- If you purchase this album, you will get a glimpse of Springsteen's music from the early 70's to the middle 90's. This will help you to decide where you want to start - with his latest material, or with the 'older' stuff. I think of the old time fans that complained about the absence of a few songs fell to pettiness - this album was certainly not made for their own benefit, since they already must have had the entire album collection.<br />I wish to focus and warmly recommend one of the two songs that are originally present only  in this album; I'm referring to \\"Blood Brothers\\" . It's one of the best songs I've ever listened to in my life. This piece of music has it all : Great tune ,Superb calm rhythm ,remarkably true and realistic words, soothing Harmonica ,and, you can't ignore the voice of the Boss himself...<br />Sit down, relax and just listen; it's one of a kind. It seems every single word expresses the state of mind Springsteen wishes to convey. I haven't heard all his albums, but I think that the main idea, that is repeated and resonated like a scarlet cord throughout a major part of his works, is summed up in this song.<br />Generally speaking, he deals with growing up, facing reality, fighting the inevitable fight every woman and man has to fight to reach their goals in life. He continues with the making of very hard decisions, dealing with the due consequences, and finally, accepting reality. Springsteen also sings a lot about the shattered dreams of almost everyone through the painful process of adulthood.<br />In this particular song, he talks of all the above plus the friends we get to know(in here- childhood buddies),the way we manage to keep on touch(or not), and the longing we feel for them now and then. I consider it a very sad painful and beautiful song I shouldn't hear very often ,not wanting diminish its magic.<br />\\"Blood Brothers\\" ,with all the other great songs make this buy an essential to start with.very often ,not wanting diminish its magic. <br />\\"Blood Brothers\\" ,with all the other great songs make this buy an essential to start with.
630280082X|4.0|I'm with the viewer from Cincinnati: Ralph Macchio does himself credit here. If Amazon's reviewer was stuck on the Karate Kid image, that's not the actor's fault -- and let's be honest; Macchio has never been enough of a marquee star to attribute his casting to that factor.    His status as a non-black northener is also appropriate. While in one sense this is a story about returning to the birthplace of blues, it's also a story of outbound discovery, of the blues leaving the cockpit of their creation to find a wider audience. Indeed, I think this tale presages the renewed popularity the blues found in the early 90s when Eric Clapton (From the Cradle) introduced a new generation to the music's roots.    This is a thoughful, enjoyable movie that I recommend to any viewer. My only peeve is that neither performer in the climactic guitar duel is really playing Delta blues, so if you're new to this art form, look beyond the film for an introduction. The real Robert Johnson recordings are a great place to start.
0812550706|3.0|Pretty good book. I can't find anything else to say. Except of course mentioning the intricate plot in which we follow Ender on his way to supreme commander of the human spacefleet without ever knowing it himself. This is of course spiced up with the harsh interaction with the other students at the combat-school and you really start &quot;live into&quot; enders universe. Be there. Only drawback, I think, is the fuzzy ending. I've never read the other books in the series, but I sort of felt cheated when... Hehe, I won't tell you. Just read it.
B00002E23H|4.0|Somewhere out at sea Nameless Giant Corporation sponsors a vast shark pen &amp; multistory underwater research center.  Here a team of scientists is working to increase the intelligence of sharks in order to cure Alzheimer's syndrome.  No, of course that doesn't make sense, the concept is irrelevant.  This is a good-looking, entertaining movie that is one of the better entries in the &quot;summer no-brainer&quot; category. The acting may not be on a par with Shakespeare in Love or something, but it's not bad.  So settle back and relax.  There's trouble at the shark station, and Samuel L. Jackson is flying in from Head Office to investigate....
0140186409|4.0|The first John Steinbeck book i read, but absolutely not the last. The authors vivid descriptive language draws one into the world as it looked like in USA at the time. Being non-american it really helped me understand a lot of the time being - and in addition to the history-lessons ;) I also felt that i had spend a great time with a great book. Certainly a 20th century classic. I love it. Now you go read it.
B00005M989|1.0|This album is a pure example why many music lovers think Prince is only a mediocre artist. I don't know what America was thinking in 1986 when \\"Kiss\\" hit number 1. That is the worse hit he has ever made, and sure enough, it is on this album. As a matter of fact, it is an insult just to see \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" as the only song from the \\"Prince\\" album. \\"With You\\" and \\"Still Waiting\\" are missing and they are gems. Where is the classic, \\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\\" Most of all, why is \\"Rasberry Beret\\" the only song \\"From Around The World In A Day\\"? \\"The Ladder\\" always seems to be missing everywhere, the best song Prince and his father John L. Nelson wrote together that is available on the \\"Around the world....\\" album. I also want you to know that if you think you are getting all Prince's big hits on one CD, you are not. \\"Batdance\\" is still missing, as it is from the first graetest hits albums Prince has. \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\\" is missing, but that can be exused to some point, as that was the first hit he did under his symbol.  Don't buy this friends. If you want to start with good Prince music, get the HITS I. It includes some major hit singles as well as non-hit singles which are actually better than most of his hits. Thanks for reading.
B00004XPQ2|5.0|If someone had the inclination, &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; could have been divided into two very respectable movies.  The first, concerning a group of British prisoners of war charged with erecting the title piece, would have been a neat little psychological drama and character study starring Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa.  The second, an action-adventure thriller, would follow William Holden, accompanied by Jack Hawkins, as they braved the harsh Asian jungle in a plot to blow up said title piece.  Each movie, as I see them in my own head, would have their fair share of suspense, action, snappy dialogue, intriguing characters, and powerful narrative thrust.  Each would have been a critical success, a popular smash, and an enduring classic.  However, they are not two movies.  They are one cohesive whole.  And here the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br />David Lean skillfully weaves these the two narrative threads together.  Even with a 160 minute running time, Lean never wastes a moment.  Everything leads to something else, and it is always entertaining.  Lean is that rare director who has a firm handle on both the visual and narrative elements of his films.  He reigns both in here with considerable skill, only showing what the audience needs to see, and what he wants them to see.<br />As in most war movies, madness is a theme that runs rampant.  Each of the main characters has dipped into some sort of madness, which manifests itself in four unique and intriguing ways.<br />Guinness is Col. Nicholson, a by the book British officer.  He carries around a copy of the Geneva Convention, and expects his Japanese captors, isolated for many months in the jungle, to adhere to them.  Guinness' greatest work here is in portraying Nicholson's stubbornness in the face of grave danger, and his pride in a job well done.  It could have been a showy role in the hands of a lesser actor, as there is a temptation to externalize Nicholson's crumble from sanity.  Guinness is subtle beyond the call of duty (even in his physical portrayal; one moment has him, after a long stint imprisoned in an oven-like box, paraded in front of his men.  Catch Nicholson trying to march with military precision on legs terrorized by atrophy.  It is a heartbreaking, and heroic, moment).<br />Colonel Saito, played by Hayakawa, is a man caught in a most unenviable position.  In the beginning, he appears to be holding all the cards.  But as we soon see, he is as much a pawn as the prisoners he's captured, indebted as much to his superiors as to his honour of duty.  The problem with the character of Colonel Saito, and really the only hole in the whole film, is that he is supposed to be a menacing character.  But we never see him be menacing; we have to rely on the word of Commander Shears.  A scene of him killing in cold blood would have gone a long way later on, when his transition to Guinness' subordinate would have been even more powerful.<br />Major Warden, played by Hawkins, comes late to the story, but has much to say about how the second half will play out.  He too is controlled by a sense of British duty, but his madness exhibits itself in a less controlled way.  Warden, who's spent most of his time playing war games in a tropical paradise of a base, expects his mission to be a walk in the park.  The horrors he encounters (both physical and psychological) are unexpected and hit him much harder than the others.  Hawkins, as both the English gentleman and the tormented soldier, does a fine job.<br />Holden plays probably the most intriguing character.  His Commander Shears has lived with his madness the longest, and has developed an ironic anti-hero callus to shield himself from the horrors.  We first see him digging graves for his fallen comrades, of which he is the last to survive.  From there, his situation gets much worse.  Shears adopts a mocking tone when confronting his superiors, parakeeting their catch phrases (&quot;When you're done, there's always one more thing to do&quot;; &quot;Be happy in your work&quot;) to the point of ridiculing them.  And even when he manages to escape the physical prison, he manages to get drawn back there against his will.<br />The prevailing madness of the film comes to a head in the end as Major Clipton, the camp's doctor and arguably the only character not afflicted by insanity up to this point (and probably my favourite character), has a Conrad-like epiphany.  It's a moment that rivals Kurtz' &quot;The horror!  The horror!&quot; from &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Kwai's&quot; war-movie progeny &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.<br />Even though many of its themes are psychological, it's no surprise why &quot;Kwai&quot; became both a popular and critical success.  It has all the elements of a grand classic: an all-star cast, tight suspense, lush scenery, humour, drama, finely drawn characters, intense action, and well-scripted dialogue.  And of course, there's the great whistling scene; nothing better than a bright melody to cut through the horrors of war.  It's a charming little scene that both brings a smile to your face and warns of tough times ahead.
0684847248|5.0|This book is a classic work by a new age psychiatrist which integrates psychology, traditional values and spiritual growth in a practical and usable format. The book explains the meaning of love (extending oneself for one's own or another's spiritual growth), proposes that discipline and responsibility are necessary in order to grow spiritually, and helps the post-60's agnostics make peace with Christianity in a way that is understandable and comforting. Although new age in doctrine, the book does not trash orthodox Christianity, but lets it be known that Christian spirituality can have a liberal new age focus as well as a conservative Biblical one. In fact The Road Less Traveled blends new age concepts of love with traditional orthodox Christian concepts of discipline and responsibility. This book is singularly responsible for leading me back to Christianity after many years of searching for the truth.  I also recommend A Course in Miracles, author anonymous and Choosing Happiness by Veronica Ray, along with the New Testament.
B00000K0DT|5.0|When I saw the scene of the coffee mug fall to the floor in Wrongfully Accused and Scary Movie, I didn't know what they were making fun of at first. A couple people at work told me that it was &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; those movies were making fun of. I never got around to seeing it until recently. Now I know why all the movie critics and people  still talk about this movie, even to this day. So I finally understand the part with the coffee in Scary Movie and Wrongfully Accused. I find those parts much funnier now. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job on producing and directing this movie. I thougt he did a great job directing X-men, so I was pretty sure &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; would be good. This movie kept me thinking to the very end. I never, ever, ever, would have guessed that 'Kyser Soze' was who he was. This movie is so clever and brillant, it's one of a kind. Theres not a lot of movies out there like this, that keeps you guessing, and makes you want to watch the movie again and again. This movie doesn't have much action, so if you want action, look else where. Now if you want a slick, smart mystery movie, with the coolest ending of any movie ever, this is it. &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; is now on the list of my top ten movies of all time.

The sound is nice, the movie is very good, Catherine its just wonderful, and Benicio del Toro it's hot, with his performance.<br />You can't miss this movie....
6304145438|5.0|Despite all the remakes and costumed remakes and hidden remakes, nothing can touch the original. This movie's simple message that every human being is important and has a life that has meaning, and the way this story is told, expands into an almost epic saga for anyone who watches it, even though it's an intimate drama. Well acted, amazing script, beautifully directed, with memorable scenes both comedic and sad and uplifting. This is one of the best movies of all time. It's a classic, it's FUN to watch, and it's a masterpiece.<br />This film is a joyous celebration of life, a life that we all live and can relate to, life that doesn't need money, position, reputation, or a big fancy house on a hill. Just a life where all that is necessary is love, faith, and a good heart. This is the story of one man's life, as simple as it may be, and how he affects so many people. It affects us as well.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This soundtrack is AWESOME. You have to listen to it more than once before deciding to buy it though b/c the 1st time around it can seem a little too odd b/c of all of the re-mixes and remakes of old songs. Once you get over that though it's awesome. Keeps me awake at work all the time!
B000002L80|2.0|Now, I thought Naked (with a few niggling exceptions) was a fine album.  This album, however...I mean, especially considering who we're dealing with...is simplistic and poppy and occasionally just plain dumb.  It seems like people who'll collectively jump up and down for something like &quot;Remain In Light&quot; fall into two distinct group when confronted with this thing (and Naked-) you love it, or just can't see why anyone would rave about it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Just listen to it!  It's one of those rare albums were each song works on its own level.  No two songs are alike, and all songs are fantastic.  I'm sure people will look into the album because of the mind-blowing animated video for Clint Eastwood, and that's great.  There is a playful sense to the song, but also a supernatural/metaphysical subtext.  That's how many of the songs are.  Listen to the CD more than once. You'll see what I mean.
0743216458|5.0|Stephen Ambrose writes a tremendous book showing the courage and selflessness that young American men possessed during the Second World War.  The book made me ashamed of all the complaining I do about my life while I have it easy compared to the men who died inland of Normandy and nearly froze to death in the forests of Bastogne.  The book is an intriguing look at the family that develops among fighting men.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read about superheros.
0553502557|5.0|This book is thoroughly enjoyable!  It is very different from the &quot;normal&quot; tourist books and provides the reader with a humorous inside look at travels in Australia.  It is blunt, honest and straightforward.  I laughed out loud at the author's comic observations around him.  I learned alot of interesting &quot;historical tidbits&quot; in a very painfree fashion.  I would highly recommend this book if you are planning to travel to Australia. If you are not planning on going to Australia, you will want to go after you finish this book.
B000003CKH|5.0|This CD is one of the best I've heard. All most all the songs are good, not like one of those CD's with just one good song.

0792842499|5.0|Clint Eastwood was one of the men principally responsible for shaping the archetype of the silent, itinerant Western gunfighter.  Drifting from town to town, guarding his words as closely as his money, Eastwood's character (known only as &quot;Blondie&quot; in this film) helped shape the western gunfighter in modern film as we know it.<br />First, a comment on the VHS edition of the film.  Due to its length, the movie unfortunately was split into two cassettes.  The break comes at a relatively quiet point in the movie, which is nice, but the need to change tapes midway through is a bit of an annoyance.<br />As to the movie itself, this is spaghetti Western at its best.  Three men with varying degrees of evil in their souls scramble to be the first to lay hands on a forgotten cache of Confederate loot.  The three serve as interesting character studies in comparison to each other.  Blondie sits in the middle, someone who looks out for himself as long as it's not at the expense of an honest individual, although he has no qualms about defrauding the government.  Tuco, the career criminal, is predictably crude and motivated only by his basest desires.  Angel Eyes is cold, calculating, and completely ruthless.  While Tuco has his occasional moments of loveable rascalhood, Angel Eyes in unredeemably evil.<br />The three men's race for the money takes them across the Western landscape, through a number of period situations and predicaments.  They are bound together by mutual interest, revenge, and perhaps grudging respect, although of course each intends to walk away with the money alone.<br />At two and half hours, this is not a movie for those weaned on such faster-paced (but still enjoyable) fare as Tombstone and Young Guns.  It is, however, one of the all-time greatest Western movies ever made.
0515125024|3.0|This is a really fun book. First of all it is a pretty good story, and that's why I gave it a handful of stars, but please don't try and suspend your disbelief while reading it. Read it as a frenzied, fantasy thriller sinking under the weight of its hilarious mistakes. I'll give you one example. Our hero has spent a good half-hour crawling through a totally dark cave tunnel when he emerges into a large cavern where equipment is stored. The cavern is dimly lit from cracks of light coming through a large door to the outside. Folks are in the cavern talking amongst themselves, but before John Reacher joins them he stops to let his \\"vision build.\\" The author doesn't seem to realize that vision adaptation takes place when going from light to dark, but not from dark to light. When you get up in the middle of the night and turn your 40-watt bedside lamp, you don't sit there for ten minutes waiting for your \\"vision to build.\\"<br />Our fearless protagonist spends this book fighting a fanatic militia group located in a remote Montana forest. He's way outnumbered of course, but the FBI is coming to the rescue.  Three of their stalwart agents decide to penetrate the dense, heavily patrolled forest, so they button their pin stripe suit coats, straighten their ties, shine their wingtip shoes, and head for the woods. Child doesn't tell whether or not they took their briefcases with them. What ever happened to the casual attire, the jackets with FBI emblazoned on the back?<br />Then there's the shrugging. When is the last time you shrugged? Child's characters do it constantly, often more than once per page. It really grates on you after awhile. The author also seems compelled to use that creaky old literary device of providing a lengthy description of every weapon used. You know, the one that goes something like this: \\"George picked up his Schlock .369 rifle with its lemon scented, knotty pine stock, cantilevered lead alloy barrel, and viscous damped trigger. The Schlock is capable of firing a 27.6 gram  projectile at the rate of ..Etc.\\" [...]P>In any event it's still a fun read relatively unmarred by mushy romance. Well, there is one scene where he and the lady do it, but our quick triggered hero is in and out of that tricky maneuver in two short sentences. Some of the book is rather exciting, like the law of physics bending climatic finale. I read that, then put the book down, shrugged, and went to bed.of firing a 27.6 gram  projectile at the rate of ..Etc.\\" [...]P>In any event it's still a fun read relatively unmarred by mushy romance.

0385486804|5.0|Admittedly, Krakauer is best known for the also-excellent book, 'Into Thin Air'..detailing a particularly tragic Mt. Everest expedition..but this, in my humble o, is the finer work.  Krakauer writes with fondness and forgiveness for his subject, a young man who goes in to the wilds of Alaska..whose body was eventually to be found in an abandoned bus and dead of hunger.  Originally this piece was printed in Outside magazine and contained some information that (he(the author) later believed) falsely depicted the circumstances of the death of Chris McCandless..so in this book, he seeks to rectify the mistakes and sets forth to invoke feelings in the reader of sorrow, sympathy (and probably for many people) rememberance of what it is/was like to be in your 20's and on a quest.   Krakauer makes good use of comparisons between events in his own life and those in the life of McCandless to create passages that write of McCandless's wanderlust and determination..Krakauer goes into detailed (and awed) description of the miles and upkeep efforts McCandless puts on his 80's-era car during his travels.  An amazing look into a tragic event.  Sold me on Krakauer as more than just a nature/uber adventurer - he's a writer.
078062582X|4.0|I went to see this film at the theatre (yes, that was me) expecting to see the latest installment of the \\"My career ..., so I will take of my clothes\\" series (other installments include \\"Embrace of the Vampire\\" and \\"Full Body Massage\\"). I was pleasantly surprised by a funny movie.<br />First off, Demi Moore is naked.  Surprisingly, I didn't find her \\"dance\\" scenes too hot.  The silicone enhancement moves like a rock statue.<br />Once you get beyond the nude Demi, you find a movie with a funny Ving Rhames and a hilarious Burt Reynolds.  This movie introduced me to Carl Hiassen, who is a hilarious author.<br />I actually recommend this movie for the humor more than the nudity.
B00003CXRP|2.0|I have a very difficult time understanding how ANYONE would think that this is a great movie!  Actually the first half isn't bad and if there had been ANY development of the plot in the second half, it could have been a good movie, possibly even a great movie!<br />What this film represents most is the tremendous lost opportunity that was suggested in the beginning......the cinematography and dialogue in the initial scenes and even those on the island were excellent at times, but the remainder of the film was a total dud.  NOTHING got developed or enhanced or explained in the second half, as though Tom Hanks and the others who directed it simply fell asleep or got bored, OR ran out of ideas.....<br />  Rating this a 2 is fair and honest, and any higher rating would do a disservice to any potential viewers.....sorry....
6305127689|4.0|although this movie, is without a doubt, the best movie ever made and is my personal favorite, it does have its flaws, just like any other movie though.  even though i wasnt old enough to remember its release into theaters, i do remember my parents buying my the VHS version when i was young and playing it until the video tape actually broke in the VCR b/c it was played so many times.  When i recently purchsed a DVD player, this movie was one of the first that i bought on the DVD format.  hooking it up to my surround sound brings the planes, aircraft carrier, and fightertown usa into my room.  some parts of the movie dont make much sense if you pay close attention and have any knowledge of this aircraft and how it is operated.  the romance parts between cruise and his woman (forget her name)  could have been left out for it didnt add much to this movie.
B000003BEV|2.0|I was very reluctant to buy this album, let alone any album by the Rolling Stones.  I still, to this day, believe that they make a wonderful greatest hits album, period.  But I bought it and immediately listened to it hoping that it would add to my collection of 1967 classics.  I experienced everything but that result.  I love Sgt. Peppers by the Beatles, Surrealistic Pillow by Jefferson Airplane, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn by Pink Floyd, Disraeli Gears by Cream, and Electric Ladyland by Hendrix, but was appaled at the music from the Rolling Stones on this album.  &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; sounds like how &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; would sound if the Beatles performed with a Blood Alcohol Concentration of .38.  &quot;Their....&quot; is a very sloppy production, very difficult to hear the voices and the stereo recording, and overall seems like a rushed episode intended to mimic the psychedelic gods: Jefferson Airplane and The Beatles.  &quot;She's like a rainbow&quot; is the only reason why this album deserves any stars at all.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|I had heard parts of the sound track and then went with my mother to go see the movie. She had already seen it before and had warned me that the first 20 minutes or so are a bit 'freaky'.<br />Well I thought it was great.  I love musical theater and because I went into the movie theater with an open mind I didn't feel the need to compare it with actual stage musical theater or with life time skilled/trained theatrical/opera singers.<br />I thought Ewan and Nicole sang pretty darn good, the new songs were very moving and the old songs were given a breath of fresh air.  <br />I hope I can get my friend to the theater to see it before it goes to video!  A normal TV screen and sound system won't do this film justice.  Just one of those flicks you MUST see on the big screen with big sound!<br />For sure unique.<br />:-)
B00003W8NM|5.0|Great! Davis Fincher packs a wallop of criteria with a riveting twist ending that will wash you out.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I don't understand any of the words. And since I love words that's a real pity (but I heard the guys of SR are working right now on the translation which is a hell of a job because of the symbolic meanings of a lot of these words - as they say). All of my best year albums have (understandable) lyrics. But the beauty of the songs on Agaetis Byrjun leave me no choice. Let me tell you, I made this my fave album even before I went to their concert in Paradiso (Amsterdam) which was a real happening. Jimmy Page could have seen that you can make beautiful guitarsounds playing with a violin bow (got you there, old cracker!). Let's say it was far better than Radiohead's performance on Pinkpop (Landgraaf).<br />Now let's go to the songs: Enter the Discovery! First track is an intro. The second track (Svefn g englar) is such mellow purity, just close your eyes and consider yourself alone floating in space surrounded by moonflowers and dreamelephants. Just a few albums are really worth 15 dollars, but this song alone comes close. Track 3 (Staralflur) can only be worse, but this one too is pure class. Maybe a little too much on the violins. Next track is another marble. Less violins, more air, really downtempo (after 5 minutes a tiny little climax starts). This is one of my favourite tracks. The next track (Ny Batteri) is a real climax one: starting very slowly, and then letting the drums in after 4.5 minutes, more horns after 6 minutes. Again one of my faves. Track 6 (Hjartad hamast) is pure trance, think Spacemen 3, this is material wich trance dj's/producers could combine with their own cheese for a real good trancetrack. Vidrar vel til loftarasa (track 7) starts where the last track left and introduces piano. Because of the piano it could wel have been an Air song, this is Space Safari then. The first five minutes are instrumental, afterwards it becomes a real songs. And again another favourite. The next two tracks are just good (and in the case of Sigur Ros that means morethan good). And the last one is an outro, a little piece of Brian Enoish ambient. Which is like child's play for these talents.   <br />What can I say? See them! Hear them! Get Sigur-Rossed! (whatever that means:)
0790729725|5.0|This is an extraordinary movie. <br />It takes an outstanding director to make something like this: the film is very long and at the same time it keeps you wishing it was even longer. The soundtrack is formidably, breathtakingly good, and the cast is exquisite.<br />And no, it does not make you want to be a gangster; it does not glamorize murder and violence, either.
0452281881|4.0|Matt Beaumont's first novel is a glorious wicked look at an advertising company run by half-wits, infantile managers, sex-crazed secretaries, and all the sort of neurotic people that I thought could only exist at where I work. :-)  It's all rather silly (fortunately the author doesn't take matters too seriously).  But like Bridget Jones's Diary, this is a story told through little snippets (e-mail messages).  And while this format is initially grating, it soon becomes familiar and rather engaging.<br />Don't expect any serious prose or intense characterizations here.  This book is made for easy reading.  And it is hilarious.  While the humour is a bit on the 'Men Behaving Badly' side and rather British-centric, I think most anyone who works in an e-mail driven company will find much to enjoy with this novel.<br />Bottom line: wonderfully silly.  But the author hits home with great humour and biting satire.  Perfect for those who take corporate life too seriously.
B00003CXDB|3.0|What Oliver Stone attempted to make - in a naive and narrow-minded way - was a critique of capitalism. Instead, he directed a film which is watched over and over again, and admired, by Capitalist Pigs like myself. What a nasty surprise to Mr Stone.<br />This DVD features a documentary - quite good and fully justifying the purchase of DVD even if you already have a video, if only to learn Oliver Stone's socialist views told in his own words. The man actually believes that people who don't work in companies should not be allowed to own them - and he actually says that! You don't often hear such a naive socialist rhetoric these days.<br />And then Douglas tells us how disappointed he is every time someone approaches him and confesses that the film was an inspiration for them to get into finance, stock market and fast-track lifestyle. Oh no. Another contender for hypocrisy prize.<br />For anyone who remembers the depiction of Blue Star airline and its oh-so-heroic, oh-so-honest trade union people as primitive, shallow and one-dimensional, it will be very interesting to see that Stone and Sheen actually put a lot of their thought and effort into it. Who knew. If they had not been trying, could this depiction have been any more lame?<br />I am pleased, in a kind of wicked way, that an attempt to attack capitalism turned out to be a collection of the most powerful quotes (\\"money never sleeps\\", \\"lunch is for wimps\\" and the ultimate \\"greed is good\\") and ideological Bible of the people whom Oliver Stone despises most. Similarly, all the self-righteous trade-union \\"honest men\\" got a nightmare of a treatment - from someone who was just trying to glorify them. With friends like these, who needs enemies - and with enemies like these, who needs friends? Capitalism has never had a better advocate than this millionaire pinko director.<br />Thanks Oliver Stone from all of us, Capitalist Pigs.
B00004W3MS|5.0|Sigur Ros is the one band that I believe a hell of a lot more recognition.  I was first turned on to them due to praises by fellow Radiohead fans.  I downloaded the song Flugufrelsarinn and then went on a crusade to find this album. <br />The moment Svefn-G-Englar was over I knew this was going to become the one album that would give a good challenge to Radiohead's OK Computer for my favorite album.  So far they are very closely tied.  It depends on my mood.<br />It is extremely hard for me to choose a favorite song off of this album.  It flows too well to just choose one piece.  The singles Svefn-G-Englar and Ny Batteri are both classics but Olsen Olsen and the rest are just as impressive.  <br />I can't wait to hear more Sigur Ros material after this!  I just wish I could find any of their singles or EPs where I live.
0894803123|4.0|We recently purchased a high-end electric ice cream maker (the Simac &quot;Gelatio Magnum&quot;) and, along with it, the Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Book; we're in love with both products! Ben and Jerry share the recipes for all of their best flavors--including chocolate chip cookie dough and Heath Bar crunch--plus tell you their own story and &quot;ice cream philosophy.&quot; It's a fun cookbook with plenty of practical tips. <br />So far we've made six or seven of the recipes, including the French Vanilla (not as rich as I'd like), Strawberry Banana (wonderful, but add an extra banana) and Orange Dream (our favorite). Their sweet cream base is extremely easy to make--it takes about 15 seconds--but if you prefer a richer, more creamy consistency, look for a cooked &quot;custard&quot;-style receipe.
B000003TAW|5.0|My brother got me into Weezer when he would play this cd in the car all the time. It finally got to where i new teh words of teh songs and would sing them in my head all day. I thought at first Weezer was to punk for me but then i slowly was pulled in to teh so attracting sound. the songs are very clever my favorite on this album are teh sweater song and buddy holly. This is a must for everyone's collection or if your not with this scene check it out at the library for sure.<br />Thank You.
6304077955|1.0|By the third violent rape sequence in this film, you kind of get the idea that the protagonist is a misogynist and psychopath and ththat the women in the movie are just waiting for him to walk all over them.  It really is just disgusting!  Now Mike Leigh has made some decent movies, a couple are quite enjoyable to watch.  But NAKED is just TRASH, with no redeeming artistic merits.  Naked, in fact, surpasses LOST IN SPACE for the worst movie I've ever seen.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Love this album.  It's been the constant in my CD player since I bought it a few weeks ago.  It really recalls the old DM- soulful, introspective, great synth and bass lines.  \\"Shine\\" and \\"Free Love\\" are two of my favorites... \\"When The Body Speaks\\" is great.  It's real classic DM.  Dave Gahan's amazing talent is so apparent on this song.  So is Martin Gore's... the way their voices blend on this song in particular, and the album overall, is pure artistry.  If you love DM, buy this album!  If you're new to DM, this will make you a fan!
B00005KHJR|5.0|This masterpiece will soon be available as a limited edition DVD. You can smell the wood coming off this movie. Your grandpa's woodburning set will make you love this movie! But this film is not only for old people. If you enjoy the smell of flowers then this movie is for you. Don't sleep on this one.
0451526384|5.0|The subject of unlikely love is one we will never grow tired of, and as long as that is true, Jane Austen is an author we will always treasure.  She always gives us such enthralling glimpses into live in nineteenth century England that we can little help but wish ourselves back to a time when love was courtly and appearances were everything.  Somehow, she knew that love went beyond her society's rules.  She knew that rank and name were not enough to silence love.  In PERSUASION, she gives us all that she gave us in Pride and Prejudice.  We shake our heads at the embarrassing families, yearn for the hero and heroine to admit their feelings to each other, and long for the man who causes trouble between the heroes to just go away.  But, this time, not only do we have the suitor who keeps the man of our heroine's dreams at a distance, we have a malicious sister.  We see Anne struggle with internal and external pressures while she deals with the seemingly outright malice of her sister, Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is mean!  She is not indifferent or aloof, but downright nasty and greedy.  Her sister's happiness is something she would rather not see until her own is firmly in place, and she seems like the type to use sabatoge to succeed.  I, for one, will never tire of reading of the ups and downs of a forbidden or unlikely love, and always feel a sense of exultation when the dashing man and striking young woman finally feel free enough to admit their feelings to one another, despite the dirty looks their pairing may draw.
B0000024LN|5.0|I picked up this album because I am a big Redman fan, and I didn't expect too much out of it.  I was wrong.  This is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard!  It is definitely the most underrated CD of all-time.  With Cd's today, they only have 1 or 2 good songs, and the rest are just trash to fill up the album.  This CD is great from beginning to finish.  I cannot recommend any tracks because every track is just as good as the next.  This style of Redman is different than in Doc's Da Name 2000 or Malpractice, and it is much better.  It seems like after this CD he lost his funk side to him.  I can't believe this CD didn't sell very much when it first came out in 1996.  This CD has funkier beats, and better lyrics than any other CD he has ever come out with.  Redman's lyrics in Muddy Waters will make you laugh and make you say wow at the same time.  This album is so good it is my favorite CD of all time along with Dr. Dre's The Chronic (The original).  The bottom line is:  BUY THIS ALBUM.  You will like it if you are a fan of Redman or not.
0582084865|5.0|&quot;Rebecca&quot; is one of the most haunting novels I have ever read.  The opening sentence alone is enough to give one the shivers: &quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.&quot;<br />The novel started as a project to see how long the author could go without naming her main character, and ends up as being a fascinating read.  Maxim de Winter is a man with secrets, and his new bride, who feels Rebecca's oppressive spirit everywhere in their new home, is an honest and brave character with whom all readeres should be able to identify with.  She is made of stronger stuff than any romance novel charcter I've ever read.<br />Rebecca herself, although her voice is rarely heard and she lives on through memories of the inhabitants of Manderley is still a force to be reckoned with.  Rebecca's loyal servant Mrs. Danvers (quite possibly the creepiest personal maid/housekeeper in literature) will make your skin crawl.<br />The book has an astonishing ending and I guarantee that anyone who picks the book up will not only be unable to put it down, but when the last page is turned, will start to reread it immediately.
B000002BBY|4.0|well, what can i say. U won't know what to expect tell u've hear it a full volume! so, what r u waiting for????
B00005LKHW|3.0|If you bought the original DVD version that came out then you pretty much already have this &quot;ultimate&quot; edition.  The deleted scenes, which there are only a handful, are the only real additions to the original disc.  Save the twenty-two dollars and use it to go see &quot;American Pie 2&quot; if you already have the original.  Don't let Universal milk you for twenty-two more dollars.  If you don't have &quot;American Pie&quot; on DVD, then definitely buy this because the extras are great, just not that different from the first DVD of the movie.
0694525499|5.0|Sometimes it takes an outsider to truly understand the inside.  Not only does British writer Neil Gaiman flex his extensive knowledge and understanding of mythology, but shows a true understanding of America and the American mind.  As a long time reader of Gaiman's (comics included), I was impressed by the maturity and depth of this work.  Gaiman has shown he is more than a genre writer.  He has truly written a great &quot;American&quot; novel.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|When I bought the album, I knew it was going to be good, and I wasn't disappointed. The lyrics touch your heart, the music is amazing, and they have voices to die for. A fabulous follow-on to 'Savage Garden'!
0553212737|4.0|True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature. <br />This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;<br />The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.<br />However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen. <br />Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read.
1577311523|5.0|I have read this book three times now and each time strikes and even deeper impact.  I have read many other books since reading Mr Tolle's Power of Now which deal with inner realization but I always return to his simple truth of Living in the Now.  After reading his book, I literally walked around for quite some time feeling a sense of complete aliveness within my body.  I began to experience who I am with a deep sense of stillness. I allowed this experience to happen to me because his simple profound understanding of slowing down the noise of our mind was presented in such an experiential manner that you immediately experience the ring of deep truth behind his words.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park stormed into the scene with their debut album Hybrid Theory and their mix of Rap/Rock makes it one of the best of the year.  Papercut, One Step Closer, With You, and especially Crawling and In The End all demonstrate the talents of the groups.  The choice to use both Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda to do vocals gives the CD all it needs to make it a great one.
B000002N2N|5.0|Ok you can only have two reasons for stopping by on this page.<br />1) Like myself you have this album and you wanted to read the reviews or 2) You do not have this and you want to see what reviewers have said.<br />If you fall under category 1 you can pass this one by.<br />If you are in category 2 then read on.<br />This is simply the greatest live album of all time. I saw the Ramones live 3 times and this album relays exactly what it was like to see them live.<br />The album builds to a cataclysmic climax.<br />Simply, if you leave this site without buying this you will miss the greatest live experience recorded of all-time bar none.<br />Gabba Gabba Hey!!
0452282152|2.0|Chevalier has painted Vermeer's world, but has forgotten to make it interesting. We enter Vermeer's world through the first-person narrative of Griet, a young sixteen-year old maid. In typical Cinderalla-like fashion, Griet is hated by Vermeer's wife and daughter, Cornelia. Griet, pious and beautiful, maintains her place in the home, gaining the attentions of the male characters.<br />Chevalier tells rather than shows, breaking the first rule of good writing. In addition, her prose is amateurish: simplistic and syntactically dull. Perhaps Chevalier should have spent less time including as many socio-historical tidbits as possible and focused on developing the characters . . . . and the plot.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana Krall is a modern wonder. The sexiness of Peggy Lee with a voice that won't let go of your ears! I only wish she sang Fever on this..someday Diana. She'll rattle your spine.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I can't believe how clean the remastered video is...as well as the 5.1 English track...It looked almost as if the film was made last year or even this year...It really blew me away... And now that I am much older, I can understand clearly the metaphysical theme Akira presents.  Although I like the theme that all life-form has the potential to use the genetically recorded knowledge gained since the beginning of creation, the storytelling and animation is even more awesome...I think representing power of knowledge as a form of psychic power opened up endless possibilities of exciting sequences.... The film definitely took good advantage of the concept to make the story entertaining as well as intellectually stimulating...<br />And this DVD....with loads of extra on the 2nd disc...well... This is the best DVD I own so far...with Ghost in the Shell in the second place....<br />Now only if Bladerunner is released at such quality and quantity as Akira....Then...I would be a very happy person to invest in DVD technology....This is a WARNNING...Do not purchase the Bladerunner DVD that is currently available...I own it, and no matter how much I like Bladerunner...I am disgusted by the DVD release...
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is the one and only version that is anything clos to the book! I loved it! Timothy Dalton was Rochester. The emotions, the almost bi-polar moments were perfect for Mr. Rochester. Granted, he was a little too pretty but his acting made up for it. The emotion he used before Jane left was great! he went from panic to sadness to anger. It was perfect! This is without a doubt, the best Jane Eyre video and I have seen all of them.
B00005BL2A|1.0|I've been a DM fan since 1989, and I can honestly say that I've never been so dissapointed by anything from them until now (I even loved SOFAD when many others fans dismissed it and didn't accept it with open arms).  I can't believe Depeche Mode have released such drivel.  'Exciter' has none of the depth or creativity that their previous albums had.  The worst songs, by far, are &quot;Sweetest Condition&quot; and &quot;Dead of Night&quot;.  I can't stand that twangy guitar on &quot;Sweetest Condition&quot; (it's not likeable in that &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; sort of way), and the vocals, lyrics, and music that accompany &quot;Dead of Night&quot; are laughable (Dave sounds like he's trying to do his best Trent Reznor impression, and fails miserably).  It says alot when Depeche Mode's best song off the album (&quot;Dream On&quot;) is so emotionless, and unimpassioned.  I hate to say it, but I think Depeche Mode are finished for good.        <br />My rating of the DM albums (1 being the best, and ten being the worst):<br />1. Some Great Reward (My Favourite) 2. Songs of Faith and Devotion and SOFAD Live 3. A Broken Frame 4. Black Celebration  5. Music For the Masses 6. Ultra 7. Construction Time Again 8. Speak &amp; Spell 9. Violator 10. Exciter (My LEAST favourite)
6301773551|5.0|I bet you all believe that Citizen Kane and Gone with the Wind and Lawrence of Arabia are overrated.
0060926317|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a college professor of comparative religions and an ordained minister in a progressive branch of Christianity. I am an admirer of Huxley's presentation of the perennial philosophy, Huston Smith's appreciation of the world's major faith traditions, and Joseph Campbell's conviction concerning the power of myth. I am a mystic by inclination. In other words, I am predisposed to take religion and spirituality seriously. It may come as some surprise, then, that I found Morgan's book nothing short of detestable. I forced myself to finish the wretched thing because I promised a former student who greatly admired it that I would.<br />The first and least of the book's problems is its utterly artless and amateurish style. To call Morgan's prose sophomoric would be to praise it far too highly. One would expect a best-selling author (or her editors) to know the difference between &quot;farther&quot; and &quot;further,&quot; &quot;lay&quot; and &quot;lie,&quot; &quot;like&quot; and &quot;as,&quot; &quot;racial&quot; and &quot;racist,&quot; and &quot;mound&quot; and &quot;monolith,&quot; to cite but a few glaring examples. An acquaintance who has seen the self-published original says that it was rife with misspellings and grammatical errors as well, making the flawed edition that I read a vast improvement. Mercy. How, I wondered, could a well-educated person write such graceless prose? Eventually I answered my own question. (See below.)<br />The second issue -- whether this is pure fiction, partial fiction, or a factual account -- has been well argued by others. The author apparently claimed from the start, in every possible public medium, that it was based on her real experiences, then hedged, then recanted, then hedged again. Even the aboriginal man named Burnum Burnum, who at first endorsed the book, later expressed his regret for having done so and severed all ties with Morgan. (It turns out that he was an urbanized man who knew little or nothing of the Outback anyway.) After reading the book, I simply cannot imagine how anyone could have even entertained the possibility that it was depicting real people and events. The whole story is utterly preposterous from the beginning. The author (or her alter-ego) is kidnapped, thinking that she is being shuttled to a ceremony to receive an award that no one has ever promised her. During a harrowing four-hour Jeep-journey into the wilderness of a foreign land at the hands of an incommunicative male stranger, she shows no real fear and raises not a word of protest, much less look for a chance of escape. Any normal (or real) person would have been scared witless and thought of survival and self-preservation. Then her clothes, her documents, and her cherished valuables are taken and thrown into a fire, and her reaction amounts to an &quot;Oh, well.&quot; On top of it all, the characters in the tribe are so two-dimensional and stereotypical (and Native American!) as to appear completely, albeit ineptly, contrived. Fact or fiction, a story must be plausible; and this one, from the get-go, is not.<br />A third issue annoyed me from the start. Morgan presents herself, vaguely, as a physician and health-care professional, which sets up a nice contrast with the medicinal folkways of her tribal captor-hosts and, of course, adds an air of scientific credibility to the entire account. She further (as opposed to &quot;farther&quot;) presents herself as a person in demand for her medical expertise, one who has &quot;lectured in Denmark, Brazil, Europe, and Sri Lanka&quot; (p. 106), apparently oblivious to the fact that Denmark is in Europe. Late in the book, however, she alludes to &quot;the American six-year healing arts programs to become an M.D., D.C., or D.O.&quot; (p. 168) I have never known either an M.D. or a D.O. who would sandwich a chiropractic degree between two real medical degrees like that, much less equate their many years of post-baccalaureate study with the high school-plus-two that is the minimum requirement for chiropractors. That led me to suspect what I later confirmed: Morgan is a retired chiropractor! (I dedicate that exclamation point to her. She appears to love them.) The fact that she cloaks that fact under the broad term &quot;physician&quot; and pretends to have real medical expertise of a scientific, clinical kind is disingenuous at best.<br />Also of interest is the fact that Morgan apparently resides, not in Kansas City, Missouri, but in nearby Lee's Summit. Now that &quot;just happens to be&quot; the world headquarters for the original and still main branch of Unity. Not coincidentally, I suspect, most of the central teachings that Morgan ascribes to her alleged aboriginal tribe -- such as &quot;Divine Oneness,&quot; &quot;universal abundance,&quot; &quot;Jesus as eldest brother,&quot; reality is perception, and death as a transition to one's &quot;highest good&quot; -- are barely veiled references to pivotal Unity principles (which, by the way, I happen to find meaningful).<br />As if it were not obvious by now, Morgan's most serious problem is her credibility. That has been so thoroughly undermined by real Aboriginal groups, scholars, and no less than the Washington Post that no thoughful, informed person could possibly believe her account to be factual, her to be truthful, or her &quot;Real People&quot; to be anything but figments of her imagination. The fact that she has nevertheless drawn such a wide and enthusiastic audience (and made millions of dollars in royalities, speaker's fees, tapes, etc.) attests that she had the kernel of a compelling idea. Too bad that she didn't see fit to couch her spiritual truth -- as indigenous and other religious peoples everywhere always have -- in myth or parable, which is to say, the vessel of honest fiction. As it stands, what might have been a useful testimonial to Oneness is tarnished beyond redemption by an author's severe and cynical lack of personal integrity. If she had a treasure to give us, she delivered it in a very earthen, but terribly leaky, vessel.
B000000NN4|5.0|Anyone who worked in a planetarium during the late 70's-early 80's used music from this album for background music (&quot;Alpha&quot; was featured prominently in the Carl Sagan miniseries &quot;Cosmos&quot;). Nucleogenesis Part 2 is the funkiest synth jazz this side of the moon.<br />If you want to start a Vangelis collection, get this and Spiral.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This album, simply put, is brilliant. Any cliched description would be vague, a waste of space. Just put on this album, really listen to it, and you'll be seduced by the vast landscape. Maybe this album will change the way music is heard . . .
B000009QO6|5.0|I've been a fiend 4 a while and just bought the danzig cd, its great! theyre all great musicians, being a drummer chuck biscuits has the best hard hitting beats that drives the music. i definately recommennd this CD
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is a welcome addition to the British rock canon and &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a masterstroke. It isn't earth-shaking; quite the opposite, actually; but it a wonderful CD to listen to when you're sick, happy, sad, sleepy, wide awake, any mood. Chris Martin has a warm voice with a wide range and he uses it to good effect on these minimal songs. You shan't regret buying this album.
B00003CXRM|3.0|To say Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey is to say the Kentucky Derby is loosely related to the chariot scene in Ben Hur.  It's Odysseus, for Cripes sake, not Ulysseus (that's the Roman name for Homer's hero)....  There are more allusions to Le Morte D'Arthur than the Odyssey....ie. the 3 in search of the unattainable--just as Galahad, Percival, and Bors searched for the Holy Grail.   Here's the key--a movie that is truly based on a myth doesn't have to advertise itself as such.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|When I first heard SG's sophomore album , Affirmation, it truly changed my outlook on the pop genre.  Darren Hayes' lyrics opened something inside me which I am truly greatful for.  His voice inspires me and really proves that pop music can be something worth listening to despite all the other garbage out there(O-Town and Spears).  There is not a bad song on this album and I believe  that it compliments their first album quite well.  This stuff is required listening for people who enjoy amazing vocal work. PLEASE GO BUY IT!!
B000002H2H|5.0|My first exposure to Metallica came from the Black Album where I listened to such songs as Nothing Else Matters and Enter Sandman.  Little did I know what I was missing.  The incredible complexity and power in this album as well as the thoughtful lyrics make this the best album I own (slightly ahead of Master of Puppets).  There are no tracks on here that aren't worth listening to. Here is my song-by-song rundown<br />1. Fight Fire With Fire- Don't let the light intro deceive you, this song is very heavy.  In a certain type of mood, this song totally hits the spot. It doesn't go on too long, just packs a good punch<br />2. Ride The Lightning- The intro is awesome and the rest of the song is good too. James's voice has a real screech to it.<br />3. For Whome The Bell Tolls- My favorite Metallica song ever, very complex, amazingly put together, pure perfection in every way<br />4. Fade To Black- excellent ballad, good intro, this is my 2nd favorite on the album<br />5. Trapped Under Ice- many would say this is a filler. I realy like this song. It may not be a classic like most everything else on here, but is definitely not a skipper<br />6. Escape- this is the worst song on here but still very quality. the refrain is excellent.  this song would be the best song on many metal albums<br />7. Creeping Death- this song has its amazing moments. The lyrics are not that good, but the guitars make up for it. this is just good stuff<br />8. The Call of the Ktulu- very good instrumental, does not get boring. this song tells a story. i really admire the guys for pulling this off. i really enjoy this song.  <br />Bottom line. get this album. it is the best rock/metal ever. also get Master of Puppets- you can't go wrong with either.  Stay away from the Black Album and the Loads. They are very second rate.

0783240503|1.0|All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie.
B000059QYB|4.0|As an excellent overview of Billy Idol's stellar career featuring songs from all his albums,this compilation reminds us about how good music was in the eighties,and why in certain respects that decade remains unsurpassed in terms of creativity.One also longs for the excellent partnership between Idol and Steve Stevens,the force behind monster albums such as 1983's 'Rebel Yell'.
B00003CY5K|5.0|I loved this movie! It was great! ... We are always hearing about blonde jokes directed toward us, but in this movie the girl shows them all just how smart a blonde valley girl can be. Anyone who loves to see the little guy become the superstar needs to see this movie. Also all blondes need to see this movie because believe me this movie will instantly life your spirits and you will be able to forever shrug off all blonde insults.
B000002HEP|5.0|Boy oh boy did I make a good decision, I passed up the chance to buy Pantera's new one for Sky Valley by Kyuss. I'd never actually heard Kyuss's music, but I'd heard a great deal about them. So I gave it a try, and damn this one is right there with TooL(my fav band). Kyuss has a unique sound and they're music is like nothing you'll ever hear. From Gardenia to Whitewater this is a great musical journey. The music really touches your soul. Though it would be hard to pick a favorite song I'd have to say Space Cadet is the standout track of the entire album. It really takes you away, whenever I listen to it (or the album in general) it's like I'm in another world.It's said the best music is the music you can fall asleep to well here it is. I strongly recomend you listen to this album while reading Tolkien for that mystical journey feel and the not knowing what to expect sort of feeling, because this album is full of suprises. Once you've heard Gardenia(opening song) you'll be in awe. Kyuss had the talent and the balls to do something different and thought they never made it big, they will forever be remembered by those who have heard they're music. Once you've heard the music you'll be hooked and everything else (aside from TooL, soungarden and a few other metal bands)namely rapcore or numetal whatever you want to label that ..., will seem like well... Take my advice buy this album, you'll be doing yourself a favor.
B00002E233|1.0|Many have already knocked Deep Blue Sea for being unrealistic, so I won't focus on that here. We're going to assume that it is entirely logical that scientists would use sharks to cure Alzheimer's.<br />I have two major problems with Deep Blue Sea. 1) The shark effects are incredibly bad, and 2) Renny Harlin. If the shark effects had been sweet, I might be more forgiving... but they aren't, so I won't.<br />My main problem with the effects is that the sharks actually change size, or &quot;mass&quot;. I don't think this effect is intended, as the phenomenon is never addressed by the characters. There are several instances where I thought the human cast would be safe having just entered a small corridor or passed through a small doorway... &quot;just when you thought it was safe to depend on the laws of physical matter!&quot; Yep, here come the sharks. On the other hand, the plot also didn't address the fact that the sharks MIGHT have built some quantum space-altering machine when they weren't eating people.<br />I'll leave my effects quibbles at that and move on to the other major element that holds this movie back: Renny. I loved Long Kiss Goodnight, but I DIDN'T love Die Hard 2, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger or Driven (and -- for the record -- I never actually saw Driven). There was some nice material to work with here, but it's often too gory, too hokey, or too plain stupid to work in the movie's favor.<br />The DVD extras were very nice and relatively plentiful. &quot;A&quot; for effort on those special features, but it isn't anything you can't see on PBS shark specials... except maybe for REAL sharks.<br />If you think you might like Deep Blue Sea, I would recommend seeing Jaws or Lake Placid instead (that Bill Pullman is such a hoot!).
B00005B36H|5.0|I got this album this first day it came out. After the first listem i really didn't know what know what to think. After a few listens I was blown away..by the music. Now the lyrics ... The past two albums (including the EP Opeiate) had great lyrics (not to say this one doesn't, if you've heard these albums before you'd know what I meant). For now this album is completly beyond me, its' really something else. I quite honestly, have never heard anything like it. I like TooL beacause the songs are all open for interpretation and that's exactly what songs are all about. They mean whatever you them want to mean.The instrumentals are incredible, how could anyone in they're right mind not like them?! I'm still trying to grasp the full meaning of these songs, and what they mean to me. Tool's albums will bring out a side of you that you never thought existed. This album is definetly a journey into the unexpected and definetly worth buying. I also recomend Kyuss's Sky Valley and I 've recently discovered a new underground band : Dredg ...
6305903182|5.0|A friend and I went to the theater to watch this movie. And to my suprise, Courtney Cox has lost so much weight. What is that all about? &quot;Gale Weathers&quot; is my favorite character in all three movies, but why does Courtney look so sick? I can't believe the pressure that producers and directors put on actresses these days. People in Fairyland in need to loosen up and let the actresses take a bite of a doughnut sometime. Regardless, Scream 3 is the best!
B000002H33|5.0|One of the best metal albums of all time, Master of Puppets is the album that would best define the genre. After releasing Ride the Lightning, Metallica decided to team up with Flemming Rasmusen yet again to produce Master, and quite litteraly took over the world. This is a metal fan's dream come true, I mean this album opens up with Battery : a thrash classic that begins with a beautiful classic guitar intro. Then onto the title track, an eight minute long epic filled with enough solos and crunshing guitar work to put a permanent smile on any metal heand's face. My favorite song off here is Sanitarium, wich tells the sad tale of metal patients who are locked up in cells rather than treated or helped. The only breather you get on this album, to soothe the pounding in your head is track 7 : Orion, an instrumental that stands the test of time as beeing one of the most incredible pieces of music ever written. This song was played at Cliff Burton's funeral, after he died in a car accident. The song brings tears to my eyes whenever I hear it. There really is no bad track to be found on this work of art, and believe me you get a great record that you will enjoy till the end of your days. You don't have to love metal to love this album, though it would help if you are into heavy music (I don't mean Limp Bizkit). This is the best album to buy if your new to Metallica, great introduction to a band that changed the face of heavy music. (RIP CLIFF!)
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I watched the movie only to discover how much more creative and delightful Moulin Rouge! can get when juxtaposed with the 1954 version (I am not saying that the old one is lousy, in fact it's more poignant). And I must say music has played a critical role in the movie's soaring success. Being a great fan of David Foster, I just love the soundtrack that he has co-produced, with stupendously ingenious writers and coordinators. The movie just came alive with each and every single note that Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman (!!!), &quot;Harry Zidler&quot; and more sing! All these showcased in a gem --&gt; The soundtrack of course. My personal favorites are Lady Marmalade, Your Song, Elephant Medley (u should hear how each song flows into another), Come What May (Buy the single which has the Film Version! U can find it in Amazon too!) and Sparkling Diamonds. The only 2 setbacks of this soundtrack are it doesn't sound as majestic as the movie's play and the producers forgot to include the better songs like Spectacular Spectacular and Like A Virgin (Hilarious, tomfoolery!). Other than that, it's quite a good buy... MR/ is my favorite movie after aeons of stagnation at Titanic and Meet The Parents... Phew* Thanks Baz and David for such a wonderful combustion of ideas. BUY IT NOW!
B000002H2H|5.0|Before the Balck Album, before ...And Justice for All, before Mster, there was Ride the Lightning a dark album filled with apocolyptic visions and haunting scenes of death. Dave Mustaine who was ousted from the band prior to this record's release wrote two of the songs on this one : the title track and Call of the Ktulu. You'll know right away if your into this album by the opening minutes of the classic Fight Fire with Fire, by that time I was hooked. Metallica really matured between Kill 'Em all and Ride the Lightning not just lyric wise but musically. They dared to write an acoustic tune : Fade to Black that still freezes my blood after all these years. The album also contains the great For whom the Bell Tolls, a song wich alot of bands have covered but have never really matched in pure intensity. Metallica clearly wouldn't limit themselves to being juts another thrash metal band and quickly broke that label with this album, more mature yet just as heavy as they're debut. This was a deep breath before they unleashed a monster upon the world...
6304493681|5.0|The latest evolution of anime,  a landmark achievement in the genre, nuff' said.
6305399212|5.0|After Alien I really wasn't sure I'd like this follow up. Besides rarely does a sequel live up to it's predecesor (Star Wars did but that's another story). This has got to be the scariest movie I've ever seen. The setting is perfect, and the fact that you don't know who's going to die next has you sitting on the edge of your seat. This movie is not about gore at all, it has a great story line and some great actors. The marines, for example Hudson has a great sense of humour and seems unafraid of anything until he sees the Aliens. There is a tremendous character growth to all those who come face to face with the Aliens and it really shows in the movie. Even the android Bishop (gotta love that knife thing he did to Drake and Hudson) will have you laughing. My favorite character has got to be Hicks, calm under pressure, brave, keeps his head. Aliens was one of the best trilogies ever (why did they have to make Resurection?!) and this could very well be the best movie ever made too. Get out there and rent it this instant you won't regret it.
0385335482|2.0|I completely agree with the few others who said the book doesn't begin to get interesting until the final chapters, then ends too abruptly. I've also read Bridget Jones Diary and this book is not in the same league, as far as writing caliber and humor are concerned. The majority of the book is focused on the main character trying to control her wild spending habits, with little else to stimulate readers. After the rationalization of approximately her 50th purchase, this tends to get a little tedious. This book might be entertaining for those who want a light summer read and excessive detail on the main character's shopping purchases, but there is no extensive character development and no wickedly funny humor, as found in BJD. I'm surprised to find this book comes so highly recommended.
B000000993|5.0|The three albums that TooL have released(excluding the ep opiate) can be clasified in this order : AENIMA the saddest one, LATERALUS the change in creativity, Opaite the aggresive Ep and finally Undertow the darkest of them all.  That little noise you hear in the background right when you hit the play button, before the track Intolereance kicks off is a sure sign of things to come.  Forget about the songs for a moment, just look at the art, Mayanrd James Keenan quoted :&quot;It's like something very ugly and hard to look at, yet you look anyway&quot;, if that's not giving away too much!  Onto the songs, the gems on this album are numerous : 4 degrees, the title track, Prison Sex, Bottom(great song, just listen to those drums at the end) and Flood.  This was my favorite TooL album in the begining but after listening to AENIMA again, I guess this one is a close second.  The lyrics on this one are outstanding, Maynard is a true poet, none can write as well as him let alone sing, Mayanrd's voice is the best in rock.  The album that got TooL noticed is still a masterpiece, and Tool though popular as they may be, are indeed themselves way ahead of they're time.
6305014140|2.0|I heard so many things about this being one of the best animes ever created, and I HAD to see it, and it was SO great. And I was warned against the sex and violence, neither of which I'm squeamish about--and I'm a HUGE anime fan, I rarely find an anime I dislike--but I really didn't enjoy Ninja Scroll. I was excpecting something great and found something mediocre. Yeah, it was okay to watch once, and I guess we all have to do it, but it's not something that I'll watch over and over and over again like Utena. In a word, it was dissapointing. The villans were creepy, yes, Jubei kicked butt, yes, but the yoda dude made it seem cliche, and I always dislike one dimensional villans. I dunno. It wasn't horrible, but I could direct you to lots better anime.
B00000DI2T|3.0|I like Bernstein's Mahler very much, but find the freshness of the original Sony set much more palatable. Other than a few places in #5, the ensemble is fantastic (...the NY Phil of that time was a phenomenon of an orchestra and that Sony set reflects that). If there were no Sony set, this would probably be a 4 or 5 star set, because it does boast many first rate performances, including a 1 and 5 that are superior to the Sony set. But the Sony set offers better performances (to a greater or lesser degree) for the rest, including what perhap the finest 3 and 7 anywhere. The sound on the Sony set is fine throughout, not modern sound but very clear and lifelike (and better than the New York recordings in the DG set - 2, 3, and 7).<br />So buy the Sony set, #5 from this set, and the newly remastered Das Lied with Fischer-Dieskau and Bernstein on Decca, and you will have all the best of Lenny's Bernstein... rather than spending considerably more for less with this set.
B000056K04|2.0|First and foremost comparing &quot;Everyday&quot; to the Lillywhite Sessions is futile.  Even though the Lillywhite Sessions are not as much of a departure for DMB as the Everyday songs they display far more depth of instrumentation and lyrical subject matter.  I find it hard to believe that Dave has become so shallow over the years that every song on Everyday has to be some boring rehash about love, especially when songs from the Lillywhite Sessions like Grey Street deal with such weighty issues as spousal abuse and others are so obviously about alcoholism.  <br />Everyday may be a greater leap in some respects (sonically) but, overall the group dynamic of the Dave Matthews Band is completely tossed in favor of Glen Ballard's slick production quality.  We have to wait until the fourth song on the disc before we even get a decent sax solo, where as the Lillywhite Sessions are ripe with evenly mixed instruments one on top of the other, like a band should sound.  Everyday could have been recorded just as easily with a group of studio musicians instead of making a great band take a hiatus in favor of some stale material.<br />And the songs on Everyday are just that, songs that start off as a departure, a reinvention of a great band - introducing electric guitar riffs - but eventually every song on Everyday dissolves into melodramatic lovey, dovey whining than a well thought out song with a life of its own.  Dave has sung about love a hundred different ways and each song has sounded original and interesting.  Here they are no more than stale sentiments thath we've heard over and over in pop music.<br />Which brings me to the point.  DMB is not a pop band.  They are not the Backstreet Boys or NSYNC.  The cover photo on Everyday seems to be the most obvious proof that something fishy is going on here, almost as though a great group of musicians have decided to dress up like rock stars for a day.  The sad thing is that the Lillywhite Sessions will see their release one day, the only question is will the mainstream audience that Everyday was supposed to reel in stick around to hear these great songs?  My guess is probably not.
B000003Z4C|5.0|Let Love In is an absolute masterpiece. Every Nick Cave album ranks from very good to great, but this is surely one of his very best. There is no weak track. With a stellar musical effort from Cave and The Bad Seeds, Let Love in has solid backing for Cave's ever-excellent lyrics. Though several masterpieces of gothic imagery abound (\\"Red Right Hand,\\" one of Cave's best songs; the ferocious and relentless \\"Jangling Jack\\"; and the mourning, self-loathing \\"Lay Me Low\\"), this album mostly focuses on love. The two-part \\"Do You Love Me?\\" and \\"Nobody's Baby Now\\" are excellent slower tempo songs, while tracks like \\"Loverman\\" the band's seemingly out of control side. I was introduced to Cave, as I'm sure many were, by Metallica's cover of this song. One can see why they chose it; it is masterly. The (near) title track is great, too, and features Cave's trademark malicious lyrics. \\"Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore\\" and \\"Thirsty Dog\\" are also excellent  and not to be left unmentioned -- more melancholy masterpieces of self-loathing. As Cave sings in the latter, \\"some things just cannot be forgiven.\\" Not buying this album, for one.
B00005N83M|5.0|I first bought this album without the extra track and it's worth every cent, there are so many upbeat tunes..now that it contains the remix of I'm Real, it's even better.  I wish they would have put the remix on the CD in the first place because it's a really great song.  Buy this version instead of the version that does not have the I'm Real remix on it..you'll love it!
B000001ESJ|4.0|I first got turned on to Rush by watching a &quot;Don Kirshner's Rock Concert&quot; one night, back in 1974 or so.   I remember them doing &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, and &quot;Working Man&quot;, so it must have been early in their career.  I recall being completely blown away by the high pitched eagle-screech of Geddy, combined with that electrical charge of Alex's guitars, not to mention the incessant and relentless beat provided by &quot;the professor&quot;, Mr. Peart on the monster drum kit. <br />I was particularly pleased, because this was the first band that was truly &quot;my&quot; discovery, having been turned on to all the fat jams by the likes of the Allman Brothers, Zeppelin, Stones, etc. by my older brother.  This meant a lot to me, having a band that &quot;I&quot; discovered, and Rush still hold a place in my heart and mind.  <br />When I got into 9th grade, my friend Harter Paterson asked me if I'd heard of the band, &quot;RUSH&quot;.  Of course, I said, knowingly.  I even managed to scrounge up enough cash to pick up their debut album on 8-track.  &quot;Well then, listen to this&quot;, he said, packing a bowl.  Well, let me tell you, I was not prepared for the onslaught of music that was about to assault my ears.  The freshness of that opening title track, &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot; still rings clear and bright to this day.  It remains one of my favorite releases by the seminal prog-rock band out of Canada.  <br />The album just comes on like gangbusters.  Track 2, the epic 'Xanadu', contains the Samuel Coolidge on Codeine-inspired lyrics, which we had been studying in Literature class just that week!  Of course, everyone likes 'Closer to the Heart', with its obvious thoughtful lyric, it comes off sort of like a kids song.  'Madrigal' usually gets short shrift, but I like this one for its light, easy and relaxed feel. <br />The middle breakdown in &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; however, contains one of the funkiest breaks in all of Rushdom.  This istruly a moment when Geddy, Neil and Alex are &quot;gettin' jiggy wid it&quot;.  Check it out. The endpiece, &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; alas, does not wear well with time.  It's interesting concept, and spooky, ethereal atmosphere provide some good down time, but in the end, it disappoints, particularly the vocals.  Not to worry, for the boys more than make up for it on the follow up release, Hemispheres, which takes the story line further than we ever thought possible.  But more on that in another review.<br />In short, if you like RUSH, you really owe it to yourself to go back and check this one out.  If only for a quick review of the funky breakdown on 'Cinderella Man', or a thorough and complete trip down memory lane, &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot; is certainly worth listening to it again, for the first time.<br />~Lazarus 8-1-01
B00004U8JU|5.0|Clearly I is fast more impressive than II and III. II has no plot and III is far too short and dark on the screen. Only JP-I can really offer you breath-taking scenes. And if u r a dinosaur lovers, probably you also want to check these out:<br />&quot;When Dinosaurs Roamed America&quot;<br />&quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;<br />As educational as they are, they may have even more plot than Jurassic Park II in my view.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|i bought this on video, i didnt realise it was going to be released on dvd, i wish i`d known as id rather have it on dvd. it contains lots of really cool videos throughout alice in chains`s career. I wish this band was still together id give anything to see them live!! anyone who likes the seatle music scene buy this dvd your in for a real treat!!
B000002HD5|5.0|In the large landscape of angst-driven rock and roll this album rose above the rest during the early 90s. I probably can't say anything that hasn't been said in other reviews but I will say that I am a fan of hip hop, country, rock and pop music and if I had to live with one album for the rest of my life it would be Gentlemen. It ranks on another level and draws no comparison to anything I can think of.  Enjoy.
006092988X|5.0|I thought that this book was one of the best I've ever read. I personally don't like reading that much, but I found that I just couldn't put the book down. I loved it. Anyone who doesn't read this book is missing out and anyone who didn't like it is crazy.
0783246641|3.0|I just want to let people know that Mary Harron, the director, does her best not to show graphic content in this movie. Maybe the unedited version is different but the movie I saw never showed private parts, wounds, or even bared ... if I can recall correctly. There were plenty of scenes where other directors would have showed it all. I just wanted to let you know that it is better taste than you may expect. They do however show Christian Bale's ... twice, which is in any case one more time than they should've. Blame it on the female director.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I was fully absorbed with this mini-series when it first came out on Masterpiece Theater in the '80s.  I wish the VHS tape included the Alistair Cooke commentary before each chapter. It really added something.<br />This production will always be in the shadow of the later A&amp;E series, but there is nothing really wrong with that.  The A&amp;E effort is also great, but not everyone can look past the comparative budgets to see that little extra theater magic that this cast and director wields.  Take the special scene where Darcy delivers his letter to Elizabeth; she reads it while he stalks off across the meadow.  When she is done, he is gone.  Not one director in a thousand could have done that in just the right way.<br />Enjoy.  I wish this were available on DVD.
0452281881|5.0|Normally I would be allergic to a self-absorbed expose' of the advertising industry, but this story, rendered solely through office e-mail messages, is astonishing and hilarious. Moreover, I'm inspired to upgrade my own pedestrian e-pistles to the next creative level. May even throw in some cheeky Brit-icisms.
B00000JG41|3.0|After my history and english teacher recommended Mr. Bungle, I went out and bought this album. Little did I know how wacky it would become. I usually chill or putter while listening to music. Mr. Bungle doesn't allow for that. This CD is EXTREMELY difficult to listen to, because every thirty seconds, you're listening to a completely different type of song than you were listening to before. Take &quot;Goodbye Sober Day,&quot; for example. It goes from swing to latin to noise to some weird monk chant to death metal back to swing in only four and a half minutes. That's way too much change in a song for me to be able to relax listening to it. I'm sorry, but this album is way too confusing.<br />I will give Mr. Bungle credit for one thing: they have broad influences. Maybe, they need to learn how to work with those influences.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I saw this movie the first night it hit the theatres and absolutely loved it.  My date and I were so im love with this movie that we immediately went out and bought the soundtrack and saw it another 6 times.  I thought that all of the effect were stupendous, and that all of the arrangements of old songs were awesome!!  The movie never lets down.  After a slow intro it picks up speed and holds the intensity the during the whole show!  I especially loved the duets with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  They were so awesome, and those two were meant to perform together.  I definately recommend this movie for anyone that loves musicals and love stories.  Wonderful intensity, and great effects will take your breath away, along with touch your heart!  If you don't like sad endings then I would recommend not watching the end, but otherwise it's a great moive!
0385493622|5.0|There is enough said in the above 140+ reviews. This is a fabulous book on the history of Mathematics and the FERMAT! I have a new found respect for number theory after I read this book. This book is effortlessly readable.

B00003CXRP|4.0|After reading a few negative reviews of this film, I became convinced that some people need help in figuring out certain things, like BEING STUCK ON A DESERTED ISLAND FOR FOUR YEARS IS SUPPOSED TO BE LONG, MEANDERING, AND IT JUST PLAIN ....!  Anyway, I quite liked \\"Cast Away\\", despite a slightly slow third act.  Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee who happens to get stuck on an island, all by himself and with barely anything to survive with.  What surprises me about the film is it's usage of elements such as a musical score (virtually nonexistent for 2/3 of the film), sound effects (the \\"score\\" for most of the film), and even photography that have to explain a lot in a film like this.  Even though it is a good film with some good performances, it is marred by a slow third act, but is definitely a commendable effort.  The DVD boasts a few documentaries on the island itself, survival techniques, and one on Wilson, the volleyball.  It also includes a 45-minute interview with Tom Hanks on not just \\"Cast Away\\", but on some of his previous efforts (including the upcoming HBO miniseries \\"Band of Brothers\\").  Plus, there's some visual effect sequences broken down for your amusement, and the trailers, TV ads, and a nicely hidden Easter Egg that may answer one of the movie's more intruging questions.  It's a nice presentation for a good (but not great) movie.
0440224764|5.0|I normally don't read books about lawyers....  But a friend of mine recommended this one. What a page turner. Couldn't stop reading. The story is intense and at time unbelievable.<br />This was my introduction to Grisham!
B00005K3LW|4.0|John McClane (Bruce Willis) has had better days.  His family is estranged from him, he's coming out of a hangover (with migraine to boot), has a madman (Jeremy Irons) intent on driving him nuts under the threat of destroying New York, and he also has a unwilling civilian (Samuel L. Jackson) who must be a participant in this insane game.  If things couldn't get any worse, they do.  &quot;Die Hard With A Vengeance&quot; manages to be quite a change of pace from the two previous &quot;Die Hard&quot; films.  The film moves at a fast pace for it's first two-thirds, but eventually starts to sputter to the finish line.  It's a solid action movie (despite some rather implausible situations and solutions) and seems to cap off the series nicely.  The Special Edition DVD boasts a commentary with returning director John McTiernan and screenwriter John Hensleigh (who explains the true origins of &quot;Die Hard 3&quot;), plus behind-the-scenes specials and documentaries, a alternate ending (rather dark, but interesting to see what could have been), trailers, and TV ads (look for the gag reel hidden in the 2nd disc's menu).  A solid Special Edition for this seemingly last chapter in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series.
0449227421|4.0|I have read quite a few book by Follett. He is a good story teller. This is another good story. The plot has several twists and at times becomes predictable, but it is still a good read.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is one of those action films that actually deserved to be called a modern classic.  In the film, Bruce Willis (currently the brooding lead of such films as &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) is a smart-mouthed New York cop who visits Los Angeles to attend a Christmas party at a building where his wife is working.  &quot;Terrorists&quot; arrive to spoil the preceedings, leaving Willis alone, exhausted, barefoot, and the only one who can stop them.  Despite it's numerous and carbon-copy immitators, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a great action epic, and it's displayed quite nicely in this new 5-star DVD release.  First off, you get two audio commentaries: one with director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia explaining the difficulties of starting a movie that DIDN'T have a ending set in stone and filming in a studio-owned building, and a second one with visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund explaining some technical aspects of the film and the secret behind Bruce Willis' &quot;barefoot&quot; performance.  A text commentary (like the text commentary on &quot;The Abyss&quot; DVD) is also available where the film is analyzed through numerous interviews with the actors, producers, and film critics.  On the second disc, there's a good amount of stuff to keep you busy.  There's a deleted scene (also on the first disc) and some outtakes, trailers, TV ads, articles on the film, the script (NOT just in DVD-ROM form), and a slick little treat called &quot;The Cutting Room&quot;.  Here, you can see how elements work in some of the big scenes in this film by either changing takes or playing with the sound.  Also, for you people confused with the difference between widescreen and fullscreen, you get a nice demonstration piece to show you the difference.  All in all, if you like the film, this is a definite keeper for your DVD collection.

B000002H97|4.0|In my review of And Justice For All I said that it was the beggining of the end.  Well, they continue that end with Load, but for now they manage to climb back up for a little while, but not for long, and not nearly as high as they were.  I have always liked to think of this album as what AJFA would have been if you could actually hear the base guitar and the production wasn't so muddled.  The songs here are not as complex as on AJFA, which is what I hated about that album.  It detracted from the music and turned it into a \\"hey look how technical we are!\\"  With this album they return to their original purpose: MUSIC!  It's hard to believe that it's still Metallica, however.  With the opening to Enter Sandman, you know you're in for something different.  Gone is the thrash. Gone is the grunge.  And gone is the Jaymz Hettfield that yells instead of sings.  He actually has a good singing voice.  Wow!  Really?  Who woulda thunk it?  Listening to this album is both extremely disappointing, and at the same time extremely entertaining.  The band that deserved the name METALLICA is dead.  In it's place is a band that can still entertain, though what their rival Megadeth was doing at the same time was FAR superior, but that's another story.  Here's the breakdown:<br />1. Enter Sandman - it's about being afraid of the dark and the monsters under the bed, in the closet, and in your head.  The music is soft, but perfect anyway.<br />2. Sad But True - (That's Metallica nowadays! Ha ha ha!) it's about the Devil's temptation.  It's harder, and sounds like AJFA, but cleaner and more melodic.<br />3. Holier than Thou - no they didn't forget how to thrash, they just wanted to try some other things.  This is back to the semi-roots for a while.  It's about arrogance, and is quite arrogant in itself.<br />4. The Unforgiven - it's about an old man who has had an unfair life.  It's not hard at all.  NOT AT ALL!  Guess what?  It's still good!  LOVE that spanish guitar!<br />5. Wherever I May Roam - it's about being a wandering vagabond.  Good song.  The music is like that of Sad But True.<br />6. Don't Tread On Me! - it's about the self-praise that america thinks it deserves.  Same kind of music as SBT and WIMR.  If you've seen the play West Side Story, you'd recognize the opening riff.  <br />7. Through the Never - it's about the vastness of space and the imagination.  Good hard and loud!  Like AJFA, but cleaner and more melodic.<br />8. Nothing Else Matters - if you went back to 1983 and pulled the average metalhead Metallica fans into this time and made them listen to this song, they'd puke their guts!!  It's so lullaby soft, and pretty.  This is an all out Monster Ballad!!  It's also the first song I learned to play on the guitar.  This song is about not letting anybody or anything get in the way of what you love.  The music is very soft, but guess what?  It's good too!  Really!  It is!<br />9. Of Wolf and Man - All right!  Metallica goes Goth!!  Why Goth?  Because it's about Werewolves, that's why!  Okay, so maybe it isn't Dead Can Dance or Lycia, but the subject matter is gothic nonetheless.  Werewolves are used as a metaphor for the wild instinct inside.  The music?  It's hard and fast, just the way it's supposed to be! \\"In wildness is the preservation of the world, so seek the wolf inside thyself!\\"  Ever read Robert Jordan?  It's also about a character in The Wheel of Time.  Excellent material, those books.<br />10. The God That Failed - When I was really religious, I hated this song!  It's complete and utter blasphemy!  Never in my life had I heard a more scathing redicule of Jesus Christ!  That probably sounds awesome to half of you, so hear you go!  Enjoy!  As for me, now, I think this song is actually very well written.  The music is pretty good, though now that I'm not offended by it anymore, I see another problem with it.  Its logic is flawed!  To see why, read the end of this review.<br />11. My Friend In Misery - it's about someone who makes his own problems.  The problem with the SONG is that it's bad.  It should have been on AJFA because it has that record's typical problem of: THE (SEMI)SINGING CLASHES WITH THE MELODY OF THE MUSIC!  Come on people!  Just because it has pounding drums or screaming guitars doesn't make it music!  I can't even began to explain how annoying this is.  I can't listen to this song anymore, I just can't!  As for that music: it's depressing.  It's like Unforgiven without the quality.<br />12. The Struggle Within - they must've wanted to end with something hard, and they did.  This is along the lines of HTT and TTN in terms of music.  It's about kind of the same thing as the last song, which I won't even mention by name, only it does it way better, like everything else.<br />So there you have it!  This record takes everything that made Metallica so badass and tosses it out the window, but what it does in place of that is just as good, in a way.  Savor it while it lasts, because once the last note of Struggle Within is ringing in your ears, you know that Metallica has passed.  Long live thrash, long live intelligent song content, and long live Cliff Burton!<br />Here's why the logic of TGTF is flawed: They say He failed because He was killed on the cross like the common Roman criminals.  \\"Healing hand held back by a deepened nail!\\"  By that they must mean that God is dead and all that crap, but guess what?  If you ask any Christian in the WORLD, he will say that when Jesus died it was only the beginning.  OOOHHHH!  It's like saying weed is bad because it gets you high.  Okay, whatever guys!
0767812778|2.0|I have been viewing this film every few years since it first came out. I figured my initial boredom with the interminal sand scenes was my due to my youth and inexperience; but I can now honestly say: I don't like this movie. It just dra-a-a-ags. And I have quite a tolerance for slowly-paced movies. I like Peter O'Toole and really like Omar Sharif. So there you go. I honestly don't understand what the big &quot;thang&quot; is about this movie. <br />I heard that this movie took forever to film and that Peter O'Toole went through all kinds of identity problems while filming it. Those facts are more captivating to me than this long piece of work. I guess I just don't get it.
0887307280|5.0|I think this is an excellent book.  It has philosophical depth as well as fairly detailed how-to coverage.  It covers the people side of life and business as well as the systems side - how to set up the various systems of any operation to make the operation work.  It puts life first, business second: it helps us make our business or career a building block of our life, not the reverse.  The reviewer who only read the first half of the book missed the best parts: HOW TO DO what it takes to get your business to support your life aims and needs and the life aims and needs of your employees, customers, and suppliers.  Getting Gerber's philosophy or viewpoint is half the learning; learning how one can do it is the other half.  Gerber gives us both. This book touches the essence of quality management. I am a business professor and I will recommend it to my students.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I am a huge Travis fan, and am very pleased to that they were able to meld the buoyant Good Feeling and the more somber Man Who into a solid piece of work. Expectations were high...Would Travis follow the Radiohead route and become more esoteric? Thankfully they didn't..As much as I love Radiohead, I never understood the comparisons anyway. Other Than Fran's voice these folks have a sound all their own. Well call me crazy but maybe REM (the new REM). Travis is to the banjo what REM is to the mandolin. The Invisible band has everything from the upbeat, &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;You don't know how it feels&quot; (excellent bonus track) to the more mellow Humpty Dumpty Love Song and Dear Diary. My favorite track if I had to choose would be Afterglow..Fran's voice is excellent and the guitar arrangement is simple but very beautiful. Soo this concludes my first ever review. Oh and go buy it...This is not a marketing ploy, just pure honesty.
B00004YW6I|5.0|...for your best album. I love PJ's work and my favourite album to date had been &quot;Dry&quot;. Until the moment I bought and listened to &quot;Stories...&quot;. I can't be very objective about PJ since she's my favourite female singer. What I can say about her is that I've always felt, when listening to her, that I was listening to somebody very close to me, a friend or sister. I guess this kind of confidence has to do with the intensity of her singing and of her lyrics. And the reason why I consider  &quot;Stories...&quot; her best album is very simple: it has the best songs she ever wrote. Seems like she's found the right balance in her songwritting, which makes her songs more accesible without loosing her natural, intense edge. My selected ones (though I find each and every song great) are: One line, This mess we are in, You said something, Big exit and Horses in my dreams.

B00004XQ83|5.0|As soon as I started watching the movie I knew that I had to have the soundtrack. Although I'm not very familiar with all the musicians on this CD, I can't think of a better way to be introduced to good ol' American roots music. This masterpiece belongs in every music lover's collection.
B0000032LS|5.0|Theres a reason this movie has a cult built around it: The music ( well the plot too but mostly the music) because its AWESOME!!  Buy this now.  Its like dirty showtunes! I have listened to Touch Me 25 times in the last hour 'nuff said.
B000006TRV|5.0|I have been a Wall fan almost my whole life.  I grew up watching the movie.  Now I finally own the CD.  At first I made the mistake of purchasing the 'Out of Phase' ripoff version that is sold with the 'Pink Floyd' name on it.  Beware of that version because it's not Floyd.  Fortunately for me the CD store let me exchange for the real one and I am just loving it.  Don't be set back by the high price tag.  There's a reason an album that's been out for twenty years still sells for $35.
B0000024UX|5.0|Bridge Over Troubled Water is a great album you can listen from beginning to end easily.  With Garfunkal's angelic voice and Paul Simon's unique writing style make it one of the best albums of all time.  The song Keep the Customer Satisfied is one of my alltime favorites as well as the many other classic songs. I highly recomend it and if you like it you would also really like Bookends.
0790729385|5.0|... the scariest movie ever made(in my opinion).But i loved it it's so good. The story revolves around a normal girl who starts acting a little weird.If u love scary movies like me this is for you.This refers to the vhs adition.
0792156684|5.0|As I write this brief review, it is four years since &quot;Titanic&quot; came out, and there have been many Big Movies since then.  Now that the hype has died down, it's time for a calm assessment of James Cameron's film. <br />It really is a classic, comparable--as the Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon said--to &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot;  Indeed, there are significant parallels between the two.  The most visually emotional scene in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was the receding wide-angle camera shot of the dead and wounded soldiers.  In &quot;Titanic,&quot; it is the unforgettable shot, not much above eye-level, of the dead victims of hyperthermia, their heads bobbing in the cold Atlantic.  Images like these become icons in one's personal memory--that with the beauty and grandeur of this world there are stark images of mass death to remind us of human follies like civil wars or ships that cut back on safety features or lifeboats.  To his great credit, Director Cameron did not play &quot;Can you top this?&quot; with &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; he played &quot;Can I match this and do it in a different way?&quot;  But he shows that he is a student of many other movies.  Reviewers have cited the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; aspects of the romantic story, but I don't know if anyone has mentioned Cameron's considerable borrowing from that great Charles Boyer-Jean Arthur film of 1937, &quot;History is Made at Night.&quot;  No matter; you can see and enjoy both films without feeling that either detracts from the other.  A true &quot;homage&quot; can be like that.<br />     Many viewers might say that &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; are epic love stories, and they of course are right, but I see the films as epics with love stories attached. Even within the love stories themselves, they are less about romance than they are about turning points in the lives of the heroines.  It was not Clark Gable that shaked Janet Leigh out of her Southern complacency; it was the civil war.  Similarly, it was the peril of a sinking ship that sent Kate Winslet back to try to save Leonardo DiCaprio in the hold even though, at that moment, he appeared to her to be an opportunist and a jewel thief.  Perhaps the most important factor in the success of both &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; is that the epic story is intrinsic to the love story, and the love story is intrinsic to the epic.  This is not easy to do, as &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;-despite its great special effects--amply confirms. <br />     For all its borrowings, &quot;Titanic&quot; has a moment, at the very end, that has never been tried before in the history of the movies and probably will never be repeated.  Just when you think the picture is over, and you see the remains of the Titanic as it appears today at the bottom of the ocean, the camera takes you back into the ship and back in time and you proceed into the grand ballroom where all the characters in the fictional part of the movie are assembled.  And then you find that it is not you who is walking up the grand stairway, but rather it is Kate Winslet, and at the top is Leonardo DiCaprio in his street clothes as we remember him.  They kiss and everyone applauds. What James Cameron has given us in this final moment is nothing other than a Curtain Call.  It gives us the feeling, for once in the movies, akin to seeing the end of great play in the theatre.  It tells us of reality on two levels: the historical reality of the drama we have just seen, and the present reality of actors who have done some good work for us in telling us the story of that drama.
B0000399WI|5.0|Frank Darabont's first movie, this adaption to Steven King's &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; is nothing short of it's Academy Award for Best Picture. The ending was brilliant, only Steven King could think up such a fine ending and only Frank Darabont could make such a great adaption as Stephen King carefully picked him to direct. You will love this movie. Also, if you liked this movie you will also fall in love with the brilliant &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, also written by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont. I can't wait untill, Frank Darabont releases his third film &quot;The Majestic&quot;.
0930289455|4.0|I find it a rare treat when villains are given as much depth as heroes (although in today's comics and films it is often the reverse).  It is even more rare when a villain is drawn so completely that you can feel pity for him.  Such is the case in this piece.<br />Now of course the people responsible for this piece did not create the Joker from scratch, the last few pages were none the less heartbreaking.  &lt;SPOILER PERHAPS???&gt;  Batman offers to help the Joker and rehabilitate him, and instead of laughing in his face as a one dimensional villain of the week may, he simply said that it was too late for that and that actually the entire situation reminded him of a joke.  (A pretty funny one at that.)<br />In addition to well flushed out characterization there are also some chilling moments which show just how sick the Joker actually is.  <br />Very short, but VERY sweet piece of work here, folks.
0380973650|5.0|With his latest published work (American Gods), Gaimen amply demonstrates that his skill as a writer and more importantly, a true storyteller has not plateaued. American Gods is sweeping in breadth and thoroughly enjoyable. Gaimen continues to fascinate readers with his conceptual orginality and creativity. The story is engaging with a tremendously identifiable protagonist, while on an abstract level, incredibly thought provoking with implications about society in general.<br />Perhaps, the only criticism one can legitimately level at Gaimen is that his writing is so fluid, effortless, and believeable, that one can question where his encyclopedic compendium of mythology ends and his creative imagery begins.<br />In short this is another fine example of Gaimen's particular trademark, the captivating storytelling that one hopes never finishes.
0060392886|4.0|This autobiography strongly resembles the Aerosmith book &quot;Walk This Way&quot; from a few years ago. You start out with the band's early days of non-stop partying, drugs, and chicks, and it's like the fun never stops. Then the story gets darker as the drugs take their toll and everyone loses their friends, money, and careers (at least temporarily). This pattern is clearly evident in the Motley Crue book, and to an even more extreme level than Aerosmith. The debauchery of the early years is truly excessive and explosive. If you love to act that way yourself, or do it vicariously by reading about the exploits of others, then you'll love those portions of this book. The only drawback is lurid descriptions of degrading things being done to women.<br />When the darkness sets in, I was surprised by the senstive and emotional writing of the guys in the band. Mick Mars (an extremly funny guy) discusses his painful bone disease that will probably lead to his early demise, Nikki Sixx (who's more intelligent than I imagined) talks about his traumatic childhood and family life, and Tommy Lee (a real sweetheart) includes his letters to Pamela from prison and shows a deep love for his sons. The most moving part of the book is when Vince Neil (who I don't think is a very cool person otherwise) discusses the death of his four-year old daughter from cancer, and how it changed his entire outlook on life.<br />This book also avoids the pitfalls of many biographies (and history books) by covering all time periods equally, instead of ignoring recent history at the expense of the glorified good old days. There's good coverage of the band's years with temporary singer John Corabi, and their recent not-so-glamorous struggles with the changing musical landscape. The only problem in this regard is the lack of dates and specific historical information, if you're the type that wants to know exactly when things happened. Otherwise, this was an extremely entertaining book, covering the expected rock star excesses with a surprising amount of realism and sensitivity. Good for both Crue fans and general rock fans alike.ted rock star excesses with a surprising amount of realism and sensitivity. Good for both Crue fans and general rock fans alike.
B000002GYG|4.0|Imagine youre in a smoke filled club, drink in hand, and listening to a seedy looking, but somehow charismatic piano player. Hes telling you stories and then those stories transform into songs. Now its over an hour later and you wonder what happened to the time. A master storyteller is at work on this CD and if you are at all intrigued by the idea of listening to tales of an Emotional Weather Report or whether or not a man is Better Off Without A Wife, this CD is for you. Musically the songs are a little too similar to one another, but if you give a good listen to the lyrics youll hear some fine commentary on life, love and the world at large.
B000053VAF|4.0|I know that this has &quot;100 minutes of extra footage&quot;, but as Smith says, the reason it wasn't in the original cut was that it wasn't needed.  I love the movie regardless, and the extra features are neat, but if you already have a copy, you might be better off just renting the Special Edition, as the extras were not really worth another 25 bucks to me.  If you don't have a copy yet, this is the one to get.
0380973650|2.0|I have read several of Gaiman's books and been impressed by his imagination.  I absolutely loved Neverwhere and wish desperately for him to write a sequel.  This book however, has too much squashed between the pages, characters I don't give a hoot about, obscenities instead of dialogue, weird sex scenes.  I found the book convoluted, confusing, disjointed and most of all, just plain boring.
0684853523|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Mr. King has opened his doors to us and let us see inside. 'On writing' is humorous and witty-and definitely not censored. I enjoy his honesty.  It is not an instruction manual on how to write so much as it is one true story of a successful writer's experience-which is why I think it has helped me to grow.  As I read along there were times when I felt I was right there with Stephen and Tabitha King.  Like when he got the phone call about 'Carrie' and its paperback rights. I took every piece of his wisdom I could from this book.  Before I read this I was not exactly a big Stephen King fan, but now I can see the man and the incredible gift he possesses.  I definitely have a new interest in his writings. I feel I got a glimpse of how the man writes and the processes of his story making; and there is also a little editing practical at the end that is very helpful!  The formula for draft editing is so true and easy to apply-an example of how clear cut his book is. Anyone interested in writing fiction should read this book.  In short, I learned a great deal about why I want to write; and I learned some important points on 'how to'and 'how not to' that will work for me.  I am certain I will read this again and again, and I will be recommending it to others.
6304806442|5.0|This film gives a stark portrayal of the life of an addict. It shows what he and his &quot;friends&quot; have to do to feed their habit, and avoid the law. There are darkly humourous moments, most supplied by Robert Carlyle. The film despite this, does have a positive message, the main character, Renton, does clean up his act at the end. It goes to show that no-one is beyond help. The film must be seen if only for the swimming in the toilet scene! A classic of British cinema which is difficult to watch, but ultimately rewarding.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is the only band even making an effort at the new and the genuine instead of shrewdly choosing bandwagons -- the only remotely original pop music today. (Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands, and of course I can hear how their music influenced Radiohead, as well as a thousand other bands. But Radiohead is moving forward, and Floyd hasn't done anything really new since 1977 &quot;Animals&quot; anyway.) <br />Like other Radiohead albums, this one sneaks up on you. You almost hate it at first. This is not entirely unexpected when you are talking about original music. But these songs, these melodies, they stay with you. They are utterly compelling, they pull you to keep listening. If you get this CD, it will be one of your favorites in little time. <br />I would put it way up there, deserving of the same attention as &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (which is almost like a &quot;Kid B&quot;). I would highly recommend listening to this on a decent sound system (or really nice headphones), with adequate bass response, preferably with a subwoofer. Both Kid A and Amnesiac take full advantage of the very low frequencies when building their multilayered soundscapes -- it's really a pleasure to listen to.
B00004VVNB|3.0|This a good adaptation of great science fiction classic-instead of remaking movies like &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; someone should update this one.
0440539811|5.0|This book is apparently some species of science fiction, conspiracy theory clearinghouse, Joycian stream-of-consciousness on LSD, pop-culture polemic.<br />But appearances can be deceiving.<br />This is actually a complete religion/philosophy/cosmology _disguised_ as sci-fi wackyness. They should print a version with numbered verses for easier reference.<br />I would strongly forewarn the highly suggestible, the young, the old, the infirm, the complacent, the rigid-of-mind, the Glorp, the Pink, the Suit, the Dupe, the Prim, the Proper or anyone who is uptight about anything that might shake their faith in their current religion/reality-tunnel, or who is worried about what their neighbors or grandparents might think (or might be doing!) This book is not for you! It is a dangerous, pernicious, seditious, contumacious, pestiferous, procacious, insidious drug that will forever alter the way you THINK.<br />Use with extreme caution.
B00003OSTK|5.0|A once-in-a-lifetime cast in a slightly faded yet eternally fascinating venture into 1932 Hollywood. Under Edmund Goulding's imaginitive direction, this actor's showcase presents a veritable microcosm of humanity. Barrymore is the sly, suave jewel theif whose love rejuventates the tired, world weary 27 year-old Garbo as the ballerina Grusinskaya. Crawford gives a lively and refreshing portrait as Flaemmchen the little stenographer with flexible morals; she's fun to watch since her acting style is miles away from that antiseptic zombie she played later in life. Beery is the tough industrialist who elicits Joan's services; and Lionel plays Otto, the lonely, dying old man who's determined to spend his last days in the lap of luxury. One may question why Wallace Beery is the only cast member who adapts a German accent whilst speaking; also, watch for the ridiculous little bobby pin keeping Garbo's hair in place during the lovemaking scenes with Barrymore! No matter. What the film lacks in credibility it more than makes up for in entertainment. Garbo's usually understated acting style strikes one as a bit phoney and exaggerated, but it's in this movie that she announces her wish &quot;to be alone&quot;. This film was re-made somewhat less successfully as WEEK-END AT THE WALDORF with Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon (!)
0553275976|2.0|...but I easily could have. Bleah. Dull and racist. I am not much of a Tom Wolfe fan at this point, having read and been bored by both &quot;A Man in Full&quot; and &quot;Bonfire.&quot; I admit laughing at and being impressed by the vivid characterizations--the prose and powerful description does keep you going, but the plot definitely does not.
B00004X01U|2.0|This is just horrible..first I have to say I feel really jipped by this album only having 10 songs...not to mention that almost all the songs are bad.

B000006OBQ|5.0|The voice had lost a little over the years,but this happens to every singer as he advance in life.This first official live recording remains nevertheless a priceless document well worth buying.Frank is obviously having a good time with the orchestra;you'll have fun hearing his monologue on his humble beginnings which he concludes by making fun at himself.Now isn't that the SINATRA we all like?At that time,FRANK had recorded his last great record THE SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS the year before.It's like witnessing the end of an era in which he was considered the king.Several excellent singles will follow this of course,but somehow this can fit as the end to the story.Several live sets have appeared on the market in recent years(1957 in CHICAGO,1959 in AUSTRALIA,LIVE IN PARIS etc)but if FRANK's voice was better in 1957 when he was recording his great concepts albums,none of them can top this one made in the town he helped to build.If you love SINATRA,you simply have to include this set in your collection.If i didn't talk about the songs,it's because they are so much a part of our cultural héritage now, that it doesn't seem necessary.But as you may say,there are young people reading this,and they don't know FRANK like you and me.Well,it is never too late,is it?
0782008364|4.0|This movie was a really good movie..if I would've seen it when it first came out(1996) I'm sure I would have thought it was really original.<br />Still the movie was really good and had me sitting on the edge of my seat.

B000002J1L|3.0|Nursery Cryme was Genesis's first album with Phil Collins on drums and Steve Hackett as guitarist. It is a radical departure from the pastoral Trespass, but signalled a new, tighter, more aggressive era. Nursery Cryme may not be as consistent and as successful as its successor, Foxtrot, but it has moments of sheer genius. Fountain of Salmacis and the awesome Return of the Giant Hogweed are classics while Harold the Barrell and Harlequin showcase the quirkier, more eccentric, English-whimsy side of the band. One thing: get it on vinyl if you can - the CD does not do the music justice.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I've heard amazing things about this movie, both good and bad.  And I have to say it was one of the bes tmovies I've ever seen.  If you are senstive and easily.....this movie is jus tnot for some people.  I though I could handle it, but for about 15 minutes after watching I just felt sick to my stomach and threw up...witch is actually good!  You get draged into this movie and WOW!  just check it out, if your up to it.
B00003CXS4|1.0|After seeing this film (or the 30 minutes of it I could bear) I felt an overwhelming need to try to let the director know that there is a sweating, balding, 465 lb man out there who has knelt on the floor with his wife's album covers fanned out in front of him. I should know. I am that man. I feel Guy Ritchie has done exactly this to me with this bilge.
078401213X|4.0|I don't know if I like this movie or not...some parts were really good and others kinda of annoying.  But then the parts that annoyed me...well, were supposed to.<br />I rented this because I thought &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; was a great movie.  I don't think Pi was as good, but I can't wait for this guy to make more movies. :)
B000003N7G|5.0|DEEP...MOODY...AND SPIRITUAL. WHEN THEY BURY ME, I WANT PSALM TO BE PLAYING AND IF THE GOOD LORD IS WILLING, I HOPE THERE IS AN ACCOMPANING THUNDERSTORM. AFTERWARDS, THEY CAN ALL GO THROW ONE BACK IN MY HONOR AND TELL LIES ABOUT ME. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC.
B000002GI0|4.0|This is a good CD, if not as good as Hiatt's previous release under his own name, the brilliant Bring the Family. I have never liked the first few songs on this CD all that much, finding them too loose, jangly and happy-sounding to my liking. I much prefer the emotive ballads like Icy Blue Heart and Feels Like Rain, and the harder rock of Ride Along and Paper Thin, probably because they are more like the songs on Bring the Family. Hiatt being happy and light-hearted doesn't really work for me. Having said that, this CD is still well worth a listen and a must for Hiatt fans. As is always the case with him the musicians Hiatt gathered for the recording cannot be faulted, and Hiatt's voice is magical- it sounds like the voice of a man who has suffered, but has found inner peace, which is indeed the case with him.
0792844793|5.0|The most controversial film of the 80's, David Lynch's &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; is a two hour long dark joke.<br />People either get it or they don't which accounts for the fact that people either love this film or completely despise it.<br />What more can anyone ask of a movie that has Dean Stockwell in drag, lip-synching Roy Orbison's &quot;In Dreams,&quot; while a deranged Dennis Hopper mouths the words, his face contorted in pain, not mention Ketty Lester's record of &quot;Love Letters&quot; used as a backdrop to a viewing of two mutalated corpses.<br />Like Scorsese, Lynch knows the power of pop music and how it can be used in the most inverted ways to enchance the power of film.<br />Too bad Lynch doesn't like to re-visit his old work...we could use a new DVD edition of &quot;Velvet&quot; with director's commentary added.<br />To sum it all up; no one can ever confuse any frame of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; with any other movie.<br />It's a complete original.
B000002L5P|5.0|This album opened up a whole new world for me. I am sorry, but even after 15+ years &quot;Reel Around the Fountain&quot; is the best song I have ever heard. I listened to and was entranced by a bunch of different music: punk, industrial, disco, house, etc. but through all those I always listened to this band.<br />The Smiths have better albums, The Queen is Dead is probably best, but there are some great, great songs on this one. Reel Around the Fountain, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Still Ill and Suffer Little Children are my favorites. <br />This Charming Man is another great one on this album, and if you like that song there is a hard to find B-Side called This Charming Man-NY that is very cool. I think on that same 12&quot; B-Side is Wonderful Woman (which is another one of their killer &lt;2:00 singles), not sure and too lazy to go look at the record. Another great B-Side to find is Jeanne.
B0000508U6|5.0|Apparently the Radio stations that litter the Washington, DC and Baltimore area are unable to find music worthy of airtime play, my suggestion is to listen to the rest of the CD.  Yellow was plastered all over the radio waves, ending sometime in June.  This tactic forced me to purchase Coldplay's CD.  To my joy, this is the first CD I'd purchased in years that was worth it's price.  I highly recommend this CD to all those that are sinking into that hole left by the Smashing Pumpkins.  Art and music can reside under the same parachute.
B000003FD9|5.0|I've heard the Casales, the Ma and both are noteworthy, however, the Casales lacks the audio integrity only a modern recording can bring to the speakers and Ma gets a little heavy on the vibrato, great stuff mind you, but it's a personal preference.  Janos Starker strikes a good balance and delivers a knockout punch in his delivery.  You won't be disappointed... the work is great and is complimented by Mr. Starker's abilities and taste.  Thank you. Thank you Janos Starker.
0884271153|5.0|This book is very nice. The last book, the goal, tells me the thoery of the constraints. This one tells me how to analyze problems in different situations. Buy it, you won't regret.
B000002I25|5.0|Yes, yes, I know I wasn't there.  I wasn't born until 10 years after Jim Morrison's death, but this album is timeless.  There are two standards on this album, Break on Through and Light My Fire.  You've all heard them, even if you didn't know what it was called.  It's amazing to think that some of the lyrics were considered profane at the time, such as the lyric &quot;girl we couldn't get much higher.&quot; &lt;gasp&gt;  See &quot;The Doors,&quot; directed by Oliver Stone to get an intersting point of view as to how this album was made.  Jim Morrison and organist Ray Manzarek were on the beach one day, talking about what they want to do with their lives, and Ray says &quot;lets start a rock 'n' roll band and make a million bucks!&quot;  One thing led to another, and we're given this initial Doors album, and it rocks.  I bet that in about 30 years from now (maybe less, maybe more) they will be playing this album in elementary school music classes to teach them music history.  It's that good.  If you live near a desert, take this album, get in your car, and go for a drive in the desert.  It'll be an amazing experience.  Enjoy!
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is one of the few bands that can indulge in artistic excesses and still retain tremendous commercial success, which I think is kind of strange. And while I say &quot;excesses,&quot; a term usually chained to denigrating interpretations, I must emphasize that Tool's artistic nature is perhaps their most striking quality. Combining an alterna-metal aesthetic with more progressive, explorative tendencies, they are decidedly unique. And they aren't just being esoteric and weird. For music fans who like a challenge, Tool presents a worthwhile package. Before discovering Tool, I was among the many who disdainfully rejected them as a lame &quot;grunge&quot; or &quot;alternative metal&quot; band, but their mosaic of musical textures creates something that dodges pigeonholing. I strongly encourage those with a liking for heavy music to check them out, because they probably aren't what you expect.<br />Aenima is full of surprises and ingenious, progressive songcraft. It explores progressive rock territory with a tone that sometimes evokes King Crimson, but never sounding like them. AEnima is all very fresh. The hard-hitting opener &quot;Stinkfist&quot; pulls the listener in with a collection of hard rock trappings: mammoth, distorted riffs, devastating drums, and fierce vocals. But the band throws you off when they change gears with &quot;Eulogy,&quot; an eight-minute piece blending monstrous heaviness with some compelling, wistfully dreamy textures (that beginning!). The musical sojourn continues with some other difficult tracks, like &quot;Pushit&quot; and the mesmerizing &quot;Third Eye.&quot;  Contrary to popular opinion, I actually enjoy the &quot;pointless&quot; interludes and think the album is so much more with them included. I find that they add to sense of suspense before a real song rolls in. &quot;Useful Idiot&quot; -- nothing more than 40 seconds of static -- is stupid on its own, but as a precursor to &quot;Forty-Six &amp; Two&quot; it serves as an interesting segue that teases you, leaving you almost begging for a song to start, as it grows louder and stronger, sort of creating a sense of tension with the listener. Especially teasing is the playful organ jam &quot;Intermission&quot; and the spooky &quot;(-) Ions,&quot; which slides smoothly into &quot;Third Eye,&quot; one of Aenima's most important songs.<br />Just as the interludes create a sense of expectancy, the songs themselves also possess that quality. &quot;Forty-Six &amp; Two&quot; is a gripping progression of texture, essentially relying on one big riff but gradually upping the intensity by stacking the arrangement with denser sonics as it goes. &quot;Third Eye,&quot; lasting more than 13 minutes and spanning enough musical ideas to fill an entire record, similarly summons a sense of tension with surprising tempo changes and long washes of instrumentation. Lengthy, explorative instrumental passages speckle the album thickly, but Tool's impossibly tight instrumental interplay, sense of detail, and precision keeps it from being boring, although it may take a serious listener to really pay attention to depth of each segment.<br />I must confess I was not initially impressed by the album's lyrical content, being turned off by reams of profanity and what was ostensibly punk-ish vitriol and juvenilia. But, as Keenan writes in &quot;AEnema,&quot; &quot;Try and read between the lines,&quot; I found that careful attention revealed that Tool possesses as much lyrical intuitivism as musical insight. Some interesting themes include genetics and false martyrs. There are also shades of philosophy that set the tone for Tool's next album Lateralus, where Keenan gets into Eastern philosophies in a big way. Even the lyric in &quot;Hooker with...&quot; is whimsical in its irony (though the song's real merit is just rocking out). Even better than the lyrics is Keenan's incredible voice. It's not his singing ability that impresses me, but his voice possesses such a gamut of qualities that it makes him unforgettable. He can sound broken and weak, ferocious and violent, or anything in between.<br />I'm new to Tool, but I can tell this is an album that offers enough depth that I'll still be listening regularly in five years...maybe longer. Are you not yet a Tool fan? Buy this and Lateralus and prepare to be blown away.ualities that it makes him unforgettable.

0385335482|5.0|Recently, I was talking to my friend over the phone.  And, yes, truth be told the most exciting part of the conversation pertains to books.  Not love lives (or lack of it), work, family, or money problems.  Books is when both our voices seem to monitor the other's tone, inflection, and excitement. &quot;Kara,&quot; I whisper excitedly.  I am already clutching the phone in my hand in anticaption.  &quot;I have just read the greatest book!&quot; &quot;Ohhh,&quot; Kara's voice takes an interesting inflection as if praticing for the Metropolitan Opera. &quot;Yes, read it in a day... not even a day really... a half a day.  Sophie Kinsella.  Confessions of a Shopaholic.&quot; &quot;What's it about?&quot; comes her immediate reply. This question always stumps me because I can never do the book justice.  I can't say for example that when you read the first line that you want to just lock yourself into a room and read and read and read.  Whatever I say of Rebecca (the main character) comes across as superficial or shallow because she likes to spend money. Nonetheless, I rooted for.  I liked Rebecca.  Needless to say, it's one of those characters that could be you or someone you know.    And Sophie Kinsella is remarkable.  Her writing has the ability to laugh, sympathize, and scream in frustation.  It was one of those books that when I was done, that I wished I hadn't read so quickly.   Confessions of a Shopaholic engages you in such a way that you don't want the book to end.  And for all those people that have money problems... definitely use your last dollars on this one.
6304233639|5.0|If you haven't seen ID4, you're in for a treat!  Its almost non-stop action will keep you glued to your seat from the minute it starts with a slow crossing of an advanced alien ship between us and the moon.  There's some outlandishness in this movie, some coincidences only Hollywood could pull off, but there's a lot of fun, humor, warmth, action, and drama in it as well.  If you're looking for deep meaning of mankind's search for extraterrestrial life, get Contact.  If you're looking for some fun, adventure, and popcorn munching fun, look no further!
B000002GVO|1.0|THis album is really weak. Except for the title track (which, by the way, is a master-piece) there is absolutely nothing here, just a compilation of mediocre love/country/pop songs at best !! Why everybody says this album is so great?? I can´t understand it. Of course the musicians are good, but the compositions are terrible.
078322799X|5.0|I saw this movie back when it came out in 1996.  The theatre was empty and I wasn't expecting much.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It was funny, scary, and highly entertaining.  I told all my friends to watch the film and they all loved it.  Watch this film!!!!
B00005J73X|3.0|Por fin un album en vivo de este famoso quinteto de Nueva Jersey llega a las tiendas y solo basto con enterarme de las canciones que este incluye para decepcionarme. Vamos primero con los aspectos positivos, que en realidad solo es uno! El album se escucha bien, algo que debe de ser tomado en cuanta al ser uno en vivo. Sin ser excelente, la grabacin esta bien realizada, las musica se escucha bien y esta no es superada por el rugir del publico. Pero aqui vienen los contras! Primero que nada, el repertorio de canciones. Estamos hablando de que este debio ser un album triple! OK, es solo uno, pero por que incluir covers y dejar fuera canciones clasicas de esta banda como Lay Your Hands On Me, Born To Be My Baby, I'll Be There For You, Blaze of Glory, etc. Supuestamente se esta tomando en cuenta una epoca de 1985 al 2001, pero las grabaciones de las canciones son practicamente del concierto que llevaron a cabo en Zurich el ao pasado. Ademas, los track al terminarse dejan de escucharse como un album de estudio normal y no es continuo como la mayoria de los que son en vivo. Al grano, este album esta recomendado para los fans de la banda. Aquellos jovenes que anden buscando conocer mas a Bon Jovi mejor consiganse el Crossroad, ese si esta lleno de 100% exitos, o mejor an, consiganse el DVD del Crush Tour que en verdad es un conciertazo y vaya que vale la pena lo que pagaran por el.
0517122707|5.0|I tried explaining to my friends as I read this book how funny it is, but I truly cannot do it justice.  The only way for a person to understand how funny John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece is to read it for himself. <br />The story revolves around the bumbling, egocentric, slob-like, wordy but intelligent Ignatius Reilly.  The things that Ignatius said made me laugh out loud on countless occassions; I could just picture his lines being spoken in a movie and not being able to contain myself.  Perhaps the book can best be summed up in Toole's own words -- &quot;Goodness only knew what Reilly's personal life was like.  One crazy incident after another, insanity upon insanity.&quot;  Along this insane path that Ignatius constantly follows, the reader meets many other characters that are typical of New Orleans.  The description of the French Quarter, Bourbon Street, and other areas is very fitting.<br />The weakness to the story is the end.  But Toole delivers some serious underlying messages in his work about 20th century society.  Although many of Ignatius' ideas are absurd and satirical, I often found myself thinking that some of his ideas did make clear implications about the society we live in.<br />The bottomline is this book is too funny not to read.
B00003CY5H|4.0|This movie started out slow but progressed excellently. The plot was interesting, however, it's one that has been played again and again.  Edward Norton gave a great performance and by the end of the movie, the crowds were routing for the &quot;bad guys&quot; to come out on top.  Worth seeing it in theaters, although I would recommend waiting for it to surface in your video store.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Sometimes I just don't understand what the Academy is thinking.  The two key areas that detracted from this film were direction and editing.  So, of course, two of four Oscars this film won were for Best Director and Best Editing.<br />Steven Soderbergh is one of the most creative directors around.  He is also one of the most self indulgent.  This is another example of style overwhelming substance.  After playing it straight with \\"Erin Brockovich\\", Soderbergh picks up where he left off with \\"The Limey\\" and attempts to break whatever record exists for throwing the most stylized techniques into a single film.  Admittedly, many of the images are brilliantly filmed with great impact.  However, the excessive technique begins to get in the way of the story and makes a complex plot even harder to follow (and stomach).<br />The story is a fascinating look at the drug trade from the perspective of various players in the game.  Soderbergh feels compelled to color code the simultaneous vignettes with an assortment of hues by varying the filters to produce blue for one, sepia for another, etc.  This is not only disturbing, but a bit insulting to viewers who really shouldn't need the color code to follow the story (except maybe for the disjointed editing).  The editing is choppy and the constant use of hand held cameras while giving certain scenes a dynamic \\"in your face\\" quality, often becomes distracting and annoying.<br />If there is one area that is uniformly excellent, it is the acting.  The entire ensemble does an outstanding job, top to bottom.  Benicio Del Toro is tremendous and deserved every ounce of the Best Supporting statue he received.  Don Cheadle gives a career performance as well.  Erika Christensen does a bang up job as the drug czar's addicted daughter.  Michael Douglas is intense and unravels marvelously as his world comes crashing down around him.  The acting is a solid ten everywhere you look.<br />As well received as this film was, I believe it could havebeen much better if Soderbergh restrained himself a bit.  Of course part of being Steven Soderbergh is to be obsessed with showing everyone just how brilliant a director can be, regardless of how it might affect the film.  (How producer Danny DeVito got Soderbergh to stay out of the way in \\"Erin Brockovich\\" is amazing to me.)<br />I rated this film a 7/10.  Most people either loved it or hated it (far more loved it).  I did a little of each.  If the runaway director had been toned down just a tad, it could have been a true classic.
B000002IGV|4.0|If you're not looking for intelligent, thought provoking lyrics, this album is for you.  It relies on, instead of that kind of lyrics, heavy riffs, pounding beats, and infectious choruses.  Worth a listen, if you're into 80s metal.
B00005B36H|5.0|I never heard a Tool album until I bought this a few days ago. I literally can't stop listening to it. I'am looking forward to hearing some of their older music, but Lateralus is definitely a classic. I think the music is truly beautiful; Maynard's voice is mesmerizing. You gotta hear this. Tool definitly won me over.
0790729369|5.0|I watched this movie 10 times or so and I still cry everytime I watch it! Just right movie to makes us think how to seize our life. TERRIFIC!
0783225970|5.0|When I first saw this movie 11 years ago on video, I really did not care for it that much. However, when I watched it on dvd last March, I went out and bought it the next day! Not only was I reminded of how great this film was, but realized how great Pacino is at playing a bad guy.This film also renforces my opinion that Brian DePalma is absolutley the greatest filmaker alive!However the squeamish should be warned that even though this film is almost 20 years old, it still stands as one of the most violent films ever made
B00003ETJQ|5.0|This is a video (or DVD) that in my opinion should be viewed by everyone at least once.  Baraka is a glimpse of this fearsome and fascinating world in all its variety, or at least as much as can be documented in two hours.<br />It offers panoramic glimpses of Mother Nature at its most serene and tumultuous, from ocean waves at sunset to bubbling magma pools inside volcano hollows.  It shows humans/human existence at both the best and worst: stunning cathedrals and temples, slumming prostitutes and the swarming masses of consumers.  <br />The editing and sequencing are intentional throughout, from the opening shot of a white-furred monkey in a Japanese hot springs to the montage of human religion rituals juxtapositioned together, displaying the basic similarities of human faith.  Children in Ecuador observing life behind protective bars; the dispossessed of India rooting through trash heaps to gather sustenance; a train of bugs swiftly crawling over the surface of a leaf while the tree itself is slashed down, another casualty of the Amazon...if a single picture is worth a thousand words, then the multitude of visual shots in Baraka could fill a library.    <br />Sound is mostly limited to the atmospheric music of Dead Can Dance, Enigma, etc., with a few notable inclusions: monks chanting in ritual, the clip-clop of a mule.  There is no speech, nor is any needed.  Personally, I had no difficulty identifying the locals; most are fairly obvious to the experienced eye.<br />Buy this video.  Borrow it from the library.  Find a way to acquire it, and just watch...let the enormity sweep over you.  Life is short, and has so much to offer.  Baraka scrapes the surface and gives you a glimpse beneath.
B00001QEE5|5.0|It had been a long time since I had seen this Disney Classic, but I thought it was an absolute hoot! My 4-year-old son laughed so hard at the crocodile sequences that he wet himself! (for him, a first) This is an excellent piece of entertainment. To Hell with the &quot;stereotyping&quot; complaints. If you are too PC to endure them, then don't watch the movie. Simple, huh? This is a fantasy, and has more in common with the Warner Bros. approach to cartooning than most people realise. Just compare Bugs and Y.Sam to Pan and Hook and you'll see what I mean. It is far less honey sweet than most other early Disney classics. Oh, and incidently, the last time Disney bent over backwards for the &quot;Native American Sensitivity Crowd,&quot; the result was &quot;POKABOREME.&quot; A bomb, if memory serves. Come on folks, lighten up!  By the way, why is it nobody complains about the stereotyped Brits and Pirates?
B000005HN6|5.0|This album is absolutley amazing.  I hadn't heard about Opeth until I saw this CD sitting in his stack.  It was kind of odd, seeing as everything else was Slayer, Children of Bodom and such, to see a CD with a big pink flower on its cover.  I asked him about it, and he played it for me.  First off, the guitars blew me away.  Amazing.  I love metal, but this was beyond metal.  This was the most melodic album I have ever had the privilege to hear.  Then there were the vocals.  Masterfully done.  Finally was the song Silhouette, which I learned was written and performed by their drummer.  Its rare to see such talent in a band these days.  If you are sitting there, thinking you should buy the album, but wanted to see what other people thought, think for yourself.  Buy this album and stop reading!

0767824571|5.0|Monty Python and The Search for The Holy Grail is a classic. It is very very hillarious. It is about King Arthur and his knight in search for The Grail. They all go seperate ways making for an exciting journey with wacky people and places. This movie is one of teh best comedies ever and i think you should buy it right now.
0679879269|5.0|Yikes.  Tears are coming to my eyes.    I like Mrs. Coulter from the very begining.  Just as she made Lyra love her, she did the same to me.  I so despertly wanted her to be good!    When I found out that she was, in fact, Lyra's mother, I was shocked.  What could be better?  The Amber Spyglass.    Dealing with manners of Christianity:  I am a Catholic.  At first, in Northern Lights, when I found out about Asriel trying to kill off the Authority, I was about reading to hurl the book across the room.  But I gave it a change, and realized that this was symbolizing what some people do in \\"the name of God\\"...witch burnings tops my list.  I wish avidly that there could be some other way, but there isn't, and that's the way it it.    As for Lyra and Will being too young to fall in love, that is bogus.  They are just as capable as falling in love as a thirty year old is...because they are RIGHT for each other.  If they had met at age 8, I could still probably believe this.  I know a lot of 20+ year olds a lot more immature than these two.    I do have to admit, Lyra changed.  So did will, and Mrs. Coulter, and Lord Asriel, and Mary Malone...people CHANGE!  Andy yes, I was a little confused with Mary tempting Lyra, but it that didn't ruin anything.    These books are powerful.  I feel guilty, like I deserted poor Harry...but then I realized that you can't compare apples and oranges.  Somehow, these books are different.    I loved that in HDM, you could identify with at least one of the characters.  At first the view point shifts annoyed me, but then I realized that they were NECASSARY!      I cannot bear to reread these books just yet.  I want to know everything about the characters, though:  It would make my day if Pullman started a series of biographies...first Lyra and Will, of course, and then Mary, the Gallivespians, and Mrs. Coulter, and Lord Asriel, and Lee Scoresby, and Iorek Byrnson, right down to every maid of Oxford.    There is also something for everyone in these books!  No matter what the age, there is always a part that makes you smile and say, \\"Yikes!  I hope my parents never read this!\\"  Or \\"Oh my!  I'll never let my children read these...\\"    And if you disagree with Pullman's books, all I can say is that they will change your life forever, like it or not,
0375703764|2.0|Wow.  A house bigger on the inside than the outside.  What a cool clever idea I thought.  And for a while it was.  Then the nonsense with the lists and silly fonts began to seem without purpose and tiresome and I gave up.  Can you recommend 1/3 of a book to someone?
B00005AKQE|5.0|Before reviewing this CD, I'd like to tell you a little story.  My name's Dan, and I've been a Creed fan ever since I heard &quot;My Own Prison&quot; on a local radio station.  As soon as My Own Prison was released, I bought the album, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Not only were they a great solid rock band, but the lyrics and singing were incredible.  You rarely hear inspirational and poetic lyrics in a rock song.  Not so with Creed.  When I heard that Creed was releasing another album, Human Clay, I knew I had to get it.  So as soon as I had the chance I went out and bought it.  I never thought that they could get any better than what I've heard on My Own Prison.  They did.  It was my absolute favorite CD ever.  I took it everywhere I went, even school.  I had been listening to it in my Computer Programming class, but forgot to take it out.  I realized this on the trip home.  The next day early in the morning I ran to the computer before my first period class, hoping to find the CD in the drive, only to realize it was gone. Nowhere to be found.  I can't explain how upset I was.  So I logged on the Amazon.com a few months later (I had borrowed a friend's CD, but it was about time to return it!) to see buy a new CD, when I found the double CD European import.  It had Human Clay AND a bonus disc with some other unreleased songs.  I ordered it and received it the other day.  It's the best set of CDs ever!  I love Human Clay, but on the bonus disc there's a the acoustic version of &quot;What's This Life For?&quot;  I had to fall in love with it because it was my favorite Creed song on My Own Prison.  It sounds just as great played with an acoustic guitar as it does with the electric.  I also love to Whom it May Concern.  It's Creed, after all!  Well, to make a long story short, I think it's an excellent CD set and no Creed fan will be disappointed.  Sorry I wasn't so articulate, but I'm tired! :)

From his powerful, conreversal, make-you-think lyrics ; to his beautiful pianistry this cd sums up his solo career the best beside the other collections that have been made. Lennon Legend is one of the greatest albums ever. This is a must for all John Lennon fans and his excellent for beginning listeners of Lennon. The best song ever is also on this album---IMAGINE
0380778556|5.0|I remember reading this book in the 8th grade for a book report and had no clue what it was about. Needless to say I made up the report. Anyways a few years later I chanced upon it again and read and it made perfect sense. Sense that time Rebecca has been one of my most read and beloved novels. In a story of a young girl raised as the companion of a shrew of a woman she finds love in the most strangest of places, Monte Carlo. Her love is for a man who is old enough to be her father. When he asks her to marry him she says yes and is wisked away to England and the magestic house known as Manderley. However, this dream romance is far from what it seems to be. She must deal with the sinister maid of her husband's deceased wife and her lack of proper breeding that makes her ignorant to the ways of Manderley. Yet behind the face of this young girl's husband is a dark secret that is waiting to be revealed. In a truly interesting tale of murder and love this suspenseful novel will leave you guessing down to the very last page.
B000056K04|4.0|I admit to being a lover of bands that change their sound, minimizing song remakes (from their old cds), so that soungs sound so...fimilar with that hint of flair. What hardcore DMB fans aren't realizing when they listen to this CD is that all the members are writing an ablum which shows them emotionally growing. Not that their sound is similar, but it is comparable to what Radiohead does with their CDs, none are the same. I must admit I was very dissapointed in the lack of violin and sax. Listening to the sound and  the words on the Everyday album, there is actually meaning to them, and any DMB fan should realize this, and not automatically shut it down because the sound is different. However, minus a star because although the lyrics have meaning, and I don't mind whena band changes its sound, I think Dave has been a little too accomodating for Ballad.
0131103628|5.0|I'm new to procedural programming. I bought this book as a reference for the ANSI C language, so that I could look up various rules or constructs that might otherwise be described less thoughtfully in the various how-to books that are available for C Programming. I was not disappointed in the least.<br />My advice to those learning C as their first programming language is to get either C for Dummies (Vol 1 &amp; 2 are sold together on this site) or Learning to Program in C by Deitel and Deitel. The latter will certainly build your skills more, but the former makes it easier to get started and keep an interest through the first few chapters (usually the most critical ones when working with books like these). Then you can use this book as a cross-reference when something doesn't make sense to you.<br />Even so, if I could learn from only one book, it would be this one without a doubt. It's relatively short length is one of its great strengths. Nowhere are you buried in obscure references or cryptic examples. It's all very clearly put together for the reader. No wonder it's hard to find used copies in good condition!
B000002JPA|5.0|What can I say about the album that changed my life and prompted me to pick up a guitar at age 12.  Now I can play about 75% of their music but during the rest I have to just sit back and smile.  I recommend everything by these guys but this would be the best place to start followed by Scenes from a Memory or Awake or either Liquid Tension Experiment album.  Breakdown: Pull Me Under:  probably the greatest radio progressive metal song ever; addicting guitar riffs, the coolest lyrics, a great guitar solo, and a great keyboard solo.  Another Day:  the power ballad that never was, beautiful song with a passionate Petrucci guitar solo(don't ever tell me he doesn't play with passion...just listen(also check out Explorers Club's Age of Impact, listen to John's solos and then try to have an argument with me).  Take the Time:  has everything, funk grooved guitar, Italian lyric bit, catchy chorus, amazing 2 minute instrumental section, dueling keyboard and guitar, and a great outro(check out the Once Upon a LiveTime version as it goes into the best rendition of &quot;Freebird&quot; I have ever heard.  Surrounded:  Interesting midrange song that is placed perfectly between two technical monster songs, cool delayed guitar solo.  Metropolis Pt. 1:  masterpiece, you can feel the tesion building in the intro, 4 minute jaw dropping instrumental section that sounds like a marriage with Yes, Rush, Frank Zappa, and a John Myung bass solo that Jaco Pastorius and Billy Sheehan would love, every prog rock group should thank them for this opus.  Under a Glass Moon:  look past technical-this is the residential badass song on the album, technically Mike Portnoy's best drumming and John Petrucci's best guitar solo on the album, sounding like a cross between Steve Vai, Yngwie Malmsteen, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Michael Schenker, Steve Morse, and Al Di Meola.  Wait for Sleep:  Beautiful short melodic piece that shows off James Labrie's true talent.  Learning to Live:  moving lyrics, best vocals onthe album, brilliant acoustic section, intricate keyboards, solid closer.  I have seen these guys three times in concert and they are even better live.  This album belongs in the Louvre...or alone with me on a desert island...or on a pedestal...or just in your cd collection.  Anyone who just appreciates good music will love this cd.
0812550706|5.0|First of all, this was a great book.  Excellent plot, well fleshed out characters,  great situations.  In short it had, as few books do, everything it would need to make itself great.  Anyway, it takes place a few hundred years in the future after several devestating attacks on humanity have nearly destroyed our species.  The remaining governments have taken to training young military geniuses in preporation for a third invasion.  Six year old Ender Wiggin is one of those chosen.  Having turned down his brother Peter, for being too violent, and his sister Valentine, for being too mild, they have at last found Ender, who they think could be the next Napolean.  Taken from his home, his family, and everything he knows, he is brought to Battle School, and trained.  And he thrives...  Anyway, I won't give any more away for the benefit of those who haven't read it yet, but I urge that you do read it.  This has to be one of the best science fiction novels ever, and if you have even a slight interest in that field this will be a favorite.  One thing that did annoy me though was that at the beginning when Ender was talking to Graff, he asks if there are girls in Battle School too, and Graff says only a few because there are too many years of evolution against them!  Oh yeah, this culture isn't &quot;Sexist&quot; or anything, it's just us that are at fault.   Well, I'm sorry, but I find that offensive!  Also, if they thought Peter was too violent to go to Battle School, (I mean really, they want warriors don't they?) then he must have been pretty bad, and if he was that bad, than why didn't they have him under observation and such, rather than letting him grow up with very do-able plans to take over the world by age twelve?  It was obvious that he had the capabilities and the motivation to do it, and it was pretty obvious they knew that as well, so why didn't they do something about that?  Oh well.  Besides those things though, this book was probably one of the best I've everread, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone.

1556154844|5.0|This book is one of the most insightful books I've ever picked up. I thought I was writing good code before and know I'm writing better code now, with just a few little tidbits gleaned from this tome. Prior to leaving my previous job I was sorely tempyed to buy my manager a copy. I think everyone who writes, reads and/or evaluates code should read this book. It's worth it.
B00004VVNB|4.0|This is a great buy. While the packaging is very plain (the booklet from the black-cover anniversary edition isn't included), the disk offers everything that was on anniversary edition DVD, and you can choose between the letterboxed on one side and the pan-and-scan version on the other side (pan-and-scan wasn't included on the anniversary disk). While I can't imagine why anyone would want the pan-and-scan, which chops nearly half the picture from this visually stunning film, it's here for those who want it.<br />There's just one thing keeping me from giving it a fifth star. There was a Special Edition laserdisc a few years back that had everything on this DVD, plus an amazing collection of magazine articles, prop photos, and other goodies. Some of this material is hard to find, and now that I know that it exists, I would like to see it on DVD. It would be a real treat to the hardcore fans who can no longer get the LD and need something to tide us over while we wait for the long-promised remake.
0385491026|5.0|This book is so colorful! I don't so much like the last 150 pages or so as much as I like her girlhood accounts. Torturesome they are, but not out of the palette of human cruelty. I really identified with Elaine on a lot of things, and I am sure many of us knew a Cordelia or two who continue to haunt us.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|This is Akira. The movie is great. The re-mastered sound makes it sound awesome. But what I don't like is they put so much color into this, it takes away from the Anime gritty feel to it, and looks more like cartoon artwork. For the old school Akira fans; I don't know if I'll be able to get used to the new voice overs. I guess it's supposed to be more of the original script, but they don't really tell you. The actors doing the voices didn't put the energy and feelings into it like the originals did. If you've never seen this movie before, you won't know any difference and you will thouroughly enjoy this movie. But for someone who has gotten used to it a certain way for 12 years, this version is a little hard to swallow.  All in all this is still a great movie, and I just wanted to get the DVD so I wouldn't wear out my ORIGINAL (limited widescreen edition) vhs tape.
B00005J9U1|5.0|This is a really great album,a must have for reggae fans.
B00000K19E|3.0|Everybody always told me to watch the Matrix, so I did.  The special effects and the graphics are great.  So are the fighting scenes.  And Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are good actors.  But the movie didn't really do it for me.  I liked A.I. much better (is that a fair comparison??).
B00004T37H|5.0|Like far too many adults, initially I was quite hesitant to watch this movie. However, the more the tale unfolded, the more glued I was. This isn't a cartoon. This is film. And indeed it is a very good one. It's special; a gem. It's one of the most beautiful stories I've ever heard, and quite frankly, it's a story everyone, at any age, could benefit from. The only adjective that truly would do such a movie justice is, &quot;enchanted&quot;. For this is no ordinary movie. Don't miss out on this one.
B000053VAF|3.0|The DVD is packed with excellent features.  The film isn't.  The Catholic church is a very easy target for ridicule and this film always makes the easy jokes.  At its best Dogma can be really quite funny but at its worst it is simply amateurish, unfortunately there is very little of the best.
6301008960|4.0|John Hughes may be the king of high school comedies, but this is the one he never made. It takes a very,very realistic look at what goes on in every high school,kids doing anything to gain popularity and the consequences that come with it, i saw this film when i was a sophmore in high school and i can say that it hit home in many ways, i remember kids like this, doing these things to one another, it takes a hard look at the pitfalls of popularity and those wanting it, for some reason Disney(the films distributor) likes to ignore this film, why i don't know? it honestly tells the truth about high school. I usually don't care for these kind of films,but this one still entertains me when it is on, at 30 i still like this film, but it is not currently available on VHS, so i don't own it, if released on DVD, i would more than likely get it. it doesn't glorify high school the way hughes' films do which i like,and its setting which takes place in Arizona( scottsdale, it looks like)is always nice to watch. A winner for sure and probably one of 1987's most overlooked films.
B000000W5B|4.0|This album is definitely one of the Stones most emotional and passionate albums.  But, it is somewhat boring at times.  It definitely does not have the same fire as &quot;Some Girls.&quot;  I just liked it so much because it has probably my favourite love song of all time in &quot;Angie&quot; and another cool one in &quot;winter.&quot;  I actually think that this album having &quot;Angie&quot; on it is worth buying it alone but there are a few other pretty good ones on this one as well.  I would reccommend buying it even though it's not their strongest work by far.  But I'm definitely glad that I bought it.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Overall this movie was bearable, the story was interesting, and there really arent that many car chases in the movie anyway.  The worst part of this movie is how unrealistic the people act.  I couldnt believe how bad and cheezy the scene was where cage and all his car-theive friends were about to steal cars, and then they played &quot;low-rider&quot; and kind of meditated untill Cage said something to the effect of &quot;ok, lets go steal some cars&quot;  That has to be the cheesiest scene in the history of movies, the director should be embarrassed.  Overall, it was somewhat entertaining  and I didnt find myself getting bored during the movie, that grants it 3 stars instead of 2.
6304795254|5.0|I have watched a lot of films in my time, in a lot of diffent genres. This was the first film in a long time that had me glued to the screen. The only other newish film i can think of that had that affect was 'The 6th Sense' or perhaps 'Momento' both excelent films. Douglas is superb as a very rich man who is bought a birthday present by his younger brother. This present is meant to bring some &quot;fun&quot; into his life, but hew gets a lot more than he bargained for! Brilliant entertainment for all, a MUST watch!

0393038912|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is the perfect overview of an incredibly wide range of scientific and social science topics relating to humanity's development. Perfect for a layman like me, because points are explained in a way that's very easily digested. (Actually, perhaps a bit too much... the author frequently repeats himself to make sure we remember what he said a few pages back.) <br />You will feel a lot smarter -- honestly -- after you read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". It deals with important information, much of which I had either never heard or never really understood previously. I had any number of \\"wow, now I understand!\\" moments as I read it. <br />The author is very forthcoming in specifying whether he is dealing with solid science or mere speculation, and everything he says rings true. And even when he gets a bit PC about the nobility of non-western cultures, he's also honest about their shortcomings. And the success of the West is put in a context that shows amazing cross-cultural similarities. The society that has \\"the right stuff\\" is going to prevail, often brutally -- and it's been happening in much the same way for 15,000 years, not just 500.
0790736039|5.0|im only 14 and me and my big brover watched IT when i was only five i am still terrified to this very day of clowns expesaly since i just watched it earlier on this is a brilliant but scary movie!
B00005ABIP|5.0|I bought the CD having heard &quot;sheep go to heaven&quot; and &quot;you turn the screws&quot; on the radio, but this CD is probably the only one i bought that i like more than 2 songs on. &quot;let me go&quot; is very catchy, and &quot;never there&quot; is neat too, especially with the phone sounds. I play the trumpet and I appreciate their use of it, and i like their super originality. This should be everyone's first cake buy.
B000003S0F|4.0|hi i'm french and a great fan of KC - this is one of the best album - specialy the first & the second tracks !!!!<br />by & see U on [...]        )!!!
B000002TPS|3.0|A good all around album but could have been better.It has its gems,but of all the megadeth albums I got tired of this one quicker than the others.The biggest complaint is that most of the songs sound the same,as if they didnt try to write the music as well as they could have but it still is a great metal album as all megadeth cds are! Hetfield and Hammett can only wish they could play riffs like Mustaine and Friedman!
0060987464|5.0|i hate reading  but i have read this book so many times its not funny.  i even got my sister-in-law to read this book and gain respect for brian warner.  he is a very intellegent and talented man, and this book lets you know all about him.  read this book you will love it.
B000002UDD|3.0|This is a solid thrash album that is a little bit overlooked.But why?It is really good,not great but fun to listen to.Megadeths meanest release to date and if you like mean youll love this!The only average songs are liar,set the world afire,and anarchy the rest are excellent especially In my darkest hour and hook in mouth.They made me want to break something,thats always a good sign!
B00005M08C|4.0|I recently heard the gorillaz myself for the first time, and fell in love with the song 'Clint Eastwood'  It has a little bit of everything.  As for the other songs, It's very different than what I listen to, but I rushed to get the CD.  I would recomend it to almost anyone.
B000002V0R|5.0|Classic metal,its that simple...Almost every song sounds like a single! Symphony of Destruction is a Megadeth masterpiece that every metalhead in the world loves to headbang to, guaranteed!Cowntdown to extinction is also an awsome song...Awe what the hell!the whole album rules!
B00004U8H4|5.0|This was a great movie.  Christian Bale did a phenomenal job playing Patrick Bateman.  This is the first movie I've seen him in, and I look forward to seeing him again.  The plot puts a sophisticated Bateman in a high paying Wall Street job surrounded by a bunch of stuck up &quot;too good for you&quot; Harvard educated pricks much like himself.  The only difference is Bateman's dark side that nobody knows about.  This is not one of those hack and slash movies that show blood for the sake of blood.  The fact is that there is almost no gore.  Don't get me wrong, I like blood as much as the next sicko, but it needs to be done in a clever way.  I found myself glued to the TV listening attentively to this perverted psycho's dialog.  Everything he does is so nonchalant which is what attracted me so much to this movie.  Having never heard anything about it, this movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  The script was very well written, and Bale did a great job acting.
B000002UUX|5.0|Great! There isnt a better thrash album around!Hangar 18 and Holy Wars are excellent.Not Megadeths best heavy metal album but definately their best thrash metal album.Friedman is the greatest solo player in the world,too bad he left the band he was an awsome part of their great success.Teamed with Dave,they were absolutely the best one two punch in metal! Screw Metallica there is no comparison to this lineup that Megadeth had!Megadeths real lineup started on this album and continued through Cryptic Writings and pretty much stayed the same on Risk minus Menza but they still had Marty and they were still great.Megadeth is still great because of Dave,but I definately miss Marty and Nick,the true Megadeth lineup.3 times better than Master of Puppets,the complexity of riffs on Rust is way better than Master of Puppets.
B000002I27|5.0|&quot;Strange Days&quot; (1967) was an extremely important album for The Doors.  Although hailed as being similiar to their self-titled album released shortly before, &quot;Strange Days&quot; marked a change for The Doors and most importantly, Jim Morrison.  Although still heavily involved in the psychedelic scene of the late 60's, The Doors expanded and incororated newer ideas into their music.  I feel &quot;Strange Days&quot; is an extremely important album and one of thier best, if not their best.
B00003CXSM|1.0|If you ever wondered about the precise definition of HORSES**T... ever wondered how best it may be visually represented, you're staring at the answer.  One of the WORST & most pointless movie ever made.    I vehemently DETEST Jennifer Lopez, even a trace presence ANNOYS me.  But after this film, I dont know which of the two I dislike more, the Lopez creature or the film.  I'll take a voluntary root canal over watching this crap again.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Perhaps Michael Douglas' thrusting into the Drug Czar position was a crack at the US Government for finding someone...anyone...to take the heat for what is inevitably going to be a failed attempt at winning the drug war. Or maybe Douglas' own lack of superior expertise in the matter is reflective of our just past, real life Drug Czar's incredibly unsuccessful &quot;Just Say No to Drugs&quot; educational campaign, where kids aren't learning anything but sugar coated wive's tales instead of learning how to deal with drug-related situations. Maybe even more telling than that is the fact there is a drug problem right in his own backyard, perhaps being a shot at people who wage campaigns so vigorously but neglect to give the proper attention to their own children.<br />Equally frustrated is Benicio Del Toro's character, an honest Mexican cop who isn't supported by his own government. A cop who can't do his job because the people he is fighting against go much higher than street level dealers. In short, no matter what he does, he is still being controlled.<br />There is the drug lord in La Jolla who perhaps personifies the fear of having a crime lord exist in the seemingly most serene suburbs. I'm not exactly sure what to think about Catherine Zeta Jone's character, whether she was indeed left completely in the dark by her husband, or if she put up a really good front in order to continue operations.<br />Whatever the case, this movie was so well executed that most other movies seem childish in comparison. The color schemes were used well to represent mood and energy, from the yellowish tint of Del Toro's scenes, to the dark gray tones of Douglas' scene, to the more vibrant colors in Zeta Jones' family-oriented setting in which the public may relate more to. All the major players in this film started to lose control over what they cherished the most. Douglas' war was hitting roadblocks, and his daughter became a crack whore. Zeta Jones' perfect life was shattered when herhusband was dragged off by the DEA. Del Toro's dream of cleaning up the streets was halted by the realization that the powers-that-be simply would never allow it to happen. Many other subplots, including Frankie Flowers having to give away his employers to the government when he really didn't have much of a choice in the matter (thus sealing his death), were portrayed with enough realism to the point the average joe could almost feel the same fear that the people in the movie were dealing with.<br />The cast was simply stellar, and while races of all sorts had their part in the film, it's somewhat disappoining to read some of the reviews on this page where people play the race card.
B000001Y5X|5.0|What Marilyn Manson lacked in musical direction they made up for in glitz and sheer screw-your-conventional-opinions attitude. This is, in my opinion, their finest effort. It's a shame that a year or so later they would abandon all of the elements that set them apart in the first place.<br />&quot;Portrait&quot; is a muddled beast, never really punk, not quite metal, but it succeeds thematically in spite of its shirking of categorization. It takes a rather insouciant approach to themes of child abuse, drug use, and Satanism that they haven't touched on since. It was exactly this type of ribbing of sacred cows that got people to take notice and affix a label to this new movement. Thus &quot;Shock Rock&quot; was born.<br />These days Mr. Manson is still about attacking popular opinion but in a more serious manner. Their latest effort has a couple of songs that hark back to the sensibility of &quot;Portrait&quot; but they never completely give themselves over to it. <br />&quot;Portrait of an American&quot; family has a carnivalesque feel to it largely due to influences ranging from the obvious, Anton LaVey, to the strange, Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory, and on into the cliche, Charles Manson. The allure of Marilyn Manson was that no one before them had drawn upon these sources all at once.<br />Love him or hate him, Marilyn Manson plays the Devil's music and unlike a lot of bands today who pilfer the imagery and feign anti-christian sentiments for popularity, HE actually pays the Devil his due.
079073463X|5.0|I have a standard by which I judge all movies I view. &quot;Good guys win; bad guys lose; good guy gets the girl.&quot; Every movie I watch had better fit this guideline. Most of the time, if it doesn't it isn't worth my time! Some people tend to overanalyze a film. If you watch this film, you will be entertained. Just sit back and enjoy!

0451160916|5.0|The Stephen King library certainly has its ups and downs--often faulted for inadequate finales (in some cases, i.e. The Stand, without cause) and occasional overlength, but there is little question that this is one of King's better novels by far.  In terms of raw story telling, this is actually a peak in King's ability to create true suspense in his readers.  That's harder to do that it sounds--a novel can be pursued at the pace which the reader chooses, which means that it takes more than a little talent to broadcast the sort of tension and suspense that King wants to deliver here.  He manages a fairly masterful job, however, for which he is to be commended.  This is one of the books where everything came together for him--his characterization is still excellent without straying into extraneous areas of his characters' lives, the plot moves at a proper pace, and the story ends as well as any you'll ever read.  Since I figure that most folks are reading this book more as a leisure activity than a study in literature, I'll reserve my judgment on the thematic overtones, but suffice it to say that King also offers a fairly superlative literary effort in this novel as well.  Strangely enough, this doesn't rank as one of my favorite King books, primarily because of the vague unease that it awakened in reading it (a rare occurence for me), but it is an undeniably good read, and ought to be picked up by anybody with the time and inclination.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I'll admit it...I LOVED the first A-ha album, &quot;Hunting High &amp; Low.&quot;  Yes, Yes, I know that &quot;Take on Me&quot; was overplayed, but there were some amazingly beautiful songs on their first release including &quot;Here I Stand and Face the Rain&quot; and &quot;Living a Boy's Adventure Tale.&quot;  However, I felt that A-ha's follow up albums were less than impressive and wrote them off as a failed 80's band.  Imagine my surprise when I heard &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky.&quot;  What a GREAT collection of songs.  A-ha have totally pegged that elecronica/acoustic sound that is so popular right now (think Dido, Madonna, Caroline Lavelle).  The album is relaxing, but upbeat at the same time, and Morten's voice is just an amazing thing.  Too bad America will not really get a chance to hear this album.  It think it would do quite well here.  I understand that it was huge in Europe...so at least someone out there got to hear these great songs.
6305014140|5.0|You haven't seen this?  You're kidding right? I used to show people Akira or something Miyazaki to introduce them to anime.  Around 1993 I received a fan-subtitle of Jubai (Ninja Scroll), and fell in love.  It's like Akira Kurosawa with mixed with ... and a bit of the ultra violence.  Yeah!!<br />The plot and characters are thought out (at least by anime standards).  The animation is beautiful.  The action is as exciting as anything live action that you'll see.  It's a great film to watch over and over again, so you can understand more of the political intrigue that is going on.<br />The basic story is of a wandering warrior who falls into a situation beyond his control.  O.k., it's not the most original story, but they execute it very well.  Just watch the movie.  Don't rent it, because you're going to end up buying it anyway.<br />This movie is really violent, so if that puts you off, this film is not for you.  I know animation and non-animation fans who love this film equally.  The DVD looks great, and the subtitles are well paced.  I can't speak for the English track, because I watch the Japanese version...but most dubs are so-so IMO.
B000002AZX|4.0|you got to have every Leonard Cohen album, but you an get this one last, or next to last (the phil spector-produced disaster of an album, compilations and live albums do not count), but it is not a bad album at all. Just get all the other studio recordings first. And dance me to the end of love.
B00003CWRX|4.0|This is a true story of a man who decided to tell the world what the major tobacco companies knew about the dangers of their product. Jeffrey Wigand was a scientist employed in research for a tobacco firm. Soon after he was fired Wigand came into contact with a producer for 60 Minutes who worked closely with journalist Mike Wallace. Bergman, the producer, arranged for Wigand to be interviewed by Wallace for a 60 Minutes expose on the cigarette industry, though Wigand was still bound by a confidentiality agreement not to discuss his employment with the company. Despite Wigand's willingness to talk, CBS pulled his interview from at the last minute afterthe tobacco company threatened a multi-billion dollar lawsuit. The staff of 60 Minutes and CBS News were soon in an internal struggle over the killing of the stor. Even though Wigand's full story did not see the light of day, he found himself the subject of lawsuits and a smear campaign.
B00000064G|5.0|I hear Nick's sister interviewed on NPR and wanted to find his music... I found it here at (   ), and listened to the downloads. His sister commented on his quiet and sweet nature, and it really comes out in this music. This cd is intoxicating... it leaves a fragrance in the room long after it has finished- a night blooming moon flower... delicious and gentle. His few short recording years were a challenge to his humility, and definately to our betterment. The unfortunate thing is that it took everything he had left in his life to complete and present this music to us. What we can hold in our hands is the product of his short life. I wonder- would I rather have HIM? Depression is a thief- and yet he gave his all. Thank you, Nick.

B00004ZEQX|1.0|This thing has to be the worst movie I have ever seen.  I know that with these type of movies you kind  of have to look the other way when it comes to plot or story line it even wasnt that gory.  Considrering that Fulci made zombie which blows house away.  This by far has to be his worst movie.  Theres also a problem with the dvd my player is brand new and this dvd made my system spin very fast and make a buzzing noise but it did play the movie.

B000002BUY|5.0|i know that most reviews on here praise this cd, and think its the greatest and it makes make yourself look bad. the thing is it is different.this cd is awesome, in fact im listening to it now. it has that heavy side which makes it an addictive cd.especially #10 in the beggining, the drums come in and you are just ready for a real heavy conclusion, then it just blends. incubus is one of my favorite bands, and there drum beats are fun to play, and to listen to. they are easily the most influential and best rock bands out there, if you want a good, no excellent cd ,this is the one to get. believe me if you buy this you will not regret it!
6303168507|5.0|Schindler's List is a very very touching movie. It shows what a human being should treat others regardless of races. This is definitely one of the best moive Spielberg had ever made. Everyone should see this masterpiece because of jew's experience during WWI and we should respect them.
6302779278|3.0|...if there had been some sort of detectable chemistry between Kevin and Whitney. The love story didn't make sense. <br />The story around the love story was good, though; Kevin's character definitely some internal issues against which he continually battles (and loses). He believes he must remain detached and stoic to be an effective bodyguard. As a former secret service agent, he feels guilt over not preventing the shooting of President Reagan while being at his mother's funeral. His triumph over these issues comes at the end when he saves his &quot;love&quot; from death.
B00003RQNJ|3.0|This is a beautifully designed DVD of one of the best movies of all time, with many interesting bonus materials, most of all the contemporary documentary. The 1994 interviews are enlightening, but the film would have been worth of an updated, retrospective documentary. The title's biggest fraud though is &quot;commentary by George Roy Hill&quot;. He can be heard about three or for times on the audio track, and all statements are taken from the documentary. Robert Crawford does a nice job, but when he has to explain to us, what he thinks, Hill was thinking during a particular scene, one wonders. Conrad Hall goes from interesting to the usual trappings of documenting your work: &quot;Isn't this nice lighting?&quot;. All in all, a good buy of a great movie, with some wasted opportunities. But there's always the 35th anniversary edition, let's hope all the key players will still be around.
B000002UA0|5.0|The first thing you have to do when listening to this album, is to not expect to hear a Pink Floyd album. That might sound strange, but it's true. A lot of the negative reviews have come from people expecting to hear another &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, or &quot;The Wall&quot;, and musically this album is very different, although ironically both those albums were heavily influenced by Syd Barrett.<br />The album itself is an absolute classic, and a wonderful testement to how good Syd Barrett was when he was in control. It has aged suprisingly well, and you can hear how Syd has influenced a whole generation of &quot;indie&quot; musicians. The guitar playing is truley remarkable, although it is very differant to the style Dave Gilmour would make famous later on. Just listen to Syd playing off his own echo on &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, or his improvisation on &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;.<br />This album sounds like absolutely nothing else in the Pink Floyd catalogue, or for that matter Syd's solo material. It is the sound of a young band, led by a very talented singer,songwriter, guitarist who is on the verge of making it into the big time. What happened next would change all that, which is a shame, but at least we have this.
6305265488|5.0|Its just a feel good, clever Cinderella story. Drew Barrymore plays a great role. She picked a very clever script to refresh her career. And Anjelica Huston is the lady you almost always love to hate.<br />It has alot of great humor in it too. PLUS there is nothing offensive for young children.
0553583182|2.0|I can tell you in few words what the book is about: you just have to believe something and repeat an idea many times a day. By doing this, you are ordering your subconscious mind to do something for you (for example: repeat to yourself &quot;I will get the job&quot;, or &quot;I do not want to smoke&quot;). If you think negative ideas, your subconscious mind will believe they are true and all this negative ideas will actually happen. Well, that's it. The book repeats this same idea over and over. If you still want to buy the book, go ahead.
B00002E233|4.0|&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is a thriller about mako sharks whose brains have been genetically altered by a research team at a research facility in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The experiment soon backfires, and our man-hungry sharks are soon chasing the remaining survivors through flooded caverns and tanks. <br />The shark concept is hardly original, but one can hardly dismiss Renny Harlin's latest film as a &quot;Jaws&quot; clone. The setup for the action is different, original in its ideas but not in the message it sends us. The film is nothing more or less than a thrill machine, with lots of explosions and shark attacks to spare, but it's surprisingly entertaining, and has its share of enjoyable moments. <br />The movie begins with a shark attack that ends with no one killed or injured, though the accident causes some negative attention and trouble for Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows), who runs the research lab Aquatica. Her project involves the extracting of a genetically developed protein complex in the brains of mako sharks, in hopes that they will provide a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Her funds come from Russell Franklin, whose skepticism concerning the project results in his returning with Susan to the lab to oversee the experiment. <br />Of course, Aquatica is not your everyday research lab. Once a navy refueling station, the facility was converted into a research laboratory, complete with shark pens and an underwater lab where observation of the sharks takes place. Introducing us to various characters that will bite the bullet sooner or later, the film is quick to let go of some baggage before things get out of hand. <br />The experiment proves to be a success, but a shark attack leads to a rescue helicopter accident, causing lots of explosions and flooding various chambers and levels of the facility. With no way to call for help, the remaining survivors must try to find their way out of the water before the sharks reach them. <br />The movie sets up the terror by using a universal message popular in many of today's creature features: don't tamper with Mother Nature. Susan has genetically tampered with the brain size of the sharks as a way to harvest more proteins, though the side effect is a much smarter animal with a heightened taste for blood and freedom. Though this is not the first film to use this kind of message (we've seen it done in films like &quot;Mimic&quot; and the Jurassic Park films), it works to its advantage. <br />And the action, once it starts, doesn't stop, and is made unique by director Harlin's sense of the unknown. Any other director, and the movie would suffer from severe predictability, but Harlin infuses the story with the same suspense he did in &quot;Cliffhanger,&quot; and those who we think would be the last to die end up being the first ones to go. Did you really expect Samuel L. Jackson to go so quickly? <br />Certain scenes are very intense, creating some involving action set pieces that are very effective. The initial destruction of the facility begins with a man losing his arm and ends with the underwater observation lab being flooded as our survivors rush to escape. Another scene pits Preacher (LL Cool J) against a shark and a rapidly heating oven, ending in a spectacular explosion from which he escapes. When the climax arrives, it becomes easier to guess who will be left standing, but it's still tons of fun, nonetheless. <br />Some very entertaining performances are turned in here. Thomas Jane plays hero-for-the-day Carter Blake very effectively, and we believe in his physical drive and strength as much we do the scientific knowledge of Saffron Burrows in the role of Susan. Samuel L. Jackson, while he lasts, plays a part out of his norm, but he does it well. LL Cool J is a riot as the unconventional priest, and Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, and Jacqueline McKenzie also make appearances. <br />In a season of uninvolving thrillers like &quot;End of Days,&quot; &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; floats to success with some very effective action sequences and some good performances. Renny Harlin revisits the tactics used in his previous films, and puts them to good use here. It's not on par with &quot;Jaws,&quot; but as a film in which the race against time winds down tightly, it works.
0790733226|2.0|This movie has just about everything right about it - apart from the usual ending which is totally ridiculous. If you were about to send someone into a machine which you didn't understand, to somewhere you had no idea about etc etc (aka Stargate experience) - why send Jodie? She spends the entire end of the movie crying - I can't really see a marine getting too affected by all that.
B00000J6AG|5.0|i think moby is a talented person. This is techno, but I don't listen to this type of music often because i find it's boring, but he makes it interesting for me. i think a lot of different people can appreciate this recording.
B000002NBY|5.0|This CD is absolutly amazing. On a scale of one to five, I'd give 23. Unfortunatly, ... does not allow you to do that. I would reccommend this CD to people -9 months-235. <br />I especially enjoyed \\"I Know What I Know\\" because of its funny lyrics and catchy tune. \\"That Was Your Mother\\" and \\"Gumboots\\" are also priceless treasures.<br />This was easily my favorite Paul Simon album, which is hard to say because they are all classics which get better each time you listen to them.
B00000I8BX|5.0|What can I say about this album that already hasn't been said? Not much but I am going to try. I am a big fan of concept albums and have several in my collection including the best ever &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; by Iron Maiden. But I will admit that I did not know what to expect when I popped this one into my CD player. From that opening grind on Shock, I was sold. Here was something special. For the plot, it kind of follows the Matrix, in fact they should throw out the soundtrack and use this album since it is infinitely better, without the chosen one. Instead a serial killer is recruited to defeat the machines. The lyrics can explain it better than me though. The musicianship is phenomenal. You have Dino pounding out tons of riffs every second, Christian dishing out basslines, and Raymond riffing along with both of them on the double bass. He is easily one of the best in the industry. And through it all Burton is at the front screaming AND singing, something very rare today. In fact it is almost thrashy in some parts but mostly it is heavy, well played metal, another rare thing. The best songs are of course Shock, Edgecrusher, Smasher/Devourer (great double bass), Securitron, Descent... hell they're all awesome. So dammit get this album now.
6305014140|5.0|This movie just rocks.  There is no other like it.
0876304420|5.0|If you are interested in Ericksonian Hypsosis, you have to read the work of Stephen Gilligan.  If you haven't heard of him, I'd be surprised.  Stephen's reputation travels even more than he does.  Amongst NLP scholars he is known as Milton Erickson's &quot;best&quot; student, the person that went farthest in deep trance identification with Milton.  He really started modeling Erickson at the point that NLP left off.  I first heard of him in 1993 but only met him in 1997 at the modeling and epistemology class at NLP University in Santa Cruz.  His current work is still very compatible with what you'll read in this book. He maintains a private practice in San Diego and is an internationally known trainer.<br />This book explains the therapeutic use of trance states.  It synthesizes the approaches of Erickson, Bandler &amp; Grinder and Bateson and brings a new perspective that goes even further.  In short the basic idea to &quot;cooperate&quot;: a therapist explores how his client constructs his reality, and then helps to construct new experiential realities, which expand the client's map, with respect for the customer's unconscious thinking.  In other words, the therapist helps the client transform a problem into a solution.<br />Given we consider Stephen as one of our examples, we asked his to write the foreword of our book &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot; and we were glad that he accepted.<br />Patrick E. Merlevede, M.Sc.  -- co-author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;
0767842693|4.0|A must for film nuts; for sheer entertainment it's only average. Bogdanovich was always best when he was looking back at other movie eras. Plus, he had the help of a great book and a uniquely american author. Stark as white linen, it had a few actors coming to end of their career and a whole heapin' passel full of actors just starting. Cloris Leachman is particularly good. And just try to convince me that George Lucas didn't rip this off in &quot;American Grafitti&quot;...I'll bet he confesses on his deathbed.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Bought this for my husband for father's day.  He can't stop talking about it.  The action, the effects!!!
