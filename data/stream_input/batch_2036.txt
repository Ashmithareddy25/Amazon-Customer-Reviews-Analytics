0765325950|5.0|Very satisfying, a little bittersweet, but a good conclusion.  Still leaves you wanting more of the world, but a good conclusion, not the conclusion but a conclusion.  The wheel...
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like all the Connelly novels,  This wasn't my favorite, but was still a good read.  Now I'm ready for another &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34; book.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|If you loved the first season of American Horror Story, this may be a disppointment.  Season 1 was simple, a great haunted house story.  Season 2 is chaotic, has too many story lines (alien abduction, serial killer, nazi style experimentation, satanic possession, catholic nun and priest crimes) and sometimes pushes the limit of good taste. It seems as though the writers gave up quality for quantity and it just didn't hold my attention the way the first season did.
B0044C5Q9K|5.0|Highlights include: the chicken episode, the paintball episode, the Greendale theme song episode. Brilliant. But specific episodes aside, the way that the show builds on previous episodes is really fun.
B000066FUB|5.0|This is a great soundtrack, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrck are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Well made, high quality and excellent construction!  I am thrilled with my purchase and it's definitely worth the price.  Absolutely love the rotating stand and the tabs that keep my Kindle standing in the position it should be in.  When I read the description of the hand strap, I was skeptical; but after receiving the case I am now a believer.  The strap is comfortable and easy to use.  My much larger-handed husband tried it and was impressed.  He loves the design of the case so well that he is hoping that Marware will eventually produce a comparable case for his Nexus.  I have only had to take the Kindle from the case once, and it is possible to disengage the tablet from the case, but I had to have my husband do it for me.  I also wish it had a slot for my pen.  Overall it is an outstanding choice, and you won't be disappointed!
B000001EIN|5.0|This is a great soundtrack, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrck are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B009VB7QQA|4.0|For those of you who are looking for a fun, stylized, and outrageous movie to watch with friends and family.  Check it out!
B000VYX8PE|3.0|Was curious and read this book...  I would recommend it for a child to read.  Intelligent children and despicable adults.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another page turner by Jodi Picoult.In the style that I have  come to look forward to. Couldn't WAIT TO READ THE NEXT PAGE
0307277887|3.0|Usually people say the opposite, but in this case I think the show is better than the book. It might be because I saw the show first, but whatever. I have read other books after seeing the movie and have liked them better than said movie. Plus the books don't have nudity and Showtime does. Winner winner chicken dinner.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Couldn't put it down!! Graphics were really good. Could have been a little more challenging. Fun to play, lots of detail.
1250007208|5.0|*I received a copy of this book as a gift from a friend.*<br />Truly an updated version of Cinderella, but this is like nothing that I have ever seen, especially when we are talking about androids and cyborgs. Now, when someone says Cinderella to me, robotics are the last thing that comes to mind. But the author makes in work, and work extremely well. I felt horrible for Cinder as she goes through many challenges, the worst is when she loses her step-sister to the plague that has struck the planet. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, and will be anxiously awaiting the release of the next book. There are some of the standard bits that one expects out of Cinderella, but this is so much better, especially if you are a fantasy/sci fi fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|no bugs no glithes no ads its great more refined than temple run. tr2 blew charts in ios it will do the same on amazon and android
B000F8O35U|5.0|I love this movie and it came quickly and in great new condition. I couldnt have chosen a better product to order.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent from the first page to the last. I saw the movie, &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; and as good as it was it leaves out some details that are covered in this book. I couldn't put it down.
B0045XICB2|3.0|i broke down and had to watch the series, since everyone else in the world already had. i'm 29 so if you're a teen i'm sure it's fine, but these movies somehow grab your attention and make you want to finish the story, but are cinematically pretty awful. lots of people raved about the effects and acting but actually it's pretty terrible. to be fair, taylor laudner (or whatever) is actually pretty good, he's the best one of the bunch. otherwise, snore.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|It made you think about what was really happening. Full of a lot of action and keeps you on the edge of your seat!

B00AA7O22U|4.0|This is a great action packed movie with many of your favorite actors. Also has some funny lines here and there.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|good movies, thought the Elementary series gives it a run for its money. can't go wrong with robert downey jr ever
B005RYF5JA|4.0|I bought this last year as a birthday present for my mom. She loved it! She has watched them on TV before and now she can pop in the DVD anytime she wants.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|robert downey jr is always a good bet, these are entertaining and of course the story is good as well. it's nice that sherlock's methodology is so flawed in these, and yet i wish his deductions were as intriguing as in Elementary
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy playing mystery manor.  its fun and relaxing.  I love the new challenges.  this is one of my favorite games to play.
B0060CXN2O|5.0|everybody loves this classic. much better than the lindsay lohan remake, an oldie and a goodie. worked well and everythign was fine
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game I just wish the cards were bigger but all in all it is easy to use
B009SQRL4U|5.0|this is a good movie for adults and older toddlers (and probably younger ones too), entertainment for all. good purchase
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|GREAT!!!!!!!!! I love this book!!!! thank you Colleen! I couldn't put this one down! I bought it last night and I stayed up to read the whole thing! It's like you were right there with sky and Dean, I laughed and I cried with them.
B000YHG72E|4.0|and why not? light entertainment, sometimes raunchy if you've got little ones, but entertaining. could watch repeatedly til the corny end
0877180121|5.0|Pleased to see that these books are still available. I miss the elves that used to be on my books, 25 yrs ago but this is great for my little boy as I begin to teach him.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|The first infant toy we purchased for our son four years ago was Lamaze's Freddie Firefly. He and we loved it so much that Sir Prance A Lot is the first toy we purchased for our new daughter. We also bought some other Lamaze plush toys, and they're all fantastic. Simple, safe, but very novel for infants exploring their senses. Highly recommend
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I love this movie and watching it on Amazon Instant on all of my devices has made it even better.
B001LM1456|5.0|this is a good version of the classic character, and everybody loves ed norton. funny, interesting, not terribly scary for my son
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I had come off a string of bad books when I tried this one out. It was self published and cheap for the kindle so I didn't expect much. I was blown away. Great and memorable characters, interesting narrative and a pace that kept me hooked.<br /><br />You follow the story of Vaelin al'Sorna from childhood to adulthood. The relationships he forges among his brothers and the trials they all face are wonderfully written and will keep you hooked. A rich and harsh world only aids you in sharing the struggles Vaelin faces.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this book was it had to end.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|and why not? rick moranis? you can't go wrong. my son loved the idea of this movie and it's totally 90's-rific.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have this for my Wii and always loved it.  Now on my Kindle fire and it is exactly the same.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I wondered if this would be challenging or interesting enough to keep my interest, not being much of a gamer, and I'm pleased to write that it is \\"all that and a bag of chips\\" as they say in NJ.  Lots of fun and high production values, great effort by the Zepto team!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game provides hours of fun for me and my daughter.  It is addicting and keeps you coming back just like Temple Run.
B000RZGIOA|5.0|I purchased this movie for my husband. He loves the movie. It's a classic and a must see for any Nick Cage fans. Fun action movie and a good(though far fetched in my opinion) plot. One thing that we love about this movie is that they thought of everything. I love to &#34;poke holes&#34; in the plots of movies but Face/Off has an answer for every plot hole I tried to point out.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Good books, but I occasionally felt frustrated because Katniss was such a smart and courageous girl, yet she didn't really question the society she lived in. She didn't rebel against it or even voice opinions about the morality of what she was forced to do. She just seemed to play along as best she could. I think it would be a better book if she showed a little more independent thought, some opinions, some deeper emotional angst, and some searching for answers. I've read a lot of coming of age novels. A good book about a young woman who is smart, sensitive, and searching while living in a crazy time in the future is The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza, by C. C. Alma. [[ASIN:B00AC5MLZ0 The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza]]  I also love The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, [[ASIN:B005PRJT9Q The Secret History]]  a beautifully written long novel about college students in the 1980's. Overall, though, I would recommend these books.
B004G6009U|5.0|This is, with out a doubt, me and my husband's favorite Disney movie. It is a wonderful, heart warming story. The movie is funny and exciting and something that we will watch again and again. I can't wait to share this movie with my own kids someday.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like Jeremy Renner in lead role, but it worked. I hope they continue the story!! Love how they always leave it open.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|It is a really great game until it stops and doesn't go any farther. It was doing awesome until it was purchased...like a lot  of these games.  They are all beginning to be the same way. Not to say they are not enjoyable ...just not reliable to an end.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you have seen the other 4 seasons, then you know why you must see this season! Love the flashback to the 60s and the evolution of advertising.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|can't stop playing. It's unlike other games it isn't easy to win in normal mode it takes actual stragety to play
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Figuring out how to do everything takes a bit of getting used to but overall the game is fun. I would still take diner dash over this game though.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like this app. It is very easy to use; it's pretty much the same as checking email on a regular computer or laptop. Plus, being able to check it on the go (with a Wi-Fi connection, of course) is so much better and easier than getting on a regular computer.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|By now you've probably heard &#34;Radioactive&#34; or &#34;It's Time,&#34; but by buying the whole album you will learn that all the tracks are just as good as the first. I particularly love &#34;On Top Of The World.&#34;  I am happy to have added Imagine Dragon's album to my library.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is truly addictive. I should really be doing other things but I find myself drawn to this game like the moth to the flame.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I have been listening to this album repeatedly and cannot seem to get enough. Nate Ruess has such a unique voice, I love listening to it. The auto-tuned portions of the songs create a certain element of fun and only enhance this album's already awesome tracks.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the back and forth approach, which keep me interested. Was very surprised at the ending.  Worth the read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy this game, especially for a time killer, True, its almost identical to Temple Run just set in a different enviroment. This is a fun little game that will entertain for as long as needed! Your running from a policemen of somesort because he caught you spraying graffiti on a train. You have to jump, Dodge, Duck, fly and otherwise avoid oncoming trains as you try to escape him. You save coins for upgrade and perks. As you play the game play gets a little faster and a little faster until eventually you will lose, lol. Great little game! We really enjoy it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|When I first heard that Les Mis&eacute;rables was going to be made into a movie musical, I was really excited.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was the cast...this was before I knew who was going to play each part.  I was basically ecstatic when I learned who would be in the movie...<br /><br />He's no Colm Wilkinson, but Hugh Jackman, in my opinion was incredible as Jean Valjean.  I knew he could sing since I had seen the video of him in \\"Oklahoma!\\" several years ago.  He's also been on stage several times.  He made the part his own and did a wonderful job.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway surprised me.  I knew she had a nice singing voice, but I had no idea that she had a *beautiful* singing voice.  Besides the fact that during 'I Dreamed a Dream' the camera was way too close to her face, her voice is beautiful and you really feel Fantine's pain.  I just wish that the camera wasn't so in her face...literally.  Other than that, watching her get her hair cut on screen (yes they really cut it there so it had to be done in only one take!) was really brave of her.  Her 'Come to Me' brought me to tears.<br /><br />Russell Crowe....well he tried!  I thought he actually did a pretty good job, but looking at the cast as a whole, he was one of the weakest voices.  His acting was spot on as always, but his voice needed a little work; however, if you look at it from the point of view that Javert is not a nice person and is actually the 'bad guy' of the film/show, then his voice was perfect.  Prior to seeing the movie, I had no idea that Crowe had any musical training.  I then learned that he did have a few months of training for the movie and that he has sung before (I think in a band, but I'm not sure).<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried as Cosette... While she does have a beautiful voice (as we heard in \\"Mamma Mia!\\"), I'm not sure that she was the best actress for this role.  She was perfectly fine with the acting.  It was the singing.  Whenever she sang with Eddie Redmayne (Marius) and Samantha Barks (Eponine), she was literally drowned out.  Plus her high notes are rather shrill.  She was never off pitch or out of tune, but those high notes did bother me a bit.  Also, I'm not sure how many others noticed this, but her vibrato was very fast.  I don't know the musical term for that, but it didn't sound very controlled.  Her voice seemed different in \\"Mamma Mia!\\".  Looking beyond that though, I did enjoy her scenes.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne as Marius was absolutely perfect.  He has a beautiful voice.  I had never heard of him before this and I hope he continues to do musical theatre.  Everything about his character simply fit like a glove.  My favorite Marius will always be Michael Ball, but he's too old to play the part now.  However I am glad that they found Eddie.<br /><br />Samantha Barks was also perfect as Eponine. She had previously been in the West End production of the show including the 25th anniversary concert so I knew she'd be great.  I just wish the character had more on screen time!<br /><br />And then of course you have Sacha Baron Cohen as Th&eacute;nardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Th&eacute;nardier were great.  They didn't have the strongest singing voices, but their acting helped to cover that.  I just wish that their whole song at the wedding was in the movie.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was wonderful as well.  I especially loved that Colm Wilkinson himself made an appearance as the Bishop who takes Valjean in at the beginning of the movie.  His voice still sounds like that of an angel.  Having Aaron Tveit play Enjolras was great, seeing as he has been in several Broadway shows.<br /><br />From a cinematic point of view, this movie was brilliant.  It really felt like you were in 1800s Paris.  One of the things that I also found very interesting was having the cast sing live as opposed to lip-syncing to previously recorded singing.  I thought at first that we weren't going to be able to hear some of the charactersin certain scenes since there is a lot of noise in the background, but it worked.  Future filmmakers should think about doing this when the next movie musical is made.  I applaud Tom Hooper for doing such a wonderful job with this movie.  It is not easy to turn a beloved stage musical into a movie, but this really worked.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the show and don't mind a new song (Suddenly) and a few music changes here and there (changes in the order of the songs), then I highly recommend this movie to you.  If you've never seen the stage musical or heard the music like my husband (who by the way loved the movie and said it was one of the most powerful movies he's ever seen), then you should see it too.  Oh yeah...remember to bring tissues...since there is a lot of noise in the background, but it worked.  Future filmmakers should think about doing this when the next movie musical is made.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game<br />overly sensitive to touch and lets you buy online so watch your kids and settings.  I play this game every day and love it.  lots of rewards and easy quests.
030758836X|5.0|That's what I like best when I read a thriller - not being able to predict what's next. This story led me by the nose right to the end. Great plot that sucks you right in.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AVB46K8 Wintertide: A Novel]]
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very addictive. It didn't take but 3 minutes and we were hooked. The kids took my kindle away from me
B00136Q342|4.0|This is a great album with plenty of Johnny Cash's best songs.  This version includes several songs that were not on the original release.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|It worked just fine but it reminded me of a more modern Atari game. I'm sure it was just not mything
0525478817|5.0|Beautiful. Elegant. Brutally Honest. Absolutely fantabulously amazing.<br /><br />I love John Green's writing! I completely and utterly worship his literary genius! If you have not yet read any of his work, I implore you to please pick this one up! This book is an incredible read. It's one of those books that gets inside you, curls itself around your heart and then stays there forever. I will never be able to forget the brilliance that is The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />In classic John Green style; this book is amusing, witty, and very thought-provoking. I loved every single moment of it. It's about three young cancer patients who are willing to make fun of themselves, who are cynical yet optimistic and who are just trying to survive. They made me laugh out loud and cry for the crap hand they were dealt. I felt emotionally connected to every single character, from the cancer patients to their friends and family. Hell, I could even sympathise a little with that Amanda bitch. This book also brought up the issue of death and oblivion a lot. While this may seem depressing, I have actually never wanted to get out there and live my life to the fullest than after finishing it! It really got me thinking about what I believe and what I would do if I knew that I was dying. God, this book is just SO good.<br /><br />I worry that a lot of people will be hesitant to read this because of its depressing contents. I too am a little bit guilty of this; I put this one off for a while because I was unsure about reading something that I knew would break my heart. And yes, it is depressing and you will probably cry but this is definitely a story worth reading. This story is flat out honest, it doesn't sugar coat any of the issues. It has opened my mind to things that I never would have contemplated before; about life, love and death. I think this is a great story for anyone of any age.<br /><br />All living humans - PLEASE READ THIS.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think it stared by being bored and just thought the biohazard symbol looked cool. After getting it and many many hours playing, this is a must have. I would like to see a update for more odd mutations
B00AREIAI8|4.0|excellent game it is super fun and awesome I would recommend it to anyone who likes horses. I definitely love it!
0393064476|4.0|this book was a gift and the review from the recipient follows:<br />This book will be of particular interest to book lovers, literary fanatics.<br />Author gives you enough historical context to keep you informed and interested.
1590171993|5.0|Beautifully written, sad and uplifting, and very entertaining. This deserves to be published by the Library of America series; it is as good as anything I've read by any American author. And I normally have no interest in novels about college academic life. Absolutely brilliant.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is the most well written sensual book I have ever read. The main character's attraction to one another is so powerful that they can not stay away from each other. I've read my share of these sort of books, but I couldn't put this book down. Had to read the entire trilogy. One of the characters is a little sick but given that he has a horrible childhood I can understand some things.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an exceptional book. It isn't a book with an overbearing problem. It is just... there. My favorite thing about it is that you can interpret it in anyway you want. There is so much stuff that can make you think.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|From beginning to end. Loved every chapter<br />Highly recommended for a fun and quick read.<br />Read cover to cover on plane ride!
0988262592|5.0|I am writing this review because I met Gene yesterday at a vendor event and I want to thank him. He gave the most fascinating and well executed presentation at the event. Due to being captivated by the presentation, I decided that unlike normal, I should actually read the freebie book. So kudos to Gene the person, because even though I normally think I should, I usually don't get around the actual reading.<br /><br />I read the book in one go, it was a nice easy page turner, that my tired brain could easily digest on the plane. The beauty of it is, in this easy novel package, it really gives you an excellent picture of the flaws of running IT in most organizations, and what you can do to remove those flaws, how to gain more efficiencies, and which flaws to avoid fixing. I would like to thank all 3 writers for making it easy for me to gain understanding why I need to be part of significant change in my IT organization.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is just too boring...if you want a fun game get subway surfers. this is just like the first temple run and you'll end up getting bored of this after a day
B007BFSYMS|3.0|The app is very nice except for one glaring flaw:  YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF! I have no clue why the developer thought this would be a good idea. It may end up making me uninstall.  Very annoying.  Using 'force stop' every time is just irritating.  Fix this, please.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|From start to finish, The Lumineers' self-titled debut album is a good listen.  I'd been slow in checking it out.  As it is currently number one on the Spotify charts, I thought now's the time to listen to it. It's understandable that they're number one.  The band is talented, and its songs are simple yet catchy.<br /><br />The Lumineers have similarities to bands like Mumford & Sons, The Head and The Heart, and The Avett Brothers.  Their feet lay in the Americana tradition, primarily drawing from folk-rock.  Unlike most music on the top of the charts, their music is mostly unpolished.  There are no gimmicks.  Just the singer's voice, an acoustic guitar, percussion, and cello blended together. The band has stated that their songs are `ones anybody can play'. It does sound like the songs were written and performed quickly. Compared to Mumford and Sons, the rhythms and craft of this album are less complex.  There are no fast banjo solos.<br /><br />Most of the songs deal with love. The lyrics aren't poetic; they are heartfelt but also simple. Almost every song can put you in a happy mood. My favorite tracks (besides the mega hit \\"Ho Hey\\") are \\"Stubborn Love\\", \\"Classy Girls\\", \\"Flowers In Your Hair\\", and \\"Big Parade\\". The rest of the album is mostly good. Some tracks have big choruses, while others are slower.  I prefer the ones with the big choruses.  My only complaint with the album is that all the songs use the same formula. It can sound monotonous. (4.25 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (01/24/2013)
B00000DLUV|5.0|One of the best shows I've seen of the Bee Gees. It is especially meaningful now that Maurice and Robin are dead so this really was a one night only. Beautiful performance by Celine Dion, too, and with Olivea Newton John in the audience it truly was a one off.
075669812X|5.0|My son wanted this for Christmas and he got it.  He carried this book everywhere he went and the figure that comes with it apprently is pretty hard to find.  It was a great gift!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great for passing time if you have to wait a little while. It gives you some great ideas for DIY. I don't think I'll ever stop using this app. I have it on my Kindle and my IPhone.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|It was a little dark and very sad for a child to watch who has lost a pet.  It would be for an older child.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This one is absolutely addictive! I quickly recommended it to all of my game player buddies. Congratulations to the developers!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Any one who enjoys a good mind game would love playing this game. It keeps you interested. you hate to put it down.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app..does what it's suppose to do along with some added features.  I recommend to my daughter and she loves it as well..even deleted her other app.
B004KKXMSI|4.0|Just saw the first part, It's good to watching the movie again in blu-ray. Audio and video is good. Let me watch another two part will post rest soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an incredible third installment to the series. Definitely not your traditional ending. I like something that leaves you conflicted. Not something that wraps together nicely, everything butterflies and unicorns. Peeta's torture, Katniss' injuries and psychological battle. Loved it.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Wow! Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy! The book was amazing.. Kept me biting my fingers the whole time!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Hands down, one of the best albums of 2012.  Maybe of all time.  It is one of those albums that you must listen to in it's entirety.  An Awesome Wave will not disappoint, but will pull you in and surprise you. and then make you listen to it again. Definitely a must-see band as I'm sure they are amazing live.  My only question to Alt J is, WHERE IS THE VINYL?!  please please please!
0316789720|5.0|Simple art. Breaks everything down to triangles, lines and circles. Even I can draw a truck or bridge or lion!
B003Y5H574|4.0|Waiting to watch with daughter. Love the reviews. Gave as a gift because she said it was wonderful & it was mum & daughter time together for this one.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Played through the tutorial, but now the game crashes every time I try to launch. So scrappy that its like this. would love to play more.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|So very true to life, back then and even now days and not just in the south. Reminds me of England and NOBS vs PEONS.
B009VLX8FS|2.0|There's only a handful of decent songs on here. She has turned into a pop artist through and through, and it is often difficult to find a hint of her country roots. There are some catchy songs on here, don't get me wrong, but I feel as if TSwift has regressed in age in a majority of them. Instead of sounding like a mature, young adult, she has written and recorded songs that sound as if she is 15 and clearly are intended for that audience (think &#34;Never Ever Getting Back Together&#34;). Huge disappointment for a long time Taylor fan! If her next album doesn't reflect an understanding that she let a lot of her original fans (I've loved her since &#34;Teardrops on My Guitar&#34; first came on the radio!), then I'll have to realize she just sold out and I'll need to find another young artist to cheer for. Maybe I'll just switch teams to Hunter Hayes anyway...So far he seems consistently country!!
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Was bought for Grandson. Not watched by me but he loved it and watches with his brother and mum and then shares/swaps with buddies.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie you will certainly enjoy the soundtrack.<br /><br />I have been listening to it throughout the day and it helps to keep you going!
B008RNGCAO|5.0|I put off buying it because I didn't really have funds to blow on graphic novels at the time. If I had known it was this good I would have done it immediately. I will certainly be getting the others in the near future
B0055SWM08|4.0|A delightful game - though it seems like it would be more Zen if it were less about being perfect.  Still a good brain exercise and I love the music and rainy backgrounds.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|11/22/2013  They changed this app a few months ago.  I've been trying to use it because I liked it so well but I find myself constantly going to the accuweather app now.  They added something called mpoints, where you get points for using the app so if you are in to mpoints you might like it but I just want a simple easy to use app.  I want to be able to get the current and at least 5 day forcaste and to check the radar.  In my opionion they took a great app and really messed it up.<br /><br />Original review<br />I use this on a Kindle Fire HD bought Sept. 2012.  I fully admit that I'm a collector of Free Apps but eventually you have to decide what Apps are really worth having.  I had this App before we made a trip home to the family on Christmas 2012.  I put in my home location and several locations along the route to our destination and of course our destination.  First, it is really easy to put in detinations since you can do either zip codes or you can start typing the city name and several choices will pop up for you to select.  I never had to type an entire city and state so that was nice.  We used this constantly on the Christmas trip to see what was forcaste and when for each of the locations we had to drive through.  By having this app we knew we needed to leave about 12 hours earlier than we planned or we would be snowed out of our long driveway by the time we got home. (We made it home and then got snowed in rather than snowed out) I still use this app a lot anytime I want to see the forcaste or current weather for my home location or where my 79 year old dad or where my 80 year old mother-in-law lives.  Also, once you set one of these locations as your home when you swipe from the top to see notifications etc., you will see the current temperature and weather for your current location without opening the app.  Yes, the App would have to be running in background to do this even after you have closed the app.  If you want to kill it see my review on the Android Assistant App.  You could also not set a location as your home as this would not happen.  I have Enable Location-based Services set to Off for my Kindle Fire so this is just based on the location you set to home in the App. (Touch one of the locations on the Locations screen and hold down until a screen pops up for you to nickname, delete, or set a the location as home).<br /><br />When you open this App it opens at the option you last had it at when you opened it.<br />The options are at the bottom of the screen are:<br />(1)  Locations:  Shows all the locations you have entered with their current weather and temperature(I have 9 right don't know if there is a limit on the number.)<br />(2)  Weather: Shows one location at a time with more details and a red exclamation point if there is a severe alert for that location.  To see the other locations swipe left to right or rght to left depending on where you are in your list of locations.  If you tap the red exclamation point, your screen will change to the severe alert for that location.  The \\"Severe\\" option at the bottom of the screen will also be hight lighted now.<br />(3)  Maps:  This option has 3 options which are right above the Locations, Weather, Maps, etc. options.  They are Points, Layers, and Map Types.  I mainly use Layers and choose radar.  The other options to choose here are clouds, Clouds/Radar, Curr. Temp., 24hr rainfall, 24hr snowfall, curr wind speed, and traffic. The points option has stuff like parks, golf courses, schools, etc.  The map types are road map and satellite.  This is something that you just need to ply with to see what will be useful to you.<br />(4) Severe:  This shows the severe weather alerts for you locations and a few paragraphs of text as to what the severe alert is and the times it is in effect.  Only one locations alert is shown on the screen at the time.  Swipe left to rigt or right to left to see the other locations.<br />(5)  Social:  Thse shows tweets of other localpeople or you have the option to choose nearby instead of local.  I care very little about this so don't use it.<br />(6)  Videos:  This is just a lot of (most of the time)weather related videos.  The top video is a forcast related to the location at the top of the screen(again swipe L-R or R-L for other locations) Swipe down to see more videos.  Right now the videos on my screen are 60 second forcaste, Ice in the South, Ice Cause Hundreds of Wrecks, Smart Phon Traffic Jam, Solar Eruption Headed To Earth, Freezing Rain Grounds Travelers, and moe if I swipe down(actuall bottom to top of screen).  At times when there wasn't much weather I have seen a bunch of pet videos so be forewarned.<br />(7)  iWitness.  Opops this might be where the pet videos are.  Obviously, I don't use these las two otions a lot either,  This says iwitness weather.  Seeit, Send it.  Share it.  and right now it says Pet Photos and Videos but there is a category option with too many to mention that you can change it to or you can choose nearby or featured.  There is also an upload icon if you want to upload your videos.  Sorry I haven't trird this.<br />(8)  In Season:  Allergy sufferers can see pollen data.  I have to go to Locations and pick the location I want and then select the In Season option.  I do not seem to be able to swipe L-R or R-L when I am in the In Season option to see pollen for other locations,<br />(9)  Settings  There's several options here for the App plus a Tips & Tricks that is a link to a web page for data about this App.<br /><br />That's about all I have time for right now but will update if I see a need later.  I have tried the accuweather App but find this one so simple and straight forward that I prefer it.  Maybe it is because I used this one first, maybe not.<br /><br />Get this App and play with all the options.  It works great on My Kindle Fire HD and I haven't had any problems.people or you have the option to choose nearby instead of local.

B003UAKE9Y|5.0|This is my daughters favorite movie.  I was so happy to find it at such an affordable price!  The movie shipped very quickly and will make a perfect Birthday present.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|This is a great price on an automatic day/date watch. The band is decently made yet a bit narrow. Be aware that this watch is quite small, about the size of a quarter, I believe it would be better suited for a woman's or child's wrist due to the small size. I have another of the Seiko 5 line, a diver style, and it dwarfs this diminutive version. If you can live with the size, then go for it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series best I've read in a long time recommended now to see the movie can't wait hope it does the book justice
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I really enjoyed this and look forward to reading the other books in the Sinister collection.  Milan wove a great tale with history and detail.  I loved the strategy and slowly emerging love.  Enjoy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I didn't think that this game would be SO fun! It's very addictive and you don want to put it down, very good game to play. But make sure you have a lot of time to play because you won't want to put<br /> It down!
0670022950|5.0|Pinker always blows my mind once every two chapters or so.  This work does the same, but is his greatest offering yet because it is so relevant.  I can think of few other myths more worthy of assault than the ones tackled here.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I haven't read it yet, but I have read the rest of the Camel Club series, so I am sure I will enjoy it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|..... they forgot to add &lt; after playing for a few chapters, you can BUY the full game for $2.99&gt; I did, I like the game...  you get nice graphics, 3 levels of play, enlarged hidden object screen, different types of puzzels,  best of all, it plays very well on my kindle fire hd.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Very happy with these. They block out almost all outside noise, and don't leak any volume out. Sound is perfect. They are a bit tight on my head, which would be my only (small) gripe.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This movie was awkward and painful to watch.  The performances were great, but the characters were unlikable and unbelievable.  The wife was too long-suffering to be real and the husband was unrealistically detached from reality.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A Higher Call is the very unique story of two pilots who meet in the skies over Germany. What happens touches their lives forever but was untold for so very many years. The research that was accomplished is incredible - so many details. Since both pilots are now gone, the story stands as a legacy to to the phrase - hate the war but not the soldiers.<br />I am not much of a reader but I really enjoyed this book. It has it's somewhat boring pages throughout, but overall it is a great piece of writing and best of all - it's a true story. If you are into these kinds of books, don't hesitate to buy this one. You won't regret reading it and it leaves you with a warm feeling for mankind. Well worth the read!
B000OIZSVY|5.0|I never thought grammar could be so amusing. As a pr and journalist student at university, I often had professors with different preferences on punctuation. Reading Truss' novel gave me insight to why my Harvard or Oxford comma might get marked in red, and tips for proceeding in writing. I loved it - what a great find!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Big buttons to see easily,multiple uses,and just plain fun. Since I gave up my laptop and went to the tablet,this has been wonderful. Best of all it was free. Keep up the great work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run is back and better than ever. it's faster, harder,  and just plain old better! the screen may be harder to tilt.and I have no idea what happened to those apes or what ever they are. now it's one big and I mean big guy! but, also, the screen is a bit sensitive. but never give up! ( even if there is no end!)
B000FC12YQ|4.0|This book was interesting, and the end actually surprised me which doesn't happen a lot!  Also nice to read a book where there isn't a lot of cussing/smut.  Would definitely recommend this to friends and even teens.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My boyfriend saw this on TV while visiting family in FL.  He suggested that I order the DVD because I would love the movie.  We both love to surf and now that we are in NC, surfing is not something we get to do anymore.<br /><br />This is a great movie and it was received in like new condition.  I always try to order from the same sellers that I've used before and will look for this seller the next time I am ordering DVD's.
B006QS07IK|4.0|its a good product but if you want an edited version find it somewhere else. it even has a book with it.
0937381888|5.0|Not too much detail, but enough to really get you started, to understand and get you doing it the right way. I definitely recommend.
0792164903|5.0|This movie has some definite cheese-factor going on, but it's a great watch on nights leading up to Halloween; everyone turns in at the least a serviceable performance, and the visuals are, of course, gothy, absurd, and delightful. I can't speak to how this compares to other editions of the movie, but I was satisfied with this one.
B004EPZ084|5.0|What can I say, Im a Jason Sudekis fan, a Charlie Day fan and Jason Bateman fan. And Jennifer Anniston is super hot in this flick.
0440133688|5.0|This was compelling. I started out hating it, and by the end, I couldn't put it down. I have a vested interest in medicine--applying to medical school--and I think reading this really puts some things into perspective. Modern debates about resident work-hours often reference this book, and I think they should.<br /><br />I have no intention of reading it twice. Being made sad once was plenty. But I am glad I read it, both from an informational and an artistic point of view.
B005USZYDU|2.0|I have read all three of the current books in this series. Theodore Boone: kid lawyer, the abduction, and the accused. I have always enjoyed John Grisham's books. Kid Lawyer, is on the Charlie May Simon Children's Book Award 2012-2013 reading list,  so when my 4th grader checked out this book from the Primary school library, being a fan of John Grisham, I read it. Then chose not to allow my child to read it, due to the gray area that it promotes between the parents and Theodore.  These books are very well written and edited, as one would expect of any John Grisham book. However, I do not think that these books should  be in a Primary or Elementary library. It is human nature to lean to toward gray areas.  I believe that children of any age do not need to be exposed to literature that promotes gray areas. When I tell my children that they can always come to me and tell me anything, then allow them to read books that promote deception, even temporarily, I'm sending them a mixed message.  So, why did I purchase, the abduction, and the accused? It was an impulse buy, before I finished, kid lawyer. In the subsequent books the gray area becomes wider. Bottom line; wrong target audience.
0385336950|5.0|I started reading this book thinking it was Cloud Atlas: A Novel by David Michell's book, but was I wrong. Overall though, I thought it was a really great book. One of the best I've read in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for a good book.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|while setting up favorite combination of sounds..it shut me down 3x in past 5 min.  Never happen b4<br />other than this issue I love this app..better then any others I've tried.  sharp clear sounds.  set a Favorite for me &amp; my Grandson (4 1/2 mo)  amazing what calms him...birds..rain..wind ..zen..oh yea chimes.  I that yo anything I listen to.  hope you enjoy it as much as baby &amp;me.  :-)
B001CB8NQE|5.0|A long-time fan of the SG series, this completed my collection.  Since there are no more re-runs, this is great for scheduling my own show schedule.  Wish someone would resurrect the series.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the graphics. Great game if you are like me and don't like timed games. Finally a non timed game that let's you advance as far as you can go until you have no more moves and have to start again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have always loved Temple Run but this just amazing.  It has fifteenth levels you can go through (witch is the one thing I wish Temple Run had).  You have to tilt your device a lot for it to work but it is still a great app.  It Isa lot more difficult then Temple Run one.  I would suggest this to anyone, so press the download button now.  :)
0634023020|5.0|After straining through the Joe Pass songbook (i.e. direct transcriptions of his solo pieces), this book is a bit more friendly and no less satisfying, as far as the music goes.  Chord/melody is very nice: the chord voicings are inventive, but not overly so.  The solos have a way of keeping the chord progressions intact and move easily and artistically.  Great fun.  I've been working on &#34;Seven Steps to Heaven.&#34;  Enjoy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Suspenseful and gritty, this CIA verses FBI verses the bad guys drama is Mitch Rapp and the crew at their best. There are so many twists and turns that you need a seat belt to read it! Vince Flynn is a master at directing a great cast of characters. Every page of this book seems as if it came from the newspaper, or at least a CIA Top Secret briefing. Flynn has a great grip on the clandestine service operations. I highly reccommend this exciting read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't know were to begin this game has so many great qualities. For sure I know its more challenging than the first and way more better. Imangi Studios you did a great job on this game make more games like this PLEASE!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so wonderful to have all the versions of the Bible readily available without having to buy them. I find it makes me read more.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|This is a video for children and as such is entertaining.  The story and video need to be updated for today's viewing, but nothing wrong with it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game is fun and addicting. But there aren't enough coins/day. I<br />play every day, but it would be nice to play longer.
0802473156|5.0|Quick and easy read. straight to the point. relateable by both men and women. good compliment to free online quiz.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|this game hasn't been updated in forever when are you going to update and what is up with the Jedi level why would I pay two bucks for one level
B007GCY8FS|2.0|It  is impossible to not like Jack Teacher but having read  all of the series I found this one disappointing.  The beginning was slow,and the entire book was very convoluted.<br />H9wever I will be on board for the next one.
034580404X|5.0|My daughter asked for this reading and I bought it for her. I don't believe she has read any of it yet but what can go wrong with a book. My transaction was easy and I would buy from again.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson has never disappointed me and this is no exception.  In fact this is the best movie he has made.  It is funny, sweet, disturbing, and creative.  Great soundtrack as always!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Even though I've had zero training on piano, I COULD play using this method. Very enjoyable. Easy to difficult levels.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|I am totally addicted to this game. It seems really easy, at first, but gets harder as you go! You really need to think about the moves that you are going to make.
B0000CFW87|5.0|My whole life I've been raised in music. My dad had been singing and dancing in professional groups since he was able to walk and talk. He's always given us many genres of music to listen to, but we all have our personal favorites. While I personally began with Disney Chanel music and progressed from there, my dad always listened to his own music. One day I came upstairs to beautiful foreign language songs. I immediately asked what he was listening to. He told me Josh Groban's name and I instantly went to the nearest computer and uploaded his music to my MP3.<br />I have many favorites, (among which \\"Oceano\\" and \\"Remember When It Rained\\" will always be firmly placed) but all the songs bring a smile to my face. Often I find myself turning on the music during work, and most often with my dad in the kitchen, and we both sing along to the English lyrics. I leave the foreign languages to my dad.<br />The only problem I have found with this particular disk- which isn't really a true problem, more like a lovable quirk- is the amount of non-English lyrics. Of the 13 songs on this disk, seven are foreign language. If you are looking for a set of songs to listen to that you can actually understand by this singer, you'd have better luck with his CD \\"Illuminations\\" because though it also has 13 songs, only three are non-English.<br />All in all, I will forever be a Josh Groban Fan. His music flows and fills the mind with beautiful scenes. It is right for any religion, any age, and any occasion.
B001LF347E|5.0|I find the fantasy of the Merlin episodes fascinating.  I shall collect them all for inclusion in my media library.  Amazon had them to me exactly as promised & everything for my viewing pleasure, perfect.
B000QCQ8Y4|2.0|Child has become so successful with his Reacher books that he doesnt have to worry whether the book is truly satisfying to his readers. This book , like a number of others of his, has some good parts, but the plot and the writing have dropped below the pulp fiction level. Unfortunately, I'll probably still buy another in the hopes that there's still some good Reacher books out there, but save your money on this one.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This movie felt like a throwback to some of my favorite movies of all time. I couldn't put my finger on it at first as to why i enjoyed the movie so much. It didn't seem like anything revolutionary as far as the plot goes. It just sucks you in and makes you enjoy it. It's an absolute bad-@$$ movie from start to finish. The super slow-mo was a little overused at first, but in some scenes it really was unique. Of course there are some great over-the-top scenes of graphic violence. Dredd came off as a total boss without over-acting the part. I hope this movie gets plenty of underground attention so they will make the two rumored sequels they had planned. Buy this movie now!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it great the best game ever yay must get it the best app for android get it now while still free Cu's it might start costing money
B007BFSYMS|4.0|If you need help falling asleep, this app may be your salvation. I loved listening to rain storms from the safety of my bed at night when I was a child. This app returns me to that happy space when I play any of the rain choices. For variation, there's a thunderstorm. If they they add a good mockingbird singing through the night, I'll rate them 5 stars!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Bought this as an extra so I could charge it while I was gaming... that way I do not have to wait for my controller to charge and pause at the good parts of the game (which is always when they die). For some reason, the handle parts feel different, but overall I am happy with my purchase!
B005QUQP76|5.0|Out of all the mice I have purchased over the years this one is pretty darn good. I would recommend it.
0321885112|5.0|This handbook is a fantiastic compliation of tips and examples of Sketchnoting, or visual note taking. The best part about it is that Mike Rhode has written the book itself in Sketchnotes, which makes it incredibly engaging. I read it all in one sitting.<br /><br />Whether you are a student, business professional, or illustrator, I highly recommend this book to you. It contains lots of pointers on how to draw almost anything using simple shapes (and even has a practice section in the back), and how to make your notes flow nicely. My favorite part: the examples that showed the variety in style of the artists who submitted pieces for this book is truely amazing to see.<br /><br />This has been one of those books for me that I can't stop showing to my friends and family. I can't recommend it highly enough!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I originally used pinterest on my laptop and thought I would hate the app but it runs just as well on my Kindle and I don't feel like I'm missing anything.
0439023513|4.0|I'm a little behind on the Hunger Games wave but nonetheless...I felt the end of Mocking Jay came way too quickly and left alot of loose ends.  Collins tried to cram way too much into the final chapter and it was very disappointing.  The epilogue was odd with Katniss speaking about her children as \\"the girl\\", \\"the boy\\"....really??  Also, her relationship with Gale was supposed to be such a close one but we are left hanging and told that he has a fancy job in District 2.  Oh, okay.  After investing yourself in the story it's difficult to not have some closure.  Some might say it's just a book & get over it which is fine.  Overall I enjoyed the series and don't regret reading the books, I'm just disappointed with the rushed & incomplete ending.<br /><br />P.S. I also have to say how disappointed I am in the movie.  I cannot believe how much of the book was left out or changed.  It doesn't do the book justice AT ALL!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is a great cover! I bought it for my daughter and she loves it! I highly recommend this cover
0425264386|1.0|I enjoyed the first Jack Reacher, and some others; but this was hack serial writing.  I had to force myself to keep reading.  Teacher becomes nearly super-human in this book, and other characters \\"radiate charisma\\" that can be felt yards away.  The characters are mind-numbingly flat and their motivations and reactions are juvenile.  Child does write better later on, but this is definitely a Reached novel worth skipping.
B000002VMD|5.0|This movie is her best by far. Whitney was  almost not chosen for this movie turned out to be one of the best decision Kevin Costner made. Good looking out....I  love this movie as well
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so worth the 6.99 I made a skyscraper house(24 stories tall) in creative mode and my bros are so jealous!!!!! Also my name isn't Laura Berlo my name is Josh. Again it is so worth the 6.99 and I recommend this who has an interest in building awesome stuff and if you love killing zombies, a creeper, or giant man-eating spiders! Whoever made this game is one word, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Total Recall(released Aug/12)stars Colin Farrell as Douglas \\"Doug\\" Quaid/Carl Hauser,Kate Beckinsale as Lori, Jessica Biel as Melina,Bryan Cranston as Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen,Bokeem Woodbine as Harry,Bill Nighy as Matthias Lair,John Cho as Bob McC and others.As a \\"reviewer\\",one will come upon films,specifically remakes(alarmingly on the increase in today's Hollywood),and have different expectations than an \\"original\\" film.One of the basic tenets of a reviewer is to be objective,but being the human beings that we are,that isn't always 100% possible,ALL of the time.Prejudices do creep in whether personal or otherwise.I have to admit beforehand that I really liked the original,so when I watched this film for the first time today I was telling the film mentally\\"Show me what you can do...convince me\\".So with that bit off my chest,let's see what the story is all about.<br />It is in an Earth future,with a Blade Runner-ish look,where wars at the end of the 21st century have almost completely devastated the entire planet.There are two countries left,the UFB(United federation of Britain) and the Colony(Australia).The UFB imports alot of its workforce from the Colony and they come and go daily by the \\"Fall\\".This huge cylindrical device carries thousands of passengers from one country to the other,through the middle of the Earth.Farrell lives with Beckinsale,and is stuck in a dead end job.He keeps having recurring dreams about being captured by police forces while a female accomplice escapes.One day he heads over to Rekall,a place where they can implant new memories of anything a client desires.Farrell picks being a secret agent.Just before they start the process they realize Farrell has already a secret agent implant and they stop it.Just then the police burst in and Farrell,acting on unknown instincts,takes the entire six man team out.Farrell escapes and returns home only to have Beckinsale turn against him and pursue him through the city,trying to kill him.It seems she was a police plant,pretending to be his wife and that he was at one time working for chancellor Cohagen.<br />The trick Farrell now has is to survive and find out exactly who he is and what they wanted of him.There are many trails for him to go through,but he eventually meets up with the woman from his dreams who is actually working for the resistance(Biel).Along the way Farrell finds equipment of his and his old apartment where the pieces start to come together.Farrell it seems was working for the chancellor initially but changed sides when he became aware of the chancellor's agenda to raze the Colony and build a new one.He was recaptured and re-programed by the chancellor but now that he has regained his memory he must try and stop the chancellor's plans from coming to fruition,with Biels help.He meets up with the resistance leader,but soon after the police arrive and take down the leader.Farrell and Biel are recaptured,with the chancellor ordering that Farrell's mind be wiped to its original self.Before they can do that Farrell escapes.<br />The chancellor now puts into motion his plans of a Colony conquest and sends thousands of troops onto the Fall.Farrell follows the chancellor and Biel onto it.During the transport's journey Farrell plants explosives and manages to rescue Biel.At the other end the clamps holding the machine in place explode one by one,until it free falls and breaks apart in a huge explosion.After it all Farrell is in an ambulance and he wakes up to find Biel there,but it is really Beckinsale in disguise.He dispatches her and the real Biel and he are reunited.<br />This new version of the film doesn't leave Earth,as did the first one to Mars.The strife is all here instead of on another planet.There are a few nods to the original as when Farrell says he had always wanted to go to Mars.There is also a check out through security onto the Fall,which mimics the security check when arriving on Mars in the original.It also has a woman checking ahead ofa disguised Farrell.For those who recall the original,we are tricked into thinking that Farrell is really the woman,but it is a red herring.Overall I found I just could not get too involved with Farrell and company.There just wasn't enough oomph there,not enough spark to really pull me in.The acting that was tepid and couldn't \\"believe\\" enough for it to work for me.I also was wondering,plot wise,why did the Colony not blow up the Fall's entry point at their end in order to kybosh the chancellors invasion plans? Bottom line,sad to say,it couldn't \\"convince\\" me.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include about three featurettes,commentary and a gag reel.<br />All in all a disappointing remake of the original starring Colin Farrell.Farrell just does not have the acting chops to compete with Ahh-nold from the original,nor make us forget the original and focus on HIS efforts.Biel and others he spends most of his on screen time with,are also tepid.Beckinsale is the exception and Nighy does a good but short turn as the resistance leader,but it is all for naught.a disguised Farrell.For those who recall the original,we are tricked into thinking that Farrell is really the woman,but it is a red herring.Overall I found I just could not get too involved with Farrell and company.There just wasn't enough oomph there,not enough spark to really pull me in.The acting that was tepid and couldn't \\"believe\\" enough for it to work for me.I also was wondering,plot wise,why did the Colony not blow up the Fall's entry point at their end in order to kybosh the chancellors invasion plans?

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing.This book was full of just absolutely breathe taking situations.  I WOULD READ THIS BOOK OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|Wonderful album. Songs like, &#34;Cmon,&#34; &#34;Thinking of You,&#34; and &#34;Dirty Love,&#34; are incredibly addicting. Kesha just keeps getting better and better. And the production value on this cd is unmatched.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. Keeps me entertained and the horses are adorable. If you're a farm person and is planning to get a horse, this is your game. I'm not, but I love it. I highly recommended it.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|This is a truly unique and beautiful album. Her voice is haunting and emotional, and the music she creates is intoxicating.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun i play it all the time it keeps ME entertained when the weather isnt good to be with. My barrel horses outside
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|I can't believe that I'm just barely hearing of this guy!  Just one listen to this album and it already rivals one of my favorite R&B albums of ALL TIME... and that is Maxwell's &#34;Urban Hang Suite&#34;!<br /><br />This guys style is so smooth, the mix of R&B, Jazz, & Hip Hop is really incredible.<br /><br />Highly recommend this album.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game had all of my expectations , I guess it should be since I was watching my friend play it
B004G6009K|5.0|Got the movie for my wife who loves it. I think its alright. Without the horse, it wouldn't be to much of a movie to me. I nit-pick over the fact she would have a huge neck with all that hair. Oh well.. still a good movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love it!!!!!!!!!! :) Everyone should own this game it is awesome. It combines the great movies that everyone loves and super fun games that everyone loves if you are reading this you should either own the game already or be downloading it cuz it rocks. :) ;)
B007OV9EYG|5.0|For the money, couldn't beat it. My son loves this movie, he is almost 3, and it keeps him occupied for hours. We have to hide it every once in a while so it don't drive us all the way nuts. Almost have all the dialog memorized. Fun movie for kids even though it leans heavily on the environmental side. I guess they have to explode a little truth to make people pay attention.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like it lots of fun. I like the noises. The different levels do actually make you think a bit.
B005XLN97M|5.0|The little girls that received this as a gift are enjoying having a place for Barbie to bring her friends and have fun  times
B0010SKUYM|4.0|THis is a great intro to the series... starts slow but the writing is beautiful and the main character captivating.  Worth sticking to it as the next book in the series is even better-
B000SEI230|3.0|MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!!!<br />Oh-kay, So Danielle, I'm reading this, because you wanted me 2 and I wanted to know the story before I watched the movie. A lot of people at school think that this book is boring, but I think that so far it has been very funny and entertaining. Who would've thought that eating boiled peanunts in a cemetary would make you a 'bad boy'?! It's really a funny and cute book, but I think that something is wrong with Jamie. I think she might be sick or something. Is she? Wow. 0.0 Landon is such a great guy! He gave his money to Jamie for the orphans! They are basically a couple now! He is going to take her out to dinner! Eric is so much nicer to Landon now too. Everything seems to be going great, except the Reverand seems to be a bit sad and that's unusual. OMG! Jamie has a disease AND she's going to die. It's so sad, but I didn't cry when I read that part. I hope this story has a happy ending 'cause it doesn't seem really happy right now.... They get married, but she dies! THis book was really nice and short. Thanks, Dan!
B007ADIRDM|5.0|My Granddaughter loved this. It shipped very fast and it was packaged well. Made she and I very happy. Has a lot of cool stuff with it also.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I'm pretty impressed with this CPU.  Motherboards are also cheap, so I was able to upgrade my HTPC for under $250 for RAM/CPU/Motherboard/CPU cooler combined.  I also got rid of my noisy discrete video card with it's loud fans, and dropped the power consumption of the HTPC at the same time.<br /><br />With the MSI motherboard I purchased, I had it outputting DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD in minutes after installing the Shark007 codec packs in Win7 64 bit.<br /><br />Now it's quiet enough that I can't hear it over the fans in my TV, and since I leave it on 24/7, I'll probably save a little on my electric bill too.<br /><br />This CPU simply can't be beat for HTPC use and light gaming in my opinion.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I started out loving this book - couldn't put it down.  Then it got even better - and then,  it went downhill fast.  I hated the ending.  You have to suspend reality to accept the characters' reasoning for how the story ends.  I just don't buy it.  But, the writing was very good, and there were some clever twists and turns.  Overall, I'd rate it a C or C-.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Daniella Plaksiy<br /><br />Loved this book the first time around so I decided to buy it and it's great. Shipped and arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|well, I have got to say that this app is very good. there are a few things I would change but those are things that are my opinion so this app is very good.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|they keep getting better in fact i enjoyed it even more than white pony. as always the deftones combine searing vocals with a smoother sound almost like a lullabye in between fits of awesomeness

0142419400|5.0|I totally loved this book. Stephanie Perkins captured that \\"he loves me, he loves me not\\" stage of all of our lives PERFECTLY and in a very authentic way.<br /><br />When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about the book and was wondering what would happen next.<br /><br />If you're looking at this book for younger readers (grades 4-6), I would probably suggest that you pick something else. There are a few instances of the \\"f-word\\" (four, I think) and a few infrequent uses of \\"Biblical Profanity,\\" along with a mention or two in passing of casual sex. Mainly, though, I think the issues and themes of the story would be lost on younger readers.<br /><br />I really look forward to reading more from Stephanie Perkins!
B006JPS1OM|3.0|It's a good game when you get in to it, but then they want you to buy the full version of it for $5.00 and it's not worth it. I can find all kinds of games for free if you just look.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game it's a great simulator I work in a stable at my uncle's ranch just the same you know we don't ride English
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was good and very suspenseful and after reading and thinking about it is pretty scary but I am sure true for some.  I just hated the ending one of those that you have to make up what you think or hopes happens.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This is one of they best classic old movies out there! Beautiful actors and scenery!  I watch it multiple times a year!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I highly recommed you read this book.  It is intriguing, a little mystery, a lot of  pure romance.  It starts a little slow but doesn't last long once I got going I just didn't want to stop I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is awesome!  Couldn't stop watching it. It was my first time to use Amazon video and it was so easy!  Will definitely use it again for movies I can't get at my local library.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. Even though I knew how it was going to end I could not stop reading. Heartbreaking.
1401235417|4.0|Capullo, you can do better...I mean, you did a great job and I apprechiate that, but draw Bruce Wayne better, make him look serious, not look like a MANIAC and DROUG DEALLER. Make him look more like in Justice League. watch Jim Lee draw Bruce Wayne. I apprechiate that you have style, but...<br />P.S. Comic is really awesome !
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|Must watch for all horror movie fans. Background music is well set and makes it even more scary. Some scenes (like restroom scene with John Grady) has only two people in whole shot, but instils a different kind of fear, knowing that the whole setup can't be true only to later realize it was true!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Hard to put down. Really enjoyed this. First time reading this author and loved her style of writing. A very different take on the general thriller. Read!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis has long been one of my favorite PC games and I was delighted to find it available to play on my tablet.  I recommend it highly.  It has a relaxing soundtrack, beautiful graphics and challenging gameplay. I find the full paid game is well worth the reasonable price charged.  The replay value  is endless and anyone should enjoy this game

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not bad, but the to other books were better with the action.  Also I did love the end &lt;3 &lt;3
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, i loved sky and dean. It felt so real, i felt all the emotion. Love
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The first time i played this i was like: wtf is that huge thing chasing me did that combine the other things from the first one into one massive one? lolz but the graphics are really descriptive and the whole thing with it being like in the sky is amazing. The twists and turns will have your heart pounding. Much better then the first temple run :D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is very fun to play. It does take a very long time to get better health so you  can do competitions, though. But over all I think it is a great game..... and it's FREE!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very great book. I read it in less than a day, every time I would try to walk away the wonder of what was going to happen next pulled me right back
0380973650|3.0|This book has its ups and downs and thus I had to give it a score of 3, right in the middle of the range. I would like to make just a few points as to why I gave the book a 3. I once heard that there are two basic plots in fiction; someone takes a trip and a stranger comes to town. Gaiman has written one long novel where he gives us both of these narratives. First, it is a road trip novel with Shadow and Wednesday traveling across the United States rounding up all the old gods that have been brought here by millions of immigrants over the centuries. Second, it is a stranger comes to town novel as Shadow enters the perfect little town of Lakeside and discovers a horrid ritual that keeps the town picture perfect. However, the reader may end up questioning why these two narratives were rolled together into one novel when maybe they would have made two better short novels. There is a lot of running around the country but the reader is left with the vague question of `why?'<br /><br />I think Gaiman has a highly creative entertaining imagination and his characters are developed quickly and vividly so the reader can picture every one after only a few sentences. The basic premise of the novel is sound: immigrants brought many gods to these shores but they gradually weaken as the gods of technology begin to replace them, However in testament to their power, they may die but come again in a new incarnation with each generation. The gods of technology defeat each other with technological progress but they never can beat the ancient gods who spring eternal in new garb. The old gods were entertaining and often wonderfully described. The new gods were bleak, colorless, automatons, with the exception of the goddess of television brilliantly played by Lucille Ball.<br /><br />There are short asides written throughout the larger novel. They tell the tales of immigrants bringing the gods of Ireland or Haiti to these shores. They are delightful and well written. We must remember the great novelist Victor Hugo does this in Les Miserables when he digresses to describe the Paris sewer system.<br /><br />But there are also weaknesses in the novel. There is over 300 pages of build-up for the great stormy fight between the gods that is resolved in two pages. A more serious flaw is that the twists in the plot can be predicted ahead of the novel. Alfred Hitchcock once said that if the viewer ever gets ahead of the film that they will soon get bored. This is the weakness of this novel because the twists in plot can be seen miles ahead of the text.<br /><br />Like I wrote at the beginning of this review, the novel has its ups and downs. It scores a 3.great novelist Victor Hugo does this in Les Miserables when he digresses to describe the Paris sewer system.<br /><br />But there are also weaknesses in the novel.

B001I8A76A|4.0|I was never a Pink fan until I heard this entire album. Now I own all of her albums. She is a versatile singer/songwriter. I love how she incorporates jazz, blues, and rock into her songs. If you are not a fan, give this album a listen, and then maybe you too will become a fan like I did.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|I liked the Alien movies and story line and the details were great.  Even with great special effects this pre-quel is not in the same category.  It was OK and it gave a starting point to the other movies but it did not really give the detail you wanted as to why the race they found wanted to kill off other planet with bugs.  It was so so.  If you liked Aliens then you may want to see it for completeness but you could skip it.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a very good book that brings together a lot of key concepts and theories that can help run an IT department. Its format is inspired from The Goal, being written as a first-person novel. The main character, under serious coaching from a mentor, discovers how to apply the Theory of Constraints, Kanban, Systems Thinking and Continuous Delivery principles to turn around an IT department and a company headed for disaster.<br /><br />It's a light read, I powered through it in one day, partly because the narrative is well built and it kept me wanting to read the next chapter, to see what happens next.<br /><br />Even if it doesn't bring anything new in terms of concepts, its main power is in the way it illustrates how to combine tools from various disciplines to achieve your goals.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|For cheap entertainment it's okay. But the vocabulary wasn't very broad and the scenes were often repeated. Not much suspense. Very predictable.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another great book from Mitch Albom!  Mitch's style of writing lets him convey in few words what it takes other writers hundreds more to do.  His book makes us understand that we need to slow down, exit the rat race, and enjoy our lives with ones we love.

I saw this in a theater when first released and although now it is technologically dated it still delivers superb entertainment in the sort of \\"The Bourne Identity\\" [[ASIN:044656446X Robert Ludlum's (TM) The Bourne Imperative (A Jason Bourne novel)]] style. Everyone's out to kill Redford and he has to figure out why while using his intellect but rather unskilled instincts to survive.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Since there are that many Bond films, less people tend to read the original Ian Fleming books.  For me Daniël Craig is the best Bond because in him I see James Bond as it was intended by Mr. Fleming : rough !<br />Without to many gadgets therefor, Skyfall is one of the purest Bond films ever in my opinion !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have heard about Downton Abbey for years, but never saw it before because of a conflict the evening it airs here, and no TIVO. Finally the desire was irresistible, and so is the series. I had never livestreamed before and don't belong to Netflix. Amazon made it solo easy.

140123769X|4.0|This trade covers 8 issues. The first 8 issues tell the tale of two of the Wolf-White children in the land of misfit toys. It is a story of regret, leadership, loyalty and duty. My favorite character in this arc is Ranger Danger, one of Dare Bigby's toys. When Dare asks him why he is so big, Ranger Danger answers that \\"I've increased in stature over the years because of the trust and responsibility you placed in me.\\"<br /><br />The last two issues deal with a two-part story of Bigby Wolf and how he was able to avoid a nasty fate that was foretold to him by a woman who could deliver/change your fate. It's excellent.<br /><br />Bill Willingham is one of the top writers in comics today, and his series \\"Fables\\" has won multiple Eisner awards. I fully believe that the recent Snow White movie, Grimm TV show and the other Fables-esque TV show were all created as a result of Willingham's successful and highbrow series.<br /><br />One can't read this in a vacuum. One must start with Fables volume 1 and work their way up to this. Most of the volumes are extraordinary pieces of writing: Willingham uses characters from the last 1000+ years of storytelling and is good enough at character development that we end up loving and hating a number of them. While each story arc is about 6 books, his overarching story arcs last for about 50 comics. He is a meticulous writer and planner.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this for my grandpa's android tablet, but on there the bucket would barely slide when making feed with three ingredients. The kindle fire is a better platform, so when I saw this app in the New for You section I grabbed it before you could blink an eye.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Resident Evil: Afterlife with Milla Jovovich. Another great movie in the Resident Evil Saga. Cannot wait to watch the next one. hope there are more in the offing
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I don't normally like clock apps very much, but this one is nice. It allows several options for tones, and it even has a mode that allows it to go off even if my device is powered down. So if you're looking for an easy to use, and aestheticly pleasing clock, this one fits the bill.
B009MO57H6|5.0|LOVE this movie as with all previous Resident Evil Movies. Cannot wait for the next one. Keep up the awesome work Milla :)
B009VSW15Y|3.0|This app is a basic camera one, but the quality is good and it stores downloaded images. It doesn't do editing though, for that you'll need a separate app. Its video mode does have a very good microphone, and it records a pretty good length of video.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy .... what is there to say. Great movies alll in one package. Love the Batman stories
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game great for animal and horse lover's!!! Even if you have never had a horse it teaches you how to care for a horse. Fun for all ages!!!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I'd actually put this at the 3 and a half star range (I wish Amazon would just let us do half stars already). I enjoyed it but was in love with it. But I find anytime you physically want to smack the main characters in the head is ultimately a good thing.<br /><br />The good:<br /> -I loved the character development, I felt like I had a decent sense of who they were and what drove them.<br /> -The relationship developed at a decent pace rather then the I-just-met-you-and-need-to-be-with-you-forever speed.<br /><br />The less then good:<br />  -Without giving too much away it becomes quickly apparent that the main characters don't have the healthiest of relationships. I'm pretty sure that was the point but still you'd hope with time and repetition they'd learn. Generally a person only needs to stick their hand in fire once to figure out that's probably not the best of ideas.<br />  -Wow that was a lot to take in in the first year of college. Just saying, wonder how the girl managed to pass.<br />  -I wish we got to see a bit more of the relationship developing. I think you could understand easier why it was so hard to walk away from the bad stuff if we got to see a better development of the good. I loved their first time out and hoped we'd see more of that and them learning about each other, having fun and generally being silly. You always get the sense it's there but never really shown. They always say they're best friends, I wanted to see that side.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad I read it and will read the companion novel when it comes out. No story can be everything to everyone and that's more the readers fault then the writers, expectations are evil things.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and now I'll have to get \\"Racing in the Rain\\".<br />The concept of a dog narrator sounds cutesy, even juvenile, but I've read few books where the narrator espoused more wisdom.<br /><br />Enzo is a dog who is ready to be reincarnated as a man, and I hope to meet him when he is. Even if you don't believe in reincarnation, there is little doubt that you can learn a lot about being a good man from this dog's perspective. Moving, riveting and engaging story.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|stop what your doing and go and get this app.If you love to draw then I would get this app.Me my self loves this app and if you get it then you would like it tot
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Has a great variety of different sounds to listen too and nice pictures to go along with the sounds. Great for the price...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love!<br />4 yr old is in love with her new horsie. This will keep her entertained for hours, especially on long car rides.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! This book had twist and turns I wasn't expecting. It keep me wondering at all times. Finished this book in 2 days.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!! and I'm 14!!! this app is recommended for all ages!! but ya....anywho I absolutley LOVE this app!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was great especially for a free book. It was classic with a few spins to it. I will read again.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Typical setting for a Grisham book (young lawyer early in career) that draws the reader in with some humor and legal excitement
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Every episode is original and entertaing.  The casting is excellent. Patriotism abounds.  After 10 seasons it is amazing that this show never becomes stale!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the game and everything but it shuts me out of it everytime I go too play with it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Needs an advertisement off switch. Fun game, and good layout. Like the deal winning hand button. One of my favorite solitair games.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This album blew me away. It is a great follow up album to Sigh No More. I feel that their sound flows from the first album into Babel. I will definitely be looking forward to their next album.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Sweet,emotional. Will always think of this book when around loving pets. Loved reading,very touching. Felt as right there with the characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i just got n it n am already level five it is pretty cool but a waste of time so if u like time wasting get this app
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My 11 year old daughter loved the movie.  A lot of familiar voices in the movie.  It is a good family movie.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|what can i say?, a great processor with a great performance, intel always has the best processor and this is not the exeption
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Actually, this one was for me.  It was recommended to me by my daughter.  I didn't think I would, but I liked it.  It was cute!!
1423140605|5.0|I really dont like reading a lot of books, but for some reason I love this series. I have dyslexia and when I was in elementary school, I was in special reading class where they forced us to read books, and its always been a constant battle between me and my mom. This series has sparked my interest into reading more books. But enough about me, its a very good book that will definitely teach you a few things about ancient greek and roman mythology. The story line is great and fun. Lots of action and battles. I would say that this series could be enjoyed by anyone ranging from the ages of 11 and up.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I rated this movie a 5-star because it was in VERY good condition when I received it, it was very good playing condition also.  I enjoyed it very much -- it was cute!!  And I'm the grandmother.  I actually purchased it for my grandchildren and when I called their parents the other night,  I was told that my four-year-old had her parents play it about 25 times in that day alone.  So, it's safe to say, it'll get a lot of plays in it's lifetime.  Thanx!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Came in very good condition.  Actually I purchased this to copy and send off to my grandchildren.  But I was told by their mother that they just loved it.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|No ethernet port, no problem.  Yes it is a bummer they got rid of it, but I can appreciate one less port that can get dirty and is open to contamination from outside stuff.  Most of the time you are mobile if you have a laptop, so this nice when you want to dock your laptop when you get home or put it back where you normally dock it.  Very simple design.  Pretty sturdy cable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game.  Its especially good for when your bored.  The graphics are good and never blurry.There is always something to do so it never gets old.  When I first saw this game I thought it was for little kids, but it turns out that it's not.  Overall, it's a awesome game.  p.s. it is so addicting you might end up playing it for hours without knowing it.  GET THIS GAME OR ELSE YOUR LIFE WILL BE AN EPIC FAILURE.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I bought this because everyone I know still has the older generation MBP's.  This will allow me to use their chargers just like when the lighting connectors were still new it was wise to have an adapter.  I lost my first one because it was so small.  Be careful.  I put mine in a plastic baggy.  I do like the size though.
B002APU580|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It has such a good story and the acting is superb.  I have seen it a dozen times and will probably watch it a dozen more times.
B009X01C64|3.0|I had a M-edge for my first Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it. I now purchased the 8.9 Kindle Fire & needed a case for that as well. I could not find one for the bigger Fire so choose this one instead. Its the same concept but not as study feeling as the m-edge for my first Fire. I'm afraid that the cover will bend if not being careful.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|A friend strongly recommended this series for my wife and me. We got hooked! The first day we watched four episodes. Season 3 has begun and we have to watch one episode per week. Bummer! Get it!
B009O07NDY|5.0|Follows in the same style and excellence of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  I find this music very relaxing.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The new film version of the musical, \\"Les Miserables\\" had tremendously high expectations. An all-star cast, made up primarily of movie actors, though some could claim varying numbers of Broadway and West End credentials, was assembled by producer Cameron Mackintosh, director Tom Hooper (\\"The King's Speech\\"), and writers Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Herbert Kretzmer to perform arguably one of the best composed scores in musical history. The musical itself has been performed around the world, grossing over $1 billion. How could the film possibly raise the bar on this international sensation? The creators decided to have the performers sing live directly onto the film, as opposed to pre-recording their voices with the aid of studio microphones, and then lip-synching their already taped singing, as has been traditionally done for movie musicals. It was a gamble that yielded, at best, moments of interest, but mostly moments of wishing for a studio version of this soundtrack.<br /><br />Now we have the CD of the music from the movie, albeit only \\"highlights,\\" and though the majority of the listening enjoyment comes from the orchestra, there are some moments of pleasant surprise among the mixed levels of performances.<br /><br />One element of distraction has nothing to do with the actors' performances: the orchestra was clearly recorded in the studio, enabling us to hear every gorgeous nuance of Anne Dudley and Stephen Metcalfe's arrangements. However, without a voice that is stage trained, as was clearly the case whenever Helena Bonham Carter or Russell Crowe were singing, their voices came across as weak and dry, as opposed to Anne Hathaway, Aaron Tveit (Broadway's \\"Next to Normal\\"), and Samantha Barks (London's \\"Les Miserables\\"), who were able to deliver the lyrics with the same passion as the accompaniment behind them.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman tries his hardest as the classic hero, Jean Valjean. With Broadway credits including \\"Oklahoma\\" and \\"The Boy from Oz,\\" one would expect him to be able to handle one of the most challenging roles in musicals. However, with the exception of his scenes with Hathaway (as Fantine) and Colm Wilkinson's Bishop (who can still deliver the tone and emotion that earned him the original stage role of Valjean when the show was created), his strong acting cannot overcome his singing deficiencies.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the show, but haven't seen the film, the CD won't alter your opinions, as it will merely be snippets of themes from what you've come to appreciate about the show. If you've seen the film, proceed with caution in checking out the CD, as it will magnify your opinion (whether positive or negative) formed when you went to the cinema.d expect him to be able to handle one of the most challenging roles in musicals.

B002S0OBMS|2.0|I am a huge fan of the phantom have seen the play numerous times and listened to the score over and over. I was surprised to learn of Love Never Dies and had to check it out. In watching the Phantom 25th anniversary I loved the phantom and Christine so thought I would enjoy this CD with the same voices. But after watching the DVD of the play in Melbourne it does not come close. The Melbourne version is absolutely Stunningly Beautiful, wonderful acting, voices, drama. I really wish there was a CD of that version. I have watched it over and over it has grasped me and gotten into my blood. If you get a chance please watch it. You will not be disappointed.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Jack Nicholson at he's weirdest.  If you like scary movies this is a must! An old one that is still a great movie.  .
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Facinating, engrosing, devious, difficult and fun. Earned all achievements and unlocked all levels inthe game. Can't wait for zombies and alien invasion.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I loved this book, as I generally do all books by James Rollins.  As usual, he weaves historical information into his story and makes it interesting.  If you have not visited Yellowstone Park this book will make you want to.  His characters are interesting, well fleshed out, and make you want to hear about their next adventure.
1594744475|5.0|It came in great condition, brand new.<br /><br />Really cute and adorable ideas with recipes and tips.<br /><br />I can't wait to get started on making Bentos! ^_^
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I got the dvd yesterday and now I'm totally addicted to it! I watched 7 episodes in a row, I just can't get enough of it. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. It's made me tear up a lot but laugh too. This show is just perfect!
1568363931|4.0|This Bento Cookbook is more of the Grown Up version of bentos.<br /><br />They have some Japanese Style and Not-So-Japanese Style recipes, but along with the recipes they also have some variation recipes.<br /><br />There isn't a picture for every single thing but a good portion of them; There's one for every main recipe but not for every extra recipe like for the Variation recipes.<br /><br />I'm still excited to start making some of these Bento recipes. ^_^
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game definitely a step up but is not as good as the original. It does not have the fun and enjoyment as the first.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really love this game but its really hard to see what's coming up behind the hills and the curves. its also hard to move left to right and on the settings I saw no sensativity
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It picks up right where you want it to, adds intrigue where you expect and also adds surprising twists as well. I love Downton. P.S. FREE BAITS!!
B005KELQEU|4.0|I bought this cover about a year after getting my Kindle, and apparently the newer Kindles (not Kindle Fire) are a bit smaller because this sleeve wouldn't fit on my device. Bummer.
0307346617|1.0|I gave up about half way through. It's just a bunch of interviews about stuff that already happened over and over again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Continued  the last book, but the last few chapters were a little slow and I wish it would have ended a little differently. But overall a good read.
0307950689|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book and I made sure to buy it as soon as it came out. Read it in two days (fast for me) but was pissed that knew what was going to happen before Dan did. Every time i pass this book in the store i feel the need to curse at it for wasting my time and money. I'll read the next one, but that is his last chance.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love the game. Can't put it down  I do need to find out more about the eagle feature.  Also like not having ads pop up
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it was a good game until it stopped loading. haven't been able to play for 2 days since this issue started happening. liked it until this happened.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This was another tape that I had missed when it first came out...but glad I received it now. Some great duets
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Cool Master does not mess around when it comes to design, they keep things clean and functional, and this Heat Sink is a product that will work no question asked.<br /><br />So far i have not had any problems with quality control from CM, this product fits in the category. I have This cooling my I7-2700k that is slightly boosted to 3.9Ghz. I have not seen any problems with performance or any noticeable heat. The Heat-sink by itself will probably suffice by itself without the fan attachment if i had it running on normal settings. Its a pretty massive block, and will forsure stand out in your case or on your test bench.<br /><br />I recommend this block if your not looking for anything fancy and need a efficient heat-sink for boosting your cpu performance.<br /><br />Pro's<br />-Great price<br />-Nice simple design<br />-Comes with Fan(quick release pins is a plus)<br />-Fan is quiet<br /><br />Cons-<br />None really
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is very engaging and creative. Worked well on my kindle fire. Would recommend this game to all. Good graphics. Nice story line.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love the color and the overall product.<br />Very durable and easily user friendly, Had<br />no problem inserting my kindle.<br />You wont regret the purchase.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|A fantastic start to a trilogy. Engaging, entertaining and with a couple of original concepts that make its universe believable as well as fascinating. Very highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome you should try it guys I love it fireman d'Ivoire boys try<br />It for me &quot;.&quot;
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app works great and is versatile and lets you customize to the things you like to listen to- music, podcasts, etc.  It is well worth the .99 and I am glad to pay this VERY affordable price to the developer.  With the Pro version allowing you to record what you are listening to- its a definite plus!  Highly recommended!
0547884591|4.0|a lot of information that one has to use gradually, I forget it til I have days off to read it and will continue to  work at it, almost too big
B00899DR40|5.0|I got this for my seven year old, she loves Justin bieber, the price was great and it sounds pretty good on the kindle
B008JF8O9M|3.0|Not a compatible printer. Check this before downloading. I'm sure there is a way you can look this.up. Other than that it looks good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book started of slow for me, I was not sure I would finish reading it but it picked up and I couldn't put it down it's a great story of courage and of faith and hope and adaptation.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Can't get it to run on my android tablet. I have a MIDI tablet and it installs, but has to force close when I try to run it.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|it's a forward facing camera on the kindle used for like Skype I guess but I wanted a regular camera but I guess that won't work on the kindle anyway it's kind of hard to take pics of your dog or family to post thing's and such, that because of the forward facing camera
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I'm NOT a big time gamer so I found this difficult to navigate. I could not find directions with the application and gave up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is awesome, great features and I love the graphics !!! A MUST GET!!! A lot of fun and challenging.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|good story line just not sure i like all the cuffs and tying up but do enjoy reading the sex
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I bought this as a gift.  My son requested it for his birthday so as a person who loves movies, he really likes this one.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book so much I had to interview the author, Andy Weir. He had me in 7 pages, and I hit \\"buy.\\" I read the entire book over two days and felt completely satisfied from start to finish. The best story I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Check out the interview here: krcoxbooks.com/Blog/Entries/2013/1/12_Author_Andy_Weir_Interview.html
B005LAII0I|5.0|This is a great movie.  Julia Roberts (as usual) does an awesome job.  Shows a different view on Snow White and it does turn out as we expect it to.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Loved the first two books... i feel like the \\"end\\" sneaks up on you, boom, its over... Very dissapointed by the ending, feel like there could have easily been one more book. I enjoyed this third book until the last 1/4 of it, I have so many unanswered questions!
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I got this quick, you can't go wrong with the combo packs even if you don't have a blu ray player currently, this is a highly underrated bond film, lots of good action especially early on, shipped fast thank you!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Cute, quirky, feel good movie!!! All of the actors are super good!! I am so glad we rented this movie!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is an okay app, it just seems to need work on some stuff like the screen can get fuzzy sometimes, and sometimes the screen goes black.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yup, that's pretty much it. This is a great show. And I definitely absolutely love it. We had to catch up before the season started back up in February.
0545259096|5.0|I loved this book before i got it and now i have it and i love it even more and now i can read it anytime!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This album did not fail any expectations I had. Matthew Bellamy is a rock legend. Dom and Chris are great too. Although I don't know how much I like the songs Chris sang for. Still. Amazing album.
0545123267|5.0|I loved this book before i got it and now i have it and i love it even more and now i can read it anytime!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Too much about the author's biography - and too scientific - I wanted to &#34;learn&#34; more about his heavenly experience.
0545123283|5.0|I loved this book before i got it and now i have it and i love it even more and now i can read it anytime!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This author is quite superfluous in her descriptions and the reader is apt to put the book down in frustration....don't do it! Stick it out...this is a great story with lots of twists and turns. I liked it - in fact, once it got going (about 60% through the story), I didn't want it to end!
B0063IH60K|4.0|What is good about this one - you can do it without a lot of thought.  However, there comes a time where you have to make a calculated decision
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is a very nice step-up from the last game. The graphics have improved considerably, the track has a new twisty, windy feature to it that makes the track a bit more diverse, and they've made character selection a real game-changing decision which depends on how you optimize them. The biggest problem is that the game is rediculously prone to crashing - especially when using the &quot;Save me&quot; function. I've had to re-download this game twice because after a while, it will crash right after the developer logo screen everytime I boot the game up. Fix this and I can rightfully give it five stars.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is addicting - my son's girlfriend put it on my Kindle Fire - she just showed be the basics and I have struggled to continue to beat my times.  Be careful - it can be addicting
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case is exactly what it claims, lightweight and comfortable. I like having the hard shell case with three small boys at home. This one doesn't make it heavy or bulky.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have loved this on my computer for a long time and wanted to put it on my phone so I could play it to pass the time while waiting in lines, etc
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for everyone. games to play with your horse. competitions feeding treats and more. learn to clean stables take care of the horse(s) and show your love to your wonderful companion(s).
B007STBUIW|4.0|For whoever is interested, the Blu-ray version of \\"Jaws\\" is only a marginal improvement (visually) over the regular DVD. The movie itself is a solid 5 Star (one of the all-time greats) but a spectacular Blu-ray (Hi-Def) transfer has yet to come.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I used to be a die hard Stephen King fan until he started mass producing books. After not reading a King novel in 10 yrs, I decided to give this one a chance, and glad I did! Well thought out and written, you can tell he took his time writing this and not pressured to just write something. Now I have to go back and see what else I missed. This is Stephen King! I missed you buddy!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great transaction - fast shipping - book in great condition - would buy from seller again! My daughter loves this book!
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I think the actors in this movie were great.  However I don't even know where to begin in describing how strange and creepy this film is. I have only watched it once after I bought it and once was enough. It is quite intense at times and slightly confusing at others.  I hate to be a spoiler so I won't give away too much as there is already a good description next to the product picture. It is one of the better psychological thrillers out there but not my cup of tea.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|the walking dead is the one show i can watch over and over and over...and when i got a blu-ray player it was the one show that i decided i would buy all the seasons tooooo..its walkerific!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone looking for a read worthy of all your time...you fall in love with the characters.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book gave great insight of the times on the political questions of slavery and immagrants of the period.<br />Really well written.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing. Nicholas Sparks had done it again. This isn't his typical love story. They don't fall in love at the beginning. It touched my heart. Seriously consider sampling or buying it. It will be worth your time. Perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I bought this game for my 8 yr old godson to play and he loved it. Kept him busy for many hours.
B007N8RULO|3.0|This is the game I meant to write about. I play this one most. Sometimes it's unresponsive and reboots. This is my favorite game with 4 suits.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After the first ten minutes, I was hooked. Can't wait for the next episode. I would say that this is one of the best British dramas I have seen.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|By far my favorite movie by the Coen brothers.  I can't count how many times I've watched the Dude in this very funny movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. It has the right amount of action and drama. The actors play their characters very well.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|What 10 year old boy would not love this?  Our 10-yeaar-old grandson was up bright and early every morning -- ready for school way earlier than usual -- so he could complete his lego project for the day!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Get this app! It's great! It's awesome! I love it! Perfect for horse lovers! Perfect for kids! I like this app
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful tool that is a must for everyone.  It is easy to use the very accurate.  Highly recommended.
6305558167|5.0|I was so glad to finally find it on DVD!! The price was awesome and the quality of the movie is great!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a beautifully published app that is very accurate and up to the minute with temps and forecasts.  I have it set for various locations to see what is going on around the country.  Highly recommended.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game. Good graphics and gameplay. It sometimes lags when you go offline. Also, there is this glitch where when you try to &quot;save yourself&quot; before the end frame, it exits the game and loses all your progress for that round. But otherwise I'm impressed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game with several varieties of set up and card faces.  Fun game. I wish it were without promotional ads. Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Too many Facebook cues..... pop up way too much.  It is annoying when you have to constantly click out of them.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is a contagiously fun game.  I wish it had a set of instructions so I don't have to wing it but it is fun even for a novice like me.  Cute characters and sounds.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The &quot;Save Me&quot; button will work or would just crash the app. If the bug was fixed I would of gave the app five stars instead. Overall, a great and very addictive game! I highly recommend this game.
B008KWHKGM|5.0|Great music by the Northern Ireland band. Catchy tunes with great rhythm. If you liked their first album, you'll enjoy their second effort, for sure.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Arrow  good story line, acting well played,,,keeps my interest with fast action and twisting plots, not to mentionthe beautiful women cast.
0316228532|4.0|It is patently obvious that J.K. Rowling needed to write this book.  She needed to give voice to the characters who inhabit this world; the lower, working and middle class people who all - each and every one - live separate from this world, and not of it.  They are the lonely, the misunderstood, the alienated.  They are legion.  For all of the couple of dozen characters we meet within the covers of this remarkably bleak book, there is hardly one who does not end the book as they started - lost and lonely.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling is a remarkable storyteller, as attested by her previous works; but the world of those books, where virtue will triumph over tremendous odds and all things are possible if you are in the right, is nowhere to be found in the small village of Pagford where a \\"casual vacancy\\" (A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred: (a) when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or (b) when his notice if resignation is received; or (c) on the day of his death.) is caused by the sudden death of a member of the village board, and the ensuing political infighting has far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />A lovely line from early on in the book says it all, \\"Both... were contemplating the casual vacancy: and saw it, not as an empty space but as a magician's pocket, full of possibilities.\\"<br /><br />This is a world where secrets cover darker secrets and hardly anything is what it appears, and an existence of quiet, hopeless desperation is the established norm.  Rowling's people are as real as any you'll find in fiction, and you'll care about them in spite of yourself; even when they do unconventional, irrational, and totally infuriating things.  You care.  But it will do neither them, nor you, any good.  They are stuck in their world.  Nothing can help them, and nothing will help them.  This book is a \\"cri du coeur\\".  Notice these people.  Know that they exist.  Acknowledge them.  (Not that you could ever help them; that would be asking too much.)<br /><br />This is, as I said earlier, a bleak book.  I cannot like it.  I can only admire it.  I'm glad that I read it, but I will not read it a second time.  Please, Ms. Rowling, now that you have this out of your system, let us back into your other worldview and allow us some measure of balance and happiness.er help them; that would be asking too much.)<br /><br />This is, as I said earlier, a bleak book.

0897502027|5.0|I WON'T BE LETTING GO OF THIS BOOK.  INCREDIBLE SOURCE OF BRUCE LEE'S OWN FORM CREATION.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wow. Didn't expect so much in a free game. Very fun and I would recommend this to anyone. .great variety.. .
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This app is great for entertainment. I love it. You can play, win, and if you run out of coins, you can leave and do whatever else. When you come back, you have more coins! Be patient, though; you have to wait 9 minutes for each coin to regenerate, so it'd be best to forget about it until the next day. I would recommend this to anyone with massive amounts of spare time, or even people with little spare time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first one was so much fun but this one destroyed it! I can't even put it down! The map is so much better, the controlled just feel so right. I told my brother about it and he loves it to!

B0002YLC24|5.0|I had to wait many years for this part 2 ,  It was worth the wait,  Great work.<br />part 1 and 2 are works of art.  Before Midnight is no doubt going to be another work of art.  See them in order people,  Otherwise you will miss the full intent.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Exactly what I needed to continue to use and enjoy my Kindle. Works fine and I was able to attach the electrical plug end from my old cord.
B00002E224|5.0|Great work ,Part 1 and 2 are absolute works of art.  Now i am counting down the days for part 3 !!!  You must see these in order or you will not get the full meaning.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Rick Riordan is one of the best authors I have ever read!!! When I first read a greek myth, I didn't understand what they meant. But when I read this book,I understude the myths more and I read any myth I can get my hands on!!!
B000SOZXJG|4.0|The movie Whale Rider was extremely interesting. It starts out in New Zealand, where twins are born, a boy and a girl. During childbirth, their mother dies, and not to long after being born, the baby boy dies also, leaving the little girl, whose name is Paikea. Paikea's grandfather is extremely disappointed that the boy had died, because he was hoping to make him chief once he was older. Distraught over his wife and son's death, Paikea's father leaves to Germany to become an artist, while she is being raised by her grandparents in New Zealand. The rules over the village state that a girl cannot be a chief or prophet, that it can only be a male, upholding the sacred belief that the whales and their ancestors are interconnected. Paikea, though she is just a young school girl, shows signs of leadership and strength, putting her at odds with her grandfather, who refuses to admit that she shows signs of a chief. At the climax, multiple whales are washed to shore, because of a sacred prayer Paikea prayed. All the local villagers try helping keep the whales alive, but there seems to be no solution, not even from Paikea's grandfather. Come to find out, only Paikea can make the whales go back into the ocean, because she is the chosen one. So she rides on the back of one of the whales, leading them back to safety, but harming her own life. Once she is recovered, she is sent to the hospital where her and her grandfather reconnect their bond. After that she is held high in the village, even though she claims not be a prophet, but she will give people hope.<br /> This movie had a lot of undertones about indigenous religions, or older religions that have no changed over the years. The upheld their beliefs of old. They believed in the power of their ancestors watching over them in guiding them through life. They had a special connection with the whales, believing that human and animal life have a special spiritual bond. They also practiced the belief of women not being in a leadership position, which was broken because of Paikea's special gift. They also showed that they would not be changed by the urbanized ways of life, by showing respect for their elders, and practicing in religious rituals, which involved singing and dancing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is exactly what i wanted for xmas so i wound up buying it for myself  well worth the 30 dollars
0765325950|1.0|Book 12 was good(-ish), 13 was bad and 14 was awful. This is mirrored in another BS trilogy: Mistborn. Book 1 was good, 2 was bad and 3 was awful. Maybe this is how BS always does it? I am never buying another BS-book again! I have been reading the Wheel of Time series since 1998 and I have read the whole series 4 times, but book 14 I'll only ever read once. I hated how Rand's fight with the Dark One was written and The Last Battle-chapter was boring and repetitive, all 194 pages of it. In the future, if I were to do a re-read of the Wheel of Time series I would read book 1-11 and stop there. The rest is just BS.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|says its free. halfway through I decided to waste my money and buy it so I could finish it only to have it crap out and constantly send me back to my kindle main screen. I cant even get it to work now.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Five stars for this book. Jack reacher is at his best. This book was hard to put down. I loved it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the game itself is good but it crashes once and then it takes over an hour to reinstall its self
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the ZIPLINES and HUGE monkeys and minarets and water falls I...I just love the game. It's just great!!!
B00511ONPG|5.0|Definitely recommended for anyone going into public relations, advertising or marketing, or looking to start or enhance a business of any size. Easy to read.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|For all of the promotional hype, I felt that this movie did not stand up to all of the critical acclaims.
0345803485|5.0|Okay- I admit, I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loved this book  and she doesn't love to read for fun.I(she's 35) Now she's encouraging me to read it so I've loaded it to my Nook. Can't wait to start reading it!
B0086DBE62|3.0|I felt that this movie was not worthy of Ann Hathaway and Julia Roberts.  I did not finish watching the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game I get 1,000 gems if I write a review only 1 more minute left!! Hurry u still have a chance lol!
B009329Y30|5.0|Another excellent book by Nicholas Sparks.  This book kept you on the edge, as it felt that something would happen to someone any time.

B000F2C87Q|5.0|They are getting bigger and bigger I've been following them since 04' love their work! Funky sound at the same time very familiar and classic. Southern garage band not country music no not at all.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I chose to buy Ford County after reading Pat Conroy's review, where he referred to it as &#34;The best thing Grisham's written.&#34;<br />Short stories are difficult to write, but these are tremendously satisfying, with well-developed characters and intriguing situations.  I will read this again in the future.
B00008O31H|5.0|They are getting bigger and bigger I've been following them since 04' love their work! Funky sound at the same time very familiar and classic. Southern garage band not country music no not at all.

B0002O06N0|5.0|They are getting bigger and bigger I've been following them since 04' love their work! Funky sound at the same time very familiar and classic. Southern garage band not country music no not at all. This album I can listen all the way through no skipping.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My two year old son loves this app and so do I! He loves being able to take care of a pet and there are so many things to do it holds his attention.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grand daughter showed me this game but to small on the iPod, downloaded on the kindle and its great, love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed from beginning to end.  Entertaining, , light fast reading. Loved the book hate reviews, word count oh come on.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the best game ever. I think the game is better than subway sufers. I love this game so much.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book so much there were parts where I wanted to cry like a baby I will read the next book
B0085YNML2|3.0|I think this is hard to figure out but I am not a big gamer!!  My teenager can do it fine but loses interest fast!  my 5 Year old grandson also plays it but loses interest fast!  It is unique though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so  awesome I love all the mixtures of thing s with the zipline and the minecars and most of all the mega monkey!
B009ARMS1I|1.0|In my opinion this show is disgusting. It pretends to be pro-underdog, but according to Wired Magazine, the show apparently rips off independent music artists like Jonathon Coulton's version of Baby Got Back, or D.J. Earworm's version of I Believe I Can Fly and gives those artists NO CREDIT OR PAYMENT.<br /><br />What a disgusting load of garbage this show and its creators are. To quote the great Jeff Winger: \\"I don't understand the appeal at all.\\"
0547328567|1.0|This is not a Big Book.  I'm not sure why it is advertised under the selection of oversized paperback children's books.  It's a lot of money for a small paperback.  Steer clear.
B00A3ATW4M|1.0|According to Wired Magazine, this show apparently rips off independent music artists like Jonathon Coulton's version of Baby Got Back, or D.J.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One of the better books by Clancy.. Was not long enough and really hated to see it end..Have already recommended it to my ready friends..
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well done Andy! Wasn't sure about the diary format but with so many positive reviews I had to try it. This book will make you laugh, maybe cry a second at the end. Plenty of suspense throughout. I believe this book would make a great movie. Don't pass this one up. Even if you are not into science fiction,  The Martian will be one of the  best books you've read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love to read! This one is on my favorites list now. The events in this book were unexpected, heart wrenching, and heartwarming. All emotions are experienced! A page turner, for sure.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I like this show.  The dialogue is well written and engaging, and the acting is top notch.  I just wish Alicia and Will would get back together.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I can see why it is a best seller. I haven't finished it yet. I ordered it as an ebook on my Kindle. I highly recommend this book if people need to know why life is so tuff and how to deal with it. This is an exceptional well written book and very helpful!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The storyline was good and loads of fun games. Very entertaining and different levels of difficulty. Enjoyed the hidden object games too. Tell your friends about it. Need more games like this.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love Christmas music, but I'm not a fan of Rod Stewart. I typically don't listen to his music at all. But since I love Christmas music, I bought this CD and I can honestly say it's now one of my favorite Christmas albums. I rarely find a CD that I can listen to all the way through without skipping a song or two, but this one is perfect. My favorite songs on the album are &#34;Merry Christmas, Baby&#34; and &#34;When You Wish Upon A Star.&#34; Being a Disney fan, I have heard many versions of &#34;When You Wish Upon A Star,&#34; and this is surprisingly one of my favorites. I would buy this CD again and again.
030758836X|3.0|Twisted, but it was not quite what I expected. Interesting, but not up to all the hype. Worth reading though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was told so well.  Very fast easy read.  I felt like I was there.<br />Sad to see the trailer for the movie.  Disappointed that already the movie does not depict the book.<br />Small details like hair color for the actors since it was a huge part of the book.<br />Recommend the book to any romantic with some mystery.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't believe how awesome the graphics are for this version. I thought the first one was good but this one is fantastic! I'm actually afraid to get caught by this monkey thing. Great job! This is by far my favorite game ever!
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is a lovely and heart warming story.  Based on a true story, this is movie you can enjoy with the whole family.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a great game only one small drawback.. I can't stop playing it and checking it for new coins.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Gameplay is slow. The drawn stickman is funny though. Its okay to bring up every once in a while. I wouldn't pay money for it though.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love playing this game with my daughter. We work together and take turns doing the mini games. We cannot visit our friends game because it crashes the whole game. This is the only thing that really bothers me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Every time I thought I knew what was about to happen The book went a whole different way. This book mad m  laugh, cry, have anxiety, and literally made my heart skip a beat with some the lines Holder threw out. I would highly recommend this book to anybody!
B003WH765U|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  The setting and background is awesome. A true drama, with great acting.  But, with beautiful music and comedy to enhance it--what more could you ask from a movie?
B004HAEGP4|5.0|This is another episode in the video game based film franchise. Plenty of guns, explosions and grotesque zombies and mutants.<br />Was never going to be nominated for an oscar so please don't pick apart the plot or explore character development; just enjoy it for what it is, good mindless action. Love it. More please!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I have always greatly enjoyed the entire series--all eight seasons.  With the complete series, all eight, in my library, I can enjoy any of the wonderful episodes at my leisure.  The only problem is that I've watched them so much, I may wear them out and have to buy a new set.  Oh well.
B0072V3AFW|1.0|a spaghetti western at its worst.  Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was.  Thankfully, it was only a rental. Never bothered beyond the first ten minutes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool. love it. it is so much better than the other horse game. I will play this all the time.
0887306667|4.0|I've always been a sucker and admirer of great marketing and this book unveils why some brands are so effective. The wisdom that drips from the pages of this book is amazing even though some of the examples and companies didn't pan out as the book predicted. The spirit of great and effective marketing is demonstrated in page after page in this short lesson but anyone who is in business (and who isn't?) could benefit from reading it. In summary, to invest your time in this 150 page book is one of the wisest things you could do.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! You just don't know what will happen. You fall in love with the characters fast and hard. You never know what will happen. You don't want to put it down. Very good read, I will read it again and again. Great book.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Not what I thought.  Incredibly dark & disturbing.  More dramatic than action oriented.  Attempts to make you think, but plot is sick.  Stick to Inception if you want to think while asses are kicked.
141659521X|5.0|I recommend this great book to all Vince Flynn fans.  He does not disappoint in his mysterious book. I look forward to more of his books.
B008HK3XU4|2.0|The case is sturdy but when it is in a position to prob the Kindle up it easily moves when screen is tapped.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|There's so much to say about this show, but to put it simply: this show is absolutely perfect.  The actors (big and small), the writing, the music, everything.<br /><br />The end of Reichenbach Fall will leave you emotionally devastated, completely puzzled, and counting down the hours until season 3.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!! It is challenging but fun to play. Its a little harder than the first game but not to hard to play. It os an awesome game to pass time. Very addicting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a fun game, its very colorful.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing solitaire. Its a good way to pass the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game. This game really shows the personalities of a horse and i think that this is a great thing.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I love this product, it was exactly what I was looking for.  I love the fact that you can rotate your kindle and stand it up in either direction.  I thought the price was fair as well.
B009GESJH2|5.0|one of his best yet, language isnt bad, lots of new music. the original rebel is coming into his own and making it more for everyone not jnust the older crowd
B008745B32|1.0|Did not hate the Book,but it bored me.Did not finish it.No real relationships.The coolness of the young and rich is irritating.
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|Terribly cliché, overtly femme. The idea is cute, the characters promising, but the execution is naive.  I am a fan of many cozy mystery novels, but this one left an oversweet taste in my mouth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Kids love it. It makes time go by so quickly. I even play this and I'm the mom. The picture is great with the kindle fire hd
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Expensive. The applicator is smaller than what it looks like on its web page but the amount required per processor in minimal so there is probably enough compound for a dozen applications. Read the instructions on how to apply on their web site. It works well. Shipped ritght away
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great read. Everyone struggles \\"fitting in\\" in middle school, but Auggie has so much more to overcome. A great reminder to not judge a book by it's cover. That the lesson was two fold, August and Julian, both misjudged.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|My friend is hooked on this game. I found it boring even on the highest level. I think it would be a good game for the young or the elderly.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Ok so I had to see this because of all the hype but I have to say I was not impressed with this movie. The acting was terrible!! I mean I know &#34;alright, alright, alright&#34; is like Matthew Mcconaughey's &#34;catch phrase&#34; so to speak but...I feel like we already heard it so many times in &#34;Dazed and Confused&#34; and now we have to hear it a million more times in this movie? #annoying. Yes, The men stripping in this movie was pretty awesome but I feel like that's where most of the time was devoted, and not in the rest of the movie. Thumbs down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I would highly recommend this one.  I didn't want to see it come to an end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw someone play this game and I wasn't sure about it.So I asked him what you do and he said it's simple.You're running away from a cop and you get power ups like super sneakers,or coin magnet (my favorite),or well you get the picture.So that night I got on my kindle fire and looked to see how much you had to pay for it and I was so exited because it was F.R.E.E.And now I can't stop playing this awesome game<br /><br />how to play:jump slide up,roll slide down,left slide to the left,right slide to the right,avoid trains,<br /><br />power ups:jet pack go to the sky,super sneakers jump really high,coin magnet be anywhere coins will come to you,x2 multiplyer makes you go faster get double the points.<br />these only stay for a limited time on you're body.<br /><br />get coins and don't get caught by the cop!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg this new temple run is awesome I just got it and I love it!!!!!!!!:)wow you should get it its awesome
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This product was great. I have already watched once thorugh and plan to do so agian. Wonderful show, great purchase
B000FBFN1U|3.0|Great continuing saga.  If you're this far in the series, odds are you'll really enjoy this book.  It's a heavy read, but one that will leave you with memories of betrayal, loyalty, honor and mystery.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was my fist Harlequin romance novel and I really enjoyed it! Fast read, full of surprise, suspense, and romance.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy solitaire, but I have not been able to win a single game even using the &#34;winning deal&#34;.  But, I will continue to play it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. its so much fun and the graphics are great. I just wish you could take care of your horse yourself. I recommend this game for everyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really fun but my mom keeps taking it and trying to play but she cant get my password!!! so yeah it is a lot of fun
B004C03L4G|5.0|For those who are looking for a daily inspirational message this book is perfect.  The author respect the religious thing and remains in the field of espirituality, giving messages that can be very good and nice for everybody.<br /><br />Very good book, loud and clear, each meditation to the point and with a deep respect for the reader.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the game is fun but when they stop playing when its their turn you can not play. The game also is a waste of time and money!!!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Love the movie, love the soundtrack! My only wish is that it included more songs from the other performers like the sockapellas!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a truly amazing and inspiring story. I couldn't stop reading it. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read!!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|We scooped this up at a great price and the kids were excited.  It has already been watched several times.  &#34;A person's a person no matter how small.&#34;  Great words to live by.
B0072OFM28|5.0|If you have watched the previous season, this is a must.  Although we all know how the legend ends.  Liam McIntyre isn't Andy Whitfield nor should he be, but the supporting cast of characters make this season a good show.  Their stories take the front and center stage.  Liam is a great replacement for Andy.  I think that the writers did a good job including him in advancing the story. I will buy the last season as well.  The DVD set is certainly cheaper than subscribing to STARZ for those of us who are economically minded.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun and very challenge. It keeps challenge you and you never get tired of this game
B004LROMSO|5.0|This is an interesting take on Camelot.  The writers bring a new slant to the old stories.  I liked the other stories but this one is really unique.  I would recommend buying the first and only season if nothing else but for the novelty of a new story line on Arthur.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its fun but I never get to play it because it never ever ever ever loads it is tooooo slow if it lets me get on
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this app is the best. it is just like the computer version and scary. I got 7 pages on my first game then turned around and he was sitting there like two feet away watching me like a creep.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|How can you call this \\"highlights\\", (which to me is an insult) without \\"Do you hear the people sing?\\" or \\"A little fall of rain\\" or even Fantine's Death?? You add songs that were never part of Les Mis and then leave out songs that helped it become the the phenomenon it is today?? The rally of Do you hear the people sing is central to the revolution. This \\"Soundtrack\\" is sorely lacking and I will NOT be buying it..
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|So far, I have only been able to view the free items on the show, but, if it is anywhere near as good as Season 1, than I am totally going to love it!!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Interesting features such as the british fashist activities.But little on the British involvment either in Europe or the Far East.Dont think the Ghurkas and Kiswis were mentioned at all.If so, only very briefly.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Play online with friends or random people.  Some games last for days and others get done more quickly.  Overall a  great game.
B004132HZS|5.0|This modern Sherlock takes the prize.  The storylines are intriguing, the use of text messaging to get an insight into the minds of Sherlock, Dr. Watson, and their enemies is fasciniating and clever.  Much like the PBS series &#34;Wallander,&#34;  I hope to see many more installments of &#34;Sherlock.&#34;
B009P5S11G|5.0|You know what, so many people hate on this girl so much. I am so proud of Rihanna............she has come a long way. Her vocals have improved greatly. I think Rih is very versatile and hardworking in spite of what the haters say. She has a distinctive voice and that is what sets her apart from everyone else (unique). She takes risks and dare to be different. Keep it up Rih, this is a very good album. I've been playing it since i bought it. I can listen to the whole album. I think she should have way more sales in the US by now than what she has. She proves her haters wrong. So, you guys can keep hating all you want.<br /><br />GO AND SUPPORT YO GIRLS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The end of Season 2 of Sherlock leaves quite a cliffhanger.  But just like season one, the writing and acting are flawless.  I am anxiously awaiting season 3 to see what will happen next.  Dr. Watson's character has developed into quite a match for Sherlock.
0374214913|5.0|This book captures the thrill of the search in research, affirms the unique gifts each of us brings to a successful collaboration, and breaks down the high walls of the silos in which we tend to circumscribe our work.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|I love to watch this movie! I am a huge classic movie buff and i am trying to get my collection back up there on DVD. I have some on VHS but i dont have a player anymore. So i have to rebuy them. I adore Katherine Hepburn and she is aces in this picture with Cary Grant. It most hilarious! A must see if you havent seen it yet. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a good read with a twist of a sad story and an interesting end. I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book and can't wait for part three to hit the stores later this year!  It is a great romantic story that will keep you wanting more!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first Nicholas Sparks book. I saw an advertisement announcing a new movie called Safe Haven, then saw the book and decided to read it. Well, I couldn't put it down. The ending kept me on the edge of my seat holding my breath. Very well written.
B00AE2J93I|3.0|I rented this on recommendation from my boyfriend. He said this was his favorite movie from 2012.<br /><br />On a technical aspect, this movie was gorgeous. Stop motion is hard and this movie does it beautifully. Only Tim Burton could do it any better. Really enjoyed the look of the film.<br /><br />Unlike Avatar, the animation wasn't enough to keep my attention. The story is about a boy who can see and talk to ghosts. Which he does frequently. Instead of developing relationships with real people he develops relationships with ghosts. So of course, he is labeled as the weird kid and gets picked on and beat up. Neil, chubby eccentric kid tries to make friends with him (in the most stalker like way possible).<br /><br />While all this is going on, Norman's uncle realizes the witch that cursed the town is about to wake up. He tries to recruit Norman to go to the cemetery and read to her grave to put her back to sleep. Norman is unfazed by this and blows him off. Later during a play, Norman begins to have visions which ruins the play and gets him grounded for being weird.<br /><br />His uncle dies and comes to Norman as a ghost and tells him he must go get the book and read to the grave, Norman reluctantly agrees and his uncle departs for the afterlife. Norman goes to his Uncle's house and has to pry the book out of his uncle's dead hands. He goes to the grave and starts to read but is confronted by the school bully who prevents Norman from reading the story, so the witch wakes up.<br /><br />Zombies start rising from the graves sending everyone into a panic. Norman, Neil, Norman's sister and Niel's brother get confronted by the zombies and the town mob at town all. The witch appears and starts attacking. Norman climbs the Town Hall to read the story but the witch destroys the book and knocks Norman out.<br /><br />When Norman was passed out and has a vision that the \\"witch\\" was actually a young girl named Agatha who could talk to ghosts like him. She was executed for being a witch but cursed the town before she died. When he wakes up he realizes the Zombies (the men who sentenced and executed Agatha) were trying to talk to him and get him to calm Agatha's spirit to make amends for what they did to her.<br /><br />He slips the Zombies pass the mob and they show him Agatha's resting place now the center of her power. Norman realizes he doesn't want to just put her back to sleep but to save her. He reminds her of the good things she had in life.<br /><br />She calms down and joins the afterlife as the curse lifts. Norman is a hero and he enjoys a quiet family movie with mom, dad, sis and grandma's ghost.<br /><br />Really felt like every weird kid becomes a hero tale...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Simply the best game on the Android market. Runs very smooth on my kindle fire HD. I highly recommend this game
1465001107|5.0|EVERY YEAR I HAVE TO GET MJ CALENDER SO GLAD AMAZON COMES THREW EACH YEAR IT JUST WOULDN'TBE A FINISHED ROOM MJ ALL OVER THE PICTURE ARE JUST GREAT NO CALENDER THE SAME
B004J4WNL2|5.0|My manager had told me to purchase the book, that it is a good read, so I did and enjoyed it. I like the fact that amazon makes it easy to download onto my IPAD, I did not have to wait for the mail.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. A must read not just for those looking to become a writer or wanting to learn how a superstar does it, but also and especially for fans of Mr.King.<br /><br />The book is not just about writing, it is about his life as a child and a teen, his life as he became a published and highly successful author, and the events that happened over a decade ago when he was nearly killed.  It is about love of his craft and his family.  It is about addiction and pain.  I suspect it is as close to an Autobiography as we will ever get from Mr. King.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|All around excellent TV show. Good acting and writing. Definitely, one of the best shows on TV that I watch.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|What maybe should have been purely juvenile adolescent humor and fun (and it is that don't get me wrong) is almost deep a time or two as well.  It's not the greatest film ever, and it won't change your life, but for what it is and what it tried to do, it succeeded.  Plus, Flash Gordon and Sam J. Jones?  Yeah that's a big part of my childhood and I marked out like a kid again.  Loved this movie.
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|I don't know how many people have said this don't work because it does I just converted epub books into mobi and it works now I have my books from my nook on my kindle it was and is worth the $3 I spent
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I think I may have enjoyed it more if I had not enjoyed all the hype around it. However it is still a great movie that stands well on it's own. Action from beginning to end.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I am not a huge fan of DC comics, but this film ranked up there with my favorite Marvel flicks.  Great Job!!!
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Ok I chose 5 stars because I love the album.  It is not perfect, it is redundant if you own live at Leeds...unless you're a who fan,in which case I think it's essential.  I'm amazed how similar, and how different, it is to LAL... I have LAL burned into my DNA, I've listened to it so many times and yet it's wonderful hearing the groovier version of young man blues and the heavy, insistent my gen. It truly shows that the who improvised to a degree every night, townshend colours his solos quite differently and I believe that moon's drumming is more vibrant in the hull session.<br />It makes me want to cry that Townshend burned all the tapes of the preceding American tour....
B0063IH60K|3.0|Gets a little boring at times, but fills the time and I get to win more an wth regular cards
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I purchased one of these for my 6 month old daughter after my friend told me how much her son loves his. My daughter is a swaddle junkie but because she's rolling over now, we have to break her of the swaddle.  This cute little &#34;Wubbie&#34; is the perfect thing that keeps her little hands busy when she's trying to fall asleep. Instead of pulling her soothie out of her mouth and then focusing on putting it back in, she cuddles and plays with the little monkey. Great product!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a huge horse back rider I have been doing it sience I was 6 and this is Jew like real life
0525953728|5.0|Bought this for my husband who is not a reader (yet) and he read it in 4 days.  He said he really enjoyed it!
B002DQLGHU|2.0|Being able to order this product online and immediately watch it is very convenient. However, it would pause mid-film to load the movie again.!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great app no ads especially if you love star wars I would recommend this to a friend love playing this game
0345803485|1.0|Like many, I bought 50 shades due to all the hype.  What worries me is that this book promotes dangerous behavior (not the BDSM, but an intelligent, educated woman NOT walking away from a man who wants her to sign an NDA and a BDSM agreement).  The leading man is an emotionally sick individual.  So, just because he's rich and handsome, she's drawn to him?  Please.  If he were an average Joe with these tendencies, he would have restraining orders against him, and probably have done some jail time.  Knowing he was not normal, he still took her virginity.  This story is about severe mental health issues.<br /><br />Women should learn about and experience sex in at least a healthly, if not loving, relationship.<br /><br />This isn't a story about erotica, though the many (too many) scenes obviously are what is bringing all the attention.  This is a story about a sick, control freak who needs help, not another victim.  Shame on the author, who is a mother, for providing such a rationalization for bad behavior, and subsequent role models.<br /><br />What's really bothersome isn't that there is yet another a badly written story with a dangerous message for women of all ages.  It's worrisome that it's a bestseller.<br /><br />As Dorothy Parker said, \\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\\"
B005K17RU0|5.0|Awesome app! Great graphics and color. Easy to navigate, very informative. I use this app every single day of the week.
B004RSCWZ2|2.0|Im 60 yeaRS old and am a bass player so I know what I like and what I dont. I was raised on thew Allman Bros wo Mr. Trucks<br />and w/ him and loved it all. Now he plays with mS Tedeschj and its not the same whatr morw can I say ?
B004TI5N38|5.0|a typical book by baldacci; his books are great & i rate them highly; another one of his bests; if you like baldacci, you will enjoy this one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the original was amazing. I didn't think it could get anymore addicting... but temple run 2 is amazing!! it blows the 1st one out of the water!!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|it was one of the dumbes movies i ever seen no rime or reason for what bwas going on not worth the bmony
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is becoming one of my top author.  He makes it hard to put his books down.  I can't wait until his next book come out..
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I could not put it down. It was one of the best free books I have read on my new Kindle.
B007WTFWJ6|4.0|This book helps me to understand and know how to make a good code change after debugging a bug - functionality or performance.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|This movie was a decent movie.  I enjoyed the story even though it's just like every other possession/horror type of movie, but it had some good parts to it.  However, the problems I'm having has nothing to do with this movie in particular.  Amazon lately has been f****** killing me!  Pretty much every movie I've watched on Amazon has buffered and had an error message with a try again option and I can't even enjoy a movie experience without having to restart the movie more than three times.  It's starting to really piss me off and I'm debating to not even watch movies on Amazon for this reason.  Amazon needs to fix it's server because it never works properly.  I'm not paying $3 for watching a movie that constantly has issues.  FIX YOUR S***!
030758836X|1.0|Was given this as a gift.  I can and do read anything and everything, but this was intolerable.  Never held my interest, didn't care about the characters.  Read a sample before buying
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! When I'm not at the stables, I can just go on this app and take care of horses and feel as if these horses are really alive. If you love horses, get this app!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I was introduced to this character through The recent movie. I was intrigued and decided to read the first book of the series. It was ok, however the author's writing style has shown much improvement in this second book. I have decided to go on and read the third.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for all ages I play I'm 12 and my 18 year old sister plays it to great fun for everyone
B004YXE438|5.0|Just remember when you do too many 2D's,.. you may eventually have problems later, when working an actual, physical puzzle...
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I love this movie!  I was so excited to see they had it on here!  It is a very good movie.  Lots of action and suspense.  All in all it was a great movie.  I really enjoyed it.
B000W3Q1HG|5.0|Though much of this book seems based in mysticism...I have a better understanding of the Toltecs and their culture...I am hoping to delve into more of Don Miguel Ruiz's books...if only to increase said understanding...
B0063IH60K|3.0|but this game , though it kills time,  is to easy.  I found myself winning game after game in very few moves. I would like to see maybe another level.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Only use this app if you need a quick on screen way to track a task or remind yourself of limited info...
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The story has a little of everything;mystery,danger,intrigue,history, and romance. I thought the changes between characters and time periods were well done and easily followed.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's nice all I really needed was the time from it but it's pretty cool. The dimmer is awesome and I like the easy settings.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Addictive!  I am a bit behind the power curve since this show originally aired in 2006,  but its never to late to have a good time....dexter is a good time!<br />Enjoy!
B009SKPVO8|4.0|I also found this strap at Best Buy, like mentioned in a previous post. You do notice the pad slide down to your chest when you've moved the camera a few times, but I wasn't expecting the best out of 25 bucks. I don't normally like having a strap on my camera, because I prefer to just hold it in hand, but it's very useful to have when traveling on trails or hikes. I use a Sony A55 with a few different(sometimes heavy) Minolta lenses and it feels sturdy. I'd recommend it to someone who doesn't have 40+ to spend on a sometimes unnecessary accessory.
B009X01C64|5.0|This is a very well-made and sturdy case/stand for the 8.9\\" Kindle Fire. A lot of book stands are complicated for me to figure out how to adjust, but I had no problem at all with this one. I have used it for viewing Netflix videos, reading ebooks, Facebooking, etc., but I found that I use it most for setting on my kitchen counter with a cooking recipe onscreen while I cook. This product works precisely as advertised and is perfect for hands-free use of the new Kindle Fire.
B0000000LI|5.0|This product is very good, and it is what I like to buy it,  and it is a very good deal!
B007N0AEWY|5.0|I came to this album by way of a car commercial.  Yes, I was hooked by the song \\"Say I Wanna Know\\" when it was used as the background music in a commercial for a luxury car. I heard the music, did my internet search, and found Nick Waterhouse on Amazon.  The production makes you feel like you're in a jazz club, and you can hear the separation in space between the background singers, drummer, guitars and horn section.  It's a great album, and you'll think of the 60's, Pulp Fiction and Mad Men when you listen.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The perfect combination of romance and suspense! Definitely a great book! I am curious to see how the movie compares...
B005EHILV4|5.0|This preamp really added control for an MXL 990 microphone when hooked to USB.  Great addition to a home recording studio.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Never understood what the hype about angry birds was until I downloaded this game.  Oh my, very addicting cause you need to get the 3 stars on every level.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|One of our geezer friends said he LOVED it so we rented.  I love Family Guy so a &#34;Seth MacFarlane&#34; seemed a good choice.  But to me the humor lacked the cleverness in F-G and I had trouble getting into it.  The compelling minutes to me were the beginning and ending - where life comes into the bear and .... not to spoil.  Here I believed it.  But otherwise, it was hokey.  My wife, in a big surprise to me, liked it far better and she only tolerates F-G and Robot Chicken.  Go figure!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  Most of Stephen King's books are rather scary, but this one is just suspenseful.  Makes you stop and think about how what we do in life can change the course of the future.  Loved the ending.
0679809015|4.0|My son really likes this book because of the flaps.  It is a lot smaller than I originally thought it was but a perfect size for my son to carry around
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's very nice and neet. The thing that I like about it is you choose your tone for your alarm...
B009E3EY4M|5.0|If you are a Led Zeppelin fan this is a must have.  The band after all of these years Led Zeppelin does a great job with this concert, amazing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I have not finished the book yet.  It was a little slow at first to catch my attention but after a few chapters it did and I am enjoying it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game is fun without being so hard you feel like beating your head against the wall. Graphics were great.<br />The only drawback is it's only partially free
B008M721MS|5.0|I love Skype I get to have coffee with my sister who lives in California. We haven' t seen o e another in years
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this sequel. It had one check of a cliffhanger at the end which I loved. Even better than Beautiful Creatures.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|Amazon should list this 5.1 re-mastered version of 2112 on Blu-ray DVD as a separate review. Yes, the album is the same in name but the sound quality is incomparable. Many of the reviews here on were posted long before this version was even released. Apples and oranges, if you will.<br /><br />There is also a great review of the re-mastered 2112 from Sound And Vision Magazine. I can't post the link here, but if you go to the site and search 2112 in 5.1 - the story will come up.
0394800184|5.0|Got it for my niece who was expecting a baby girl for her shower. Was my son's most favorite book
B002VECLVO|4.0|This film is so beautiful. The actors and actresses are so skilled, and the cinematography is amazing. I really enjoyed the glimpse of California in the 60s. This movie wasn't meant to be an action-packed thriller, so don't whine if you think it's too slow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing! If you think the first one is fun...this one is even better! You get to ride mine carts and zip lines!!!!! It is very glitchy on ipod but on kindle fire its great!! I definitly recommend this game to all people!!!!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|The music is upbeat, and the lyrics are downbeat: my favorite! Fun encourages me every time I listen, because they are honest about how people feel in difficult situations. Fun knows we're not perfect, but they are determined to make lemonade from lemons. I'll be watching them in the future.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games r ok. Dnt like the price 2 unlock more games. Think tht if u beat all the games in a section a new 1 should open up. Still play it daily so evidently there is something about it I like.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The developers really ouitdid themselves with this one. As an avid fan of Temple Run 1 and a disappointed one in Brave, this one definitely makes up for the mistakes of Brave. The graphics and gameplay are both outstanding and sticks with the basic premise of the original. My only question is...how do they make money off of this? Do that many people really buy the stuff they can eventually get for free (by playing and trying to advance farther)? Doesn't matter, I'm glad I got it...FREE.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I have all 3 of Glee's Christmas cd's and I love them all. The singing is great, the music upbeat. Great addition to our Christmas collection.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Some courses are easy, some are hard. And that's what keeps me coming back to this. I want to unlock those other courses, to see what challenges await me. In real life I don't like playing golf, but on my Kindle there's nothing better!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A friend got me addicted to this game. I play it when I watch tv and it gives me hours of fun and challenge.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|... and easy to play.  The paths can be seen with just a little bit of analysis.  You should be able to progress through the levels faster, ie, fewer steps.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's a great game. The graphics are wonderful and so are the new features. But it isn't as responsive when you try to turn and it makes my thumb hurt, plus when I try to tilt it takes a while to adjust. It's not as good as the original.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just your typical solitaire game .. easy to play and relatively easy to win.  Nothing out of the ordinary to play.
B00138H0H4|5.0|There hasn't been another female artist that has come even close to writing or playing on brandi's level in 25 years.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful love story! This is on  of those books that once  you read it becomes a part of you. Treasure every day as if it were you  last.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie for some time, but like it even more on Blu-ray. Will watch it again and again.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This movie has lovely music and great visual appeal.  I was surprised by the cast, they were all very talented and believable.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this game and enjoyed the play and graphics,  but the only way to get it to play was to delete it and download it again.  And the only way to exit is to hit the home button.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. The graphics are phenominal and there has been a lot more obstacles added to make the game more fun! This game us definitely worth the download.(:
1250006341|5.0|We are such fans of Downton Abbey and the book just opens up the love of the show more.  Definitely a great gift for a DA fan.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Disappointing story line. I was ready to stop reading half way through but endured to the end. The story was too long and the end unsatisfying.
1250027624|5.0|Again, if you are a fan of the show or enjoy this era, it is a must for your bookshelves.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Excellent techno-thriller!<br />This is his first book.<br />I highly recommend this and all of this author's books if your are interested in technical fiction.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I am hooked on H.O. adventure games. The atmosphere of this one was nice and spooky. The puzzles we r e not too hard and the hints were helpful. Several hours of playtime over several days.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Excellent techno-thriller!<br />This is his third book.<br />I highly recommend this and all of this author's books if your are interested in technical fiction.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Don't:  *expect a neat wrap-up.<br /><br />Do:  * enjoy an engaging near-future imagining of corporate genetic-tampering & all that comes with it.<br /><br />  *Buy this book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|get this game it's free and it's great and intertens your kids will you'll love it. It is so fun
B008RA3X5E|1.0|It may be something wrong with the download, or a error made by the operator (ME), but it would not display the time after the alarm was set, and the alarm did not go off, Spent to much time trying to get it to work, especially since my cell phon does all this stuff with no trouble.
B0095P31L6|1.0|Some movies can be stupid to the point of being funny, but this movie goes beyond that point, and is so incredibly stupid that it is not the least bit funny.  Just pointess and stupid, without any redeaming qualities at all!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the game has locked up on me so i removed it from my device and now it will not let me get it back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app the picture is great and its really simple to follow my three year old loves this game worth every penny
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has imagination, self-discipline, and a deep-seated love of wisdom traditions. I read some esoteric Toltec stuff years ago, but this is REAL advice that you can put into practice immediately. A perfect addition for anyone involved in personal or professional development.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. It is definitely addictive. I had to remind myself I was on vacation with other people so that I would put it down. Definitely a good choice!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sorry to hade it end!<br />Hope I can find another series to read.  Great story and love triangle now to watch the movies
0375869026|5.0|I gave this book to my granddaughter for Christmas and her eyes lit up when she saw the title.  She said she had ben waiting to read this at school but it is always checked out.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|I can't say I remember the movie, I haven't seen it in at least 30 years, but I remember it was good, and my dad liked it
B00008O89K|1.0|My tracks constantly stuttered and were overwhelmed with static.  Not even passable quality.  Low quality insert, overall I think I could bootleg this myself and do better with an old VHS tape.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|I loved this book (kindle version).  I have enjoyed every one of Jeffrey Archer's books from start to finish, he always writes books that are hard to put down.  I would say that other than Kane and Abel and the first 2 books of the Clifton chronicles that A Prisoner of Birth is my favourite.  This is coming from someone who has only ever read and finished reading biographies. I have tried to read many works of fiction from other authors but been disappointed.  Jeffrey's characters are very interesting; the story develops quickly with no chance for boredom; the story is not padded out with over-the-top descriptions like many authors - it is full of twists and turns and the outcome unpredictable.<br />I look forward to my next Archer book including the 3rd and last book in the Clifton chronicles.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent graphics and entertaining keeps you guessing on what to do next great storyline I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hidden objects games.<br />Look forward to playing more games
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I downloaded this ap. Because it was free (special deal) but now that I<br />have tried it, well worth purchasing. Wide variety of cool background noises,<br />with new content available periodically. Simple video<br />Comes with it (still shots) this might be improved. But overall excellent. Thanks!
B003N0XDT4|1.0|I was looking so forward to getting this item after reading the GOOD reviews. I always read the BAD reviews too but didn't pay much attention.<br />Well I also got a faulty unit. It works fine when using the USB connected to my laptop, but as soon as I disconnect the USB......nothing. I am the kind of person who will not return to a restaurant under any circumstances if I have a bad experience, so I will not be purchasing another FiiO product after this disappointment.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|after reinstalling and getting stuck in the managers office again I found a key I was missing the first time around. Glitch or user error? I'm still not sure but the second time around was enjoyable.
B005LAII8A|1.0|Me, my husband and family watched this movie on a recent Friday \\"movie\\" night.  Bleh.  It was incredibly pointless in its basic plot premise.  The acting was ok.  I think I'm a bit biased because the plot was just so ....yuck.  In short, don't waste your hard earned money; I wish I could send you my dvd.  Second thought, I think I'll just throw it in the trash.
0988262592|5.0|Let me first start out by saying this is the first IT related book I have read in less than 24 hours. In fact I will go even further and say I probably haven't read a single book in less than a day, and I read a lot. I devoured this book. Why? It is quite simple. Gene has taken the plight of IT and distilled it down to a book that anyone who has suffered through long nights of project deployments, lived with the dichotomy of not just development and operations but IT and the \\"business\\", wished they could throw their cell phone at a wall maybe even someone's head, can read and immediately gain valuable insight into the \\"process\\" level issues that plague almost every single organization.<br /><br />Having worked in technology for almost 15 years I have always believed that the true value of technology is to facilitate business objectives, that IT enables the business to sell or produce a product or service, and that if alignment is not reached neither are the expectations of the share/stakeholders.<br /><br />I could write volumes of insight based on what Gene, Kevin, and George have written, but instead let me just say this. Pay particular attention to the comparison of IT to manufacturing, the similarities are uncanny. The 4 types of work described in the book were refreshing, but more so downright justifying. Managing the pipeline of project and IT related work while dealing with changes and emergency (or unplanned) work results in so many different system constraints. I have pondered on this dilemma for quite some time and always came to the conclusion that highly compensated IT resources know how to manage their time, when the reality is they struggle also because it always comes down to \\"who screams the loudest\\".<br /><br />The \\"Three Ways\\" framework the authors introduce is extremely important to understand. Improving the flow, feedback, and rigorously testing the system are vital components to achieving a lean, agile, and responsive system. Anyone who hopes tosucceed in the fast changing landscape of technology absolutely MUST READ this book. The dreary technical manuals and books serve a specific purpose, show how it can be done, but this book gives us access to the \\"big picture\\". It's time for an IT revolution, and I am VERY excited to see it happening.<br /><br />Parting thought, the character Wes, appeals to me for some strange reason.
B005MMYEF8|5.0|I've been a fan of Spartacus ...for years !  Years ago I happen to stumble on this on Netflix ..the blood, the guts, fight scenes ..great series !
B009329ZF2|4.0|Very good 4 stares Action was excellent . The store line was plausible except for the old ship outher then that is was good
B00B2V66VS|4.0|everything looks wonderful but controls are laggy so jumps are missed as are turns which is very annoying. running on an s3 so not exactly dated hardware. Fix the lag and it will be 5 stars.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Short and to the point.  There are good practical ideas to use in the everyday world.<br />Time to put this to work.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Overall excellent movie, I've watched it at least five times, I normally don't like musicals, I give it two thumbs up.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The puzzles are challenging without being hard, and the controls are spot on.  The game flows  well and comes highly recommended.  Be sure to put a hour or two aside.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend, and it did not disappoint!  Topic is fascinating and inspiring.  Great read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Totally Addicting. The cast is superb and the story lines are delightfully intriguing. Historical fiction at its finest<br /><br />A must watch!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|a very fun game. would recommend to all. many hours and relaxzation with this app. don't regret this buy at all. thank you
0425263908|5.0|Great book to read, sex is great.  Shades of gray was too controlling for me, so this was a book my co-worker suggested; great choice.
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|i just didn't really like it that well the instruction are kind of hard to understand and it seems like your doing the same thing over and over
B00B2V66VS|4.0|very well done.  try it!  fast paced but intuitive, if you liked the first one, you'll love this one. hey!
B009M1QRM8|5.0|COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN, it was very interesting and fast pasted.<br />It's nice to see other side of Pendagrast.<br />Enjoyed the fact that there was 2 more stories on going.<br />Can't wait for the next one.

B008HK3XOU|4.0|The cover is strong & protects well. I like the on & off feature when opening & closing the cover.<br />The cover is manufactured backwards. You can only plug in the charger with cover open.<br />MY GIANT
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun and not to hard nice graphics and Inc  feeding the horse stuff we like to play together a d had a nice time doing this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|why?<br />better graphics<br />a little tougher<br />more fun!<br />FREE!<br />there are a million reasons why you should get this amazing app. if u loved temple run, get it!
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|The movie is overlooked because of the subject matter I guess; but look who is in the movie?  It is a very good movie.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|great show if you don't mind the violence. Similar to the Soprano's. A gangs a gangs just in different clothing and differnece vehicles.  suits and cadies or leather and bikes.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I don't normally finish books I start to read but I must say I couldn't wait to keep reading with this one. I have no idea how or why but I couldn't wait to move on to the next chapter. It's not the best book ever but it was very cute and kept me entertained. I would recommend it. I'm giving it 4 stars because I noticed a few grammatical errors and it kind of bugged me.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Mostly pretty good. This is really my first Taylor swift CD and I like about every other song, so worth it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|One of my friends said this game was so fun so I looked it up and started playing. This app is the best app I have ever played. I check my account ever day and there is always so much to do...definitely worth downloading...I can't believe this app is free.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was AMAZING. Colleen Hoover did an awesome job with creating a book that capture the reader in every emotion, situation, and you just get so lost in the book that it almost becomes your reality. I cannot believe the wicked twist in the story I would have never ever thought this book would go that route but it was worth it.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friend who enjoys reading as much as I do.<br />If you enjoy a book that has a very developed character, drags you into every emotional roller coaster,  a book that you can't but down, and a book that keeps you on your toes this book is for you.
B002BVYBBK|4.0|The Fast and the Furious movie that started it all.  Once of my favorites.  The acting isn't the greatest, but the action is.  You have to watch it for the ridiculousness.
B000001E29|5.0|I have been listening to Tom Waits for a very long while now and have somehow managed to skip over this for so many years.  Maybe because the first track I listened to was \\"Oily night\\"....  This album creates an entire world to immerse yourself into.  One thing I recommend when starting this album is to not skip tracks or start in the middle.  You get an intense feeling of the environment that Waits is trying to create listening to the album the whole way through. This my friends is one of Waits classics.  \\"Flash Pan Hunter\\" is my personal favorite.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|We purchased this as a gift for one nephew who really enjoys it.  It was such a hit, another nephew just had to have it too!  Thus where this second purchase came from.  If you can find it at a decent price ($35 or less), grab it while you can.  Can't go wrong with Creationary!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch perfect is an awesome movie would suggest to anyone looking for a good laugh.  Amazon instant video feed horrible.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This latest album from Two Steps From Hell is awesome.  I can't rank this higher than the other two previous releases (Invincible & Archangel) because they are all equally good.
6305558167|5.0|Excellent movie! A great and lush telling of the King Arthur Legends. The Director commentary was fascinating as well. DVD arrived very quickly and in excellent condition.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|Tim brings some outstanding concepts and delivers them in a humerous and interesting way. I have implimented heaps of the concepts in the book. Reccomendd for any make 16+ and any chick that wants to lose weight or work her booty.<br />Love it.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This one paled in comparison to the original. This remake seemed to be missing half the story line. It left me unimpressed, another Promethius. I love remakes an by rights they should be better. Improved story line, better cinematography,  better directing and editing.  After all, the model is ready to improve on.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Who doesn't like games.  This is an old standby, but enjoyable, nonetheless.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys passing the time with a game.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Great read.  Hard to put down once you get started.  On to the next Reacher book.  Enjoyed this one.  Read on.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Yes - I prefer things to adhere to the KISS approach, but this app is not really stupid.  I'm familiar with advanced calculators and this does everything I need.  Keep in mind its not a graphing calc. app.<br /><br />The numbers and output display are a great size.  With my iPod held in a portrait view the simple functions are present and well laid out.  If I need to do longer calculations (like figuring interest in one calculation) I just rotate my device to a landscape view and 'wa la' it turns into an advanced calculator.  Buttons are still easy to see and push.  I rarely have fat fingers with this app.  Perfect for a semi-nerd like me!!!  I highly recommend this app and I probably use it at least once or twice a day.  My thumbs are up!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is fabulous! I read it from front to back several times. I recommend it for all ages. A very good read!
1449415881|5.0|I buy this calendar every year for my engineer husband - a true nerd like Dilbert!  He puts it on the kitchen windowsill so that I (a true nerd like Dilbert!) can also get my daily laugh!
B002GHHHP6|5.0|I bought the VHS version a few years back, and when I saw this version on Amazon, it reminded me that the film had interesting twists on actors and their parts as well as the twists at the end. Typical &#34;James Garner&#34; characters (the cynical sense of humor like Rockford and the TV version of Maverick), this film does not disappoint on humor and banter. There are all sorts of &#34;nods&#34; to the Western genre and all the &#34;old&#34; actors who played characters on the old TV and film Westerns. Several had speaking parts, but many were in the &#34;grand poker game&#34; (too many to name, but fun to see again).
0060254920|5.0|I have this book in my office, since my children are all adults now.  What can be said about the way that Maurice Sendak shows how mothers love their Wild Things, even when they're misbehaving?  After being sent to bed, Max goes on an adventure, returns to find his dinner waiting.  &#34;And it was still warm&#34; lives in my heart forever.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|We bought this case when we purchased a Kindle for our son.  It is a nice case. Serves its purpose.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I'm a Big Bang Theory addict and when I saw that the DVD's were available, I got out my credit card!  What does it tell you when I say that I can't wait for Season 6 to be over so that I may also own it?
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is perfect for kids of all ages. My kids even got me hooked on it. Very simple but fun. Also easy to make money so it doesnt get frustrating for the little ones.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I'm a Big Bang Theory addict and when I saw that the DVD's were available, I got out my credit card!  What does it tell you when I say that I can't wait for Season 6 to be over so that I may also own it?
B009DKFSUA|5.0|Very well put together tracks and lyrics are great.  Good beats, hot mixes.  Very relevant.  Worth the price if you like club music its all dance.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Well made knife, heavy and tought. Very thick blade, it´s very well balanced, and has a good grip. This knife feels indestructible and probally it´s !! If you´re looking for a badass knife that will handle everything you through at it, thats your knife.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great fun for my brain and my kids! we have found it challenging but not irritating and have shared with others.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I got this app because IT WAS FREE!!!!<br />I am soooo addicted to playing this game. It is simple, and fun. I am ashamed to admit that I am hooked and addicted. The only confusing part is trying to get to other people's zoo....<br />I don't like to link my facebook account... but felt I needed to so I could get more XP points... and hearts. Although I am not sure how it has helped me, and I HATE to get game requests from FB... so I feel guilty adding my FB account to this game!<br />If you need me I will be playing Wonder Zoo!<br />Oh Yes.... and super cute graphics!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|the characters are amazing, the playfulness of the couple is adorable, and the.storyline is breathtaking and beautiful! Good for teens :)
B0086700CM|5.0|Chose this app because it was free.<br />I get addicted to playing this game, and have to put it down and do my chores!<br />I would recommend it for all ages.<br />I give it a 5 stars!~
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 because you have better graphics and powerups also very good characters so play alot buy coins get addicted and get some chips
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little calculator. The feature i like is that it has a back button that really works. It's easy to fix a minor mistake by pressing the back button. Nothing fancy but much better than a phone calculator
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I really enjoy all of these type games from G five. I love how they're interactive and  all the mini games, and the graphics are always a treat.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|READ MY TITLE. THANX! DWNLOAD DWNLOAD DWNLOAD!!! Delete temple run, install  Temple Run 2! Bye bye temple run hello-o temple run 2
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked on Downton Abbey and look forward to each episode.  I love the dynamics between the aristocrats and the household staff.  Great story.
B0017JKEL8|4.0|the dvd it self was good and i enjoyed watching it<br />it took longer than expected to get to my house and the tracking system was not that great
B002GYI9C4|4.0|He creates a really interesting world and interesting complex characters, and it's just a really fun read. My only complaint is the lack of female characters, the ones he has are great, but there are very few.
0316069434|4.0|good idea for this story however i found it a bit too long in the center. harry is faster at gatering facts and i had to push through it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Graphics and storyline are great for a low cost.  A little short, but overall a nice game. I recommend it to anyone who likes hidden object and puzzle games.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app met all my expectations! absolutely amazing!! a little slow but still worth it. if your considering it, definately get it. it feels like your owning your own horse!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I enjoy having quick accees to a quick game of pac man on my tablet.  Love playing the retro classic games.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|I do like this game a lot.  I do wish there were word instructions and maybe a hint option, for when you get stuck.  But I love the graphics and the thinking involved.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|It was a great price when I ordered, came with Blu Ray, Digital Download and Amazon had a temporary digital download prior to receipt.  Good value.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A I love this because it's like wen I was little I always wanted a horse and now I get that chance...love it
B00B2V66VS|1.0|there is some bug but every time I go to the app it tells me that it inst responding it is still a great game and if you can play it you should get ig
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I love 'les mis' and have done since i first saw it on stage when i was 10 years old. I went on to read the novel the details of the characters in that were amazing, really shown in the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts. This movie however struggles on a few fronts.<br /><br />The first, and perhaps most obvious, is Javert. Russel Crowe tried his best but the part was just too difficult for his vocal range. The complexity of Javert comes out in his voice and Crowe is simply unable to do this consistantly, the result being a character that doesn't comes over as well as he could. I'm not saying anything against Crowe's acting ability here or his strength as a singer in general. He is a good singer who simply overreached himself a bit with this particular project (although the live singing probably didn't help him).<br /><br />The second front which the movie struggles on is the music itself. At times in the movie the directors either re-arrange the music, remove it completly or write new stuff. The movie directors seem to think that a ultra successful show that has been seen by millions doesn't know how to tell a story. For people who have not seen the musical before this is not a problem but for those who have it can cause confusion. The biggest changes have got to be the lines removed at the begining to introduce Javert and Valjean (as this is the whole plot of the story).The song 'do you hear the people sing' is also changed (and not for the better), the song should be Enjolras' call to arms but it has become a chorus song that has minimal musical impact. The removal of the song 'turning' also deminishes the impact of the revolution in the movie, making it seem like no-one but Marius is bothered about them.<br /><br />Overall the movie was good and I enjoyed it. The visuals were amasing, although at times they concentarted too much on visuals and not music. The costumes were good and so was the acting, unfortunatly the choice to make the actors sing live (althoughit made it more emotional) made the singing inconsistant and showed the struggles the actors had reaching and holding notes.<br />This movie is worth watching if you have not watched 'Les Mis' before. If you have then just bare in mind that changes are made and if you are very specific about the musical don't watch it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like I remember as a child. Good card game at your own pace. //// /// ///)) // // /
B00AYDC3CG|1.0|I have a very high speed connection and I can't tell whether it was the video or the connection but the pauses were annoying.  I will try one of the other streaming video services next time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very challenging.  I am hooked.  Have gone up multiple levels in playing multiple suits.<br />Would recommend who likes card games at your own pace.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is extremely well-written, it brings you into the life of these people. I would read it again... It is suitable for men or women readers.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|Rick Riordan has definitely become one of my favourite authors! He has written so many great books and I love them all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Horse lovers, get this app! I love it! Best horse app ever!! I haven't been able to ride horses all winter because of the cold. This helps keep me patient!
B00433SVP6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It didn't have many of the old characters in it but I was still good and once you get into you'll love it too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is so much fun! it gives you a very good experience with horses. you get to interact with the horses and compete in competitions.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its fun! If your an animal lover or just looking for a good app. So it might be good for you.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|These are awesome value for the money. I bought quite a few of these to build some systems for my office. The price seems to fluctuate between 112~118.<br /><br />They have 4 cores and run really smooth. Can't complain, these are a great value for the money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|one word is fun I love this game its way better then the first temple run its hard but real fun so download this game temple run 2
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|'Modern Family' isn't the best comedy ever to be on television and I surely think it can be overrated at times, but the first few seasons really are nicely done.  It's also the type of show where you really can't just jump in on any episode; you have to learn about the characters for things to be funny/ironic.<br /><br />I would say that Cameron and Mitchell are the most hilarious couple, with Cam being very overdramatic while Cam is more shy and reserved.  The two adopt a daughter in the first episode and their lives really revolve around her (and their drama).  I remind myself a lot of Cam, so I'm biased.<br /><br />The Dunphy's are my second favorite.  At first I hated Phil, but now he's one of my favorites.  He can act like a totally idiot and is the &#34;wannabe&#34; cool dad, but it works because the combination of that with his strong work ethic and helping around the house make him a great family member.  Although it's interesting that the show is called 'MODERN Family' considering that none of the women have jobs, they have broken some new ground by having husband and wife sharing chores.  Phil and Claire will go grocery shopping together and make dinner together; it's not just her taking care of the bumbling husband.<br /><br />Jay, Gloria, and Manny Pritchett are probably my least favorite.  Manny is really funny and Ed O'Neill as Jay really gives some classic Al Bundy looks, but Gloria is just irritating sometimes that I can't stand her.  The other storylines are just funnier, anyway.<br /><br />Some people didn't think it was possible to make another &#34;classic family sitcom&#34; in this day and age because of how much technology is used.  Instead of pretending like it doesn't exist, the show successfully integrates technology into the show and just makes it a part of their everyday lives.<br /><br />Definitely a groundbreaking show in its own right, although the recent episodes (season 4) have been rather disappointing.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is fun. for our whole family.  we all like the skill it takes to fly a squirrel. HOpe you enjoy time with your kids and this game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|when I am at home I go to the weather channel and it is nice to be able to do it on my kindle fire!
0307352145|5.0|Excellent insights into the life orientation of introverts, helping them see their strengths and potentially guiding their friends and family to a better understanding as well. I bought this as a gift, and the recipient loved it.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|it is just not as good as bing in my opinion. it is a lot slower when you really want an answer!!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Real funny movie, it cracked me up. But Amazons video quality is poor. Video constantly paused and I had to keep restarting the movie.
B005HPY8LU|4.0|Always been a little bit of a fan, but never purchased her CD's until this album.  Good vocals and music...Keep it up!
B004XMMSZG|4.0|Once you google the device and learn the pair code is 0000 it works perfectly.<br />The company claims the code is on the box. Not. They claim its on the device. Blush - it is. But if you follow instructions like I do the device is already inserted before you are asked for a code. Okay weak argument I agree.<br /><br />Anyhow it works just as advertised and I am - now - a happy camper. So 4.5?
0756686970|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my nephew , who is a newly Star Wars fan/geek.  Nice hardcover quality and a lot of information for children of all ages; plus a little Lego character to boot!
B006GECE9Y|2.0|i was interested in dolphin because of the ability to send links from pc to tablet. turned out that i had to log in to dolphin to activate this feature. dolphin no longer has their own registration (i had to write 3 times over a week to find this out), so i couldn't sign-in under the dolphin option. they now only offer 3rd party sign-in (thru google, facebook, etc).  this i won't do for security and privacy reasons. also, i didn't find dolphin to be any faster than the stock tablet (asus tf300t) browser.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Who doesn't love Indiana Jones.  Well....except the Crystal Skull.  Big mistake on his part and the movie writters.  Still worth the purchase even if you don't watch the last movie.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Luv the app. I particularly love being able to use the mic and speak the word I'm looking for which helps a lot when I'm looking for a spelling
B005CRQ3UC|1.0|Very poor value for the money. The book is nicely written and illustrated but very short maybe worth $2.99 at best.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The book left me turning pages frantically to get to the end. But the ending was so anticlimactic that I had to reread the last few pages to make sure I didn't miss something.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|this book is excellent for anyone having a recent death in family.  written by a brain surgeon who underwent the heavenly experience.  written superbly.  young and old have enjoyed my gift of the book after I purchased to read on plane going home to attend a funeral.  So glad I read the book before I arrived home for the burial of a dear family members trauma of death.
0765325950|5.0|Imagine a book that does not have to fool around with an enormous amount of details, but can just focus on giving you an amazing thrill ride.  Good. You have the picture?  Does it look like the cover of A Memoryof Light?  It should.  Jordan and Sanderson killed forests full of trees to lay the foundation for a good ole fashioned shoot-em-up.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained that there are a lot of things that they didn't feel were brought to full resolution. I suspect that the same reviewers would complain that the pacing wasn't there if Sanderson had done what they say.  To me, in my obviously humble and very erudite opinion, this book was the perfect icing on Jordan's gourmet cake.  Thank you Robert Jordan and farewell.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting, but nothing that piqued my interest for long, which means I could put it down .I don't know if I would read another book by the author.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Had bought this app before it was free and it had no ads. Now it moved to a free model for the app in an update and it has ads even though it was paid for previously. A good game otherwise, shame the developer is being greedy by getting people that paid to pay again with their data in advertising.<br /><br />Edit: Changed ranking to 5 stars after learning that Amazon does not pay developers the 20% of list price for free apps of the day. This makes the update completely justified and is a fantastic puzzle game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved it. It was a joy to read would recommend it very highly as was very interesting and very engrossing.
B005HSL626|3.0|Once you slice a few melons, apples, oranges, etc. it gets a little boring.  Certainly not addictive like some games.

B0079J28NW|5.0|Magical and ground-breaking - a must have disc for your Beatles collection.  Still miss the Fab Four to this day.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|The Director's Cut is wonderful....Since I haven't seen the movie in many years, I watched the previously released version first.  Then I watched Ms Streisand's comments on her scene by scene directorial motives/goals.  I now view all movies based upon her creativeness and sensibility.  Directors should take note!  Watching the deleted scenes was enlightening. Too bad they had to be cut.  All in all, a satisfying purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If I like a book, I'm manic about finishing it. This was one of those books. As you weave your way through the pages, you suspect the father's perverse role and even the possible reasons for the lack of communication in the home. The twist for me was to learn of the brother-sister relationship between John and Karen. Ms Hoover did an excellent job of wanting us to come back for more...just when I thought \\"I got it\\" she proved me wrong. If I had one<br />criticism, it would be the maturity of the two teens, Sky and Holder. Most adults I know do not have that level of reasoning. Nice job and excellent cover!
B004QK5N5W|1.0|This could have been something to use in my classroom every day. I have tried multiple times to use it without success, when other adapters of the same version work seamlessly. I was sold a damaged product and it costs more to ship it to return it than it did to purchase it. I learned my lesson.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for bored person.  Much easier than taking care of real horses and much cheaper too.  I like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game but tricky!!  cut me some slack if I cant stay on track! like temple run? you will love this!!!!:) Additive !!!! CANT stop gotta hop!:)
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I got this game thinking it would be about making quilt patterns, but it is more like making stained glass pictures.  It can be pretty challenging at times and the bonus rounds really test your memory.  If you like puzzles you will love this game, the artwork and the music are very nicely done!
0765325950|5.0|After waiting many years for the conclusion of this series, it did not disappoint.  I loved the comentary that Matt had running in his head.  It really helped relieve some of the tension of the book.  Amazing to me that everything was able to come together in the end.  I really hope that there will be more off-shoots of this story!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you like the original temple run then you will LOVE this one. its the same concept but has like new features like a zipline, minecarts andbso much more. I definitely reccomend this game
B004JHYRAE|5.0|I'm still reading it, and enjoying it in the company of my girlfriend... it's being even more interesting and well written than I expected! :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|to be honest. I got this game so that I could get money in big win soccer but I ended up liking it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app I got it for my daughter who loves animals she loved it I tried I think it is good for kids but as an adulet it is just ok : /
1401230423|5.0|It arrives before I expected, a great buy. It came in perfect conditions.<br /><br />Looking forward to buy with you again!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book!!!!!!!!!! Could not out it down!!!!!! Colleen Hoover is incredible!!!!! An absolute must read!!!! It takes you on such a crazy roller coaster ride!
B0058YZBPM|5.0|excelent quality and all is complete, this is beautiful and cool, all the specification is really, thanks i recomend it
B008D37J6O|4.0|I found it works great HD is sharp an smooth<br />I . found it easy to use on many codec
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Greek Mythology meets new world.  Percy is a demi-god but doesn't know it until an attempt on his life is made.  Percy is<br />being blamed for stealing Zues lighting rod!  Percy is then taken to a &#34;world&#34; filled with others like him, learns, and then<br />battles.  All ends well.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|it was easy to play and a lot of fun. I played it for hours . I enjoyed it very much.
1442354747|5.0|i enjoyed the movies and wanted to read the book and decided to order it on cd and listen to it will im driving .
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this app daily for work, easy to use and the multiple references are great for cross checking.  Also love the daily word puzzles.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not a fan. Just frustrates me and I have to play fruit ninja to get ride of frustrations on this one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is really aware  I was playing it and the monster that attacks you looks like the three in temple run original all mashed up together awesome. My friend was plaintive said it was really cool.
B0086700CM|3.0|Why do I have to write so much about this game or other products. The words don't like should be good enought
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this temple run its a very fun game everyone should rate it with five stars because its better than temple run 1
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|really hated this one. It was stupid and no one I knew was as dumb as me to try it
B003UYUP58|5.0|Well written and full of information.  He includes the patient's perspective as well as the research side of cancer.  Can't put it down.
B005HSL626|3.0|Gets boring after the 99th time of smashing things. but it takes care of frustrations iii jj jj jj j
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its an amazing game but when i hit save me it crashes and leaves me with one less diamond and no save me
B000A2IPP0|4.0|From the DVD casing (front and back), you can not make out whether or not the DVD has both the originally released movie, as well as the 'remastered and reworked' version.......
0453005071|5.0|I have read these books earlier in my life, but they are just as intriguing as I remember them.<br />thank you
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This series is awesome. I have read it many times over and I have to say my favorite book is this one. Breaking dawn takes happily ever after to a whole new level.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I have played this but I am not good at it, so I would rather play with the zombies.<br />Thank you
B00AUA67GQ|1.0|Only the geek who wrote the code could follow such poor instructions . Missing several steps. Aftera wasted 30 minutes,I realized I was only one third the way to deciphering how to get to the screen editor whete all the complicated stuff was done. I dont think another hour would have helped, and then you must ask yourself, what wil I do with this? Not sure it would be worth the effort if it was even twice as user friendly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run but I hate it when I kill the guy.  :(  This new one is more challenging and my guy gets to life longer.  :)
B00003CX95|4.0|It came in a timely fashion.  It was exactly what I expected. We watched it the night that we received it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|this is one of the best books writen. It encompasses life, death, greed, and hope. One of Dickens better writings
0307474259|5.0|Taubes presents the scientific evidence of obesity concisely. He makes his argument clear, and the book follows in a reader-friendly format. It's nice to hear some evidence-based arguments on health and obesity, especially with all the misinformation so readily available.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This app is so much fun to play but after my first night having it the game crashed. I uninstalled it and now I wont reinstall. I'm very surprised at the bug.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|This app says I need a &#34;plug in&#34; to use it.  Where do I get that?<br />Other apps I have downloaded don't say that.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorites, because the dinosaurs appear to be so real that you want to ask, &#34;How did they ever train those dinosaurs to act like that?&#34; (Well, of course, they AREN'T real!!) I feared blu ray would show edits, people running along with the dinosaurs, for example, but the mix between human action and computer generated action is very seamless.  Great job! And just look at those T-rex teeth!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I enjoy looking up bible verses and sharing them with my grandchildren.  It's also handy to use when I have a question.
1613832788|4.0|That was my reaction but I liked the story just well enough to pick up the second one.<br /><br />So glad that I did.  The story becomes much more action packed, fast paced and full of surprises.  The first book developed the characters for us and this one really gets into the story at a fast pace.<br /><br />The element of surprise is used well in this book and this is a massive improvement over the 1st book in many ways.<br /><br />Martin still has the issue with throwing in too many minor characters and muddling the book up with names that make it a bit confusing in parts.<br /><br />Overall though excellent writing.  On to Storm of Swords.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I only wish I would've read the book before I watched the movie! Can't wait to read the next one :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time when I get bored or if I am waiting in the doctors office or something. This game has great graphics. I recommends this app for anyone.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this series, however twisted that makes me. It is funny, horrifying, and psychologically fascinating. The performances are superb and the sets harrowing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I'm not typically a big reader of fiction but I loved it. Of course it's not reality but who cares!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|We were not able to watch the movie via amazon video. The movie would play for a few minutes and then we had technical problems. This happended multiple times before we gave up. There was no way to request technical help. Ultimately we gave up and watched via time warner cable on-demand service.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Great entertainment with real heartfelt story. There's not enough of these movies made anymore. This movie will definitely keep your attention.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Very good, worth the money although it takes too long for it to load.  I will still buy the next one...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting read from beginning to end...one of those books that you cannot put down.  I could hardly put it down
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great way to pass the time for anyone. fun and entertaining. thanks for the free app
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This is arguably one of the best action movies ive seen in a while. Its true to the comic book but more importantly it will make sense to newcomers as well. Dredd is set in a distopian future where mega cities have been built and the majority of the earth has become uninhabitable. Crime spirals due to overpopulation and street judges are created. Policemen who serve as judge, jury and executioner (IF NEEDS BE). This movie actually builds the mega cities around our existimg cities. Judge Dredd didpenses justice harshly but very fairly. Most of the movie takes place in a building but dont let that turn you away. You will be completely satisfied with the pacing and dark humor in the film. And you may even be left pondering how the concept of such justice would be applicable in todays and the futures society.  Watch it!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|this app is easy to use and is very clear how to use it. my paper shopping lists are gone now.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Could not believe that when I downloaded this to watch that it would be this good. After seeing the original and thought it wasn't good, and like all remakes, they just almost always fall short and flat, I didn't have high hopes. This one I downloaded and watched because of a friends recommendation. What a surprise.  I can watch this movie again and again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love playing solitary and this one looks nice and is great time killer :) you can' t  really reinvent classic solitary so I'm glad they didn't try.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Once again, another ripping good yarn from Lee Child.  I do enjoy his use of dry humour which makes Jack Reacher an enjoyable if incredible hero
B009CGYO0K|3.0|It was good while it lasted, but a little short for my taste. Also, it's a little expensive for that short of a book.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|I will keep this review short. This movie was the most pathetic piece of crap excuse for a book adaptation I have ever seen. Save your money and buy the book,ebook or audio book. I feel sorry for author because the movie has all but ruined the good name of a very good book!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I have used this app since it was only used for inventory editing. It has grown so much bigger and has made me that much happier every update!
1451696191|5.0|I have heard about this book since I was in high school, but never got around to reading it until now (as I refuse to see the movie before reading the book). It is fantastic! A true look into an individual teenager who is trying to \\"learn the ropes\\" in high school, though he is already mature far beyond his years. As a high school teacher, I would even recommend this book for a class novel study in 9th grade, or as a replacement for the wretched \\"Go Ask Alice\\" garbage often read in Intensive Reading classes.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Can't believe this game was free on android. I finished the game in 4 days because I played it so much!
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|This album is really good, Happiness is my favorite song on this album. I also love Road To Somewhere, A&E, and Clowns. Even though this isn't a normal Goldfrapp album it its still great. If you love Goldfrapp then you definitely need to get this album
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait to see the movie!!! I recommend this to older ages not younger ages. It has some risky moments but that just made the book better!! I hope you also enjoyed the book too!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|There are many times that some sort of white noise really helps with sleep.  I really like all the variety.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this book I always love to look stuff up in it. I always find what I`m looking for.<br />  Love love it!!!!!!:):):):):):):)<3<3<br /><br />  -Lily Snow
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google and yahoo are my favorite search engines.  I love having it available at a touch.  I use search engines everyday.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|\\"Fracknation\\"  now shown on cable tv, look it up<br /><br />If you want the truth, watch Fracknation.  Gasland is usual lies for financial gain.
B004Y042N8|3.0|I enjoy playing this game as a pass time.  My grandkids also enjoy playing this game when they come over.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Good game but finished it in one evening, wish it was longer and harder. So I could not give it any more stars.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy playing as a relaxing pass time and also for mental challenge.  I like all the levels that are available.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I have always loved his voice and couldn't wait for his album to be released. I was not disappointed. I completely enjoy it every time I listen to it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to pull up the weather at any time.  I also love being able to see the forcast.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I have such low expectations of popular romances, but this one, besides two glaring grammatical errors,  was a pleasant surprise. I found the heroines character realistic. The storyline was very strong, and I was impressed with the sex scenes(eg, use of condoms, discussion of birth control, self-restraint on the part of the boy.)  It was written for a younger audience than I am, so will probably suggest it as a \\"good read\\" to my 22 year old (but not yet to my 16 year old, who still expects life to read like this book. ie, a perfect nonkiss from a perfect boy who always says the right things.)
B008XG1X18|1.0|I could not get signed up.  No matter what I put in as a username, it said it was already used.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is  so fun especially if you love horses/animals as much as I do the graphics are 100% perfect ifs so realistic I can't even put my kindle down me and my friends love it so if I were you I'd get it :) :) :)
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|I enjoy playing From Cheese as a relaxing pass time.  My grandkids also enjoy playing it when they come over.
B004HY3BU6|4.0|This movie gets better and better with time.  I didn't like it when it first appeared because I thought the excesses of the Love character were a bit over the top, but as time has gone by, I now realize the talent, professionalism and subtelty that went into this film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a relaxing game for me and a great pass timer. I like all the different settings that are available.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie came on time was easy to order and my kid luvs it! I ordered the same movie for her for x mas and it was not from the us and wouldn't work! Sometimes trying to save a buck you end up spending twice as much! The movie from amazon works great we have watched it tons of times!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A lovely book of passion and fear all in one. I loved it and<br />want to know what happens next. I was at the edge of my<br />seat the whole time. I enjoyed it very much and am buying<br />the other two. Thank you  E L for taking me away for awhile.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the better books I have read in years!<br /> What is going to be next And when? -- -
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|American Horror Story is one of my favorite shows. Saying that, I was slightly disappointed that this season did not have me glued to the screen like season one. Jessica Lang was INCREDIBLE and I was soooooooooo excited to see Frances Conroy back. I won't spoil the plot for you but, don't expect to have the same thrilling experience as last season.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way way better then the first they are both very good but this one is way better. I have played non stop it's addicting. I would have paid for this app. BEST APP EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|greatly have enjoyed this game.  I was happen when I saw this in the app store on my kindle fire.  and I really like that it links to facebook.  again great gamester @
0156027321|5.0|It is such a beautifully written story. Every aspect of life science, philosophy, religion, love, hate, sad, happiness, sorrow, are all interwoven and tells such an intriguing story. It is very hard not to like this book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone really. Enjoy!
B008BO61BE|5.0|Considero o CD Screaming for Vengeance o melhor álbum do Judas Priest, a performance no US Festival '83 aconteceu no auge da banda, logo após ao famoso show do &#34;Screaming&#34;. Por fim, a região do DVD rodou no Brasil sem problemas. Super recomendo!! Baita show!! K.K. Downing e companhia mostrando porquê são sensacionais.
0618918248|5.0|Excellent book.  I will definitely read this one again.<br />I wonder what Dawkins' life must be like, running<br />against the wind.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|Was better than I expected considering I downloaded the book in error. I had no real sympathy with the characters.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good book. Nicholas Sparks has become one of my favorites. It was hard putting this book down.  I wanted to keep reading.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I admit, when my friends told me about the Mortal Instrument series I was confused. I mean, what's a Shadowhunter? They finally convinced me to buy City of Bones, and if I didn't like it, they wouldn't bug me about it anymore. Right from the very first chapter I was hooked. This is a fantastic book. Cassandra Clare has great word choice and a great vision for these books. Can't wait to read book #2!!
B009E3EXMU|4.0|As a huge Zeppelin fan I decided to get this because it's their last concert. The preformance is great and towards the end of the night it becomes very touching, to see the crowd roaring for the encore and the way the band is completely elated  by the force of that moment was one of the best things for me.<br />I have to say that the editing is poor with so many camera angles changing so fast, I dont think that was necesary, but it is a good buy because the music and the performance is superb.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It stops in the middle of games and then doesn't let you back into the same game. Don't get it if your in for the objectives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses get this app oh my god feed them groom them not just for girls I love this get it its awesome
B00ALKPTFA|3.0|Did not like the way in which the information was presented. The background story added little to the message of the book and in fact was more of a distraction than an aid to reinforcing the main purpose of the book.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|The plot was interesting and the actors did a great job in each of their parts.  My family really enjoyed this movie.
B00008RH1H|5.0|This was one of the last Minufe/Kirasawa films that I didn't have and I throughly enjoyed it.  Mifune is the doomed leader that climbs the ladder of command.  He is at his snarling best in this flim.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I started playing this game and found it hard to stop. Beautiful graphics on my kindle fire hd. Great story, but be warned, things jump out at you! I started playing the app for free and then continued playing after paying $2.99. I think it was well worth it. I am definitely going to try another game from G5.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought it was a great book but to short I read it in less than a day, it was a great quick read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game takes forever to load but it is a very fun game to play!!!!!!!!!<br />I'm so excited that it finally came out
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its a game that I play quite often.  Its easy to learn and play.  It relaxes me so it is a good game.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I LOVE THIS APP IT IS AWESOME! !! I CAN POST THINGs ON Fb AND I CAN DRAW AND DO EFFECTS AND COLLOGES!!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Well I've always been a huge fan of Batman and now I can see all 3 movies whenever I'm in the mood!! All 3 movies have that awesome action that really makes the movies worth watching over & over!! Definately 5 stars out of 5 stars!!
B000SEFCD8|5.0|She puts you inside the dog's head; can really see how human behaviors can be confusing.  Perfect amount of humor, anecdote and research.  H<br />Just excellent
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was one of the best apps I have ever played on the kindle fire. But it might glicth on u so this is a heads up if it does, but it is still fun.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|A clever, subversive sci-fi/actioner, The Faculty nonetheless is burdened a bit by being caught in Scream's overwhelming shadow. As some critics have noted, Kevin Williamson's constant dismantling of whatever genre he's operating in offers plenty of surprises at the actual textual level, but on the whole it's easy to look at one of his movies and expect lots of metahumor and self-parody. Great movie, highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this dame the first day it came out, but I kinda just stumbled upon it. I see comments saying that it lags, and the controls are awful. on my kindle fire, I face none of these problems. the game runs smooth. it is, in my opinion, a lot smoother than the original temple run. this may be because of the graphics quality. on a large screen, the pixels are not cramped like they are or will be on a smaller screen like an ipod touch. well, in the options of the game, you can easily change the graphics quality so the game will run smoother. I find the game to be better than the first. but I guess that is only a matter of opinion...
B003L77GGK|5.0|Sam and Dean do it again! Favorite series out of all the show I've ever watched. It's about two brothers who go &#34;hunting&#34; so to speak, to hunt supernatural beings. The series is wrapped around just about any supernatural being, and explains some of the history on said creatures. Each season finale leaves a huge cliffhanger that leaves you on your toes for the next episode. If you love the supernatural, you'd love this series.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is truly stunning as of a game but but if your used to the original simple competitive temple run, this is a completely different game. That's not bad because games do need to be spruced up but to me they went overboard to much and that's caused it to be less interesting in some ways. Like its lost the competitive attitude and now seems less social to me and way to complicated, so for that I unwantingly give it 3 stars.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|Buy any music you can imagine with this app.  There is always a $5 album and a free song available.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Where do I begin? Clowns from outer space who terrorize a small city with cotton candy and circus tents. What I love so much about this movie, is it isn't too cheesy. It's the perfect humor/horror/cheesy 80's film of that decade. Soundtrack is pretty neat, and the storyline plot is goofy and a little suspenseful. A worthwhile watch!
B003KRGCTI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  The cast was great as was the plot.  I love endings that you can't foresee!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it I think it is a little bit like temple run but with more characters I recommend this app.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Well written with realistic description of events. Explains the make up required to become a Navy SEAL.I loved it and could not put it down
B005T87QCI|5.0|who doesn't like robots that beat each other up. l like the app but I wish it would include the main characters
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I have enjoyed every Reacher novel I have read and this one is no exception. Lee Child knows how to move a story along.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far one of the best books that I have ever read!  I love sky and holder. His intensity and passion is hot for one, and his love for sky is just amazing. This book is not what I expected at all. You just have to read this! Could not put it down!!
B00479SVBU|4.0|Be aware that if your Tunes files are m4a, and you put them on a USB stick or SD card, this unit can't play them. It can play them if you connect your ipod or iPhone by a cable, however. There are ways to convert your files to mp3, if you want to do  that. Can you hear the difference between an mp3 and an m4a? Maybe.

0395389496|2.0|I bought this thinking it included the movie.  I was wrong.  The DVD only had a couple of songs from the movie.  Luckily, we found the movie playing on AMC before Christmas Eve because we also got him the Lionel Polar Express Train Set for Christmas.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Easy read. Super sexy and smart. You love the characters from the beginning. It's such a different premise which I enjoyed. It kind of has a cheesy ending but other than that I really enjoyed this book.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Some stuff I didn't like about this game,like the missions are kinda frustrating.Also when you go through the lab threre is a inappropriate picture in the lab

1451627297|4.0|On a bitterly cold day in Chicago, what better than a storyline that felt like a Dr Who Christmas special, in the Colonies (USA). Though this book could have been edited to a tighter hold-my-attention better few less pages, the overall Alice in Wonderland-ishness great fun. Give it a whirl.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is certainly a fun read.  Bought it based on Amazon's review, read it without expecting too much of it.  The book is very engaging and funny.  \\"Even NASA cannot improve duct tape!\\"  I almost want to send Mark back to Mars so I can read some more of his adventures.

B002XWXPC8|5.0|This is an American classic, combining America's past time, Cleveland, and a precursor to Charlie Sheen's insanity.  In a way, he has become &#34;Wild Thing&#34; in real life.  Just think about that (and watch this movie).

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The British know how to produce the best period dramas and Downton Abbey is the best of all time. I love this series and it has not only taken Britain by storm, but America as well. But beware . . . once you watch one episode you will be in for a long two days of a Downton Abbey marathon. You will not able to stop.

B007REV4T8|5.0|A hard drive containing the names of undercover agents embedded in terrorist organizations is now up for sale and you suffered a near fatal injury trying to stop it. What would it take to send you back into the fray? Money, love, fear?<br /><br />  James Bond (played by Daniel Craig for the third time) and fellow MI6 agent Eve (played by Naomie Harris) have tracked a thief carrying a stolen hard drive with confidential information to a train. After an exhausting chase and an epic amount of destruction, Bond and the thief are locked in a physical struggle. With the thief in her sights, Eve (Harris), on orders from M (played by Judi Dench for the seventh time) takes the shot, misses, and sends 007 plummeting to the water below while the hard drive and the thief are lost. M (Dench) is summoned before a government committee where one member, Gareth Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes), encourages her to retire. While en route to MI6 headquarters, their servers are breached and, while M watches helplessly in traffic, their offices are destroyed killing several agents. Bond, having taken his fall from the tracks as an opportunity to retire, learns of the attack while watching television in a bar. His return to government service is typically atypical. He breaks into M's home, reports for duty, and asks how he can be of service. Before returning to duty, Bond must submit to both a physical and a psychological exam. Despite failing both, a desperate M puts Bond back in the field, for lack of a better idea.<br /><br />  This being a Bond movie, there is, of course, a great deal more to the story. The moment we are introduced to the true villain, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) marks the Bond series' return to cinematic greatness. Bardem is truly terrifying and every time you think you've figured out his master plan, he shocks you. The introduction of Ben Whishaw as 007's liaison to Q branch breathes new life into an element of the franchise that I assumed had simply been abandoned with the departure of Pierce Brosnan and the death of the much-beloved Desmond Llewelyn. I understand that many Bond fans saw Quantum of Solace as a failure. Putting aside the fact that I was not one of them, this is easily the best Bond film since Craig assumed the role of lead actor, in my opinion.abandoned with the departure of Pierce Brosnan and the death of the much-beloved Desmond Llewelyn.

Patrick Rothfuss is nothing short of genius, he pulls you into his world with believable characters and an incredible story. The audiobook version of this book is also incredible, Nick Podehl does an outstanding job of bringing the characters to life.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|During 2008 and 2009 I began to hear the name of Duffy everywhere. In magazines,my Amazon.com music recommendations,the works! Considering my experiences with saturation promotional effects with musicians before,I was of course very skeptical. After all she seemed to be joining the crowd of modern British retro soul female artists such as Lily Allen and the late Amy Winehouse at pretty much the same time they were all coming out. Shows you how much of that 1990's attitude of corporate thinking weighing out over the creative sort in the minds of the public (that I actively disliked) had rubbed off on me. It was a family member listening to the radio who heard one of her songs and I looked it up,knowing only the album title. And here was Duffy again. So I decided to take the plunge and order this album. Again,the hype was not wrong on this one.<br /><br />  On the title song,\\"Warwick Avenue\\",\\"Serious\\",\\"Stepping Stone\\",\\"Syrup & Honey\\" and \\"I'm Scared\\" Duffy's almost high pitched combination of vocal inflections equally influenced by Erykah Badu and Dinah Washington are backed up by that eerily haunting sound that so much soul/R&B balladry of this sort had in the early/mid 60's from which these songs clearly take their influence-full of echoed back-round's and heavily reverbed rhythm guitar and piano lines. The use of string orchestra's for harmony also adds greatly to that deeply soulful affect. On \\"Hanging On Too Long\\",the chord changes have this beautifully penetrating major/minor progression with a sleek,slow funk flavor and it's my favorite on the album. \\"Mercy\\" is the song I came in for,the most overtly uptempo song here with a strong Chicago/Motown rhythmic punch.<br /><br />  \\"Delayed Devotion\\" nicely transitions into a sweetly rolling Al Green/Hi studio type sound where the closing song \\"Distant Dreamer\\" is a wonderfully theatrical and orchestrated girl group soul type epic. One of the things that defines this album is that all of Duffy's songs are so incredibly strong and well crafted,they tend to sound like interpretations of old soul classics. Instrumentally,from 60's soul balladry to later and more funkier styles sometimes,everything works. Everything is mixed beautifully and effectively. Further more the material has enough stylistic and instrumental variety to hold up well to Duffy's elastic and expressive vocal technique. Because of so many albums coming out at this time in this particular vein,Duffy could've easily ended up a bit of a one album wonder. Thankfully she's stuck around.y strong and well crafted,they tend to sound like interpretations of old soul classics.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|More of Buble's great vocals and music.  Like many others, I just wish he would create more of his own music along with covering the classics that he loves so much.
B00436GNVC|5.0|Considering the enormous hype surrounding her debut [[ASIN:B0014I4KIK Rockferry]],her follow up album could've easily sank into pure oblivion. That didn't happen. Not only did her music gain the attention of the public,but of other musicians as well. The question was which ones would actually be involved with her as she prepared her follow up. The hip-hop band The Roots had a sturdy reputation in the New York recording industry in which Duffy was heavily involved in during this time-in everything from Dave Chappell's shows to eventually becoming the the house band for Jimmy Fallon's late night TV show. Needless to say they seemed to have jumped at the chance to be involved with an musical artist again. Especially someone whose creative vision was leading dow a similar path as their own. And this sophomore album was the result of all that.<br /><br />  Right off the bat,with it's rhythmically dynamic blend of of bass/guitar interaction and bass-synthesizer accents \\"My Boy\\" showcases that we're dealing with a more uptempo and funkier Duffy this time out. Her vocals have also gained a new level of expression too-expressing even greater earnestness than before. \\"Well,Well,Well\\" is the most deliciously funky piece of music Duffy has made. With The Roots working out with Questlove's intense JB inspired poly-rhythms and that slippery basslines,Duffy pours the right amount of vocal grit and moxy into it as well. On \\"Keeping My Baby\\" and \\"Lovestruck\\" there's a strong dance/rock element added with extremely defined melodies and overlapped bass/synthesizer layers. On \\"Girl\\" the Roots again catch onto a nicely spare post disco boogie funk type vibe that's very appealing.<br /><br />  It's on the ballads \\"Too Hurt To Dance\\",\\"Don't Forsake Me\\",\\"Breath Away\\" and the title song that are closer to the music of her debut album. Difference is all of them are somewhat more epic in stature. That all before the closing sonf \\"Hard For The Heart\\",a cinematically soulful experience that builds in tempo throughout. I noticed reading other reviews here that this album isn't quite as creatively appreciated as her debut. Mostly referring to her more aggressive and biting vocal approach. Actually I personally find this to be just about the right extension she should've had from her debut. It would've been very easy for her to hook up with a very commercially minded producer for a sound filled with overwhelming electronics and repetitive chants as with so many other artists trying to get attention. But she surrounded herself with contemporary musicians with that song-craft/highly instrumental musical approach she seems to prefer. And considering the quality of the results,I more than respect that.lds in tempo throughout. I noticed reading other reviews here that this album isn't quite as creatively appreciated as her debut.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought I would try this app because it was free and the ratings were so high. I have never seen such an awesome,  beautiful app. The horse is so realistic and one cares for the horse in many ways as well as competing with your horse. This app is for all ages and is very fun!

B008MG1E4A|2.0|There is nothing in this book that didn't come from the news, he even provided a reference list for you to review.  The only \\"personal accounts\\" are those of his experiences on other missions (which are vague anyway).  I'm not sure if this was actually written by the author, publishing company, or the government.<br /><br />If you take the book as purely entertainment it is a novel that will make you proud of our service men and women because of the things they give up to do a job for us.  Other than that, you could have paid close attention to the news/media to know what is said in this book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|A relaxing app. I recommend this app for a person who loves the sound of nature.  I like nature and I love this app!

B008K8VDPU|4.0|I purchased this so my children could practice piano on the go. I haven't explored all the different options, but have been very happy with the piano setting. I just wish the keys were a little bigger. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone looking for a good piano on the go.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|Anyone who truly wants to enjoy this movie must put all recollections or thoughts, if any, of the 1979 mini series with Alec Guinness out of your mind.<br /><br />For those who have seen or have this mini series in their video library, it is a compelling version of the John le Carre novel. Alec Guinness has never been better than in his role as George Smiley, the plodding, methodical, yet one-dimensional spy hired to find a mole in MI 5. The mini series boasts of a well-written script, brilliant direction, and strong, unforgettable supporting roles. The mini series runs for more than six hours; there are no car-chases, no buildings falling down, no gun fights, yet it will keep you at the edge of your chair (or couch) for the entire time the series runs. It is a hard act to follow.<br /><br />This movie does the best job it can to put le Carre's novel in modern-day terms. The major shortcoming of this film is that it tries to better the mini series by imitation -- and there just is no comparison.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, of course, plays the title role of George Smiley, the character portrayed by Alec  Guinness. While Oldman is a fine actor, this is not his finest work. He does not make this character his own. He appears to be imitating Guinness, but what results is Oldman playing Smiley as an Alec Guinness on Valium.<br /><br />Oldman is not alone in the rather blase characterizations in this film version. Some of the other most prominent were:<br /><br />John Hurt. He plays the character of Control, the director of the Circus, attempting to ferret out the mole in the agency. Alexander Knox played Control in the miniseries. Knox was perfect for the role. Knox personified death warmed over, a burearocrat utterly exhausted by the intra-agency in-fighting and back biting. Hurt is good, he has the look, but acts the role as if he is utterly bored by his job, not exhausted.<br /><br />Toby Jones. He plays Percy Adeline, the usurper of Control's position. Michael Aldridge played Adeline in the miniseries, and imbued that role with the pomposity, arrogance, meance that la Carre intended for this character.<br /><br />Mark Strong. He plays Jim Prideaux, the spy who was nearly murdered by the mole in the agency. Ian Banner played Prideaux in the original miniseries, and deftly portrays this character as the broken, shattered spy he was. Strong is not broken or shattered but catatonic.<br /><br />Oddly enough the best portrayal is a lessor character, Toby Esterhasie. David Dencik brilliantly plays this character as the sniveling dog that he is. Also, Tom Hardy is good, very good, in the Ricki Tarr character, the wrong-go outcast who first makes the existence of the mole known.<br /><br />On the whole, however, the actors undoubtedly attempted to portray the tedium and daily grind of the agency. What resulted was a group of actors who appeared to be sleep-walking.<br /><br />Why was Oldman nominated for the Academy Award for this role? No doubt it was the result of collective guilt by the Academy for not previously nominating this actor for his body of work; Lord knows there are other roles he should have been nominated for. He will be nominated soon and hopefully win the statue he so justly deserves.played Adeline in the miniseries, and imbued that role with the pomposity, arrogance, meance that la Carre intended for this character.<br /><br />Mark Strong.

But, all in all I would say this app has just about anything you would want to do to a picture. Just takes some time to figure out.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|The packaging for this set is absolutely rotten. It's one of those \\"hinged\\" multi-sets with 8 discs.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm not sure where to start, I probably saw this book a million times on the shelf at the book store. It was not what I expected at all.<br /><br />It felt like going back in time to high school and college, when all that mattered was how hot a certain guy was and the parties, the crazy wild s*** we all do in the name of fitting in or just wanting to live life like it was in the fast lane.<br /><br />From the moment Abby watched Travis Maddox's first fight I was hooked, Travis that guy that every girl in school wants to get her hands, that bad boy the guy that no matter how much you want him, hes just out of your reach. Then Abby comes along and that all changes, the bad boy is knocked on his ass and wondering what just hit him...<br /><br />Abby and Travis will make you crazy wanting to know will they just be friends or lovers? There are some great secondary characters America and Finch that so scream for their own story --please!<br /><br />Rather than go on and on repeating what happens in the book like everyone else does for a review--go get a copy and lose yourself for a few hours. It will make you laugh, want to read faster and cry as you realize omg I am not even close the end and I'm afraid to breathe because I dont want it to end but I have to know what happens...<br /><br />Right now I just want my pre-ordered copy of \\"Walking Disaster\\" because I miss Abby and Travis already...

B001K3ENEA|5.0|Along with the unbeatable price and top notch AKG sound quality, these headphones are a must have.  These headphones will make you hear parts of your music that you didnt know were there.  They are extremely durable (I have had them for 8+ months) and are good for travel and even sleeping.  Since these are studio headphones, you need to turn the music to max volume for the EQ to be proper. They don't buzz when the music is too loud, and the bass isn't overpowered, but it is still great.  It can pick up almost all frequencies used in most songs.  The downsides are how long the cord is (6 ft.), but I'm sure that some people would appreciate that, and the noise bleeding (How much you can hear when headphones are not on your head).These are not noise cancelling (they are designed so that you can hear outside sounds with them on). Overall, I personally think that these are better then Dr. Dre Beats (By a long shot) and much more affordable. With Amazon's top notch shipping, you can't go wrong.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love temple run 1.  temple run 2 is a lot harder to control your guy. I like this app very much though. I recommend you to get this game,it's cool. I think imangi studios did a great job. Thanks

The bulk of mankind's resources and best technology are reserved for the military arm of the Colonial Defense Forces and the posher colonies. Earth has become cultural and technological backwater kept stagnant by the Colonial Union by informational denial so that it can be most effectively used as a farm for producing colonists and soldiers. But who is best prepared to fight wars for the human race against smarter, faster, stronger and more technologically advanced alien species?  Naturally, the elderly.<br /><br />This whole series is quite enjoyable not only as a work of fiction, but as a commentary on our current society and foil for the misguided optimism of post-singularity fiction as well.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game because it can teach you something. but it has so things like why does it have time to do that game again but overall it is cool
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is perfect for the few times I use a calculator.<br />Because it is loaded on my kindle fire and I usually have my kindle fire with me it is always handy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!  It is very fun and perfect for horse lovers!! The graphics are great and never glitch!!! Again I love this game!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I've been using this folio case for over 1 year now and it has held up great. I bought white, but should have considered a darker color for ease in keeping clean.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing these machines at arcades...a lot of fun trying to collect prizes but frustrating waiting for your coins to regenerate..
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really enjoy this easy game which is also a memory enhancer. Can't wait until a different version is offered free for Amazon members.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this movie so much. It will always be my favorite of all time! Plus Gerard Butler is amazing in this :)
B007RI56NY|2.0|I thought that this would be more like their later work. Unfortunately it's rather bland mainstream cheesy stuff. I will listen to the previews next time.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|In my home, this hard drive streams data to my iPad, Kindle Fire HD, and my other computers with no problems. But using the WD 2Go app for my iPad and Kindle Fire HD when away from my home and using someone's wireless, the streaming capability of video is as good as in my home.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is the written version of &#34;Zero Dark Thirty.&#34;  Most of the book is about the background and training of the team that was assembled to kill Osama Bin Laden.  A big plus for the book is the description of the actual training mockup of Bin Laden's compound - something that &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; failed to cover.  Biggest problem with the book:  lack of editing, e.g. &#34;me and Frank&#34; not corrected to &#34;Frank and me,&#34; etc.  Also noted some technical inaccuracies.  None of these are deal breakers, just looks lazy and unpolished to some degree, gets old after first few instances.  Still a good read, compelling narrative.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Everything about this book is wonderful. The writing, the poetry, the characters. The Avett Brothers are a favorite of mine & i loved how she referenced their music throughout :)
0446554995|5.0|TWO GRAVES  I always love Preston and Childs books. This one does not dissapoint. Suspense is the key in this one.
0679805273|5.0|I love reading Dr Suess to my stepdaughter and my unborn daughter. This story is an adorable story that doesn't portray the world as an unbeliavably perfect place but isn't too dark.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Keeps you wanting more! Edge of the seat. Really get to know the characters more and understand them more. Makes you anxious for book 3
B0085LMFAE|5.0|Paul Simon's Graceland - Great album!!! If I could only have 10 albums,this would definitely be one of them.Thank you God for giving Paul Simon such a wonderful talent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A book about young love with an unexpected emotional twist will have you reading until the early morning hours.  You won't be disappointed!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This movie just made me continually think of couples their age I know. Very realistic! Great acting. But unsettling to  visualize .<br />Found myself in tears thinking of my own parents going through this time of their lives.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|simple and easy to use. does what it said it would do and the quality is great for the price
B008LCRAC0|5.0|Absolutey no problems with the delivery.  I opened the package and looked at the CD's but did not play them.  I expect no problems as the disks were fine
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Despite the criticism I've heard, I think this is a great re-make and I usually don't like re-makes!  Great soundtrack as well!
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Slow, violent, not worth the money. Could have been good but it never got out of the shoots. Wish I never bought it
B005F3XV62|5.0|I've never seen a Kevin James movie that I didn't love.  This one did NOT disappoint!  So funny, and family friendly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is great! This is a new way to get the awesomely awesome game around. I think that they have to make temple run 3 !
B00AESN8XY|4.0|There are hours of fun taking over the world in this app, well worth the small price. Works great on the kindle HD 8.9.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Simply spectacular. You could take pretty much any still image from this series, and it would be an image worth framing in it's own right.<br />A masterpiece of cinematography. Definitely worth having in Blu-ray, and definitely worth having the special edition with the extras.<br /><br />I normally rent DVDs from Netflix rather than buying, but this is something you are going to want to own, and watch more than once.
B008M87GJK|5.0|The price doesn't get much better than free and it also has excellent news stories that the BBC are known for,I recommend this too anyone who needs a quick go-to for news.
1449410243|3.0|I'm a great fan of the oatmeal and expected to love this book, but it just doesn't have much content in it.<br />A lot of space is taken up with large versions of sequential cartoons, and a lot of space is taken up by the Bobcats.<br /><br />I knew that it was going to just be cartoons from the website, but I'd been hoping for a larger quantity.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This item arrived promptly, and with great care.  I am very pleased with the item.  As I had been looking for a copy, it was great to finally have it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know this book is extremely popular but I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.  Can't wait to read the next two!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I bought this set for my husband. He is a huge Star Trek fan. He was just like a little kid. He had to open it that night and start his marathon. All movies were very good quality, and reasonably priced. Thanks for letting me surprise him and give him something that he will enjoy for many years.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Addictive, fun, challenging and superb graphics. I really enjoy the timed mode as well. Glad I read the reviews and purchased this unique puzzle app for my kindle fire. The graphics and the sound effects make it an extra pleasant<br /><br /> experience. I say go for it, great app!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 latches onto the original feel of Temple Run, while adding many new and great features! There are new traps, and the older ones were improved greatly. And there is also turns in the track, not just a straight line. Plus the graphics, which have come a long way. The setting is beautifully detailed, making it feel a lot bettee done. I would reccomend getting this game!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very addictive,.  I enjoyed playing the free sample.  I'm considering buying it now.  I'm interested to see how it ends.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Really enjoyed this Trilogy. Must agree with some of the others that it is a bit repetative but I had to read it to the end. Actually I must admit I've read it more then once. Its not just for the young either, I'm in my 60's and I'm not too old to remember &#34;yep you can have fun with sex&#34;. Everyone I've met that has read this book has similar views.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|The way the movie was filmed was very unique and the acting was top notch as well. Loved how there were different stories being told within the same universe.
B004SBX112|3.0|The game is fun and i definitely find lots of enjoyment in it. But its not very \\"ad-free\\" i had the free version then purchased the\\"ad-free\\" to get rid of the pop UPS that just start the game over to the loading screen, and it worked momentarily. Now its back to the ads. I end up winning a board and it shuts down, starts over &i have to do the whole board over again. Its just annoying.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds is a fun game that can be addicting. The free version is interspersed with annoying ads but what the heck, it's free.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I took a whole day and watched back to back..I was riveted and couldn't wait to see what would happen next
B001974DG0|5.0|Very good book.  Kept my interest all the way thru.  I would highly recommend this book to any one!  It would make a good Valentine!
B009XTF8KQ|1.0|I wish i knew before i paid that much for this movie [plus shipping]it was so fake!!!!!!!!!!!! I would never have ordered it!!I cant even give it a star or anything its that bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I order from Amazon all the time but I will have to say this movie this is the first time i had wish i didnt.I need to send it back we did not watch it all because its so badly fake.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Such as classic.  Viewing the world through the eyes of a simple man that follows one motto:  &#34;Ain't nothing to it but to do it.&#34;  I have a GUMP approach to life and let's just say that I have one amazing life.  Tom Hanks could not have been a better actor for this role.  I love the director - Robert Z  because he directs in a way that elegant - simple communication that reaches all audiences.  Classic.
B005651R24|1.0|Neither well written, nor an interesting storyline.  And as the summary says, lacking in any taste.  A waste of time.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Easy enough to beat for confidence, hard enough to challenge. Good simple graphics. A good app for casual players. Also allows decent learning opportunies and undo to explore alternate moves.
0316228532|4.0|I had resisted reading Ms. Rowling's newest book for fear that her seven previous novels (all best sellers) would prove her writing skills to be a fluke or limited to the Young Adult genre of literature. My fears were, of course, unfounded, as her newest novel validates that history will place Ms. Rowling on its \\"Most Enduring\\" list, noting that her talents are expansive, her eye sharp and her courage astounding.<br /> The book opens with the death of Barry Fairbrother.  His death causes the casual vacancy on the Parish Council and begins the revelation of how a seemingly peaceful village can hold such dark hearts.  This death is of keen interest many in the town of Pagford, in the West Country of England, as he was pushing for the inclusion of \\"The Fields\\" within the village boundaries.  The Fields, the name given the district of subsidized housing built by the town of Yarvil on land nearer to Pagford than its own borders, is peopled by the poor, drug addicted and/or outcasts, most of whom subside \\"on the dole.\\"  The conflict over Mr. Fairbrother's council seat reveals the deep division between the inhabitants of this idyllic town.  The war that erupts from this division is the focus of this heart-rending, sometimes comedic, sometimes violent novel.<br /> As is true with Ms. Rowling's previous novels, the character development drives this work.  The only innocents are those who are helpless to defend themselves; everyone else mentioned in the book contributes to the pain they suffer, to the havoc presently hovering over Pagford and refuses to change their behavior until it is too late to be redemptive.  In creating a wide range of characters and causing each of them to \\"live,\\" Ms. Rowling made a place for each reader to see their own \\"dark side\\" somewhere in the pages of this read.  The choices for those we meet in this book are three fold: 1) do what is easy, 2) do what is right or 3) get all you can when you can regardless of the cost to others.  Repeatedly, mostof the characters are on the verge of making the \\"right\\" choice.  There are moments when there is hope that someone will choose \\"to do what is right,\\" but the person who could have made that choice and stuck to it apparently died in the book's opening pages.  Crystal's vulnerability and self-defeating plans, Fats' seeking for authenticity at the expense of everyone but himself, Howard's likes to believe that desire to \\"better\\" his family lies at his quest for power, Samantha's self-loathing is the result of her refusal to act from her own best \\"place\\" and Robbie's heart-breaking presence are only part of the actions that speak of the conflict within every choice and action taken.<br /> This is NOT a book for children, nor is it a book that would hold the attention of the typical contemporary adolescent.  It was not intended to be such.  The book pulls back the curtain on \\"polite\\" society to reveal what can be (is) held in the heart of humanity and confronts all with the real possibility that we all could be have despicably given the right occasion. The language spoken by most of those met in this community would have placed the students of Hogwarts on permanent detention.  There is sex and drug use described and the violence is of the kind that leaves bruises that may never heal through-out the body of this work.<br />Because of the number of characters who have a role in this story, it took a while for me to get hooked by the story.  Once all the characters were known, I was enthralled quickly.  The people of Pagford, \\"The Fields\\" and Yarvil were those of quick acquaintance but enduring impression.  I found myself in tears at the close of the book due to equal parts of sadness at having to say goodbye to this town and of hope that the events that occurred in the few months I was allowed to visit had cause a true change in its people.<br />Like Steven King's Castle Rock or William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, maybe Pagford will be Ms. Rowling's \\"home base\\" forMANY future stories.  I would like to visit it again.
B002VE5472|5.0|Different than expected.  Fresh idea.  All actors had good character development. Solid movie worth a watch.  Keeps you on your toes.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is additive but, now I can't open up the game or when I do play, it cuts off. I already uninstall and reinstall. Still having the same problem.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Looks great and does all I need it to do.  Love it<br />Seems durable and I like the color.  Thanks
B008MEM24S|5.0|Like &quot;Where's my water?&quot; by Disney,  but with new fun puzzles. Both games are well worth the money. I'm positively addicted!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The story itself is a bit unbelievable.  A little hard to follow in parts.  But of course, another interesting adventure for Jack Reacher.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Don't get me wrong the game play was wonderful! Yet,  when I stopped playing it, it wouldn't allow me to open it back up!! I tried to uninstall and install it again; but when I did that the icon remained on my Kindle Fire, yet is saying it is not found. If I could get this situation fixed then that would be great.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The free version works great. It does what it advertises. I really like the dimmer feature, because I really want very little light when I'm trying to fall asleep. Perfect for traveling.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book it really answered a lot of questions from one, but asked new ones for the next book to answer and finish. I can't wait to read the third book which I am going to do now. Lots of action and putting clues together in this part of the series.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I found it interesting but it was a bit slow. Some of the extra stuff was not very fast. It is also very expensive. So it takes a while to get anything.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Many different sounds. Easy to use and best of all, its free. Has a built in clock for bedside use.
B001W2JWWC|4.0|Brilliant, melodic harmonies, soaring guitars and rythyms - Nicks, McVie, Buckingham at their best. Buy this record and then get Rumors
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My only complaint is having to be connected to the internet to use it. I only have wifi on my tablet so I can not use it on the go wich is when I would use it the most.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|It's awesome!!!<br />I love it great service,great product,everything from Amazon.com I like it, Cool songs to listen in middle of night!!!!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't gotten involved in a great TV series in a l-o-n-g time!  Am enjoying every episode and character and storyline!  LOVE the costumes and settings!  This is entertainment at its VERY BEST!
B004GJYROG|5.0|Movie was in good shape, and worked fine. It deserves 5 stars because there was obviously nothing wrong with it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i havent played much. but when i do. it is fun and keeps me entertained. i always like a good mystery
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great movie, great acting, with a great (and handsome) hero!  I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a great escape from reality for a few hours.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app you have to get it i have it on x box and pc couldn't wait for it to come out for kindle fire!<br /><br />Awsome game love it i built a manshon
0547258305|4.0| THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BY MY 13 Y.O. DAUGHTER <br /><br />I loved this book! I'm not sure what exactly made me like it so much,but I just did. I really appreciate Kristen's creation of a completely fiction world and to even create so much background history for it too- like stories within a story. I love the writing, the relationships, and Katsa's strong, no nonsense personality. I think this has a great story line and decently-developed characters. I don't believe I can say much here without saying too much,but I can say one thing:although this is not the best book ever written,you will LOVE it. I will never regret reading it, and definitely recommend the book.<br /><br />It had me checking my eye color.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|For anyone interested in where our food comes from and the importance of being better informed consumers. A great read!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|(THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BY MY 13 Y.O. DAUGHTER)<br /><br />I loved It! Stephen King is an amazing author and I thoroughly enjoy his books. It is a wonderful novel which I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Things I loved about the novel:<br />1.The change in POV. It definitely takes a great writer to master so many characters' different personalities in one novel. I loved looking at the same event from different perspectives.<br />2.The flashbacks. I enjoyed going from 1958 to 1985. It kept the book interesting and adds dimension.<br />3.The look at how the characters changed in 27 years. I enjoyed seeing what the children became when they became adults. I love how their choices in careers reflect their personalities as children. I would give examples,but...spoilers. Sorry.<br />4.The minor conflicts. The way one handsome,outgoing leader of the group gets the girl the more shy,self-conscious guy also liked and also deserved.The mothers who don't like their kids' friends, the domestic violence that thought Bev how to fight back,which became very useful later on. The way not everyone became wealthy and successful later on in life...among others. This adds dimension, instead of just focusing on one main conflict.<br />5.The historical background of Derry and Pennywise. This means that it's not just the Losers who had to deal with It,but other generations too. This adds thickness to the plot.<br />4. The more 'adult' things. Beer, tobacco, and sex. This adds a ' real world' feel to it. Keeping things honest and true,regardless of whether it's negative, or a tough pill to swallow, is important. Too many books leave that out. For example,things don't go beyond kissing when you know something more serious is obviously going to happen,or teenagers are uncomfortable when their peers curse. Seriously? Wake up and smell the real world, buddy.<br /><br />Basically, I love Stephen King, and It is his greatest, in my opinion. You should read it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|It was interesting to see into the life of Tina Fey.  She wrote humorously with such human emotion I felt like I was a good friend of hers by the end.  You will find insight, humor, and entertainment in this book!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series and will purchase season 3 when it is available.  I will definitely watch more than once!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Loved the dogfighting segments. Felt like I was in the seat with the pilot.The F-18 Hornet must be a awesome airplane to fly.

B005COO1X6|4.0|Typical Stephen king short story.  Pulls you in and moves quickly without a large back story. Fun Little read for horror fans
B009MO57H6|5.0|How can you go wrong with Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking butt again? It's RE, we're not expecting huge plot, just great female butt kicking heroins.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|It is really catchy and Calvin Harris tries a lot of cool new stuff. Definitely his best album so far!
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Wait! Disney is doing an animated film about girl empowerment? Not exactly, by empowering herself, the main character causes her entire world to crumble and must undo what she's done--buck up, back off, and go along.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|My sister in law and I have made it a tradition to watch this movie every year around the holidays. We love it. It's so heartwarming and fun to watch.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Embarassing it was so bad. I really expected more from the people that were in it. Couldn't even watch it all the way.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|We do not hate the app, but we installed the app and it would not open.  We tried to reinstall and it would not let us.  The system will not let us load it again.  We really would like the app,, How can we purchase it again?  Thank you
B00A3OTNTC|5.0|Pitbull is a marketing genius and makes me proud to be Cuban.  He was smart enough to feature himself with big stars and now they paid him back and helped him make this great party album.  &#34;Don't Stop the Party&#34; says it all.

0525478817|5.0|This book was so not what I expected at all. I'd seen it mentioned a lot this year, but after reading the Goodreads description, I was unimpressed. It just didn't sound appealing to me at all. But then came a lot of End of Year Surveys and Top Ten Books of 2012, and I saw this book all over the place. I figured for it to be getting that much love, it had to be better than it sounded, and I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />From the very beginning, the first couple pages, it was clear to me that I really, really liked Hazel. Even though she is terminally ill with cancer, she has a sense of humor that can't be beat. I found myself chuckling a lot at things that came out of her mouth, and I found myself often forgetting that she was, in fact, sick, until the next mention of her cannula came up.<br /><br />Augustus was easily my favorite character. He was just so swoon-worthy and romantic, but also hilarious and sarcastic. From the start, I really liked his interaction with Hazel. They just had a relationship that was so believable but still really enjoyable to read. I never found myself rolling my eyes or getting aggravated with them. I really loved their chemistry.<br /><br />There was a twist at the end that while I sort of saw it coming, it wasn't blatantly predictable, and I liked it. It changed the way I expected the story to go, which was nice. I am also glad that a prediction I made for the ending did not come true. I definitely thought it was foreshadowed and would not have been happy with it, so I'm glad that it didn't happen the way I thought it would.<br /><br />I did find myself with some questions left over at the end of the story, but I think that that was realistic. The whole story was very realistic, and in life, you don't always get the answers you want, and you don't always get a happy ending. I thought that was appropriate here.<br /><br />Overall, I really, really loved this book. It was so beautifully written, a realistic look at the way cancer affects people's lives. I found my heart going out to the characters for their struggles, but moreso loving how they continued to live their lives and not let their cancer define them. I would definitely recommend that everybody read this book, and I will definitely be reading more John Green. I easily give it 5 stars!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|VERY INTERESTING TO ME AND GOOD FOR KIDS.  I LOVE THIS GAME JUST STARTED PLAYING IT, BUT IT IS MY FAVORITE GAME.  I LOVE THOSE BIRDS.

But that aside I really enjoyed the the story..  sorry for all of you that have a negative review to this book because of your personal issues.  Its a story not a self help book.  JAMIE MAGUIRE thank you for your book and I will be reading walking disaster come april it will be interesting to see what was going on in travis head.
B007549W62|2.0|I watched this movie when it first arrived. Really didn't know anything about it except what I had read in reviews. Movie did not make any sense to me. I know it will get pretty ugly when and if something goes wrong in our country ( EMP, Nuclear Attack, etc) but this one was way over the top. This movie was not believable in any way, the characters were all over the place in personalities and actions. I would not waste my money. Heck, you can even have my copy.....
B00884GR0W|1.0|This game is horrible. I bought this game because of these other guys said that it was better than this other game! That's the last time I listen to them! The characters do not  go with the setting, the blocks have to be walked over to retrieve them, and the bed is hard to create! Do not get this game because it's horrible!
B006LSZECO|4.0|With many twists and turns.  It is off in many directions. What one thinks is happening turns out to be the other way around. The first part of the book sets the stage and the 2nd part is full of surprises.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best! Also, did you know that 1 block has 4,096 bits in them! I did the math on paper! Wanna know how I got that? Do 16*16*16 to get it!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I rated this story highly because I enjoy simple pilgrimage stories.  There is a bit of the everyman in Harold so he is very easy to connect with.  A gentle story providing some quiet moments of reflection.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I saw the movie it was very well put together and I cried a little bit at the end but amazzzing
B002KS1IJC|5.0|This movie was simply amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be kept on their toes throughout a movie. All around it is an enjoyable movie to watch. I rented it to begin with and I will eventually buy it so I can keep watching it! It brings out many emotions while watching!
B008L1DNGI|1.0|I thought this game would be easy yet addicting. It however, was neither. I stopped playing it the second I started. I was bored out of my mind! I didn't really like this game...
B0091REZMW|1.0|I'll never know how good or bad the app is....as after three tries, the app won't even open.  And if any of the other reviews are any indication, this &quot;free&quot; app wasn't really free anyway.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was even harder to put down than the last. Surprises came from every corner! I couldn't believe what was happening and it was impossible to put down. I cannot wait to read the next one and find out what their futures hold.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is really fun when it works and an improvement from the original temple run and the brave version but glitches so often you can hardly do anything except die ):
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great job. The story kept my attention and was hard to put down.  I will read more of Nicholas Sparks books.
B00004XONN|5.0|\\"Landmark album of the early 2000s and of all time for incorporating electronic music into their often noted poetic alternative rock sound. While OK Computer surged with some of the key devices that would progress for Kid A/Amnesiac, Kid A is the one, in particular, that makes the risky effort of being experimental without being a show-off but being confident about it especially with some of its greatest songs that Radiohead's ever done with the title track, Treefingers, In Limbo, and the highly danceable yet politically conscious Idioteque. A foundation album also in many ways that resemble the kind of ambitious efforts Bloc Party done with their third album Intimacy and the previous cult classic Loveless album from My Bloody Valentine. Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke's ingenuity with tinkering electronic instruments and mixing gear is complex and daring to a high degree that hasn't been seen in any other work before in the field of alternative music lately.\\"
0765325950|5.0|I've loved The Wheel of Time series since the beginning.  I did worry that the scope of the story had exceeded the authors' ability to bring it to a successful conclusion.<br /><br />This book richly reward the reader's patience and faith.  There were many threads to this story, and so it takes a lot of story to bring them all together, show what they ultimately meant, and bring them to a conclusion.<br /><br />All of this is done even better than I hoped.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for a beautiful, thrilling story that I will never forget.
B009AMAM9S|4.0|While not a film that I was highly anticipatory for, I gave a try on seeing it only knowing the premise and some of the mixed reactions. Thankfully, I was left convinced and excited to know that it went beyond expectations.<br /><br />First and foremost, the best part of the film was, in particular, the comical Timothy Cavendish story involving his quirky journey of being stuck in a retirement home. Even though this maybe perceived as the simplest and light-hearted of the film's elements (actually funnier and more involving than most comedies these days), it feels a lot like something found in a classic Ealing comedy that ironically, for elderly audiences these days, cannot be found. The cinematography, humour, choice of location, and acting is all superb (even from a transgender Weaving). Among the others that stood out included the Lucia Rey segment, the Sonmi segment, and to a certain point- the most significant segment which reveals the Cloud Atlas origin of the title being part of a classical piece.<br /><br />The film, after seeing it with a group of mates, was not as complicated as some might expect but it was certainly detailed and intricate in its effort to connect the points/dots of how they got into their position). What makes Cloud Atlas stand out is that it not only manages to create a story of life but emphasise on its stories much like TV episodes or short films all-in-one, especially when one knows when does the drama, action, or comic sign of relief start, it all makes it more interesting. The historical quibs/styles (esp. during the 1970s segment) and the themes in the film revolving around tolerance, awareness of consumerism and being a soulless \\"machine\\", solitude, individuality, and corporate conspiracy all work effectively and simply enough to make a rather sweet yet direct message. The emphasis on creating an environment (especially in the futuristic sequences) all serve to create interesting comparisons and allusions to films like Blade Runner, 2046, Soylent Green (especially), Amistad, Last of the Mohicans (which Avatar has many of its roots from), and Apocalypto.<br /><br />The directing and writing management from Tom Tykwer was the big plus point of the film especially when in consideration that he directed The International, a recession-era political allegory that was one of the best films in 2009. The film does suffer from some inefficient timing with the Rey and Frobischer segments which suffer from some simplicity and a rushed climax, sometimes predictability in the name of a positive ending (no one always gets the assassin or the elderly retreat from retirement always like that in real life) choice of acting, and the use of only English language for the film (it was easy to detect Weaving and Sturgess appearing a little odd). The mixture of graphic violence and sex doesn't seem excessive (not like most R-rated films these days) but still surprising for a film when the trailers looked like it could be rated PG-13.<br /><br />In the end, the film seems less interested on trying to be this ultimate thing in the end to be intriguing relative narratives and it worked well in the end in creating a film that many variety films wish they could be. It is amazing how the film was funded, sponsored, and produced throughout its course given its complex source material and lack of involvement with the larger film industries (moreover a Germany-USA funded project, henceforth the Tykwer connection) showing ambition at a time where it is lost from many films these days. If the Academy does consider artistry over snobbery, then I would say give Cloud Atlas a chance especially in make-up, hair, editing, and possibly adapted screenplay. The film has been called as polarising but in the face of the film industry's lagging creativity and experimentation, it is not a film you should skip. One of the best art-house/experimental films seen in recent years since The Artist and 127 Hours.\\"r, 2046, Soylent Green (especially), Amistad, Last of the Mohicans (which Avatar has many of its roots from), and Apocalypto.<br /><br />The directing and writing management from Tom Tykwer was the big plus point of the film especially when in consideration that he directed The International, a recession-era political allegory that was one of the best films in 2009.

1468179993|5.0|Shame on me - I judged this book by the cover.  It \\"bleeds\\" self published cheapness, that I hesitated to even read the first sentence.  Thank God I did. This book is EXCELLENT.  If you are a speaker, if you are going to speak, or if you ever may do at least one speech at some point in your life (even if it is to an audience of two other people), this book is the perfect primer.<br /><br />I applaud the author for providing so much valuable content in such a condense book.  And thank you for teaching me not to ever judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />Nicely done. A MUST READ!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Some times I log in and spiders don't have butts can some one fix that bug PLZ  (I need more words)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|when I first started it was aesome worked great but for some reason the coins I grab are disappearing and when I try and save myself during the run, the game closes down. I don't know if this is only happening to me but it is really irritating.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game!!! its great. i wish I could get more gems.yaaaaaaay!!! whaooooo!!!!!<br /> I love it!!! I love it I love it!!!!!
1423136802|5.0|This series is fun for me, is very engaging to my 7th grade students, and my 4 year old son will listen to the audio books for hours. My husband enjoyed listening to them while commuting. They're not perfect, but they're addictive little stories that get kids interested in reading and Greek mythology.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|If you love Family Guy etc... do not hesitate to see this movie. Mark, Mila, and Seth are an excellent comedy team. I'm hoping the sequel rumors are true!
1423140605|5.0|I'm a fan of the original Percy Jackson stories, so I was really excited to get this one. I was not disappointed.
B009682EFQ|5.0|I have been listening to Neurosis for nearly 20 years now. Each album is a sonic assault. Even the \\"technically lighter\\" material is laden with with heavy riffs.<br />Honor Found in Decay is no exception. Crushingly heavy yet beautiful. Not the typical formula so many metal bands rely on.<br /><br />Neurosis is a band that people either love or hate. I only know one person other than myself that loves them and that is my brother. They are definitely not for everyone, but that is exactly what makes them so special to their core fans.<br /><br />  A masterpiece of artful ferocity.<br /><br />P.S. The new autorip feature is excellent. Great job as always Amazon.
