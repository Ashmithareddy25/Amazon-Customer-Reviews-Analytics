B00003CXI1|5.0|As a Harry Potter fan I waited for months and months for this movie to come out. Having read and re-read the books at least twice... I had been following all the media buzz on what was to be a hit movie. I had hoped on the day it came out my mom would let me leave early from school to see the 3:30pm showing to my surprise my mom let me have the whole day off something the state of Texas wouldn't approve of! I like to think I was one of the first people to see it seeing the early 7:30am showing.<br /><br />There is one word to describe this movie magical. Although, I have heard mulitple fans complain about the movie and how they don't live up to the book- I found that they have. The books can only take us so far with descriptions- we usually have to imagine the rest. But, with the movies we get the chance to see these magical worlds come before our eyes. O.K I'll admit as a fan I have been disappointed with some of the choices that have been made with the movies... with certain cast members. But, they do a good job living up to Rowling's epic books!<br /><br />The actors that play Ron and Hermoine are perfectly cast. And although Radcliffe may seem the perfect choice as Harry since he has features and maturity I still believe Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor among them. Although he does a great job anyway. The sets, costumes, script, and acting make this first chapter in the Harry Potter saga a magical one!<br /><br />All in all though this is a movie you should allow your children to see and please give them the right to imagine/dream their smart they know there's no such thing as witches and wizards they just need the chance to believe. Rent or buy this one and share bowl of popcorn and watch a magical beginning!
B00000JGHS|5.0|I like Striptease. It is such a fun movie to watch, especially on VH1. Striptease is forever a cult classic and is one of the best Golden Raspberry winning movies ever. If you are a fan of Razzie winners pick up this flick.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I caught them and the Raveonettes last year. While the Strokes were on this bitch behind me began letting loose with a piercing, dog-whistle shriek, causing my eardrum to crackle. It was worth it. The Strokes were great. So is this and their previous album.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|At first Imust admit I was a little confussed as to why they would both is studio recorded album and his live version together.  But now I understand!!!  It is so that all the new Gavin fans can hear this extremely talented artist versitility and the listener can hear for themselves that the songs are as electrifying no matter how he sings them.   If you have ever been to a Gaving DeGraw concert you know the amazing preformances his gives and the live version of Chariot can bring you back to that moment in a heartbeat.  All of Gavins songs tell a story, some of love, some about having fun, some about living your life the way you want to live and not being afraid to take chances.  I am a true believer that to really sing a song you have to feel it.  In Stripped you can hear it in Gavins voice that emotions are truely coming from deep within and it just gives you the chills.  All of his songs will make you think of a time or a place, even a person that you can relate his lyrics to.  People seem to love music that they can relate to.  WEll if are that person Gavin DeGraws Chariot Stripped album will not disapoint you.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I've been listening to this album for two or three years now, and it is easily one of my favorites.  It's very meticulously produced, and is in essence, perfect.  The vocals have a sense of Pink Floyd to them, while the heavy guitar riffs frequently remind me of more recent bands, like Tool and other hard rock bands.  Definitely a good pick for an avid rock fan.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I walked into a music store one day and asked a friend who worked who was new and upcoming, and would recommend to me.  Right  away he went and got a Gaving Degraw CD.  He said that he had all the influences I liked.  He said he was very soulful yet had a rock edge to him that made him different.  I had heard the song follow through and decided to take my chances.  I got home and when I listened to the CD I was mesmorized!!!  I have never had an artist capture my thoughts and feelings so completely.  Not to mention that the order of the songs was perfect!  It was mellow when it needed to be and fun and funky when it needed to be.  That was almost 2 yrs ago and now I have just burned out my second CD because I listen to him so much.  If you are inspired by both rock amd soul you will love this CD.  Once you see him in concert you will love it even more!
0780020685|4.0|What is there to say about \\"Seven Samurai\\" that hasn't already been said a thousand times? I surely can't think of anything that hasn't become movie review cliche. Let the cliches begin: It's a singular masterpiece that is considered to be one of the most important films of all time and Akira Kurosawa has influenced generations of film makers such as George Lucas, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese and a host of others. Okay, end cliches (even though they are true). My take on this movie is that it has an outstanding plot (which \\"The Magnificant Seven\\" would later transpose it into a Western medium), is full of many wonderful characters, particularly Kikuchiyo, played by the amazing Toshiro Mifune, and Kambei, played by the great Takashi Shimura, and is a fun combination of action and character driven moments. Personally, I prefer Kurosawa's non-samurai masterpiece, \\"Red Beard,\\" also starring the excellent Toshiro Mifune, for it's depth of story and character, but this preference does not infer that \\"Seven Samurai\\" is anything less than the great film that it is. I recommend \\"Seven Samurai\\" without reservation, particularly for those willing to take a 207 minute expediation that is well worth every minute. Criterion Collection DVD's are notoriously expensive but they often provide a wealth of extras. Sadly, the \\"Seven Samurai\\" is not as repleat with extras as later Criterion Collection DVD's but the commentary by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck is still worth listening to.
B000002U9L|5.0|this cd is like, an all around great deal. every song is super cool-david bowie's hott voice and trevor jone's superb score! everytime i listen to this cd i picture myself in the labyrinth, haha.
B0002DB50E|5.0|As many reviewers have already noted, David Cronenberg's 1983 film, Videodrome, is both grotesque and intriguing. While I am not a horror fan by any means, and this movie has frequently been described as a \\"thinking man's horror film,\\" I found it engrossing. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to take a dark, hallucinatory journey into the world were biology and technology quite literally become one. On the surface, this film which stars James Woods and Deborah Harry, involves a sleazy cable TV owner (Woods) becoming increasingly addicted to an ultraviolent snuff TV program called \\"Videodrome.\\" Woods' degenerative journey as addict and victim of \\"Videodrome\\" is particularly relevant in our society of every-increasing technological reliance.
B00005JNTV|4.0|There are enough reviews for this movie, but I'll say it was excellent.  Violent and scary (at times) wonderful characters and the cast, superb.  The black and white was awesome, it only made it more real looking.  Watch it at the theater if you can, well worth the money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001FC0|5.0|so many great songs some to my head when i think of the 80's/ but if u ever want a CD that will bring you back..its this . wow
B0006399FS|1.0|Well...sometimes in reviews, you need some assumption. You have to assume that a band wanted to create a certain mood with a certain song, when for all you know, they could have been going for something completely different. Anyway, there's no need for assumption here - with this lame album, their latest record, U2 made a stupid attempt to try and go back to their great 80's sounds.  <br /> <br />In trying to do so - 20 years older and colder -, U2 created an album that sounds even more boring, cheap, unoriginal, amateurish and unfinished than their huge dissapointing ATYCLB (worst U2 album, after this one). <br /> <br />I'll openly admit that you don't have to listen to every song off of this album. In fact, you only listen to a couple. It doesn't really matter - this album is one of those cases where you only really need to hear a couple of songs to get the dissapointing feel of the whole album. The whole record sounds like a self parody. It's just...horrific.  <br /> <br />The distinct loss of all motivation and progress. Both songwriting and Bono's singing are non-existent. Every song sounds like heared before. Even their overhyped Vertigo Tour sounds exactly as Elevation Tour. Pathetic. HTDAAB just displays the U2 agony hidden behind Bono's ego, annoying marketing machine and 80's and 90's legacy. Tragic. U2 are truly finished.
B00005JNEW|4.0|This 2004 film is based on a true story of one year in the 1980s when the Odessa, Texas High School Football Team competed for the state championship.  Billy Bob Thornton is the coach and his acting, as usual, is excellent.  So is that of the cast of young men who play the football players.  It's easy to see why their whole lives are wrapped up in winning this championship.  There's nothing else in this town that will ever give them any glory.  This is their moment and they have to use it to the maximum.<br /><br />This point is brought out over and over again - that for these boys - there is no life other than football.  It is especially demonstrated in the relationship of one of the boys and his father.  The father is an abusive drunk who treats the boy badly because the boy fumbles the ball. It seems that years before, the father was on a winning team and won a state championship ring.  After that, his life had no meaning and he truly believed that if the boy didn't come out of this football season a winner, there would be no other way for the boy to be able to succeed.<br /><br />The script was good and did hold my interest but I felt I had seen it all before.  There's the best player on the team who sustains an injury.  There's the competition between the boys. There's a social life of sorts.  And, of course, there is the tough-love coach who encourages them throughout.<br /><br />The script is good too, maintaining the tension throughout.<br /><br />Sorry though.  I was bored.  Maybe it's because I'm not a football lover.  Maybe it's because even though I understood how much the game meant to the boys, I'm just too far away from the Odessa Texas lifestyle to really feel their passion in my gut. It was a good film too.  Just not for me.
B00018D44U|5.0|This album is very relaxing, yet the tunes and her voice is very outstanding.  Take note that this album sold more than 1.1 million copies in it's first week in U.S. alone.  Why it sold a lot?  Better buy this album and you'll know why....
B0000AUHPK|5.0|\\"It's a rough journey and a sad heart to travel it...\\"<br />One of my favorite films, this film has excellence in all its elements; the sensitivity of Peter Kominsky's direction, Mike Souther's gorgeous cinematography shot on location in North Yorkshire, and the loveliest of soundtracks by Ryuichi Sakamoto are the canvas onto which the elegance and fluidity of Emily Bronte's words are painted, and it's the words that I delight in most of all...there is no end to the times I can watch this film, just to hear them.<br />Comparing this film to the 1939 version is a hopeless pursuit, as both are vastly different, and one film should not take the shine from the other, as one cannot evaluate whether Rembrandt is better than Van Gogh.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Heathcliff, in a performance that reveals more of its complexity and dark passion with every viewing, with his brooding looks and a violence that is never far from the surface. Juliette Binoche is luminous as Cathy (as well as her daughter in the latter part of the film), and though I do admit she lapses into a French accent from time to time, I don't think it minimizes her wonderful performance.<br />The supporting cast is superb, with Janet McTeer as Ellen, Sophie Ward as Isabella, Simon Shepherd as Edgar, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley.<br />Sinead O'Connor is effective as Emily Bronte, in the beginning and end of the film, and also narrating portions of the film, with her soft, misty voice.<br />I find this a magical adaptation...a gloriously written and visually captivating gothic romance, a battle of wills and hearts, vengeance and a love that goes beyond the grave. Total running time is 107 minutes.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I definitely loved this movie.  The colors and graphics were very vivid.  I saw the muscial at the Fox Theater in St. Louis, MO and enjoyed it; however, I understood the movie a lot better.  Even though the actors weren't well known, they did a great job with the characters in the movie.  This movie had me mesmerized from the biginning to the end.  If anyone enjoys muscials, this is the movie to get.
068987474X|5.0|Listen ladies, if you're constantly making excuses for your guy, then he's really not worth your time!  Get out and move on!  If you feel like your relationship is going nowhere--guess what?  It's not!  This book will help you face reality and free yourself to get out there and find a guy who will treat you the way you deserve to be treated!    I purchased this book months ago, but kept it on my shelf because I was in denial--I wasn't ready to face the truths that I knew it held.  And yes, it holds many truths--and many that I already knew, for that matter!  I knew in my heart of hearts that my relationship was on the rocks, but I allowed myself to stay in it, all along making excuses for the guy and feeling worse and worse about myself.      Greg is right on with the guy's point of view (as he should be, as a guy himself!).  He is straightforward, brutally honest, downright blunt, and funny to boot!  If you feel like your relationship is sailing into rough waters, then this book will probably serve best to confirm what you already know, but don't want (or aren't ready) to face.  If you think you're relationship sucks and you have no idea why, I hope that you will recognize yourself in this book and that the book will inspire you to take action.    It's a quick read, but it's a slap in the face.  You can't possibly read it and continue to make excuses for your guy.  As you read, step out of yourself and take a long, hard, objective look at your relationship--what you want from it and where it's going.    By the time you finish this book (and you aren't likely to put it down until you do), Greg will have convinced you that you are an amazing woman who deserves so much more than what you've got.  And after you put the book back up on the shelf, you'll be living in a world with Greg as your conscience--you'll be hearing his voice in the back of your mind, reminding you that you are a fabulous, sexy woman who deserves only the best.    Happy reading!  May you rid yourself of the detritus of mankind and find the one guy who will show you love and devotion.
B00006LI4S|1.0|Why can't people admit that they have bought something terrible? Four stars...five stars.....for this DVD? Didn't they seen Roger Waters \\"Live in the Flesh\\"? It's not a shame. I bought something terrible too. The only star for this dvd is for the woman on the cello who did a great job!!!!!!
B000002J1B|5.0|After the sprawling excesses of Topographic Oceans, Yes returned to the more concise format of Close To The Edge, with one side-long epic and two mini-epics, and while some critics accused them of self-plagiarism, the fact is that Relayer very nearly equals CTTE, while never having achieved it's legendary status.  And that's a shame, because they followed the model in sequencing only.  The music contained within was very different, with strains of jazz fusion and even near-heavy metal entering the Yes sound.  The fusion influence is so pronounced that some of the instrumental sections will have you thinking you're listening to the Mahavishnu Orchestra or something.<br /><br />Rick Wakeman's one-album departure made way for Swiss virtuoso Patrick Moraz, sporter of one of the the most ridiculous 70's hairstyles ever, but a prodigiously talented keyboard player.  Moraz had the ability to copy Wakeman but wisely chose not to, opting for a unique and more jazz influenced sound at times, and using some very new and different synth sounds at others.  His playing here is truly a standout in the Yes repertoire.<br /><br />\\"The Gates of Delerium\\" is the epic and features tight instrumental interplay interspersed with Jon Anderson's tale of the evils of war.  Such distinctly un-Yes-ian lyrics as \\"slay them, burn their children's laughter on to hell\\" stand out, before an atmospheric segment gives way to one of my favourite moments in all of Yes's work, when Moraz and Steve Howe toss a tuneful little riff around before the beautiful and uplifting tune-within-an-epic \\"Soon\\" rises up from the mist to take us out on a hopeful note.  One of their all time best extended pieces and an absolute must for prog fans.<br /><br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" has sometimes been called an excuse for Howe to go completely nuts on guitar, and while his soloing is certainly over the top, Squire, Moraz and White get in some wankery besides, and I mean that as a compliment since this IS prog!  There is a pretty nice prog piece in there as well.<br /><br />\\"To Be Over\\" sustains a quieter, reflective vibe throughout it's 9 minutes, basically a simple pop styled song with everyone getting to show off during the break.  My one complaint is the rather abrupt ending after the nice symphonic buildup.  I think this song needed to go out with a bit more of a bang rather than a quickie fade-out.<br /><br />That aside, Relayer is one of Yes's finest and most satisfying albums, although I recommend it more for the hardcore prog fan.pretty nice prog piece in there as well. <br /> <br />\\"To Be Over\\" sustains a quieter, reflective vibe throughout it's 9 minutes, basically a simple pop styled song with everyone getting to show off during the break.

B000002I4S|5.0|Both a high point and a turning point in his discography, Giant Steps was the culmination of John Coltrane's hard bop period as he moved off into modal fare.  5 alternate takes are added to the 7 tracks that made up Coltrane's 1960 Atlantic Records debut, with a very nice remaster that makes these tracks come alive.  The dizzyingly impressive array of bop experimentalism includes such Coltrane standards as the title cut, \\"Syeeda's Flute Song\\" and of course \\"Naima.\\"<br /><br />The main players include Paul Chambers on bass, Tommy Flanagan on piano and Art Taylor on drums, with Wyn Kelly and Jimmy Cobb on \\"Naima.\\"  Cedar Walton and Lex Humphries play on a couple of the alternate takes.  Everyone plays as if their lives depended on it and turn in terrific performances in keeping up with Coltrane's muscular, fervent attack.<br /><br />A textbook since the day it was released and a cornerstone of any collection.
B00005K3OT|2.0|You may love this movie; a lot of respectable, intelligent people do. But a word of caution is appropriate for those who haven't seen it, but are considering buying the DVD. My advice is to see it once before you decide.    I found a couple of points irritating. One is the misguided representation of clergy. The new priest, just out of seminary, is too weak and scared to deal with the local bigwig in any way other than trembling (and complete) obedience. At the end of the movie, the priest--apparently just now figuring out how to articulate this--has the realization that people matter, life is beautiful, the world has riches worth experiencing, etc. etc. As in so many movies, the role of the priest/minister/pastor is written as someone who somehow, after years of seminary training, presumably some life-changing experiences, and solemn vows before God, has never before had the opportunity to think deeply about life, is too terrified by someone in power to buck the system, and has to learn these most basic truths from a lady who magically descends on the town like Mary Poppins and sets up a chocolate shop.     As an example of the low regard this movie has for your interpretive abilities, an abusive husband says something about his victim not even knowing how to use a skillet. Later in self-defense she will hit him over the head with a skillet. Very well. But since you obviously don't get it, she says, \\"Who says I can't use a skillet?\\" But since you STILL don't get it, the two conscious adult characters now break into laughter at this witty bon mot (having just survived a terrifying assault). Talk about getting hit over the head.    At one point, Judi Dench's character says to Juliette Binoche's, \\"Don't look so damn pleased with yourself.\\" I had the same reaction to the whole production.    I admit I wasn't even stirred by the elaborate chocolate creations, as one is supposed to be in a \\"food movie.\\" (They didn't have to use slow motion in Big Night or Babette's Feastwhen people put food into their mouths to show how delectable it was supposed to be.)     The actors in this outstanding cast carry the day, and are a pleasure to watch (Alfred Molina in particular, who, given the role of a two-dimensional conformist, somehow manages to make him grow throughout the film). And the DVD bonus material is good. For some, this movie will be a most welcome, momentary escape. But my advice is to rent or borrow it once before laying down your money.
0792846443|4.0|There have been some VERY good King adaptations (ie: \\"The Green Mile,\\" \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"Delores Claiborne\\"), some that are good but aren't the book (Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\", \\"Christine\\") and some that are godawful (\\"Pet Sematary\\", \\"Dreamcatcher\\").  \\"Misery\\" falls into the first category of being very good.  And it's a good thing too, because that was one of the best King novels.<br /><br />Misery centers on a famous novelist named Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan).  He's just finished his new book, and while there's a storm coming in, he feels he can still take his finished manuscript to his literary agent.  On the way, the snow storm gets the better of him and he skids off the road.<br /><br />All seems lost for Paul, until he's found and pryed from the car.  When he awakens he's in the midst of Annie Wilkes (played by Oscar winner Kathy Bates), who claims to be his number one fan.<br /><br />While nursing Paul back to health, she picks up the latest book in Paul Sheldon's \\"Misery\\" series, and is rather disappointed by Paul killing off his main character Misery Chastain.  Now Annie is mad, and wants Paul to write a book just for her.<br /><br />*From the book*<br /><br />\\"She has a lot of ways to spur him on.  One is a needle.  Another is an ax.  And if they don't work, she can get real nasty.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, like most book adaptations, some things have to be changed and others have to be cut.  Annie doesn't spur Paul on with an ax, she does it with a sledge hammer.  And while Kathy Bates plays an excellent Annie Wilkes (she won an oscar for it), she wasn't nearly as incredible as she was in the book.<br /><br />The book was also frightening.  This movie is not.  I agree, it isn't right to expect the book, but I did expect certain things.  It follows the book closely... but this is a horror movie for cryin' out loud!  It NEEDS to be scary.  It's suspenseful, yes, but it isn't scary.<br /><br />Misery is an incredible film.  One of the best situational movies ever made, and one of the best King adaptations (unfortunately good movies made from Stephen King's books are too few and far between).  Watch it.  Don't expect something to scare the pants off you, and don't expect Annie to be as psychotic as she was in the book (for those who read it).  Still, it's a great film.dible film.

0684867621|5.0|I don't read horror or fantasy novels. They just aren't my genres. But I wanted to read something by the great Mr. King. This looked like my one option.<br /><br />What a beautiful book! The \\"horror\\" parts were gratuitous. Trisha's ways of coping with steadily losing her grip on reality are the heart of this book. The Tom Gordon/baseball bits are woven into the story seamlessly, and add a lot to the final impact.<br /><br />This is the book to show to people who don't typically read King's books.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I love this album.  I have been a fan of Green Day for some time.  I loved Dookie and Warning, but this latest album is their best in my opinion. <br /> <br />Other people seem to think that they are \\"selling out\\" but I think that they are merely evolving as artists.  They have been around for a while, and it is to be expected that their sound is going to change over time. <br /> <br />Green Day's lyrics have always had meaning behind them, but they outdo themselves this time.  I love \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Holiday\\" and I'm sure they will help me make it through the next four years of this administration.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is my first Pantera album and I am very impressed to say the least. When I first got it I never really \\"got\\" it, and it took me about 4 or 5 months later to give it a spin and then the quality of the CD hit home. From then on until now this has been in my CD player for a while. <br /> <br />   I have no complaints except for 1 song. Dimebag(RIP)offers amazing guitar work that stunned me when I heard it(great guitar solo's on every song but Primal Concrete Sledge). Phil's vocals are very good, but they may be an acquired taste(I had a little bit of trouble with them at first). The drums don't really stick out but they play for the song very well and the same with the bass. Here is a track by track listing: <br /> <br />1.Cowboys From Hell(10/10)- Very anthemic track, and a perfect opener. This song really demonstrates the \\"funness\\" of the album. <br /> <br />2.Primal Concrete Sledge(5/10)- Least favorite but the last part of the song is cool. No harm done in skipping this because its a very short song. <br /> <br />3.Psycho Holiday(8/10)- Great song not as memorable as the others. From here on the album goes upward. <br /> <br />4.Heresy(10/10)- A harsher song like Primal Concrete Sledge but much more memorable and very catchy riffs and great solo. <br /> <br />5.Cemetery Gates(10/10)- This is Pantera's \\"One\\" or \\"Fade to Black\\" and just as good. Beautiful solo, the chorus is awkward at first but you will come to love it. <br /> <br />6.Domination(10/10)-To me this is the best song. The riffs are amazing and this song makes me need to move around. Also contains the best solo, with the exception of Cemetery Gates. The outro is also awesome. <br /> <br />7.Shattered(10/10)-Much like the previous track with really cool riffs. Another favorite. <br /> <br />8.Clash With Reality(9/10)-Great intro, but ever so slightly drags on which takes off a point.  <br /> <br />9.Medicine Man(10/10)-Another favorite, this one is very dark, but has a ....sarcastic? tone to it. The verse is pretty slow but the chorus and intro is heavy. <br /> <br />10.Message In Blood(10/10)-Another highlight with one of the weirdest riffs with a time change in the middle of it. A darker song like Medicine Man. <br /> <br />11.The Sleep(10/10)-Great acoustic part, another highlight. <br /> <br />12.The Art of Shredding(8/10)-Like Psycho Holiday its very good but its not as memorable as all the others, by now its starting to sound a bit similar.  <br /> <br />Overall: <br />    <br />   Overall this is a classic album that was worth every bit of my money. I'm glad I discovered these guys. If you don't have this album already you should get it. As the title of the review says, this album is something you can put in the car or at a party and just mosh(or however you listen to music).  <br />
B0007YH4O4|5.0|Mariah Carey never ceases to amaze me!!  Charmbracelet may not have been her best album vocally but what amazed me by that album was that it didn't sound like any other of her other albums and it was like that \\"My Saving Grace\\" song was made for me because since I am a Christian, I feel exactly the same, Lord Jesus is my saving grace.  After just one listen to The Emancipation Of Mimi, it amazes me how Mariah is not afraid to take chances, she doesn't have to have every single album sound exactly alike, she does what she wants and doesn't let anyone tell her what to do.  NO album is exactly alike.  There's always progression.  I am, always have been, and always will be Mariah's true and hugest fan!!  It's like Mariah writes these songs for me, I mean that I can totally relate, I'm a girl so it's not literally for me but hopefully people will know what I mean!!!  I totally love The Emancipation Of Mimi.  As I am writing this review I am listening to it, my 6th time in a row!!!<br /><br />The song It's Like That is so awesome to dance and sing along to.  I love the music, the lyrics, and especially Mariah's powerful vocals!  My all time favorite song is really hard to pick because there are two songs that I love and really can't decide between the two.  We Belong Together is such a wonderful, beautiful slow ballad that should reach number 1 on Billboard, it's so powerful musically, vocally and lyrically and Mariah's voice is so amazing and everyone who thinks Mariah can't sing anymore, don't know what they're talking about because Mariah's voice is so incredible, especially on the end of this song!!!  I totally love it!!!!  The song Fly Like A Bird is such a spiritually, powerful song and it's amazing that Mariah wrote these words that I've been wanting to say, well I've been searching for the right words and it's Mariah who knew exactly what I was feeling toward the Lord.  Mariah's church Minister or Pastor speaks throughout the song and \\"His Love Will Never Forsake You Or Leave You Alone, Trust Him\\" is forever in my soul.  Words like \\"Carry Me Home, Higher Jesus, Carry Me Higher Lord\\" and \\"I Need You Now Lord, Carry Me High, I Need The Strength Of You By My Side\\" and \\"Keep Your Head To The Sky, With God's Love You'll Survive.\\"  There is also a Choir singing.  This song tells exactly how I feel toward the Lord Jesus and what I want to say to him.  There's nothing better than my favorite singer of all time singing about my saviour, Lord Jesus!!!  Another favorite of mine is Joy Ride.  Not because my name is in the title, because it's such a cool pop song that you can sing along to and Mariah's vocals are over the top, especially at the very end of the song.  I love the music during the chorus of Joy Ride with drum and bass beats, it's awesome!!!  Shake It Off is a really cool R&B upbeat song.  Mine Again is another slow ballad that Mariah belts on.  Mariah just about belts on every single song, especially on We Belong Together, Mine Again, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird.  Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg is a really cool dance R&B song with a really cool beat to dance to and I find myself singing along to this song too.  Stay The Night is a very soulful and unique song, the music reminds me of something from the 50's or 60's and I love the way Mariah sings and belts.  I love It!!  Get Your Number with Jermaine Dupri is a cool upbeat R&B song that I also like.  One And Only with Twista is a cool mid-tempo song that I like a lot.  Circles is another slow ballad that I love and love the way Mariah sings!!  Your Girl is a really cool upbeat song and I love the way Mariah sings in the chorus, it's a really cool song to sing along to!!!  In I Wish You Knew, Mariah speaks a few times during the song and you hear an audience, a very beautiful slow ballad, I especially love the end when Mariah hits that high note!!!  To The Floor with Nelly could be the next club song, it's a really cool upbeat R&B/Hip-Hop song.<br /><br />When I hear the songs Fly Like A Bird and Joy Ride, I picture just soaring way up high in the clouds, especially on Fly Like A Bird but also on Joy Ride because the whole song makes me picture being up there high in the clouds, being free.  If Mariah was to make a music video for either Fly Like A Bird or Joy Ride, I picture her just soaring through the clouds on an Eagles' wing or something.  Mariah sings with so much emotion, soul, and power on these songs, all 14 of them, using all 7 of her octaves, hitting that really high note a lot!!!  There is all sorts of elements, Pop, Hip-Hop, Soul, Gospel, and R&B.  Mariah's new CD, The Emancipation Of Mimi is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes any of those elements I listed above and especially Mariah fans!!  Mariah is the BEST!!!<br /><br />This Limited Edition comes with a double-sided poster, one side a poster of Mariah and the other side, the lyrics to the songs on the CD.A Bird and Joy Ride, I picture just soaring way up high in the clouds, especially on Fly Like A Bird but also on Joy Ride because the whole song makes me picture being up there high in the clouds, being free.

B00006CXXU|5.0|My favorite album of all times. All the songs are meaningful and touch you in different ways - it's like a diary which unfolds through listening to it. Excellent songs : Walk Away, Infatuation, Beautiful and above all The Voice Within. Thank you Christina
6301607929|5.0|I first saw Picnic in the mid seventies as a young teen.  I was a little young to understand the romantic entanglements at that age but I've watched this movie repeatedly through the years and the characters have become more three dimensional, their motivations more clear with each watching.<BR>I think most everyone can find a piece of themselves in Hal (the drifter who boasts to conceal his shyness and feelings of worthlessness), Millie (the brainy younger sister of Madge who feels overshadowed by her beautiful sister), Mrs. Potts (who no doubt wished for romance and family as a young woman but found herself tied to an invalid mother), Miss Sydney (the old maid school teacher whose clock is ticking and who is growing more desparately lonely with each new school year).  Even Madge's mother, who finds herself a bit flattered on her first introduction to Hal, is somewhat sympathetic.  She, herself, fell for a charasmatic charmer, only to be left behind by his drinking and womanizing.  She's allowed herself to harden through the years, seeing young Mr. Benson and his wealth as a way out for her daughter, Madge.  I admit, I've seen this movie so many times, I mouth the dialogue along with the characters.  When Madge's mother is consoling her, explaining her protectiveness towards Millie, I fairly scream, &quot;Don't you see...I'm trying to make up for all those golden years you had that she didn't.&quot;  So...spread out a blanket, gather up the tissues and prepare for a sweet and bittersweet summer Picnic.
B000002J3W|5.0|For the last time...Amazon.com reviewers and others alike, this is not a hair metal album or hair metal band for that matter!  The first Skid Row album was infact flirty with hair metal, but still was not.  Slave to the Grind was a kick ass hard rock/metal album as is this one.  The only reason the first album sounds sort of hair metalish is because those songs were written before Bach joined the band.  All in all, this band is bad ass!!!  'Nuff said...
077106506X|4.0|I have always professed a distaste for books of short stories.  I love a novel that can swallow me up and keep me interested for days on end.  I requested this book for Christmas, unaware that it was actually a book of short stories.  Upon reading it, I have changed my mind about short story reading.  Each story offers a unique and interesting snapshot into some character's life, and Munro executes these snapshots with professionalism and talent.  After reading this book, I went on to read Jhumpa Lahiri's Pulitzer Prize-winning Interpreter of Maladies, and I can now appreciate the power of authors who can create SEVERAL interesting and powerful stories within the confines of one book.  Recommended.
B0000AZKLF|5.0|When you take two of the greatest and most influential guitarists ever and put them together for a jam session, you can't go wrong. Stevie Ray Vaughn has been heavily influenced by Albert King (and also his older brother Jimmie Vaughn, Lonnie Mack, Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Guy) and when you hear him play along with him you can hear how much he was influenced by him. Hell, Stevie Ray has actually coped dozens of King's licks and used them in his songs. His playing is very similar and the two are a perfect match. Neither one of the two sits back too let the other take the spotlight, both of them jam and crank it out never holding back. The talks in between songs are also  interesting to listen too and the interaction between the two is cool. Track Rating- <br />1. Stormy Monday 10/10 <br />2. Pride and Joy 10/10 <br />3. Ask Me No Questions 10/10 (Not the lynyrd skynyrd song, the b.b. king one) <br />4. Blues At Sunrise 10/10 (BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM, 15 minutes long, incredible) <br />5. Overall Junction 8.5/10 <br />6. Matchbox Blues 9.5/10 <br />7. Don't Lie to Me 10/10 <br /> <br />This is an essential album in your S.R.V., Albert King, blues or music collection.
B000268QB2|5.0|An amazingly beautiful album. The vocals, the piano work, eveything makes the album very warm and beutiful. Great for just sitting back and relaxing, whether it's because if a hard day, or just ending a great night with song.<br />Truly a band to keep an ear out for. Only problem is, it just seems not enough. I am very anxious in hearing more from them. Something everyone should have.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Very rarely do I see a film that I really feel challenged by, but \\"Dogville\\" just blew me away. I just can't get it out of my head. There's nothing trite or easily digestable in this disturbing, provocative, brilliant and powerful film. I'll admit: this isn't an easy film to watch. It's very long, it's shot like theatre without realistic sets, and it's not a feel-good film. When you can see yourself in the horrible, repugnant citizens of Dogville, then you know you've fallen right into the director's trap. Is it a critique of America? Possibly. But I just saw it as the biggest indictment on human nature I've ever seen on film.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I picked up three different CDs using amazon.com's Marketplace Sellers over the past two weeks, in a combination of pleasure-related and work-related listening.<br /><br />The last of the three is Dido's No Angel. This CD was released back in 1999, and for several years I've had a soft spot for \\"Here With Me\\", the lead single off of this CD. Last year I picked up her more recent Life For Rent, and was impressed with that disc's musical depth, so I picked this one up to get a feel for her earlier material. This disc show's Dido's potential. The emphasis here is on lyrics...I don't think that Dido's voice is truly remarkable (nothing wrong with it though), but her lyrics are thoughtful. So far, my favourite off of the album remains \\"Here With Me\\", but I'm enjoying \\"Hunter\\" and \\"Don't Think of Me\\" as well. As with Life For Rent, I suspect that No Angel will grow on me over time.<br /><br />For some reason, Dido's music reminds me of Coupling, the British sitcom. Not sure why that is, specifically...was there a Dido track used in the series somewhere?
0385510454|1.0|Is this book a thriller or is it a language and travel primer?  Grisham has padded his book with a lot of unnecessary material about learning the Italian language and Italian cities - al of it irrelevant to the story. I know that most Americans do not travel but this is ridiculous - he treats his readers as morons.There are a lot of errors too. e.g. Prosecco is not the Italian champagne, it's a sparkling wine used as an aperitivo. Their 'champagne' is made by Ferrari.  <br /> <br />Grisham should stick to what he knows - the law.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I picked up three different CDs using amazon.com's Marketplace Sellers over the past two weeks, in a combination of pleasure-related and work-related listening.<br /><br />The second CD out of the trio is Christina Aguilera's stripped. This was a work-related purchase--I try to listen to what the kids listen to, to try to modernize our demo material--but I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Unlike the crapola that Britney Spears puts out, this multiple-Grammy-award-winner actually has a voice in there, which she puts to good use. She won a Grammy on this CD for \\"Beautiful\\", which was popular enough that even my fiancee commented that she liked it. Other notable tracks off of the CD are \\"Infatuation\\", with its Latin-style beat, \\"Impossible\\", a collaboration with Alicia Keys, the piano-based \\"Soar\\", and the soft \\"The Voice Within\\", which is a reminder of Mariah Carey's old days (before she lost either her mind or her common sense). Lest I forget, there's also \\"Dirrty\\", a strong dance track with a deep bass beat...the video for this really got her in trouble, due to its raunchiness, but I can see kids of my kid brother's age dancing away to this quite easily. I've also got a soft spot for \\"Fighter\\".<br /><br />So, not a bad acquisition at all, this CD... With her voice, I think she'll be around for a while, and can easily see her releasing a CD of old-fashioned ballads someday.
B00002E224|5.0|Free-association comes into mind while viewing Richard Linklater's film Before Sunrise.  This is the cerebral process of freely expressing ones initial thoughts without inhibitions or censorship to a listener, as it displays the ability of swiftly obtaining much information about a person.  Through the free association in the film, two individuals get to know one another through this seemingly diverging cerebral discussion regarding whatever crosses their mind.  However, through their openness these individuals find harmony, as they begin to connect the bits and pieces from each other's personal thoughts.<br /><br />The film opens with a German speaking couple, Austrians, or possibly Germans, arguing loudly on a train traveling westward.  Across the isle sits a young twenty-some blond French woman, Celine (Julie Delpy) who the audience will recognize from Three Colors: White (1994) from the year before, returning to Paris from a visit to her grandmother in Budapest.  The arguing couple urges her to move to a more peaceful location across from an American, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), of her own age.  Through blunt caution, Jesse approaches Celine, which leads both of them to the buffet car where they begin to discuss their personal philosophical perspectives on existence and their experiences.<br /><br />Through their discussion they found solace, but it is about to end, as Jesse must exit the train at Vienna due to a flight he had back to the United States the following day.  The two say their goodbyes, but Jesse quickly returns to ask Celine if she would consider staying for one night in order to eliminate the possibility of dreaming of him in the future.  Celine smiles and nods to Jesse's suggestion while she reveals that she intends to follow his notion.  Expectedly her decision leads the audience into an intriguing thoughtful venture where they discover one another through questions and hypotheses that they present to each other.<br /><br />The audience gets to follow Celine and Jesse through the night, as they get closer to each other through cerebral discovery.  The words that they exchange have a meaning, as they willfully expose themselves in order to gain each other's trust, care, and affection.  In essence, they are falling in love, and during this blissful night, they reveal their strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, and experiences through their viewpoints and notions.  This happens while they ultimately are aware that the culmination of their prolonged rendezvous is creeping nearer through the rise of the sun.<br /><br />The psychological depth and philosophical concentration of the story rests within Richard Linklater's and Kim Krizan's well-written script, which encourages cerebral participation and reflection.  However, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke enhance moments through their performances, which transcend words into human drama of the highest quality.  Linklater should also receive credit for framing each scene, which encourages the audience to dig deeper into the meaning of Celine and Jesse's conversations.  The end-credits do not stop this film from continuing to roll in the mind of the audience, as the love affair instigates the notion of why existence can be wonderful.the night, as they get closer to each other through cerebral discovery.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I remember about 1998 or so my cousin's friend saying I should pick up OK Computer.  I never heard anything by Radiohead except for Creep on the radio.  The next time I hit Best Buy I bought it.  I went home, shut the lights, put my headphones on and closed my eyes...and thought what the hell is this crap??  For some reason I kept on listening and Let Down finally came on.  I listened to it nonstop for days.  Beautiful.  Slowly other songs started growing on me(arent those songs the best?)and I now can say OK Computer is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.  So glad I discovered it.
B00008LOS1|3.0|Why would they include 3 different recordings of Getting In Tune, Won't Get Fooled Again and Behind Blue Eyes but not manage to include live versions of My Wife, and Baba O'Riley, two of the best songs on the original album? Who's in charge at Decca anyway? <br />
1594200106|5.0|This book is a tremendous combination of mystery, thriller, love story, and romance.  The author juggles all these genres with skill and finesse, never allowing any of the threads of the story to dominate so much that the other subplots become secondary.  There are also wise sayings about life in general interspersed in the story.  An example would be the comment about not losing your dreams:  \\"You never know when you might need them.\\"  As an American who lived three years in Spain (albeit quite a ways from Barcelona), I was transported back by this story 30+ years to the days when I glimpsed parts of the Spanish culture.  Other reviews will give you the outline of the story, but I will attempt a small capsule summary.  The narrator, as a boy, discovers a forgotten book by a forgotten author.  He is enthralled and tries to learn more about the mysterious writer.  In the process, he encounters picaresque, dangerous, beautiful, and eccentric people, who complicate and enliven his life.  This book was a joy to read and I recommend it most strongly to you.  I would be very surprised if most readers wouldn't want to hug the book after finishing it.  I know I did.
B0006399FS|1.0|It seems all that talk was for nothing. <br />So much for all that \\"best album ever\\" talk. <br />Thats why many are'nt buying this (Literally!) <br />But for many its to late - how could U2 settle for this, and I'm still finding it hard to beleive it took 4 years for them to bring this out. <br /> <br />They sound to much like they are trying to sound to much like themselves from back in the earliear 80s, without it working and as for the less louder tracks, well they are just bland and unexciting. <br /> <br />Sorry but its the truth - everything they did up until here was great and even the less gooder stuff was alright, but this is just a joke. <br />
B000002H97|4.0|In 1991 when Metallica released their follow up to \\"...And Justice for All\\", toned it down a bit. With 1991's Metallica aka the black album, the band cut back on the riffing and solos a bit,trimed the length of some of their songs as well and came up with a powerful yet more commercial sound that could appeal to people, who may not have been fans of heavy metal. I had to re-review this album after giving it another chance. Even though there is not as much fury as the first 4 albums, the black album is still pretty good, and it is easy to see why everybody likes this album. Enter Sandman, Sad but True, Unforgiven, and Wherever I May Roam, are a few of the highlights from the Black Album. Check it Out!
B00006RU5B|1.0|Wow, what a dreary and bland album. <br /> <br />Rage Against The Machine members and Soundgardens Chris Cornell could of done something a bit more unploished and exciting rather than this nicely packaged album full of squeaky clean guitar solos - Boring and bland! <br /> <br />Bring back \\"Zack De La Cockroach!!!\\" - no offence, its actually a very cool name. <br />Chris Cornell should of just started his own new band thankyou very much. <br /> <br />Get \\"Euphoria Morning\\" thats an outstanding album. <br />
B00000DRE1|5.0|W.A.S.P.'s The Crimson Idol,was their first album of the 90s. In all reality, The Crimson Idol is more or less a Blackie Lawless solo album, since none of the original members are on this album except for Lawless. The Crimson Idol is a concept album or a rock opera, about a singer named Jonathan. Each song is part of Jonathan's story. The Crimson Idol ranks among W.A.S.P. finest albums. This album is great showcase for the talents of Blackie Lawless. Chainsaw Charlie, and HOld on to My Heart are just a couple of the standouts on The Crimson Idol. If you can find The Crimson Idol, you should buy it.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|\\"Take Me Out\\" is the catchiest song to come out since Oasis's \\"Wonderwall\\" <br /> <br />as for the album well, its great that a trully great band that is new has appeared, and they have their own style and image which is just fantastic, its great to see something new and refreshing. <br /> <br />The album is great, although sometimes on the whole it can sound a bit to similiar at times, that aside its a fantastic first album from a band who look like they will go on to even better things.
0393317552|5.0|Yali, from New Guinea, asked why Europeans had developed so much cargo.  Empires with steel weapons were able to exterminate those relying on stone and wood.  Evolutionary biology is an historical science forced to use historical methods.  The starting point is 11,000 B.C.   <br /> <br />Our closest relatives are the gorilla, the common chimpanzee, and the pygmy chimpanzee, (the bonobo).  In the contest of the Spaniards versus Indians in the New World, only the tribes who reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering horses and guns were able to prevail.  Europeans overcame the Incas and the Aztecs against numerical odds with their weapons and tactics.  Until World War I the military use of horses transformed warfare.  Transmission of diseases introduced through the presence of Europeans played a role in weakening resistance to European supremacy.   <br /> <br />Plant and animal domestication contribute to greater population density.  There is a higher birthrate through the use of a fixed abode and there is increased food production over hunter-gatherer methods.  The storage of food is possible.  Stored food means a society, a kingdom, can maintain people given special functions such as priests, soldiers, artisans.   <br /> <br />Much of history has consisted of unequal conflicts.  By Roman times almost all of the leading crops of today were being cultivated.  The vast majority of wild plants are unsuitable for cultivation.  Fertile Crescent cereals were productive in the wild.  The Feritle Crescent has biological diversity over small distances.   <br /> <br />To be domesticated a wild mammal must possess many different characteristics.  To be used for food the animals must be herbivores, fast-growing, non-finicky eaters.  They must have decent dispositions and breed in captivity.  They must live in herds, have a dominance structure, and over-lapping territories.   <br /> <br />Eurasia's East-West axis allowed Fertile Crescent crops to spread over the band of the temperate latitudes.  Predominately North-South axies in Africa and the Americas made the diffusion of crops difficult.  Necessity produced the atom bomb, cotton gin, and steam engine.  Complex societies form by merger.  Unlike Russia and the United States, China seems monolithic.  China's head start contributed to developments in neighboring regions.  Human societies in East Asia and the Pacific provide many examples of how environment shapes history.   <br /> <br />The books is fascinating. The author compresses an amazing amount of information between the book's covers.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album is just not comparable or anywhere near as real sounding or as \\"good\\" with their proper albums which are  \\"Dookie\\" \\"Insomniac\\" and  \\"Nimrod\\" Nimrod including that bearable but also dreadful song \\"Good Riddance\\". <br /> <br />\\"Warning\\" was a bit......a bit to soft and poppy and now this \\"American Idiot\\" an album that proudly displays itself as being an example that rock n roll can be dangerous. <br /> <br />Which about as true and effective as trying to drown yourself in a bath tubb of marshmellows. <br /> <br />The music sounds fake, the video clips are stupid and annoying, the lyrics are garbage and their image is nice and tidy......this is not Green Day this is a poppy punk band who look like they are in it for the money and not the music.
B00005JLEJ|4.0|The colors in Akira Kurosawa's \\"Kagemusha\\" re-emerge bold and saturated on this DVD, with images bordering on hyper-realistic. The 1970s film stock retained a fair amount of grain, but it's rendered harmless by the raging colors. Wear is at a minimum, limited to some speckling and spotting. The film unspools letterboxed at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (with enhancement for 16x9 monitors). The stereo sound is as good as it gets with a foreign film of this age. The taiko drums roll out just like thunder while the rush of hooves fills the listener's room.<br /><br />Stephen Prince, commentator on the Wellspring DVD of \\"Ran,\\" the director's other color epic, gets the nod again on \\"Kagemusha.\\" The author of the Kurosawa book \\"The Warrior's Camera\\" repeats the feat of lecturing with authority and verve throughout the lengthy feature. Prince points out where most of the cuts were made for the shortened U.S. version of the film, accurately calling the complete presentation found on the Criterion DVD \\"a richer and more organic presentation.\\"<br /><br />\\"Kagemusha\\" works on a surface level as a take on illusion and reality, but those wise enough to dig deeper will need Prince's help. The commentator provides the historical orientation that Kurosawa rushed past, baffling his foreign audiences.<br /><br />Disc 2's extras lead off with exec producers George Lucas and Francis Coppola looking back on Kurosawa and \\"Kagemusha\\" in 19 minutes of interviews filmed last year. Kurosawa captured violence in a \\"poetic surprising way\\" that schooled the young American directors of the 1970s, Coppola says. \\"You could trace a line backwards from `The Godfather' to `Bonnie and Clyde' to Kurosawa,\\" he says. The Japanese director \\"always had a great story to tell,\\" Lucas adds.<br /><br />Some of Kurosawa's 200-some storyboards for the film reappear on the DVD in a split-screen comparison with finished scenes. In a fun extra, Coppola clinks glasses with Kurosawa in an odd TV ad for Suntory whiskey, a pitch clearly ... lost in translation.

B0007KTAU4|4.0|A local radio station (one of the only english-based stations in my area that has the guts to play music not sung in english) one day played \\"Quelqu'un m'a dit\\" in the middle of a set of songs. I was hooked! What a great song! I sat through the entire set to hear who the artist was. They finally said her name, and I wrote it down to look up later. Now maybe I'm a bit out of it, but I had never heard the name \\"Carla Bruni\\" before that day. Here I thought the radio station had done a great service in introducing an obscure up-and-coming French Bob Dylan to the all too homogenous American airwaves. Images of a bumming coquette bouncing around the caf&eacute;s of Paris bounced around in my head. What a find! A new voice! A beautiful voice! Tr&egrave;s romantique!<br /><br />So I put her name into Google and was quite surprised. Hm! There must be another \\"Carla Bruni\\" out there who's an Italian supermodel. I kept searching for my dream ragamuffin musician but found only lots of nudes of Mrs. Bruni scattering the pages of my Google image search. Then the idealism was shattered like a thin chunk of obsidian: Carla Bruni the musician and Carla Bruni the supermodel were one and the same. Whoa.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the fashion industry. I don't want to support supermodels. I don't think a person should have an unfair advantage over others simply because they're beautiful. And I definitely don't want to give such people my money. So I was a little distressed, because the song wouldn't completely leave me. But I also wanted nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, though Carla Bruni doesn't need a cent of my money or my support (the romantic ragamuffin probably would have), I relented and bought the CD. It was in the \\"Italian Music\\" section of a local CD shop. The song was just as great as I remembered it from the radio. And now the big surprise: the rest of the CD is also very good. Not only that, Carla Bruni herself had a major hand in most of the songwriting and wordsmithing on this lovely CD.<br /><br />\\"Quelqu'un m'a dit\\" is simply a great song. Not much else to say there. Most of the album follows the mood of that song. Lots of nylon-stringed guitar, some strings here and there, minimal percussion, and Bruni's smooth voice sticking out over the mix. The music fits the French language perfectly (It's harder to imagine this music sung in Italian). The pace picks up in a few places, such as \\"L'excessive\\" with its bouncy jazzy beat. But the mood is mostly mellow, sensuous, and beautiful. The album closes appropriately with \\"La derni&egrave;re minute\\" or \\"The Last Minute\\" which is, appropriately, a minute long.<br /><br />This music apparently took some time to make it to the states. It was orginally released in 2002. That says droves about the english-centric mainstream music industry in the United States.<br /><br />So in the end I completely relented, and I love the CD, though I'm still not thrilled that she's a supermodel. Though sometimes we forget that things work a little differently over in europe. They definitely have good taste in music.uelqu'un m'a dit\\" is simply a great song. Not much else to say there.

B00005JMJG|5.0|This is certainly a different sort of film, and before I saw it I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It turned out to be far better than anything I may have had in mind beforehand. Though billed as a romantic comedy, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a far cry from most of the \\"chick flick\\" type movies we see today. The film is surreal in nature, but the story is honest, touching, and surprisingly down-to-earth. The central character, Joel (Jim Carrey), is a quiet man, bashful and awkward around girls. Then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a vibrant and spontaneous young woman, and the two embark upon a tumultuous but passionate relationship. But this is only the beginning. After a particularly nasty fight, Clementine impulsively decides to undergo a procedure which will have Joel and all memories connected to him erased from her mind.<br /><br />When Joel discovers what his girlfriend has done, he is devastated, and decides to have the same procedure performed on himself to wipe Clementine out of his own memory. The procedure is done while he is asleep, and we see each of his memories played back just before it is erased forever. As Joel relives these memories, however, he begins to realize that he may not want to forget Clementine after all. He finds that he still loves her, and wants to hold onto the good things they had. But how can he stop the forgetting process once it has begun?<br /><br />The story may sound strange, but amazingly, it works. From the beginning it draws the viewer in, revealing enough to make us care about the characters, but concealing enough to keep us guessing. Unlike so many romantic comedies, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is anything but predictable. Right up to the last scenes, it is still unclear how everything is going to end. The atmosphere of the film is very surreal, and the style is quite fragmented, making for some confusion (this is intentional), but all the threads come together seamlessly in the end. This is a very artistic and thought-provoking film, and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has woven a plotline of surprising brilliance.<br /><br />Needless to say, the part of Joel is a significant departure for Jim Carrey from the roles he has played before. Unlike the wild, offbeat characters we are used to seeing from him, Carrey's performance here is almost understated. I was surprised by how heartfelt and genuine Joel was. We see none of Carrey's usual off-the-wall antics. This film showcases his acting ability, proving that he can portray a character with real emotional depth. Kate Winslet also turns in a terrific performance as Clementine. This is a bit of a departure for her, too, quite different from her roles in films such as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" or \\"Finding Neverland.\\" Here Winslet is a brash, spontaneous, and rather foul-mouthed young American woman. She pulls it off surprisingly well, creating a character that is at times flagrant and moody, but genuinely likeable nonetheless.<br /><br />The DVD Special Features (referring to the regular edition, NOT the 2-disc edition) are worth a look. The featurette \\"A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" offers some great information on the filmmaking process. Cast and crew members provide their own insights into the making of the movie. Another featurette, \\"A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry\\" is just that; the two reflect briefly on various experiences on the set. There is also feature commentary from Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, a few deleted scenes (all of which I agree were better left out of the movie, though they are interesting to see), a music video for The Polyphonic Spree's \\"Light and Day,\\" and a commercial for Lacuna, the fictional company that, in the story, administers the memory-erasing procedure.<br /><br />I honestly can't think of a single thing to criticize about this film, and I strongly urge everyone to see it.istic and thought-provoking film, and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has woven a plotline of surprising brilliance.

B0006L5RXS|4.0|Sweet was one of the most successful UK bands of the 1970s. They started out with Funny Funny in 1971, a singalong vocal pop hit and that same year they had another huge success with the clever pop song Coco, a song about a monkey, with sweet hooks and gorgeous harmonies.<br /><br />As the 1970s progressed, their sound evolved into a type of bubblegum metal, power pop or glamrock, as on the brilliant Blockbuster, Hell Raiser and Ballroom Blitz. The very best tracks are the aforementioned, plus the amazing Fox On The Run.<br /><br />Not everything is great here, since Poppa Joe, Alexander Graham Bell, Little Willy and Wig Wam Bam are disposable and lightweight pop. But their 1978 hit Love Is Like Oxygen is much more mature, a type of tuneful hard rock.<br /><br />The album includes some of their best album tracks like Restless, Set Me Free and Burn On The Flame, that display Sweet's more serious hard rock side. Overall a very enjoyable mix of vocal and hard edged pop plus some serious glam rock excursions.
0060594888|5.0|If I had to recommend just one book on attaining success, this would be the one!  The topics are wide ranging and Mr. Canfield clearly recognizes that success requires more than money alone.  The 64 principles are clearly explained, and each chapter contains enough reference information for the reader to embark on further exploration.  The book was easy to read, but not simplistic.  I wish that it had been available when I was 21.  There is also a very useful website associated with the book.  This is a book that I highlighted extensively and that I intend to keep and discuss with my children.
B000002UA7|5.0|The Whole Story covers all of Kate bush's most memorable songs from the 1970s and early 1980s although it is by no means the whole story of her career. It opens with the re-recorded version of her spooky and atmospheric 1978 hit Wuthering Heights. This version has greater depth than the original single and still remains a most remarkable song based as it is on the novel of the same name.<br /><br />Bush is a unique singer-songwriter with a gift for striking romantic imagery, although her work is not always immediately accessible. The Man With The Child In His Eyes is a complex and moving ballad, whilst Wow is a powerful atmospheric pop song.<br /><br />Her music can be quite idiosyncratic and full of oneiric imagery, like Breathing and The Dreaming. On the other hand, Babooshka is a buoyant pop song with a catchy tune. This compilation is charming and very enjoyable. Overall, Kate's music can be described as a form of art rock, not always appealing on first listen, but very rewarding if you persist.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|As we began to watch the DVD of SHALL WE DANCE?, my wife told me I wouldn't like it. Perhaps she remembers too well our 1999 classes in ballroom dancing preparatory to the gala New Year's Eve formal affair we attended to end the millennium, in all of which I demonstrated that This White Man Can't Dance.<br /><br />Richard Gere plays lawyer John Clark, a writer of wills, who's undergoing a mid-life crisis. Certainly, he loves his wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) and his teenage daughter Jenna (Tamara Hope), but his daiy routine is otherwise one of quiet desperation. Then, riding home on the elevated train, he notices Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio alongside the tracks. Even more intriguing is the solitary Latin beauty standing motionless in an open window. One evening, on a mad impulse, he alights from his ride and signs up for beginner's lessons in ballroom dancing. Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette) provides the practical knowledge of the dance steps, but it's her assistant Paulina (Jennifer Lopez), the Latin beauty from the window, who can imbue the school's students with passion, as when she describes how to dance the rumba:<br /><br />\\"The rumba is the vertical expression of a horizontal wish. You have to hold her, like the skin on her thigh is your reason for living. Let her go, like your heart's being ripped from your chest. Throw her back, like you're going to have your way with her right here on the dance floor. And then finish, like she's ruined you for life.\\"<br /><br />Beverly, who knows nothing of her husband's new interest, begins to suspect he's having an affair. She hires a private detective (Richard Jenkins) to uncover the dirt. In perhaps the film's best monologue, Beverly explains to the gumshoe why people get married, which is that each individual, otherwise a non-entity in a world of billions, needs someone to bear witness to his/her life. It's perhaps one of the most poignant justifications of marriage that I've ever run across.<br /><br />SHALL WE DANCE? includes several fine performances: Stanley Tucci as Clark's colleague Link, whose closet dedication to ballroom dancing is a secret life unknown to his co-workers, and Lisa Ann Walter as Bonnie, the earthy and abrasive blonde on the downslope of middle-age determined to win a local dance competition, in which, of course, John's involvement figures significantly in the evolution of the plot. Somewhat disappointing to me was J Lo's Paulina, who came off more prickly than was perhaps necessary. Indeed, it wasn't until Paulina's description of the rumba (quoted above) that I saw any good reason for her character's presence in the film.<br /><br />SHALL WE DANCE? is undeniably a chick flick, but, to my and my wife's amazement, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B00005JNTV|5.0|This film is not for everyone, but I loved it.  It's another highly stylized ultraviolent movie from that dynamic duo Rodriguez and Tarrantino.  I've read a little Frank Miller, but was unaware of Sin City the graphic novels.  From what it sounds like they took a lot of care to stay true to the original graphic novels so I guess I should really be crediting Frank Miller for the way this movie looks and feels.  The stories are also quite good, though thematically typical of at least a few of graphic novels I've read.  In a world where perverts can be the next president, corruption goes to the very top, love is bought and sold, and life doesn't seem to be worth very much, What does one cling to? Live for? Die for?  Kill for?  All in all, once you get past the bullets, blood, and dismemberment, the stories are really kind of sweet.
0060730552|2.0|I bought this book based on the story of Joe Simpson and tried so hard to like it, but I just couldn't. It had to be one of the most boring books I've read in a long time...No, correct that, I couldn't even finish it because it was so boring. I lasted about 80 pages and skimmed the other 20 and just wanted the book to end.... <br /> <br />The book started out okay but once the two started climbing it became extremely repetitive....I just wanted the book to end...It was so damn boring! Great story (hence two stars and not one) but terribly written. <br />
B0002S947K|5.0|I rarely (never) write reviews for this kind of thing, but I stongly believe that this albumn should be heard.  I saw Mr. Lamontagne in the Austin City Limits music festival... after only listening to two songs (there were many venues, and I only walked past his near the end of his set) I bought this albumn.  I haven't been dissapointed.  Though the voice is different, and really even the tone is pretty different, somehow I draw parallels between Lamontagne and Jim Croce.  And that's a good thing, in my opinion.
0201721481|5.0|This is one of the most readable C++ books available today. The formatting and layout are expertly formulated to clearly get information across with minimal impedance. Their use of callouts and shading is enabling but not noisy. The ordering of topics is artful - learning vector, string, and simple iteration right of the chute is the Right Thing. The authors teach what you need when you need it as you learn C++. I like the way they present usage of the C++ library, especially of containers and algorithms, before they even mention how to define your own classes. This encourages the right mindset for effective C++ programming. Wisely, they leave topics important to production programming (exceptions, namespaces, multiple inheritance, RTTI) and other gnarly issues (pointers to members, local classes) to the end. Anyone with familiarity with at least one other programming language should be able to get up to speed with C++ As Nature Intended with this very readable book.<br /><br />-- Chuck Allison, Editor, The C++ Source
0060594888|5.0|I know that's a big statement, but it's also absolutely true. I grabbed the huge tome up at a bookstore after browsing through its pages, took it home and instantly fell in love with its knowledge. If you love Napolean Hill, The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People and Awaken The Giant Within, you might as well order this book right now. The price might be hefty, but it's worth every penny. Inside this massive collection of success secrets, you'll discover:<br /><br />>Why so many people, even success junkies like us, fail to achieve our dreams.<br />>Inspiration to keep you going during the tough moments<br />>Dozens of examples to give you ideas on how to apply the success principles to your own life.<br /><br />...and lots more.<br /><br />One of my favorite ideas in the book is a new twist on the, \\"Act as if you are already successful\\" principle that I've known for years. When I read the chaper on this principle, I felt like I did the first time I read, \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" I was stunned.
B00000IAU3|5.0|OMG, i love this CD. one of my all time favorites. i know most of the songs by heart, i sing along to Dido, when i'm laying in bed with my baby, and i sing the words to him. it's a very sweet moment - i just love the words. and it's very calming and soothing. i like to play music to fall asleep to at night. this is a great CD. profound and beautiful. thanks Dido!! (your mother didn't really name you that - did she?)
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is awesome.  You should definitely buy it.  Even if you have never listened to the Beatles or any rock music at all, I guarantee you will love this album.  Every song is awesome, especially 'Nowhere Man' and 'In My Life.'  'Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)' was in the top 100 of the Rolling Stone 500 greatest songs list and it is actually my least favorite song on the album (though I still think it is outstanding).  This is one of the few albums in the world that you can listen to all the way through.  If this album came out today, you would not be able to go anywhere and no hear about how great it is.  If it came out today when the Grammys actually recognize rock music (The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' in 1967 was the first rock album to win best album at the Grammys) it would win for sure.  But since it is from 1965 it lost to Frank Sinatra.  Anyway, the year doesn't matter.  No matter what kind of music you like, unless you already are a fan of the Beatles, you will like this more.  This is the Beatles 3rd best album.  If you don't own 'Revolver' or 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' than you will think this is the greatest album ever.
B000089RVR|5.0|I'm a fan, love this girl and her music. just wish she had a different name! every time i tell someone i LOVE Dido - they look at me and say \\"Dildo?\\" to which i answer - \\"NO! D I D O .\\" sheesh.<br />OK, i have the first album, and i love it. so, when the second came out, had to get it. both are great make-out music CDs. put one on and grab your sweetie. just ask my hubby, Norman - we've kissed to Dido many many times, and more....
B000002UAR|5.0|If you are reading this, it is probably because you are trying to decide whether you should buy this album.  I have two words for you: Do it.  This was the very first Beatles album I ever bought, and it singlehandedly changed me from a rap fan to a classic rock fan.  This is my second-favorite album ever ('Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' by the Beatles is number one) and without a doubt you should buy it.  All the songs are great and there is more variety on here than almost any album ever.  There are great guitar riffs ('Taxman'), a string ensemble ('Eleanor Rigby'),beautiful ballads ('Here There and Everywhere' and 'For No One'), soul ('Got to Get You Into My Life'), eastern music ('Love You To'), fun sing-a-longs ('Yellow Submarine'), and an acid trip ('Tomorrow Never Knows').  BUY THIS ALBUM.  As someone who never had listened to any rock music at all before this album, I really think you should buy this album.  Really.  Buy it.  It is better than anything else ever made (except 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'- buy that too!).  The Beatles were the greatest and always will be.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Anastacia rocks and her voice is awesome.  I own all 3 of her albums and am totally pissed at the length of time it is taking Sony/Epic/Daylight to release this album in the U.S.  Anastacia is an overlooked talent like many of the artists I'm fans of that have true staying power but are passed by for the flavor of the month. People trust me that flavor is just gonna leave a bad taste in your mouth! Buy the Anastacia album....buy all of 'em!
B0002OERI0|1.0|When I first heard that Green Day was releasing a new album last September I was ecstatic. But one day before school in mid-September before the album's release I was watching MTV and saw the new American Idiot video. Something inside me died that morning. I was very disappointed in the song and the video. It simply was not Green Day. I have been a huge Green Day fan for three years. They are one of my all time favorite bands. Sure Green Day has not been the Green Day I love since the release of 1997's Nimrod. But this was an all time low. Sure I can add the songs Holiday, St. Jimmy, and Give Me Novacaine to my long list of Green Day songs I like. But as a whole this album was my least favorite.
B00009V7P8|5.0|The Blowers Daughter is quite possibly the best song I have ever heard....As an artist and musician, I am in awe and humbled by such a work of perfection.  Period.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|\\"Let It Be... Naked\\" is so offensive it both concept and content, that it's hardly possible to believe that this release actually happened.  What the \\"fans\\" of this version must realize is that THIS VERSION IS NOT THE VERSION THAT THE BEATLES INTENDED TO RELEASE OR ENDORSED.  This irrelevant release is Paul McCartney's vision of what he NOW wants \\"Let It Be\\" to be.  [...]   To sum it all up:  Buy the real 1970 version, buy it quick, before Sir Paul decides to have it deleted form the catalog and enjoy that album for what it is, Beatles outtakes and live tracks rescued by Phil Spector and cobbled into a fairly satisfying album.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|One of the best children's movies of all time, \\"Mary Poppins\\" is one of Walt Disney's finest accomplishments. When he paired an up-and-coming young actress (Julie Andrews) with an established, bankable, and enthusiastic star (Dick Van Dyke), Disney struck cinematic gold.    \\"Mary Poppins\\" compares favorably with even the best childrens' fare of the last 40 years, and is just as enjoyable for older family members. Never preachy or saccharine, the movie can be enjoyed again and again.    Everyone who loves movies should own this 2-DVD set, packed with extras. There are absolutely no flaws to be seen, and the extras are top-notch. If you are on the fence about purchasing this movie, go ahead and order it from Amazon right away, with full confidence.    Five stars!
1591391105|4.0|The premise and content of this book is what to do in the critical first 90 days in a new assignment or a new position.  While the book covers a wide variety of concepts, there are few which go into great detail.  However, those that are covered are done so in manner that still is a valuable read for anyone changing jobs or roles.<br /><br />In my opinion one of the richest subjects to address, is also the one covered in the least detail here - culture.  One of the most challenging and difficult issues to understand and respond to are the unstated, yet very powerful, forces at work which enable or hinder a new employee's organizational success.  Any manager in a new role needs to quickly understand the do's and don'ts so they can be more effective.  I wish the book had gone into far more detail on this subject.<br /><br />That said, the sections on how to ask the right questions, assess your new team, and negotiate success with your boss are all great.  The author depicts a STaRS model for determining the situation a new leader may face.  The four types of business situations are \\"Sustaining Success\\", \\"Turnaround\\", \\"Realignment\\" and \\"Start-Up\\".  The book goes into each situation and the different approaches required in each setting. (Page 63)<br /><br />I found the section on \\"Build Your Team\\" to be quite insightful.  Several tips are included that will be very useful for anyone in the position of assessing their new team. In particular are several questions that can be asked, and some great insights into non-verbal behaviors and other clues that will provide much needed information to lead and coach through the transition.  (Page 167).<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone looking to put together a quick on-boarding program for new managers, or who is going through a transition themselves.  Many good ideas and a great overview of the areas a new leader needs to be aware of to make a successful transition.
B00005JLEJ|3.0|Being a big fan of Asian cinema and Japanese history, I have longed to view Kagemusha.  I guess all the waiting, hampered my expectations.  This piece takes place prior to the reign of the Tokugawa period when clans were all battling for control.   <br /> <br />When Lord Shingen of the Takeda clan dies, the clan quickly substitutes a double to take his place and fool the country of the truth.  The double has to convince even his close relations that he is the real thing, otherwise word may spread and other clans will take advantage of the situation.   <br /> <br />This movie is one of Japanese most famous directors, Akira Kurosawa, biggest pieces.  It was supported and co-produc <br />ed by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) and Francis Ford Coppala (famous American director).   It was Akira's movies from the 60's that inspired American movies such as STAR WARS, Magnificent 7, and a long list of Western movies.  You definitely can see the western influences in the magnificent Kurosawa movie, The Seven Samurai.   <br /> <br />Back to the movie at hand, I was disappointed.   The movie, very beautifully shot with scenery and provided with intelligent dialogue has been weakened by one thing; pace.  This movie has an incredibly and brutally slow pace to it.  It is a movie running at 3 hours which could have easily been 1/2 the length and still achieved its goal.  The acting is superb, characters are amply developed, even though the focus is mainly on 1 person (the double), scenery is spectacular, dialogue is well written, but in the end it just is too long.  There really is no reason to justify its length, not even the \\"artistry\\" factor can.   <br /> <br />In the end, all the great movie aspects are there, just stretched out too far. <br /> <br />I viewed the 3/29/05 Criterion Collection:  Picture and Sound are yes, above par.
B00000DFMM|5.0|The absolute apotheosis of 80s synthesizer music.  One of my favorite and most-listened-to albums by anyone, ever.  Atmospheric, expansive, compelling.  Redoubtable, riveting; full of miraculous chordal progressions which almost seem to defy logic, gravity, and all previous musical explorations.  Sounds crazy?  Nope, it's really that good.  A work of undisputed genius.<br /><br />Propaganda never again reached this peak ...But then neither did anyone else.  Miss \\"A Secret Wish\\" at your peril!
B00009XITP|4.0|Watch with your friends, have fun. Don't pay attention to the weak acting, sensless storyline, and predictable plot. ok?
B000002HMH|5.0|This cd beats so much ass, that if it were a boxer it'd be an undefeated champ. So whoever says that metallica went soft can go die, becuase i'm always right
B000002UB3|5.0|In my opinion the greatest rock album ever. Certainly the greatest Beatles album ever.
1400032717|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. I would describe it as a fun ride, without much of a destination, which isnt' necessarily bad, but if you are a person for twists, or a mounting plot, in my opinion, the twist attempt in this book is a bit of a dud. Nonetheless, it was a very enjoyable read, and funny. Quite funny in spots.
B0006399FS|4.0|I saw all the 1-star reviews for this CD, and I couldn't help but wonder if this has been the concerted effort of some I-Hate-U2-Fan-Club. My suspicion grew stronger as I noticed the abundance of \\"unhelpful\\" ratings of the favorable reviews. <br /> <br />Ultimately, we all have our personal tastes. But let's at least try to be fair. Why all the 1-star ratings? Is it because the CD was this bad, or is it because the CD fell short of the reviewers' subjective and perhaps unrealistic expectation of what a band with a 20-year history *ought* to sound like? Or is it simply because the CD has U2's name on it? <br /> <br />Listen to the CD again. If the music, the songs, the lyrics, the production didn't come with U2's name on it, would you have been this harsh on it? I know there are at least a couple of listenable songs on the CD to justify at least a 2-stars for most listeners who don't care one way or the other about the musicians behind it. <br /> <br />I know some people will be enraged by my questions, and I fully expect loads of \\"unhelpful\\" peer reviews. If true, then all you U2-haters out there would only be behaving as predictably as what you accused this latest U2 CD of--just more-of-the-same rehashing of old tricks.

B0002858YS|5.0|I had heard of the band but had never heard them. Then, one night at a sleepover, I was watching MTV when Mr. Brightside, the music video, came onto the screen. I sat transfixed by not only the colors, but by the wonderful music I was hearing. <br /> <br />I began to check out their stuff and eventually went to pick up the CD, since I had heard Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told Me and figured I'd try to see what I could make of it. What I got was not only worth the money, it totally went past my expectations. <br /> <br />The songs are catchy with melodious tunes and a wonderful sound. The synth sounds add immensely to the performance of The Killers! Their new sound with songs proving points and telling stories, conveying hardcore meaning with a solid melody, provides us with a technical \\"eargasm\\" that will leave us tingling. It's a wonder they've just debuted; had they done so years ago, there might be more wonderful things coming from them. <br /> <br />Key songs on the CD are: <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside (without a doubt) <br />Andy, You're A Star (with a mind like mine, this song is translated into a myriad of things that eventually settles on the best meaning possible; you figure it out!) <br />All These Things I've Done (the large gospel bridge in the middle is what I wait for during this song. I couldn't bear to listen to this CD and not listen to this song!) <br />Change Your Mind (the beginning alone is enough to keep me hooked through the end) <br /> <br />Overall, I must say that I am impressed with this CD and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I reccommend it to everyone who thinks we need a new wave of retro synth music and something rejuvenating in the otherwise bland pop scene we have now. This is new. This is fresh. They are The Killers.
B00000BKI4|4.0|this album is definitely dreamy. There are no huge moments but a a steady slight twinge of light guitars and flowing orchstral sounds fronted by a quiet band. It reminds me of what Mr. Mackey on Southpark would hears inside his head. Hmm-kay?
B00012QM8G|3.0|First of all I'm sick and tired of hearing people complain about the two-sided disc. I wasn't any happier about it, but all I had to do was get off my lazy butt and change the side. That aside, I just finished watching the movie and I thought it was pretty good. I don't know how acurate it was, but Oskar Schindler was a good man. He was the only one who seemed to care enough about the Jewish people to try to save them. Yeah, he made them work for very little wages in his factory, but it was better than being shot in the back of the head. I wouldn't consider buying this movie, but I would suggest renting it.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This album is like the best kind of hypnotic, chilled out trip,<br /><br />but it is so much more than the current abundance of chilled out tunes, the tracks are historic reworkings of jazz classics which have been cleverly engineered in a loop fashion, with beautiful jazzy voice samples so as to make an entirely new, mesmeric sound and feel.<br /><br /> The music really is the kind of stuff that is pleasurable both audibly and in a more transcended, visceral sense, it works it's way into your head and your being so as to become memorable and classic and a kind of theme for times and places.
B000002MU3|2.0|<br />Okay, Amazon, thanks for telling me how to feel. \\"Strange Currencies\\" better than \\"Everybody Hurts\\"? I don't think so. As many people have pointed out, there are only two goods songs on here (and both are classics): \\"What's the Frequency\\" and \\"Bang the Blame\\". It's so dissapointing that REM can't put out a totally solid album. With this band, it seems their hits are all classics (rightfully), and everything else is just mediocre or worse. There's no middle ground with these guys. I think I'm being generous with two stars for two songs, but whatever. <br />
B000001Y5J|1.0|Depeche mode's \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" is more controversial than anything by Trent Reznor. It's more sacreligious AND catchy, too. And DM didn't even aim to offend! I'd like to see Trent make a single like that! He has to TRY to make people gasp and cover their eyes and ears. He's like the \\"tormented\\" 17 year old \\"poet\\" and/or theater major at a community college who wished somebody would take the time to just notice him. And as for the \\"Broken Movie\\" that was never official released; it isn't anything more unsettling than watching an instructional video on how to stuff/cook a raw turkey or drain raw ground beef. <br /> <br />On \\"Gave Up\\" Reznor whines that he smashed his self to pieces and doen't \\"know what else to do\\"?! How about shutting up and stop releasing sh*tty albums like this. Fixed is even worse. Listening to static is better than that sh*t. <br /> <br />And to the guy below who complains about how all the 99 tracks aren't music: Grow the f*ck up. Plenty of other bands do that. Hanson even did it. The Beatles did it. Nirvana did it. Blur did it. Unfortunately, Nine Inch Nails isn't in the same league as any of those bands. <br /> <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've had this cd for a long time and now finally felt compelled to write a review.  This is the best cd of 2003 and very close to one of the greatest cd's ever.  I don't think I need to address each individual song because other reviews have already done that.  Stockholm Syndrome and Butterflies & Hurricanes are not to be missed.  To those who have heard Muse is just another radiohead, that is completely untrue.  Being and extremely hardcore Muse fan and listening to them for a long time, I have only once ever thought of comparing Matt Bellamy to Thom Yorke.  Matt shares the same vocal style as Thom, but not the same vocal patterns...they are much different.  Yes they may both hit a capellas a lot, but what do you expect?  It would be a waste of Matt's wonderful voice if he didn't sing that way. But when Matt sings it is like he is putting all of his soul and all of his energy behind his vocals.  Almost all of Muse's songs have stronger vocals than radiohead tracks.    As for those who say the music is the same as radiohead...I'm not sure what exactly is going through their heads.  Yes radiohead was an influence, but one of many. I actually believe anyone comparing Muse to radiohead is just insulting radiohead.  Whatever elements of radiohead Muse may have taken they have improved upon greatly.  The vocals are much better, the bass lines much more stunning, edgy, and heavy.  Drums are much more prominent.  And the guitar(only one) and piano work are self explainatory. These tracks are original and very well written and do not sound like radiohead at all.  Muse has a heavy element added to their sound that radiohead will never acheive.  Mind you radiohead sits around their studio with 5 members trying to write complicated things.  Muse is a much more respectable band.  They have such a loud, dominant, and amazing sound coming out of 3 members.  A three piece band that can rock is always a plus because, as this albun shows, it really is all you need.
B0007MAO0M|4.0|Yep, it won't close very good either.  Almost a major headache to put the slip cover back on.  And trust me you need to put it back on.  Bad design there.  They are right the scrapebook should have been designed to fit in the case.  Which lacks the chapter insert.  Since i own the old dvd set I simply stuck that chapter insert in the new set.  Disc 2 of this set is absurd.  Nothing much new.  And the interview with Kevin Costner looks to be in the same room and chair and setting he used for the interview on The new Bodyguard dvd.  Now I see why this is $13.99 and not more.  Basically a rush job.  The only reason to buy it of course though is the Superbit presentation. ;)  The running commentary is a bit of a laugh though :)  Loved it. <br /> <br /> <br />They also seemed to have fixed the closed captioning.  The original was just embarassingly wrong.
B0006J28BO|5.0|This cartoon is for children and adults alike.  It takes people into a magical world where cats rule.  It's really cute in a fairytale style, as they kidnap a highschool girl to reward her for rescuing a cat and she goes on a magical adventure.  It's reallt cute.  All the cats in it have defininte personalities and are neat.
076790592X|2.0|I picked up Tuesdays with Morrie at a yard sale recently, after having heard for years about what a life-affirming book it is.  I lost my grandfather about 2 years ago and had many heart-to-heart talks with him in his declining years. I hoped the book would capture some of that sensibility.  Instead, it was the most trite piece of crap I've read in years. While Morrie was most certainly a commendable person and inspirational teacher, [...] And things that seem to Mitch to be revelatory are the most obvious things that should have occurred to most people by adolescence. Yuck.
B00005JNTV|5.0|The is a freakin' awesome movie. Before you go into this movie a few things need to be said. First off, this isn't a date movie (unless you have a really kewl girlfriend like I do) and this isn't a movie for kids. (I wouldn't recommend parents of kids under the age of 17 taking their kids to see this movie.) This is not your typical comic book, this is a graphic novel. It is filled with gratuitous violence and nudity. At the same time this is the most faithful comic book/graphic novel adaptation ever put to the big screen and it's made only better by that fact.<br /><br />Let me tell you, I didn't go into this movie as a fanboy of the Sin City comic book. I went into this as a fan of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. (I'm one of those people who is more of a fan of the film makers than the stars who act in their films.) Two days before I picked up the first book in the series, The Hard Goodbye, and started reading it. I must say I enjoyed what I had read thoroughly before seeing the movie as I followed Marv through his search for the b@st@rds who killed the only woman who ever loved him. I went to the theater on opening day, and was just blown away as I watched the exact same thing, frame for frame as I had just read in the graphic novel.<br /><br />Style is the first thing everyone talks about when dealing with this movie. Sure, it's in black and white, but the splashes of color mixed with the black and white give you a new way to look at the dingy world of Basin City. (This movie is after all Frank Miller's depiction of Hollywood.) Also the lack of color does also dim the violence a tad bit, but the style is stunning none the less.<br /><br />I have seen too many reviews downing the acting and dialogue of this movie. According to one reviewer, \\"The acting was horrendous.\\" But then again that actor was a 15 year old, who I'm sure knows nothing of where this style of acting comes from. Most of the people who give this movie bad reviews know nothing of true cinema, only the popcorn crap that we call movies nowadays. Crap like The Day After Tomorrow, or Freddy Vs. Jason and crap like that. The style of acting that is used in this movie was originated in the film noir movies of the 30's 40's and 50's. It's supposed to be slightly overacted and cheesy. Among the best in this movie are Mickey Rourke as the aforementioned Marv, and a brilliant Benicio Del Toro as a crooked cop who seems to somewhat enjoy a very interesting car ride with Clive Owen in the one scene directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />This movie does not have a linear plot by the way. And the characters are only brought together by a mutual friend/enemy/relative. The movie is based off of 3 of the first four novels, and are tied together quite well despite not having a major character running between each segment.<br /><br />All in all, anyone who is a fan of Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Kill Bill 1 and 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Pulp Fiction, and/or Reservoir Dogs should see this movie. Not only should you see this movie, you should see it while it's on the big screen, it's only going to loose some of it's luster on the small scree. Not much, but the image won't quite be the same.ue cinema, only the popcorn crap that we call movies nowadays. Crap like The Day After Tomorrow, or Freddy Vs. Jason and crap like that.

B00062IVKS|5.0|Well i've been waiting ever since I got my 1st dvd player for this one to get the \\"Special Edition\\" treatment! I was very disapointed in 2000 when Scorsese didn't release a 20th Anniversary Edition, but the extra 5 yr wait was worth it! <br /> <br />These dvd's contain an incredible collection of special features! <br />The commentaries by different producers/writer/actors is incredible(I just wish a few more people could have done them too!)but my absolute fave feature is \\"LaMotta vs DeNiro\\" which gives you an UNCANNY look at these 2 men boxing. The attention to detail is scary by Scorsese & DeNiro's preperation to actually spend a year learning how to box is truly beyond belief! <br />He boxed over 1000 rounds w/LaMotta alone! LaMotta always said DeNiro could have actually been a vg Middleweight, even in his late 30's when he learned how to box & coming from a World champ that did defeat the greatest boxer ever(Suar Ray Robinson)that's a GREAT compliment, & a true one! <br /> <br />Indeed it is a crime that Scorsese never wins an Oscar, as I don't think he ever will. However when his films like this come out he always wins more prestigious awards(New York & other filmwriters awards, The Cannes award, ect ect,)& will likely get a lifetime achievment award which will be the Academy's way of saying, \\"Oh excuse us! WE SCREWED UP!\\" <br /> <br />I never understood how a film can win the \\"Best Piture of the Year\\" but the Director not win?? Who directed the damned movie? A grip????? <br /> <br />Anyway, the greatest movie ever made has now, finally gotten the treatment it deserves! What a joy to watch! If you don't own a copy yet but want to see the finest performances by the finest actors & a fabulous soundtrack & film direction the way only Scorsese can do it then buy this dvd! Scorsese will never be a \\"Hollywood\\" director, but that's fine w/me Marty! Keep on giving us your New York, the REAL one! Thank you for this masterpeice!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Purchased the CD prior to seeing this amazing show..the music had me singing all day and was the only CD in my car stereo for months. The show itself...wow! Makes you think of an alternative to the original movie The Wizard Of Oz...and everything fits....Gregory McGuire...what an imagination! Highly recommend the CD, the book and the Musical!
B000002JOH|5.0|I was only 7 when this album came out so I kinda missed out on it then. Recently started paying more attention to radio and decided to pick up this disc after hearing a track or two on the local rock station. Needless to say, I am glad with my choice and typically wear a neck brace after playing this disc. \m/
0767817664|4.0|Although \\"Fright Night\\" is considered to be an 80's classic, it is actually more than that. The film is an endearing and energetic homage to horror cinema especially the Hammer productions and the Universal horror cycle. Yes, the film has a humorous tone, but it is not campy nor is it trashy. It is a competently written, stylishly directed and wonderfully performed horror film which features amazing special effects by Richard Edlund (back when effects depended on imagination, not processor speed) and a truly original and haunting score by Brad Fiedel. But the highlight of this movie has to be Roddy McDowall's performance as Peter Vincent (which is Tom Holland's tribute to actors PETER Cushing and VINCENT Price) as his portrayal of the fading horror star who hosts a second rate late night horror show who reluctantly becomes a real life vampire killer, is both terrific and arguably his career best. With an atmosphere that is nothing short of a horror buff's dream, good performances and a terrific, special-effects laden climax, this is a horror classic that is unmissable for fans of horror and especially vampire films. *The Region 1 dvd features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer, but is sadly missing the 5.1 sound remix that is featured on the region 2 edition, however both features the excellent trailer, which is also restored*.
B00003003R|4.0|Awesome, rockin' CD that brings back some fond memories from my teenage years in the early 90s. Yes, there are some essential live tracks missing (i.e. the debut of \\"Civil War\\" at Farm-Aid 4.7.90, \\"Live & Let Die\\" from Wembley Stadium 8.31.91, the group's rendition of the \\"Godfather Theme\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\" or \\"You Ain't the First\\" from the '93 Skin n' Bones acoustic sets) and a few minutes of Axl's famous rants would've painted a nice sonic portrait of a real G'n'R concert circa  '91-'92 but I suppose Geffen will release those from the vaults on Volume 2 (after all the current litigation is over, that is). <br /> <br />OK, now onto the music that IS included: \\"It's Alright\\", the Black Sabbath cover, is the highpont of Disc 1 for me as it is  the only song here I had never heard before.  It is a beautiful song amidst the raucous and volatile Appetite tracks that dominate the first disc Axl shows off some magnificent piano chops here as well as on the solo leading into \\"November Rain\\" demonstrating that he apparently listened to Beethoven and the John Coltrane Quartet along with Zepplin and the Stones. <br /> <br />Disc 2 mellows things out a little with great versions of \\"Estranged\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\". Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" from the Freddy Mercury Tribute Concert (4.20.92) is performed superbly (better than UYI2 version) and IMHO was the highlight of that historic concert. \\"Move to the City\\" is not my favorite track, but I do like jazz and I respect that the band was broadening their musical horizons and reaching out to more international audiences (even if the 976-Horns did piss off some hardcore metalheads).     <br /> <br />This CD is probably geared for the more serious G'n'R fan, but is also enjoyable even if you've only heard G'n'R on the radio or watched their videos on MTV waaaaay back when. I'm gettin' old. Rock on!. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008OWZC|5.0|Well I'm partial to Ten Years After live at the Fillmore, but Led Zeppelin's HOW THE WEST WAS WON is probably the greatest 'live' release of all-time.<br /><br />It draws its numbers from one of the best catolouges, and on this album you hear the utterly crips and beautifully power-raunched sound of Led Zeppelin's classic and brilliant songs in a new environment. They take their numbers to new heights as they launch musical grenades into the heads of everybody who picks this album up.<br /><br />Disc one is song after song of pure classics, Immigrant Song surpasses it's studio predecessor with a vamped-up rampage backline and a freaking awesome solo. Heartbreaker is torn through with an amazing, cool, extra-extended guitar solo. Over The Hills is a powerhouse power-ballad worthy of any. Black Dog is as groovey and hardcore as ever, especailly with the flailing Out On the Tiles intro. Stairway is dead-on good, powerful, and an excellent rendition. Since I've Been Loving You is passionate and as all hell. The whole acoustic set is beautiful, it's great to hear Zep do some supreme acoustic work. Going To California is a meanderign acoustic jam in this form. That's The Way is enchanting. Bron Yr Aur Stomp is a great song, unusual among Zep's other songs.<br /><br />The other two discs are almost as delicious as the first. Dazed And Confused is *drool* I can't believe what a cool song that is, it's the king of enthralling goodness (the studio version is drop dead beautiful but the live versions become an absolute monster pummel). What Is And What Should Never Be & Dancing Days are both excellent renditions, I particularly like that version of WIAWSNB. Moby Dick is masterfully entertaining, I love ever minute of it. WLL medley is crazy good, very entertaining and groovy and musical. Rock And Roll is a true powerhouse stomp with raunchy guitar soloage throughout. The Ocean is a slicing riffage piece. Bring It On Home is smooth & powerful & groovey to the max all at the same time.<br /><br />The whole thing together makes for a wonderful experience. I'd say it's worth your consideration. Let's get down to the gritty-honesty here, I tend to preffer studio work over live work. Live work can at at times be absolutely unfathomably cool, but for the most part the way a band puts together a song in the studio has the song at it's absolute height. Never the less, it'd be a good thing to consider getting Led Zeppelin's How The West Was Won because it is just plain incredible. The energy is equal or above any that I have ever heard. I say that being a serious grunge fan as I am, loving Alice In Chains & Nirvana and such... Led Zeppelin matches their loudness on this live album, they really do.the same time.  <br /> <br />The whole thing together makes for a wonderful experience. I'd say it's worth your consideration.

B00005JNTV|5.0|New movie from director Robert Rodriquez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino(that alone made me want to see it), based on the comics of Frank Miller. Here's what you need to know: Uber stylish film noir with plenty of blood n' gore, a great cast including Bruce Willis,Michael Madsen,Clive Owen,Mickey Rourke(and many more) and a pretty good script....now what you do with that knowledge....GO SEE THE FRIGGIN' MOVIE.
B000059MEK|5.0|Why do I find myself year after year listening to Discovery? Because it is one of the best albums out there I have ever heard.  Even if you don't listen to techno or tronica there is something about this album that sets it apart from the rest of the albums in this genre.  It's breathtaking, and rapidly changing, you never know whats coming next.  Each song is well-crafted and packed with as many hooks as some bands used on an entire album. <br /> <br />From the dance tracks like \\"One More Time\\" and \\"Harder,Better Faster Stronger\\", to the variety of songs including \\"Face to Face\\", a nice vocal set, every song is a new experience.  The album flows well and what the last song lacked the next makes up, its constant and hypnotic.  I don't usually enjoy albums like this, but Discovery is an album that can suck the non-believer into this electronic world.  It's addictive and so good that if you call yourself a music lover and you don't have Discovery, your lying. <br /> <br />Daft Punk's \\"Discovery\\" gets <br />A Bliss of 9
B000002J03|5.0|Out of all the Zeppelin studio albums, this one is my personal favourite. It truly showcases the talents of the band, such as John Bonham's 3 minute drum solo on \\"Moby Dick\\", Jimmy Page's sloppy but stellar solo on \\"Heartbreaker\\", Plant's vocals and JPJ's thumping rhythm throughout. While \\"II\\" may not be as cohesive or logical as \\"IV\\" or even \\"Physical Graffiti\\", the moments of sheer musical brilliance more than make up for the lack of its \\"albumness\\" (for lack of a better word). <br /> <br />Whole Lotta Love takes the cake for this album, and it's the opener! My mere words cannot describe the joy that this track brings my ears. We have here 5 1/2 minutes of sheer sonic bliss. Almost rivaling it are What is and What Should Not Be and The Lemon Song, before slowing down at Thank You. All three of these tracks are better than the last, and shows a very diverse band, as the first seems to be in a slow jazzy style, then to bluesy rock, and finally landing at an optimistic dirge (yes, I went there). Heartbreaker and Living Loving Maid are not as incredible orgasm-inducing as the rest of the record, but it doesn't matter, as either would rival the best tracks on any other Zeppelin record. Beyond this, we have Ramble On, a tremendous acoustic rock track, with a great performance by Page.  <br /> <br />Moby Dick begins with a killer, crushing guitar riff, but is ultimately overshadowed by the brilliance of the 3 minute drum solo by Bonham, proof that we was easily one of the best drummers at the time (rivaled, in my understanding, by Keith Moon). Finally, we close perfectly with \\"Bring it on Home\\", a bona-fide blues song, which switches into a rocker just in time for the close of the record. <br /> <br />HIGHLY recommended, one of my 5 favourite albums for sure.

B0002G2B2M|2.0|..it's pretty lame.  In spite of all the kudos this movie has received, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of those \\"artsy\\" movies that brags on its own originality, but fails to really address the issues at hand:  you may be able to erase a person's memories, but you cannot erase the feelings that person has.  This is proven not only in the main storyline with Joel and Clementine, but in the secondary plot featuring the impressionable Mary who thinks that the work of her idol Howard is so wonderful.  We later find out that her heroic doctor has been \\"playing\\" her like a fiddle, too.  We first meet Joel as he skips a day from work and goes off on an adventure where he runs into the blue-haired Clementine.  There's the slightest hint that they've \\"met before\\", and by the time the opening credits roll, we see a disgruntled and angry Joel finding out that Clementine has had a procedure done to \\"erase\\" her memories of Joel and she's on to a new life with a new boyfriend.  A hurt Joel decides to have the procedure done, but as it is being performed, he finds his memories aren't as awful as the thought and he tries to stop the procedure.  Of course, by the end, both Joel and Clementine realize they made a mistake in having the procedure done, but we also realize that even though they want to try and make it together again, the same things that caused them to split in the first place are still there and they will more than likely appear again.<br /><br />I didn't find the script all that enticing, it's manipulative and much of what goes on is predictable and forced.  As for the acting, Jim Carrey takes a dramatic leap but I found myself thinking, \\"This is Jim Carrey trying to show us he's a serious actor and not just a manic Ace Ventura.\\"  Kate Winslet's performance, while professionally done, pales in comparison to her work in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" and she should have gotten her oscar nomination for that film instead of this one in which she merely seems to be \\"acting.\\"  Elijah Wood looks painfully out of place in his role as the lovestricken Patrick, again like an actor who is saying \\"Don't just think of me as Frodo.\\"  Ironically, it is in the performances of Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, that the heart of this movie is evidenced.  Ruffalo is marvelous as the programming geek with the hots for an unsuspecting Dunst; Dunst, meanwhile, uses her adolescent charms gamely and does a real reversal when she finds out what's happened to her; and Wilkinson exudes a calm confidence and vulnerability as the mastermind behind Lacuna, which is the memory erasing company.  The film offers some great visual effects as Carrey's memory is being erased, but by the time the deed is done, so much posturing and padding has crippled the movie.<br /><br />I'm sure all of the afficionados of this vastly overrated film will hit their \\"No\\" buttons by now, but as always, it's not whether one agrees with the film, but if one can find something that helped them make up their own minds about this movie.

0140277447|4.0|The Japanese government normally refers to the invasion of China as  \\"China Incident.\\"   You can tell how sorry the person is by looking at the word he/she chooses to describe a bad fact. <br />I feel sorry for such a liar.  Remember, nobody has ever invited Japanese to go to China and kill Chinese. <br /> <br />Then, they always use quibbles like the A-bombs to justify their own suffering and their aggression and atrocities.   Again, this is an egocentric view of the history without considering the causality.  Who caused all these troubles?  Everybody else says Japanese.  But lots of Japanese people don't think so.  For example, Hosei Norota, a former defence chief, blames Japan's entry into World War II on the United States. \\"Faced with oil and other embargoes, Japan had no choice but to venture southward to secure natural resources,\\" the senior politician tells a meeting of supporters. \\"In other words, Japan had fallen prey to a scheme of the United States.\\"   Aha, now we can see that Pearl Habor is not impossible, it is INEVITABLE?!  <br /> <br />Is it true that an embargo will lead to a brutal war?  Clearly no. <br />Only a person feeling no sorry can use such ridiculous arguments. <br /> <br />Finally, about the so-call \\"apology\\",  Japanese government always said \\"regret\\" rather than \\"apology\\", except one time in 1998 by Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi (of Socialist Party, not the powerful Liberal Democratic Party).  A Japanese here said Japan has made apologies for 17 times.  This is a lie.   Thinking about this, \\"regret\\" for 16 times, 1-time \\"apology\\" (in lexical form) submerged in those \\"regrets\\", and then always \\"regret\\" again up to now.   The sincerity of the one-time apology is very questionable.  And now it is crystal clear that the apology was just a fake as Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has officially visited Yasukuni Shrine every year to pay respect to the 17 \\"oriental Hitlers\\" (the 17 war criminals of WWII whose pictures and names are worshippedin the Shrine).   I just cannot imagine what the reaction it will be for Jews, Polishs and Americans IF GERMAN PRIME MINISTER SHOWS OFFICIAL RESPECT TO ADOLF HITLER, HERMAN GORING AND HEINRICH HIMMLER.   I don't think Korean and Chinese people over-reacted.  On the contrary, they are too shy and too nice.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is why I loved hip-hop during \\"the Renaissance\\" era (1992-1996). There were so many talented artists and classic albums came out over that span. So many classic albums to name (\\"Reasonable Doubt\\", \\"The Diary\\", \\"Me Against the World\\", \\"Ready to Die\\", \\"Built for Cuban Linx\\", just to name a few) but \\"Illmatic\\" is an example.   <br /> <br />1. The Genesis - Intro with \\"Live at the BBQ\\" in the background. <br /> <br />2. N.Y. State of Mind - Great song to start off the album with a legendary producer, DJ Premier, to lay the track. <br /> <br />3. Life's a Bitch - Whoa! AZ ripped the track and basically outshined Nas over Gap Band \\"Yearning for your Love\\" sample. <br />  <br />4. The World is Yours - I think this is Pete Rock's best beat he ever produced, with Nas'\\"looking out my window\\" rhymes makes this song a classic. I love the video too. <br /> <br />5. Halftime - Nice old school type beat with blaring horns on the chorus. Nas doesn't back down on the track. <br /> <br />6. Memory Lane - Another hot beat from DJ Premier with Nas looking back on good and bad times. <br /> <br />7. One Love - Anther hot beat, this time from Q-Tip of ATCQ fame. Nas quotes letter to jailed Cormega. Nice chopped loop sample of \\" Smiling Billy Suite\\" Heath Brothers. ( I know this because I am a jazz fan) <br /> <br />8. One Time 4 Your Mind - Nas definitely rips the Large Professor track. Nice chopped loop with hard hitting drums. <br /> <br />9. Represent - Self-explanatory. DJ Premier does it again with a chopped loop for Nas to spit over. <br /> <br />10. It Ain't Hard to Tell - Nas at his beat over Mike Jackson's \\"Human Nature\\" sample. The video to the song is also hot. <br /> <br />If you love hip-hop and want to get away from commercialized rap, this is one of the classic albums you would want to listen to. GO COP THAT!  <br />
B0007YEKZU|4.0|The latest movie from the very talented Stephen Chow is really funny, well made and most importantly inspired and unique.  <br /> <br />A petty crook and his sidekick pretend to be from the notorious Axe Gang to extort money from a rural apartment building and accidently set into motion a stand off between the gang and the residents of the building. I really don't want to give away any more of the plot because not knowing what the movie is about makes the experience more enjoyable.  <br /> <br />This movie has great CG and a highly stylish look. The acting  from the landlady, landlord, Sing and his sidekick are very good with the landlady stealing almost all her scenes. The soundtrack is very good as well. <br /> <br />As an English and Cantonese speaker I can say with some confidence that the subtitles are the best that I've seen, capturing the right meaning and tone. I've been a fan of Stephen Chow ever since I was very young and he still has me rolling now at 21 because he knows what's funny. This movie gives you a little bit of everything action, laughs, drama and love. It's worth watching because you have never seen anything like this but most of all because it's good.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|This film is OK, but it lacks story, yet the Pearl Harbor is intense and very well done, yet most of the action was computer generated. And the Director's Cut version of that battle scene is different from the theatrical release version of that scene.  <br /> <br />-Instead of whole soldiers being blasted out of sand bag barricades-  you see blood, limbs, and other body parts flying out of those same sand bag barricades. <br /> <br />-During the movie's many strafing scenes, you now see huge chunks of meat and other body parts go flying from the falling people. And the shot of the two nurses ducking down by the fountain, you can now see a man's entire body getting <br />severed by the 20mm guns of the strafing Zeros.  <br /> <br />-There are now several new scenes in Battleship Row of sailors on fire, getting shot, and being brutally dismembered by shrapnel. This also inculdes a really graphic shot of a severed head. <br /> <br />-The scene with Miller and Capt. Bennion now has shots of Bennion holding his intestines in his hands and Miller trying to put them back in his body.  <br /> <br />-The hospital scenes now have graphic shots of battlefield surgery and amputations, as well as close ups of severed limbs laying on the floor. <br /> <br />According to imdb.com, there are more changes in this Director's Cut, but I haven't found them yet. The Theatrical Version runs 3 hours, 3 minutes and is rated PG-13, and the much more gory Director's Cut runs a minute longer and is rated R. <br /> <br />Film Rating (Both Versions) 5/10

006092988X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. It is the book I most often turn to when I'm feeling down, and it has never failed to lift my spirits. Francie Nolan is an unforgettable character that will stay with you long after you've read the book.
B00005JNRB|4.0|This adaptation of Clive Cussler's novel is quite interesting and entertaining. Right away you'll notice Clive's interest in antique cars, and of course his trademark knack for the marine life. To the movie itself it demonstrates excellent motion picture photography, meaning the camera crew was doing an excellent job with excitingly unique shots. Most of it plays in Africa - Sahara - duh ... A lot of action with comedic lines by Steve Zahn's character, but a rather unbelievable storyline which might not be the important issue in this flick. As one of the only - if not the only - female characters in this motion picture, Penelope Cruz doesn't really have a role and her role seems forced. Matt is doing alright as the hero Dirk Pitt trying to launch a career as an action star - and maybe it works ... I'm sure he had fun after he apparently went through a rigorous body workout program to put on some muscle -- and it shows. <br />Why do I give this movie 4 stars? First of all I think this movie should get a PG rating instead of the PG-13 as there's no bad language and no sensual situations -- it's actually a very clean movie ... and this is refreshing and a reminder that Hollywood can produce a fun-filled action movie without foul language and without the usual stupid half-naked babe scenes. I think the concept was executed very well and it has been a while since a nice powerboat like a Donzi or SeaRay has been extensively featured and trashed in a movie and in this flick you get the pleasure of such action. It's well worth watching this movie and my wife said that this is one for our DVD collection whenever it's released on DVD in several months or so. I would say it's a cool motion picture adventure for the whole family, but also noting that a film like this is probably not everybody's cup of tea.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am not a big fan of huge stars, or media mogules, but I've been a fan of Green Day forever, since I was like 6 or 7. This cd is as awesome as International superhits, as all of their music. Buy this now, no regrets, love.
B0007YVBFC|5.0|\\"Mimi's Emancipation/A Cause for Celebration!!\\" This has to be MC's best album in a long time. This disc is a top notch collection of R&B/Pop that will definitley put Mariah back on top of the charts. Her voice is back in top form along with A-List producers such as Kanye, Pharrell and of course JD. Some of the highlights include; <br />\\"We Belong Together\\" which produced by JD, takes you back to what we all love her for - those heartfelt ballads. Definitely watch out for this single. It's gonna explode!!  <br />\\"Stay The Night\\" is a true vocal performance track. Mariah really belts it out towards the end of the Kanye produced number.  <br />\\"Get Your Number\\" features Mariah's trademark R&B crooning. With JD killin' the chorus, this track will definitely heat up the clubs.  <br />\\"Circles\\" which feature all live musicians gives you an old-skool 70's soul diva vibe. Has all the glass-shattering vocals without being over-produced. <br />The end result is definitely a much more confident Mariah. You've been waiting a while for a disc like this - Your wait is over. Get \\"Emancipated\\" April 12th!!

B000069AT7|5.0|This is one movie that will always remain close to my heart. I remember my mother taking me to see it when I was very small. I think it taught many of us the value of friendship and love no matter how different we all may be. Even after all these years this masterpiece still magages to get me all choked up.    <br />    I recieved this gift set for Christmas a few years ago, and I love it!  Not only does it include a great print of the original version, but it includes the 2002 version, the soundtrack, a behind the scenes dvd, and a book. I watched the 2002 version out of curiousity, and thought it wasn't anything too special. Its the original 1982 version of the film that I fell in love with as a child, and its my preferred version. Props to Steven Spielberg for giving us the chance to get the original with the updated film! If only George Lucas could have done the same with the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy...*sigh* <br />Sadly, this gift set is no longer in production, but I'm sure you can find it in some stores yet. <br />     Anyways, its great to have this film in my personal library to enjoy over and over again. When she's a bit older, I look forward to introducing my daughter to this magic film that captivated me as a child.
B000003TA4|1.0|This could be one of the worst CDs ever released.  Everybody thinks it was hair metal, but it was really trashy grunge bands like Nirvana who created the worst music of the 80s and 90s.  I have heard dozens of 80s/90s hair metal bands, but NONE of them even come close to being as phenominally bad as Nirvana.  Nirvana was so HORRIBLE!  I can still remember that awful day back in 1992 when I was first exposed to the abomination known as Nirvana.  I tuned in to my local contempory radio station, and then I heard that horrible filth entitled \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" coming out of the speakers.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing!  I mean I had put up with noise pollution before (heavy traffic, construction zones, etc), but this was just too much to bear!  At this point, I didn't know what this crap was called until I saw the equally horrible video.  I could feel my blood pressure skyrocketing at the sight of that garbage. <br /> <br />Its been a long time since I first heard the world's worst band, but I have still NEVER, EVER heard ANY band even remotely as bad as Nirvana.  That teen pop boom in the late 90s looks like the most brilliant music ever recorded compared to all those awful grunge bands of the 80s and early 90s.  Even New Kids on the Block, MC Hammer, and Vanilla Ice look brilliant compared to Nirvana.  Now, I'm not sure how much of a compliment that is, since even a rusty chainsaw going at full speed sounds better than Nirvana, but I am quite sure that Nirvana were the most talentless hacks that ever lived.  Nirvana sucks.  They suck.  Nirvana.   $hittiest band there has EVER been.
0553213105|5.0|If you haven't read the book Pride and Prejudice, it is one I would quickly recommend. I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.<br /><br />For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.<br /><br />A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.<br /><br />If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does!

6300183513|5.0|This terrific thriller from Alfred Hitchcock about our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism starring Jimmy Stewart and  the lovely Grace Kelly is one of his most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character driven film and the suspense builds slowly to a fever pitch, a bonafide grab the edge of your seat nail biter. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.<br /><br />Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer laid up in a cast due to an accident while on assignment and Grace Kelly is his doting girlfriend. We should all be so lucky. But Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his situation but about his relationship with Lisa (Kelly), whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella  (Thelma Ritter) makes for great entertainment as Jeff is bored and begins watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera.<br /><br />Jeff becomes involved in their lives like he is watching a daily soap opera, much to the disapproval of Lisa. He takes to heart their loneliness and finds pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff begins to piece together what he has seen in one apartment and fears he may be spying on a killer. Both Lisa and his cop pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning.<br /><br />His own disbelief and Lisa's early scorn turns into an obsession that becomes evermore dangerous for all of them as Lisa begins to believe him and becomes his legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife may believe Jeff has seen too much, putting all their lives in danger. Hitchcock uses his own lens to show the voyeuristic climate Jeff has become comfortable with dangerously changing to a one on one confrontation.<br /><br />This is wonderful entertainment. It moves deftly from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, graduating to heart pounding suspense. This is a teriffic and enjoyable film and one of Hitchcock's best. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart. Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable.<br /><br />But it is Jimmy Stewart who hits this one out of the park to dead center. He gives one of his finest performances, conveying the irritation of being in a cast and the emotional helplessness when he may not be able to escape the consequences of his own voyeurism because of it. You'll watch this one many times over. A great film to pop in the vcr late on a rainy night. Don't miss it.cock uses his own lens to show the voyeuristic climate Jeff has become comfortable with dangerously changing to a one on one confrontation.     This is wonderful entertainment.

B000002MFN|4.0|Either you love her, or you hate her. Madonna is arguably one of the greatest entertainers/singers ever. One quality that I like the most about Madonna (besides her music) is her ability to stir up controversy and push people's buttons. EROTICA is just another way that she did just that, and oh how she did it so wonderfully with this album! EROTICA is not as bad as many critics made it out to be. In fact, some critics did not slam the cd (Rolling Stone even gave EROTICA a 4-star review). I think people were tired of the oversaturation of Madonna's sexcapades at the time of EROTICA'S release, and that is why the album got so much negative publicity. (Along with EROTICA, Madonna was in the awful movie BODY OF EVIDENCE, and of course her infamous SEX book had also hit the shelves). Ironically, though, EROTICA is not as sexual as many people might think.  <br /> <br />EROTICA is actually moody, deep, dark, sensual, and melodic. Through this album, Madonna confronts many taboo topics and mature themes. EROTICA leaves Madonna being more daring than she did with LIKE A PRAYER and JUSTIFY MY LOVE. This record is intended for open-minded listeners ready to hear Madonna's boldness on every track. Here is how I feel about each song: <br /> <br />Erotica - Great start to the album, as it sets the mood for the rest of the CD - dominatrix style. This song is almost haunting with Madonna's deep voice gliding over the thumping beats. <br /> <br />Fever - A sexy dance track. It's good, but it's not one of my favorites on the record. <br /> <br />Bye Bye Baby - A sassy song - Madonna sings about a lover gone wrong. <br /> <br />Deeper and Deeper - One of my favorite all-time Madonna songs. Deeper and Deeper has a fun disco-dancing feel to it. The song's hook is also very catchy! <br /> <br />Where Life Begins - This, along with the song Erotica, are the only real sexual songs on the entire Erotica CD. Where Life Begins is a very sensual tune - the lyrics are all a metaphor for oral sex. <br /> <br />Bad Girl - a moody and emotional ballad <br /> <br />Waiting - the best song on the \\"Erotica\\" cd. Everything about this track is brilliant in my opinion. The horns echoing behind Madonna's sultry voice are a beautiful touch. I also like the jazzy feel when the piano comes in on certain parts of the song. The lyrics are deep, cold, and calculating - listen to what Madonna says at the end of the song - it's awesome. <br /> <br />Thief of Hearts - Another sassy song where Madonna sings to all the home-wrecking, backstabbing girls that try to steal other people's boyfriends. <br /> <br />Words - Words is a calm track. The beat is nice. <br /> <br />Rain - One of Madonna's great ballads. This really is a beautiful song.  <br /> <br />Why It's So Hard - Interesting song - Lyrically, it teaches a valuable lesson to all who listen. <br /> <br />In This Life - one of the most touching songs on the album. Madonna sings about a friend she lost to AIDS. The track also promotes accepting people regardless of their sexuality. One of the lyrics is....\\"shouldn't matter who you choose to love.\\" <br /> <br />Did You Do It? - simply weird - I am still trying to figure out what Madonna is trying to say through this song. It's mysterious, and a nice way to conclude the album.  <br /> <br />I really think that people who judge EROTICA by its cover are missing out. Overall, EROTICA is my second favorite Madonna album behind RAY OF LIGHT.
B000000993|5.0|This is a classic alternative metal release. Tool knows how to make such dark, blistering music that drowns posers in their own blood. It's just that sick. \\"Sober\\" has one of the best bass lines you have ever heard, and the guitars will send you into a world of darkness. Tool delivers into your soul and boils your blood. \\"Prison Sex\\" is another grand track from the masters of dark alternative music. \\"Intolerance\\" makes you get on your knees and beg. Every track is dark, brutal and creepy. Tool is just that good. Their new material may be a tad bit overplayed, but they know how to play some good music. Believe me.
B000002B30|3.0|I am of two minds about Bruce's \\"Greatest His,\\" as I usally am about any artist I am a die hard fan of when it comes time to release a \\"hits\\" compilation.  They never give you everything they should and often miss some personal favorites.  This is a fact of life.  But when you look at compilations from other artists of Springsteen's caliber and duration (25 years and 11 or so albums, at this point) like Billy Joel, John Mellencamp, Aerosmith, The Stones, etc (the former 3 share the same record label with Bruce), even if they miss some stuff, you can't accuse them of being skimpy.  Even though all these artists - and many more - have over the years released various incarnations of hits albums, the first efforts were at least career spanning and true to their title in a technical and otherwise fashion. But those behind this Springsteen release have delivered a single disc of material that ignores his first two albums and is skimpy on material from all the others.    This is something of an atrocity seeing as how much Bruce means to so many.  If you are a die hard fan, the head-slapping omissions are enough to drive you crazy with disbelief.  How can any Bruce \\"hits\\" album leave out \\"Spirit In the Night,\\" \\"Jungleland,\\" \\"Rosalita,\\" \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,\\" \\"The Promissed Land,\\" \\"Out In the Street,\\" \\"Cadillac Ranch,\\" \\"I'm On Fire,\\" \\"Cover Me,\\" \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"Lucky Town?\\"  No matter what you think of \\"Pink Cadillac,\\" it was a single, a hit and homeless (at least until '99's \\"Tracks,\\" but you'd think someone would have thought to include it here since this collection seems to exist if for no other reason than to be hit-heavy).  And how about some live or rare tracks (\\"Red Headed Woman,\\" \\"Fire,\\" \\"Becasue the Night...\\").  And that's just the stuff that people would know from the radio and, from a technical asspect, are \\"hit\\" enough to deserve a place here.      If you really want to get into what true fans would put on here there may not be enough room on even 3 cds, but most would agree \\"Growin' Up,\\" \\"Kitty's Back,\\" \\"Backstreets,\\" \\"Prove It All Night,\\" \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town,\\" \\"Adam Raised A Cain,\\" and \\"Racing In the Streets\\" should be on any Boss compilation among the others mentioned.  Had they gone the extra mile and made this collection 2 discs, they may have been alble to represent all of these titles here, or close, and make a lot of people happy.  Wouldn't that be great?!?!?  (They had a second chance at this with '03's \\"Essential...,\\" and although that is a far better effort - at least it gives us 2 discs of hits, it still has some head-slapping exclusions.)    To be accurate this set should be titled \\"Chart Hits\\" or \\"Accurately Sequenced Singles Collection.\\"  Anything with the word \\"greatest\\" pertaining to Sprtingsteen's large song catelog should include all the aforementioned songs.  Or at least far more titles than are represented here.    The flip side to this argument, however (though it is not one that I personaly support as either a fan or consumer), is the technical aspect of aranging this album.  The sad truth is Bruce's actual chart hits are limited.  Even though his true fans love all the songs I mentioned, and many more, the casual listeners, for whom this collection was obviously intended, have never even heard of them (even if they have at some point heard them on the radio).  This cd seems to be largely geared towards that crowd.    And I'll confess, I was about 16 when this album was released and I bought it without knowing much more than these songs from the Boss (although I still knew plenty were not represented, even as a non-die hard fan, I remeber hearing more Bruce than this on the radio).  It did the job for awhile.  And I credit it somewhat with making me seek out individual Bruce albums, thereby discovering so much more than I ever though I could in Springsteen's music.    I also understand that, when around people who are not as familiar with Bruce - because he is an artist that you either relate to  something in his voice or lyrics right off the bat or he has to grow on you, this is a perfect album to play.  Most will know - and like - every song.  Again, that doesn't make me happy to say - I want as many people as possible to hear all the great songs they are missing out on - but it is an unfortunate truism.  Not everyone is a huge Springsteen fan.    And finally, to the album's credit, it has a few new songs, and they are actually pretty good.  Also included is \\"Murder Incorporated,\\" a shelved cut from \\"Born In the USA,\\" but one Bruce often plays live and has been requested by fans for a long time.  It's nice to finaly have it included on an album, especially one on which it will get the attention it deserves.(Wouldn't it be nice if that same consideration was given to at least some of the other rejected titles I mentioned?)      Of the new tracks, all of which range from slow, albiet one very romantic (\\"Secret Garden\\") to moderately paced variations on familiar themes (\\"This Hard Land\\" - which has a great last verse and a quality about it that grows on you), \\"Blood Brothers\\" is the most fetching, if only bacause it is so obviously a metephor for a reunited and reinvigorated E Street Band.  It's nice hear the love and respect they still have for one another paid tribute to; and it's great to hear some new tunes with the whole team involved as opposed to the rotating cast of different musicians Bruce had been using for the previous decade(this reunion would apex with two major highlights:  their wonderous reunion tour and Bruce's best album in almost a decade, \\"The Rising\\" - which was followed by it's own equally wonderous tour).  Just for getting the boys back together this CD gets mad props.    I rarely listen to this instead of actual albums or my own compilations; and if you have to go the greatest hits route with Springsteen '03s \\"Essenial...\\" is a much better bet, although it still misses some major stuff.  Are these greatest hit compilations merely a marketing ploy to give us taste of something and get us hooked so we pony-up for the full albums albums?  Probably.  But its no ploy if it gets people into Springsteen enough to branch out into other albums the way I did.  That is a gift that far exceeds any one greatest hits album's worth.
B0007CNXUU|3.0|This film had all the potential in the world but it just barely made it to very good.  The good points: Great story, Kate Winslet (she always surprises me), the boys who played the brothers (especially Peter), Julie Christie, lovely sets/costumes. The bad points: shmaltzy, overblown music, the director's need to \\"Hollywoodize\\" the whole beat of the film, the sentimentality of the script. Neutral point: Johnny Depp (I always want something more from him but he only barely delivers.) This film is worth seeing especially if you like tear jerkers but it could have been so much more.Too bad.
B0002858YS|1.0|I love The Killers. They're like, the best indie band ever, next to Coldplay! They have a totally original sound and their lead singer is really hot. I saw them one night when I was watching The O.C. and I bought their CD (along with Bright Eyes and Death Cab For Cutie) and I love it. it looks great in my collection, next to my \\"Garden State\\" DVD.<br /><br />Someone told me about this band called \\"New Order\\" or something, and they said they sounded like The Killers. I listened to some of their songs, and I couldn't believe it. These guys are a total rip-off of The Killers! How dare they do something like that! That's just mean! Someone should file a lawsuit against them or something! :-(<br /><br />And there was this other band called \\"The Pixie\\" or something like that, and other people said they were indie, so I listened to them, and I hated them! Their lead singer is a bald fat guy, and his voice is weird and freaky. And they write lyrics about stuff like incest, which makes them crazy. If they were the first indie band, they sure didn't do it right!<br /><br />THE KILLERS ROCK! SOMEBODY TOLD ME!
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Beautifully photographed and deeply philosophical, Michelangelo Antonioni's BLOW-UP is either going to bore you to tears or send you into a deep reverie on the meaning of reality and to what extent we can understand it.<br />  Unfortunately, there's no plot to speak of - David Hemmings plays a fashion photographer, an Artist and more than a bit of a cad, in swinging London of the mod `60's.  There may have been a shock effect to this one that time has robbed it of.  There's some full-frontal nudity (brief), a rather casual treatment of casual sex, and pot smoking.  If it was shocking then it just seems quaint now.<br />  The Hemmings' character takes a photograph of Vanessa Redgrave and a well-dressed man in a park.  When he blows up the image he discovers something more in the image than was first apparent.<br />  For those of us more comfortable with conventional, plot driven movies this one is very, very slow going and confusing.  BLOW-UP is probably best suited for those who like to do the heavy lifting when watching movies.  Antonioni doesn't provide many answers, like, for instance, who are the mimes and what do they stand for?  What's up with the tennis game?  What's the relationship between Hemmings and the Sarah Miles characters?  Peter Brunette's thoughtful commentary is a great help in providing structure and adding context to the film. I found the movie emotionally cold and detached and difficult to care about.  An odd and dated beauty.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Gorillaz is a weird band to say the least. They use old rap beats with mixture of drums and guitar and it sounds very good when mixed all together. But lyric wise it may remind you of some punk bands out there but its still original in its own right. The reason i gave this album 4 instead of 5 is a few tracks (Mainly latin samone and left hand suziki method) Confused me as to what their purpose was. The only good thing about left hand suzuki method is at the end after a few minutes of silence theres a bonus remix to Clint Eastwood. Its the same song cept alot faster with new rap verses.
B00005JNRB|5.0|Although there have been a lenghty string of action/adventure movies in the last year or so, and they have all been worthy and entertaining, never as action-packed or fun-filled as this one. Matthew Mconaughey plays a modern-day Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell who is in search of a Civil War battleship buried in the Sahara. He is everything you'd want in an action hero. He has a wisecracking sidekick (Steve Zahn). Also helping is a doctor (Penelope Cruz). Some people say this movie is unrealistic, silly, and stupid. And some of it is. But really, who cares? It's action-packed, National Treasure-meets-The Mummy type of movie. And if that's not the greatest action/adventure ever made, I don't know what would be. Also reccomended, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, National Treasure, the Indiana Jones movies, and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow.
B000006O7C|4.0|Jeff Buckley's posthumous second album is punchier, more pop, and one could argue, less soulful than his debut Grace.  A six-plus minute anthem like \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" complete with its multiple bridges and choruses would seem out of place on this album.  So would the elongated acid rock of \\"Dream Brother\\" and the throwback jazziness of \\"Lilac Wine.\\"  The sense of improvisation, structural elasticity, and idealistic romanticism is replaced by conciseness, hooks, and pragmatism.  Jeff Buckley, the aspring chanteuse, is featured less prominently on this album than Jeff Buckley, the pop-rock singer.  This may be why Buckley felt disillusioned with the album.  It reflects a different, more presumably superficial side of his musical persona.  But in my opinion, Buckley's talent shines most purely through this personality.  Afterall, for me, the most potent song on \\"Grace\\" is by far the most outwardly conventional rock: \\"Eternal Life.\\"       <br /> <br />Sketches (For My Sweetheart the Drunk) is obviously incomplete.  It features awkward covers: \\"Yard of Blonde Girls\\" and a capella chanting: \\"You and I\\" (a failed attempt to reclaim the spiritual improvisationalism that the album clearly lacked?).  The second disc consists of several four tracked throwaways: \\"Jewel Box\\" and \\"Demon John.\\"   <br /> <br />Despite these slight unpleasantries (which are *still* interesting) that are to be expected on any incomplete album, the bulk of both discs is brilliant.  The album opens with \\"The Sky Is A Landfill,\\" an accessible rocker that captures modern political disillusionment.  The next track, \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" is a wonderful R&B number that brims with soul and yes, sexiness, all whilst maintaining a focused and down-to-earth sensibility.  \\"Opened Once\\" is a soulful and maritime reflection on love and friendship.  This is a delicate, lovely, and focused song.  The next track, the dark rock number, \\"Nightmare by the Sea\\" as well as the similar, \\"Vancouver\\" usesdisturbing poetic metaphors to convey an inescapable despair.  \\"Witches Rave\\" is Arthur Miller meets Morrissey.  <br /> <br />The second disc features more disenchantment and heartfelt reflections on relationships. \\"Haven't You Heard\\" is a rousing rock number that is meant to be shouted/sung at the top of one's lungs as Buckley sarcastically warns of \\"the virus called language.\\"  The four-tracked \\"Murder Suicide Meteor Slave\\" is a dischordant mess, but a fascinating and beautiful one.  The chorus sings \\"Welcome down to paradise rock/There is no single entrance/There are no stars to revolve around/There is no real underground\\"... the cryptic lyrics implying a loss of faith and idealism.  Meanwhile, \\"I Know We Could Be So Happy (If We Wanted To Be) another thoughtful four-tracked number considers Buckley and his former significant other as \\"two cripples dancing/till the bitter end we live.\\"   <br /> <br />Voluptuous, soulful, and amorphous, Buckley's voice sounds better than ever on these tracks.  I'm not experienced enough to discern whether or not Buckley was a great jazz singer.  But I know for a fact that he was a great pop-rock singer.  <br /> <br />Sketches (For My Sweetheart the Drunk) is a more accessible, more pop, and more pragmatic affair than the sweeping romanticism and jazzy boundlessness of Grace.  It is the work of an artist frustrated with his art, and as such reflects that frustration.  It also reveals the possibility that Buckley was unaware of just how extraordinary his talents were- in especially the more pop-rock genre.
0143034901|5.0|This book grabbed me by the eyes in Wal-Mart--the last place I would have expected to see any such, but I was captured by the time I had gotten to the bottom of the first page--and the Cemetery of Books.<br /><br />Anyone who likes mysteries will enjoy this book.  It's a matrioshka doll of a book, plots within plots within more plots, all set during and after the Spanish Civil War. Sorting it all out is wonderful and holds the reader to the last page.<br /><br />Its delights include several romantic threads, at least one horror story, and the city of Barcelona among the memorable and seductive characters we meet.  Written with a very Peninsular Spanish sensibility and translated by the late poet Robert Graves' daughter, it is a luscious read.<br /><br />My cousin, who lived in Barcelona for years, says the translator probably doesn't know Catal&aacute;n, so it is frustrating for her to read.  She and other Catal&aacute;n speakers may need to read the original.  However, the rest of us will enjoy this translation.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This film, which was shot in a scant eighteen days, is stunningly original in concept. I confess that I was totally riveted to the screen for the entire running time of the  film, as was my son. Edgy and somewhat surreal, the film clearly demonstrates that the director, James Wan,  can certainly do more with less, as the film was shot on a shoestring budget. Yet, he also knows that less is sometimes more, as he keeps the actual  amount of on screen gore to a minimum. In doing so, he forces a viewer's imagination to work overtime, which serves to create more suspense than a visual statement of the obvious.<br /><br />The plot is diabolically clever. It appears that a maniac is on the loose, placing people in fiendish situations that are truly matters of life or death, virtually ensuring that someone dies. The deaths occur in a highly unusual manner, indicative of a complex and maniacal mind at work. Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) are on the case and hot on this maniac's trail. When on the verge of his capture, however, everything goes wrong, and Detective Tapp becomes somewhat unhinged after a total debacle ensues.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr.  Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), who was himself a suspect in the case, suddenly finds himself in a filthy, ancient, cavernous bathroom, along with a young man  named Adam (Leigh Whannell). Both are chained to pipes in the wall and are disoriented and unsure as to how they got there. Between them and just beyond their reach lies an apparently dead man in a pool of blood, ostensibly killed with the gun that he still holds in his hand. Then, Dr. Gordon and Adam discover that a series of cryptic  instructions have been left for them to follow.  Each instruction clearly delineates just how precarious their position is.<br /><br />What follows is a mesmerizing cat and mouse game, replete with a number of twists and turns, that is sure to keep the viewer enthralled. This is certainly a plot driven, rather than character driven, film. Therefore, although some of the acting is not of the highest caliber, it matters not, as it is the plot, and not the individual characterizations, that are at the central core of this gripping film. Moreover, the plot is so creative and riveting, that some of its flaws become virtually insignificant in the overall scheme of things.  The screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, who also plays the part of Adam, deserves kudos for his complex and clever screenplay. He deserves less than that for his portrayal of Adam. Mr. Whannell should concentrate on screenplay writing, as it is there that his true gift lies. Notwithstanding this relatively minor criticism, I love this film!er driven, film.

1593072937|5.0|First let me say that as I write this Amazon.com is offering this outstanding graphic novel for less than $12. That's a jaw dropping deal, folks. And if you still need more convincing to part ways with your 12 bills then just read on...    One word that gets thrown around a lot with SIN CITY is the word \\"noir.\\" A lotta folks say SIN CITY is a great noir comic, but brother, let me tell ya this: SIN CITY re-defines noir. Saying SIN CITY is a noir book is like saying a Ferrari is a car--it's an understatement of the highest order. Sin City is about good guys doing bad things to bad people for good reasons.     This is volume 1 and was originally serialized in a monthly book called Dark Horse Presents back in the early 1990s. It was collected in book form and Frank Miller (writer/artist/genius) added almost 20 extra pages and put it out as SIN CITY. Later this tale of a gladiator born in the wrong century, Marv, and his quest to avenge the love of his life, a dead hooker named Goldie, got the subtitle The Hard Goodbye.    I'm sure a lot of folks are interested in the SIN CITY series of books due to the recent film co-directed by the book's creator, Frank Miller. Miller settles into what will become his signature style on the Sin City books through the course of the story and his use of black ink on white paper boggles the mind. His images are stark, bold, ingenius. The Hard Goodbye started it all. The Sin City series of books. The action figures. The film. The re-defining of a genre.    See? I told ya $12 was peanuts.

B000062YAZ|1.0|OK, the musicianship and production should be at least three stars, if not higher.  But c'mon, guys --- songs about a Nazi doctor that conducted horrible medical experiments, decapitated bodies, serial killers, slams against religion....I mean, when does it all end ?  When does conscience start playing a part ?  Would you really want your kids to know that THIS is what you listen to ?  Would the guys in this band want THEIR kids to know that this is what they sing about ?  There is plenty of intelligent metal out there --- Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Motorhead, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest -- all good stuff !  But this is garbage, and this is why metal gets slammed by soooo many people who don't take it seriously as a musical art form.  Like it or not, death metal gives heavy metal a bad name.  So take the one-star rating as a call to boycott this crap.  There's enough real violence and tragedy in the world --- listening to this only makes matters worse.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera,\\" is really worth seeing. The dvd release looks really good as the special edition contains many extra features for fans of the musical and or movie. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves \\"Phantom\\" or musicals in general, it's well worth seeing many times, The music is really great and so is the love story. It has every elemant and I think the film was really well done. It looks so beautiful on screen. I think Emmy Rossum makes a perfect Christine and her singing alone is worth seeing the movie for. Gerard Bulter and Patrick also have great voices too.  Gerard makes a really good Phantom. <br /> <br />
B0000033TE|5.0|Forget Yes' 'Fragile', King Crimson's 'In the Court of the Crimson King', Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' and Genesis' 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'.  'Brain Salad Surgery' is the finest progressive rock album ever made by the form's greatest practitioners -- ELP.  The musicianship and energy on this recording are astounding: each of the three group members is such a master at his instrument, the energy and creativity literally fly off the disc.  'Karn Evil 9', in particular, is a triumph of structure in its three movements; the 3rd impression reminds me of nothing so much as \\"The End\\" on the Beatles' 'Abbey Road' in the way it seemingly ties up an era (in this case, the early '70's progressive British Rock movement), and sounds like the dawning of a new day.  Greg Lake's voice and production are magnificent throughout.  In fact, there's absolutely NOTHING bad I can say about this album.  It is one of my very favorites in ALL forms of music, certainly ELP's finest work, and one of the great masterpieces in rock music.  Every bit as much of a classic as the Beatles' 'Abbey Road' and 'Sgt. Pepper', the Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds', the Who's 'Who's Next' and the Stones' 'Beggars Banquet'.  If I could give it ten stars, I would.
B000021Y77|5.0|Turn on your TV and buckle up for an exhilarating 80-minute ride.  From the get-go, this film literally runs and barely pauses to take a breath.  Take your eyes off the screen and you may miss a fast-paced sequence of snapshots that tells you the future of certain minor characters.  Run to the kitchen for a glass of water and you've missed an entire scene.<br /><br />But you won't want to take your eyes off this taut, fast-paced drama.  Lola has just been told that her boyfriend Manni, an aspiring drug dealer, has lost 100,000 marks on the subway.  She has 20 minutes to get together the money, or Manni will be killed by his new boss.  How?  Where? From whom? Down the steps, out the door, Lola runs, and runs.  After 20 minutes, we've seen an entire film.  But wait .  .  .  you don't like the ending?  Roll back the clock and we'll do it differently.  Still don't like it?  Give Tykwer another 20 minutes and he'll do it again.<br /><br />The point, of course, is that our lives are not entirely our own: they are shaped by minor incidents and by actions taken by other people.  (Who hasn't said something along the lines of: If she hadn't delayed me at the bank, I would have gotten to the store before it closed.  If I hadn't missed the turn-off, I wouldn't have been on that street, and that guy wouldn't have hit my car.)  Suppose you could \\"rerun the tape\\" and do it differently?  Tykwer does, and does it brilliantly. Will there be a robbery?  Will Lola get the money from her father?  Will she get it elsewhere?  Will the police come in time? Who will live or die?  Time will tell.<br /><br />One newspaper reviewer, after seeing this film, said that Tom Tykwer is the most promising German director since Rainer Fassbinder. While \\"The Princess and the Warrior\\" does not demonstrate quite the same greatness, in both films Tykwer tackles head on the issues of how marginally-related people, or being in the right place at the right time, can influence one's fate. But \\"Run, Lola, Run\\" is brilliant.  The interspersing of cartoon animations of Lola with film; the snapshot sequences; a pumped up score and a never-dull plot make this one a winner.nterspersing of cartoon animations of Lola with film; the snapshot sequences; a pumped up score and a never-dull plot make this one a winner.
078681859X|4.0|Although labeled as YA, the \\"adults\\" among us who love fantasy will also enjoy this book.  Told in first person by Bartimaeus and third person by Nathaniel, it's wonderfully done.  Bartimaeus, being 5,000 years old, is sharp, sarcastic, funny and engaging, while Nathaniel really reads as the lesser character who is certainly no Harry Potter, so it will be interesting to see how the series develops.  But, if you are looking for a break from mysteries, this is a delightful interlude.
B000021XR5|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots simply dominated MTV and radio throughout the first half of the 90s. Although their debut album \\"Core\\" (1992) borrowed some ideas from the Seattle scene, the band eventually found its own sound with \\"Purple,\\" (1994) and \\"Tiny Music\\" (1996). They were one of rocks most popular, promising bands.<br /><br />But all was not well within the band. Although STP never broke up, they took an extended break during the second half of the 90s. Dean and Robert DeLeo (Guitar, Bass, receptively) and drummer Eric Kretz formed the band Talk Show with singer David Coutts and released a self-titled album in 1997. Scott Weiland released his eclectic solo album the following year. Despite the quality of these outings, both sold poorly.<br /><br />In 1999, when STP released their first album in three years, much had changed. The glory days of Grunge when \\"Core\\" and \\"Purple\\" were released were long since gone. Even the days of post-grunge when \\"Tiny Music\\" enjoyed its success were over. A new breed of bands and styles dominated MTV and rock radio. In the late 90s, early '00s, Nu-Metal was all the rage. Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains were all gone. Bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Kid Rock had dethroned bands like Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots.<br /><br />How well would Stone Temple Pilots fare in 1999, in this sea of Nu-Metal drudgery? Most ivory tower music snobs predicted in '92/93, that STP's popularity would burn out as soon as the grunge era came to pass. But STP would soon prove all their detractors wrong by releasing their superb, amply titled fourth album \\"No4.\\"<br /><br />For me, \\"No4\\" is actually a mix of STP's previous three albums. It has the heaviness of \\"Core,\\" and \\"Purple\\" and the retro-glam psychedelic tripiness of \\"Tiny Music.\\" In the heavy openers \\"Down,\\" and \\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\" we hear the Weiland from the days of yore, with his signature baritone growl that had been noticeably absent from \\"Tiny Music.\\" These heavy openers are like STP telling the new younger Nu-Metal bands that they are back and hungry. While these songs don't really sound as though they could have been on \\"Core,\\" they sound like a natural progression from that album. Some of the other songs on \\"No4,\\" however, sound more in the vein of \\"Tiny Music,\\" like the 60s sounding \\"Church on Tuesday\\" and \\"I Got You,\\" and the radio friendly \\"Sour Girl.\\" The paranoid trippy \\"No Way Out\\" sounds like a hybrid, mixing the heaviness of \\"Core\\" with the reto-glam aesthetics of \\"Tiny Music.\\"<br /><br />\\"No4\\" has a nice flow that never gets boring or looses momentum. This album contains some of the bands' finest songs, like the heavy \\"Down,\\" \\"Heaven & Hot Rods, \\"No Way Out\\" as well as the lush pop-savvy \\"Sour Girl.\\" And while some songs are better than others, the entire disc is quite enjoyable. There isn't any filler. STP has always been an eclectic band, and \\"No4\\" shows STP mixing different tones and styles at their best. Dean DeLeo's riffs and solos are as catchy and memorable as always throughout the disc.<br /><br />As some have pointed out, the production is a bit murky. STP's three previous albums, as well as their swan song \\"Shangri-LA DEE DA (2001)\\" all have a very crisp, polished sound. By comparison, \\"No4\\" sounds rawer, almost like a demo. By I don't look at that as a negative. It actually gives the album a certain charm.

The movie was just fine without him. <br />Moreover, Billy's father and more so his brother Tony, were extremely rude to his teacher when a simple \\"no thanks\\" would suffice.

B000003TA4|5.0|The truth about this album whether you loved it or hated it is that it will always be remembered. This was a time when mainstream made a pivotal shift toward grunge and alternative rock.  I personally don't believe Nirvana was the best band at the time given Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains, nor do I think Nevermind was the best album at the time.  I do consider this to be Nirvana's best work though and the only Nirvana album (aside from Unplugged) that really appealed to me.  To be concise the songs on Nevermind rocked out (and still do) and it's the reason why so many of them are considered classic grunge songs.  The success of this album is furthered exemplified by its volume of sales and overwhelming popularity back in the early 90s.  Definitely worth a listen if you enjoyed that era of music.
0316172324|1.0|It amazes me what makes a bestseller.  With enough marketing dollars and big name, this book was predetermined a bestseller even before it hit the bookshelves.

Without the hype, this would not even catch the eye of the public.  Poorly written, nothing original on business.  Skip this thin book and get a better business book.

The Illusion albums provided some of the greatest G N' R music featuring classics like Don't Cry, November Rain, Civil War, Estranged, and You Could Be Mine.  The albums highlighted Slash's unbelievable and underappreciated talent but yet seemed marred by the inconsistency of Axl's songwriting.  This is something I don't understand about the Illusion albums.  They feature some of the most brilliant songs such as November Rain, Civil War, and Estranged.  At the same time they feature way too many incomplete or just plain poor arrangements like Bad Obsession, You Ain't the First, Back off Bitch, Breakdown, and Get In the Ring.  I am disappointed because these albums had a lot of potential that wasn't quite realized.  Though I would definitely say that the handful of classics from the Illusion albums are among some of the best in rock music.
B00005JNRB|3.0|\\"Sahara\\" feels like a combination of \\"National Treasure\\" and \\"Hidalgo\\". It is a pretty decent film that will be well worth renting once it hits DVD, but I would pass seeing this one in theaters. The acting is good for the most part and the $130 million dollar budget was spent on some good special effects and stunts. I don't regret spending $7.00 on this movie, but it is really nothing memorable.
B000005IU1|5.0|They are never reconized for it, but The Stooges were really the first punk band, no, not The Pistols, The Ramones, or The Damned, but The Stooges. This came out in 69 were as most of the early punk came out around 77. This album, IS raw power (another good Stooges album), this cd has great songs like No Fun (Pistols did a great cover of this) and I want to be your dog... If you want to have the true roots of punk, get this.
076790592X|4.0|After reading this book you'll want a Morrie in your life, if you don't already have one. And If you do have one, you'll cherish him or her even more.<br /><br />Tuesday's with Morrie is a true \\"eye-opener\\". It definitely makes you think but a lot of books may make you think. The difference between this book and most \\"thinking\\" books is that this book will make you want to talk too. You'll find yourself stopping sometimes just to chat with someone about the subject you were just reading about. You may even make your own list of subjects that you want to discuss with someone older and wiser, or maybe even your age. I loved the fact that even though it was a sad ending, it wasn't the sad ending you usually read about. It'll make you want to let go one of those happy cries.<br /><br />Read it. Read it to your children. Read it to your mother or father. Read it to someone special to you. You'll both enjoy it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I don't give 5-star ratings lightly, it takes a lot to impress me that much, but The Arcade Fire has risen to the challenge. With an eclectic melting pot of genres -- ranging from traditional folk to punk -- Funeral is a remarkable debut album, indeed. <br />I don't have all day and neither do you, so I'm only going to cover the first five songs. <br />The album starts with the Talking Heads-esque \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels),\\" the story of a child's idealistic view of love apart from civilization. \\"And since there's no one else around//we let our hair grow long //and forget all we used to know//then our skin gets thicker //from living out in the snow.\\" As powerful an album opener as I've ever heard, it tells you right away what you're in for. <br />Next up is the second part of the Neighborhood quartet, \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika),\\" a tale of a troubled older brother named Alexander (as in The Great) who the narrator believes should have been named Laika (as in the first dog sent into space by Russia, which had no intention of retrieving him). \\"When daddy comes home you always start a fight//so the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights.\\" The story echoes the fate of Russia's doomed canine, with troubled Alexander's exit from the scene.  <br />\\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" (or \\"One year without light,\\" for those of us who didn't take high school French), skips between English and French in the story of a love affair not approved by the girl's father. Not the strongest track on the record, but an effective bridge between the first and second halves of the neighborhood series, the album's heart. <br />\\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" might be my favorite song on the record. It picks up the pace with a sudden attack beat meant to pull you right out of the smooth lull of the preceding track. If \\"Neighborhood #1\\" is childish idealism, and \\"Neighborhood #2\\" is the pre-teen realization that the world isn't as perfect as it seems, than \\"Neighborhood #3\\" is the angry teenage fallout of that realization. Singer Win Butler takes you through the painful stages of disenchantment with the faux-perfection of suburban life. \\"Ice has covered up my parents hands //don't have any dreams don't have any plans.\\" \\"Is it a dream? Is it a lie?//I think I'll let you decide. //Just light a candle for the kids//Jesus Christ, don't keep it hid!\\" This song is about as close to a rocker as the album gets, and is definitely the song to crank the volume to. <br />\\"Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)\\" is where the narrator -- and the album -- grows up. Out of adolescence, our protagonist waxes slowly and quietly on the monotony of waiting for life to happen. \\"They say a watched pot won't ever boil//well I closed my eyes and nothing changed//just some water, getting hotter -- in the flames.\\" \\"It's not a lover I want no more//and it's not heaven I'm pining for//but there's some spirit I used to know//that's been drowned out by the radio.\\" It's gut-wrenching in its honesty, and painful in its message. <br />I've been long-winded enough. For the rest, you'll have to buy the CD!
1400032717|5.0|This book is humorous, touching and insightful. I was deeply moved with the author's understanding and respect for the main character, Christopher, as well as his ability to show people how they are without adding judgement. This book echoed Christopher's perception of his world, to see things as they are at face value without adding our labels or judgement. Mark Haddon is brilliant!
B0007OCG56|1.0|Hard to believe this dreadful sitcom comes to us from James L. Brooks, who gave us the brilliant \\"As Good As It Gets.\\" Brooks is in full pander mode as he regugitates all the hackneyed stereotypes about whites and Latinos: The hysterical stay at home suburban mom who is utterly clueless when it comes to her family until the noble Mexican maid comes along to inject humanity and compassion back into their lives. Yawn.      Equally overwrought is the usual boo-hoo-hoo maudlin moments that lesser writers trot out as emotional crescendos, but here they are unsentimental and stupid. And what a fabulous message: it's better for the maid's daughter to become a maid like her mom and throw away a private school scholarship in order to \\"be true to her roots.\\" I thought people come to this country to form a better life for themselves and their families. Why would the maid NOT want her daughter to have the best education she could? Great message, James.       And Adam Sandler? Alas, his best role is still \\"Punch Drunk Love.\\" He comes across here as a semi-retarded Emeril Lagasse who can barely relate to anyone in an adult manner. Tea Leoni spends the movie sobbing and feeling sorry for herself, making you want to reach through the television and strangle her. Her costant shrieks of \\"Left!\\" as she passes joggers on her hourly run are funny only the first hundred times we hear it. She is truly one of the most annoying actresses in recent memory. Cloris Leachman is amusing as the drunk mother with a heart of Jose Cuervo Gold, and the  kids are cardboard cut-outs. The youngest child in this movie, Georgie  barely exists. I think he's in two scenes. At a whopping 130 minute running time, that counts more as a cameo.    Highly UNrecommended.
B000002JAX|4.0|With the release of Madeline Peyroux's 2004 CD on Rounder, it may be time for a glance back at her first release from 1996 on Atlantic.  Critically acclaimed, taking 8 years for a follow-up has allowed this disc to sink from view.  The arrangements are sparse but serve to highlight Peyroux's unique voice.  On \\"La Vie en Rosa,\\" the lyric is sung in French, and Peyroux sounds like a yearning Edith Piaf.  Born in Athens, Georgia, she spent time living in Paris and seems quite at home in this musical setting.  \\"Always A Use\\" is one of her originals that shows her as an expressive vocalist, \\"Maybe ain't no use in singing my blues, but there's always a use in you & me.\\"  \\"Muddy Water\\" has a shuffle beat with Peyroux's lazy vocal singing about life on the delta.  \\"Was I?\\" is a delightful track Kenny Wollison's lively percussion giving bounce and Peyroux's vocals lifting from there, \\"Was I drunk? Was he handsome?  And did mama give me hell!\\"  One of Madeleine's idols Bessie Smith penned 2 tracks that conclude the set with the teasing \\"Reckless Blues\\" that sports lively Cyrus Chestnut piano & \\"Lovesick Blues,\\" \\"My sweetie went away, but he didn't say where, didn't say when & didn't say why.\\"  The set opens with Patsy Cline's big hit \\"Walkin' After Midnight\\" with Madeleine's loping arrangement.  Peyroux's voice is often compared to Billie Holiday & nowhere can it be more easily seen that on Holiday's \\"(Getting Some) Fun Out of Life.\\"  \\"Dreamland\\" is an excellent set that shows great promise from this fine singer.  Enjoy!
B00005JNTV|1.0|I'm absolutely stunned at the rave reviews this absurdity has recieved. This movie was comedic where it tried to be serious, it was inexplicable when it should have been realistic, and it was above all irritating to watch. Everyone I was with came to that same consensus. And don't think I'm some thirty-five-year-old uncultured religious fundamentalist whining about violence and sex in movies. I'm a fifteen-year-old guy who went to the movie with other fifteen and sixteen year old guys.  <br /> <br /> First, the good. If all you care about in a movie is hot women, you've got it covered. The style that the movie was shot in was also quite entertaining. It was certainly a feast for the eyes, which makes me wonder if the critics are that easily swayed by a new idea to give a movie a shining review. If it weren't for the splashes of brilliant color in between all the grey, would the critics have thought it was such a great, groundbreaking movie? No. They would have said it was inexplicable and humorous, such as I. Now let me move on to the truly awful: <br /> <br /> Can someone please explain to me why after the main character in the middle segment got ran over by a car twice, shot with a gun over and over and over again, and punched out, he can still get back up and walk around shooting people. No, not just shooting people-killing them instantly with one shot! Does anyone else see the inconsistency here? Also, was it truly necessary to have an incapacitated head start speaking in the middle of a serious action sequence? Was that meant to be a joke? I couldn't tell.  <br /> <br /> Furthermore, isn't the \\"hookers run this city and have a pact with the police\\" thing a little cliche and played out? Also, the pulling off of penises made me want to gag. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrendous, but what else should you expect from Brittany Murphy, Taryn Manning and Jessica Alba? Even Bruce Willis, a favorite of mine, disappointed (For a good new Bruce flick, catch \\"Hostage\\").<br /> <br /> Without it's stylized directing and visuals, it would be dubbed a piece of crap by the critics and by audiences alike. <br /> <br /> But, you could still go for a good laugh, I guess. <br /> <br /> Grade: D- <br /> Cliche-filled cheese.
B0006399FS|1.0|I DO NOT like this CD.  True, I don't like most of what U2 has done, but c'mon, enough is enough.  For those who think that U2 are good just because they sell millions of records and sell out their shows, so does Brittany Spears.  Are you fans of her work also?  <br /> <br />I also agree with the reviewer that says there seem to be people giving unhelpful votes to everyone who gives this a high mark.  Well, I gave some of them helpful reviews because they said whatthey like about the CD and have other reviews.  I know what they like and since I don't like any of it, I can safely say I have different taste in music. <br /> <br />I like music that is COMPLETELY not mainstream or is a lot more aggressive than U2.  SOme of my favorites have been on MTV alot, but have a completely different sound than U2, such as Rollins Band or Ministry(not With Sympathy though).  SO if you like harder edged music, stay away from U2.  If not, you may like it.   I just don't. <br /> <br />Thank you for reading.
B000066F6H|3.0|When I saw this band play live on the MTV music awards their first hit single \\"Hate to say I told you so\\" I was blown away. I thought to myself that maybe this was my new favorite band. The lead singer was hot and energetic, he belted out the song like nothing else. After buying this CD and giving it one good listen, I have to say that I was terribly dissappointed. I have never listened to the whole CD since, I actually have no idea where it even is at this point. Some songs were great, like \\"hate to say i told you so\\" and \\"main offender\\" but everything else couldn't hold my attention. I think this band has great potential, but maybe they were too worried about getting a hit single and not making a great album. I defintely would not reccomend buying this album, if you want their music download a couple of their hit songs and call it good. Spare the whatever dollars and buy yourself an ice cream cone instead!
B00007BKVC|5.0|One can say that the story is sad, but if you look at it another way and that way being they had their adventure, were there for each other and expressed loyalty and love that hardly any real friendship is these days, then it isn't sad. They chose to die at the end, but they died together - happy.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This CD was and remains one of the best mellow rock CDs I have ever purchased. This is one of the only CDS where I can honestly say I don't have to skip a single song on this album, I enjoy every one. This is a great CD to put in your headphones and just lay back and listen.
6304806434|1.0|If you are a child, you might enjoy this film. But for us movie fans, who have intelligence, you can't fool us with this absurd tale about a bunch of convicts joining together, working together like friends, \\"if you're bad like me, you're cool.\\" Pleeeeze. In the real world, they'd all kill each other once the cops were out of the picture. It's a stereotype to say that all bad people stick together. This movie was absurd, corny, ridiculous, unrealistic, and it's a shame a great actor like john malkovich agreed to it.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|(HERES A LITTLE KNOWN FACT)    As some of you may (or may not) know, this album was ORIGINALLY released as a 15 track album, that contained the 2 tracks, Frail Limb Nursery and Purity, as tracks 8 and 9. They were then almost immediately erased from the cd, after it was re-issued only a short time later, without those tracks on it, and those tracks being replaced with the track Me Inside.    The reason that those two tracks were erased from the cd, and the cd was re-issued was because of the meaning of the song Purity, and the sound clips used in Frail Limb Nursery. The song (Purity) was based on a fabricated murder story, about a girl named Purity Knight who was (confirmed FALSELY) abducted, burried alive in a body sized box, and soon after, died within that very box.    The clips in Frail Limb Nursery are of Purity telling a story to a boy she talked to in order to obtain food while burried, that Slipknot borrowed from Crimescene.com whom are the ones whom made up the Purity Knight story.    If those tracks weren't removed from the cd, Corey and Slipknot would've been looking at major copyright infringement lawsuits from CS.com. So, they were removed and replaced with the track Me Inside.    (AND A BRIEF HISTORY LESSON ON SLIPKNOT)    To all of you whom do not know, there was a man named Anders Colsefni whom was the ORIGINAL Slipknot vocalist, and him with 5 (yes only 5..not 8) other guys, put out an album back in 1996 on Pale One Music (in which I own) called, \\"Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.\\", think of it as a demo album..or maybe an EP.     It contained only 8 tracks, and a hidden 9th. It's extremely rare, and was limited to only 1000 copies. Finding it now, is almost impossible.     So yes, that was just a little history lesson to all those whom don't know that Anders is the ORIGINAL vocalist, and the original band only had 6 members.     (SELFTITLED ALBUM (WITHOUT BONUS TRACKS) REVIEW)    A very good begining indeed, I dub this album. It has some of the best tracksI have ever heard Slipknot compose. While Anders liked to approach the Death Metal sound back in 96, Corey tends to go for a more Rapcore sound with this masterpiece of an album. The tracks are...     1.7-42617-00002-7 3/5   2.(SiC) 3/5   3.Eyeless 5/5   4.Wait & Bleed 10/5   5.Surfacing 20/5   6.Spit it Out 10/5   7.Tattered & Torn 4/5   8.Me Inside 3/5   (FORMER/REPLACES \\"Frail Limb Nursery\\")   9.Liberate 4.5/5   (FORMER/REPLACES \\"Purity\\")   10.Prosthetics 10/5   11.No Life 5/5   12.Diluted 100/5   13.Only One 3/5   14.Scissors 5/5   **15.Eeyore 4/5   (Hiddden Track)     Alot of new stuff here, and a few remakes. The remakes are:     1. Tattered & Torn (Original Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. song)   2. Only One (Original Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. song)   3. Me Inside (Written for Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat., but never released on it.)     The best tracks on the Selftitled album, i'm going to have to say are:     Diluted   Wait & Bleed   Prosthetics   Surfacing   and   Spit it Out     (ONTO DIGIPACK (BONUS TRACKS) REVIEW)    As stated, this digipak really DOES make up for the loss of Frail Limb Nursery and Purity. It contains 6 bonus tracks, the most bonus tracks that the selftitled digipak has. No other version, has more tracks, only less. So this is one of the BEST ones, and quite possibly the 2nd best. The best being the 19 track one that contains both Frail Limb Nursery and Purity, which is out of print as well, and very rare.    This contains great bonus tracks. They are..    1. Wait and Bleed (Terry Date Mix) 5/5  2. Spit it Out (Overcaffinated Mix) 5/5  3. Get This (Or Die) 5/5  4. Interloper (Demo Track) 5/5  5. Despise (Purity Demo) 100/5  6. Surfacing (Live) 10/5    All of which are awesome!    The Wait and Bleed mix is BETTER than the original cause Corey is actually SINGING in it, and not screaming his way through it.    Get This (Or Die) is a short, but sweet song with zaney disturbingly funny lyrics.    Interloper is a great demo of Diluted, but you can def. tell the difference between the two. Good demo nonetheless.    The Spit it Out mix is pretty much the exact same thing as the original, only faster. Much, MUCH better!    And Despise is the demo version of Purity, with only one real major difference, the chorus.    Then Surfacing is a live track, that actually sounds somewhat  better than the album version.    This digipak ownz,  so...    Get This (Or Die).
B000003TAR|5.0|Yes, even better than \\"Nevermind\\". The music on this album is depressing, bleak, and completely misrebale. But its not all doom and gloom. It wont click on first listen, but repeated listeners will often find beauty and charm nestled in these songs. <br /> <br />   Two good examples of ineer beauty are \\"Dumb\\" and \\"All Apologies\\", two softer songs that show Kurts sensitive side. However, to completely contradict that are songs like \\"Milk It\\" and \\"Scentless Apprentice\\". Many people see these songs as unlistenable noise, but to the true gruunge fan, they turn out to be the best songs. <br /> <br />   All songs are great, but I'd say the best are \\"Serve the Servants\\", \\"Dumb\\", and \\"Milk It\\". \\"Dumb\\" is a heartfelt song, \\"Milk It\\" is true grunge, and \\"Serve the Servants\\" is sort of a median between the two. <br /> <br />  So buy \\"In Utero\\" now. I guarantee you wont regret it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|To begin with, \\"Under My Skin\\" is definitely a must have for any Avril fan or the people who is starting to be her fans, because, I think it's a bit different from \\"Let Go\\". In this album, she expresses more things and it's a more personal album than \\"Let Go\\". I think that's why it's called \\"Under My Skin\\", and I personally found it better than the debut album. There is just one song I think she shouldn't have recorded with the rhythm it has, because the letter is kind of deep; I'm talking about \\"Forgotten\\". It's the track eight and if you can hear it in the music sampler, do it.<br /><br />I have four personal favorite songs:<br />Take Me Away (1): A great song to begin the album<br />My Happy Ending (6): You must have heard it already; it was a single<br />Nobody's Home (7): My favorite song in the antire album! It's the current single. You must like it!<br />Who Knows (9): It's a very up song, which makes you feel happy, and it's the most \\"pop\\" song in the album (it's like \\"Complicated\\" in \\"Let Go\\", but better...)<br /><br />You should really buy it, you won't be dissapointed at all.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I found this masterpiece like so many of us in the United States badly chopped up and limping from the ungainly cuts made to the original vision of Master Miyazaki.  That being said I carried the love of this piece with me for twenty years, always hearing from those who had seen the original Japanese version about how lacking it was when it was the Warriors of the Wind.  I did not care, this vision of the tenuous and hostile future was populated by the perfect heroine for a 12 year old girl who had never seen a truly strong and dedicated female role model in any anime until Nausicaa herself.<br /><br />When Disney did the only honorable thing it could and released this polished original I bought it the first day it was available, I knew that I had to have it.  I was expecting to still love it the same as I did when I was a young girl, but now as a mother and a grown woman.  I find that love Nausicaa even more.  The scenes that had been brutally removed from Warriors in the Wind took my breath away.  The animation is timeless, no matter how advanced we become, it will always be beautiful.<br /><br />The new voices for the characters work as well, James Patrick Stewart is unmistakable as Lord Yupa, the other cast members do a wonderful job of conferring emotion and the proper spirit of the film.  This is one that must be bought now, who knows how long Disney will allow it to be out so snap it up.  Enjoy and treasure this wonderful work for a long time to come.<br /><br />Tatianna
B0007GAEW6|5.0|As an old progrock fan, and an old punk to boot, I have longed for the return of musical ambition, creative freedom, and musical heroism.  All the modern prog I have heard has been too emotionally timid, or too lamely melodramatic, or too unhip and dated.  Nothing has had the reach, the FLAVOR, until I first heard \\"The Widow\\" on my local alternative station.  Little did I know that \\"Frances the Mute\\" would exceed my wildest dreams--which of course is exactly what great progressive rock should do!   <br /> <br />These guys pull the hard rock virtuosity of Led Zeppelin, the minimalist spacerock of Tago Mago-era Can, the rattling edginess of King Crimson, and the Latin passion of Santana into the postpunk/postalternative universe with all the balls intact.  And it's still new.  And I still don't get it all.   <br /> <br />It feels so good to be amazed by music again.  These guys are my new heroes.  Can't wait to hear \\"Deloused in the Comatorium \\" next. <br /> <br />WOW!!
B00005JNTV|4.0|I've never read the Frank Miller novels, but from what I've heard, the film version of \\"Sin City\\" is a great adaptation of the comic books. Speaking as someone who isn't familiar with the comics, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Sin City\\" and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in an \\"alternative moviegoing experience.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is actually made up of three different stories. In the first one, Bruce Willis plays a nearly-retired cop who puts his life and career on the line to save a young girl from a child molestor. The second story follows Marv (Mickey Rourke) as he tries to track down the people responsible for the death of a hooker who winds up in his bed. Finally, Clive Owen plays a man who tries to protect his new girlfriend from an abusive ex (Benicio Del Toro) and accidently threatens the balance of power between the police, the mob, and the girls who work the streets in Old Town.<br /><br />The film is shot almost entirely in black and white with little glimmers of color here and there (deep red lipstick, a woman's piercing blue eyes). Almost all of the backgrounds are digitally generated, which gives everything a true comic book/film noir quality. Some people might be turned off by the intense violence that is present in all three stories, but it's my understanding that the graphic novels are exactly the same way, so fans of the \\"Sin City\\" series will probably be pleased. I enjoyed the unique filmmaking techniques coupled with entertaining stories and fabulous performances by a large and incredibly talented cast.<br /><br />See this film in the theatre if you can...even thought it's a gritty, violent movie, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. (I also got a real kick out of seeing Elijah Wood play a ninja-style serial killer/cannibal...a far cry from his Frodo Baggins days!)
B0007MVXQG|5.0|When I first saw the DUAL-DISC logo, and concept in relation to albums it was with an AC/DC  release. So I knew about the Dual Disc Concept before I saw the info on the ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION Dual-Disc. From the little I heard of the Priest  release, it was with High expectations.<br /><br />ALBUM TECHNICAL: the CD Audio on Side one works well, plays well, and rocks brilliantly on Regular Boom Boxes, CD decks, and PCs. The Dual Disc  does have the incredible warning that the CD \\"audio\\" side does not conform to CD Audio specifications. Nonetheless, it plays on all the systems I tried. The Disc only has problems with units that \\"Cache\\" when doing playback. The thickness of the disc seems to me to be the same as a regular CD, so I had no problem in that respect. As for being unable to copy the CD audio to a CD  disc, that is totally wrong. If you bounce the CD side to wav or mp3 on your hard-drive, then back to CD using ROXIO  easy CD creator, it works very well.<br />After reading the many reviews complaining about the dual-disc being unplayable, I have tried the dual-disc on multiple players, including a DVD  player for a TV. I have had NO problems with the conventional players ( those that do not Cache).<br />Even the issue of the alleged uncopyable disc seems to be straight out wrong. Roxio works on versions 4 to 6, even the Multimedia  Suite by Roxio can be used for getting the tracks for transfer to CD. I realise it kind of destroys the point of buying a disc of any kind; however, if you use the discs in your car, or in an environment where the disc  may be destroyed by heat, or even stolen, then a CD \\"copy\\" version is a good compromise. I even made a tape of the CD side of the dual disc, and this is where the copy-protection shows the most ( the source disc often has a frequency \\"missing\\" or corrupted, so that a transfer to a second source will make a bad or horribly corrupted copy... you can see this on an oscilloscope, or the digital version that analyses bandwidths, and the tape works just as well as the CD  disc.).<br /><br />Please note: The Discs I buy are legit versions. I make a copy for places to play the disc where it might easily be stolen or damaged; these discs are EASILY copyable ... people saying otherwise are LYING, or they are computer illiterate.<br /><br />I plan to test the disc in a number of environments including a car CD player ( notoriously dodgy players, but good sound), to see if the width is an issue. Given how the dual-disc is almost exactly the same width as the regular CD, I could see these discs playing even in the 300-400  disc  units that some people have.<br /><br />TEST NOTE  May 15: I played the Dual Disc, as it is from the dual sided disc, and it played perfectly, in a CD player in a PT Cruiser, 2005 standard edition. No problem in getting the dualdisc in the player, and the sound was awesome in a six speaker system. Not a single scratch after playing the disc... no scratch on either side of the dual disc. So much for the problem of playing this disc in a car.<br /><br />MUSIC: Totally Awesome. From the Start to the finish, the light and shade on the disc is the best Priest I have ever heard. ANGEL is a beautiful song as well... totally great Ballad.<br />I have been playing the disc non-stop on a tape version back to back with DEEPEST PURPLE ( an old compilation), and the songs on ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION just get better, and I can pick out a lot of tricks that the guys use... very fun to listen to.<br />And Halford plays some \\"Homage\\" to at least one band: listen to the end of REVOLUTION and  pick up the LED  ZEPPELIN vocal riff.<br /><br />The CD audio sounds great in Stereo, and on playback, the 5.1 system works well except that the middle channel has no signal( I don't know if that is deliberate or accidental). I have since re-read the stickers, and it says \\"Enhanced Stereo\\" so maybe they used some of the Bose technology to split the left and right channels for further aural augmentation, and maybe my Synthetic 5.1 software has kicked in to augment the quality.<br /><br />THE DVD  SIDE:  The 30 Minute special Looks great, and sounds even better than I had expected. If the Spanish concert to be released later is part of this material, then that will be AWESOME.<br />I have had no DVD signal  dropout on a DELL  Dimension 8200, and on a Phillips  DVP642 DVD player.<br /><br />DVD SIDE  AUDIO:  Beyond great. You will definitely  want to crank this one UP !!!!!!!! Same as the CD side in track listing, but the Audio is better; however, still no middle/central track ( still, I guess 4 great is better than 5 not so great ??) ... might have been interesting to have a middle track the Way  IRON MAIDEN have done on DVDs.<br />Anyway, since the audio is in enhanced stereo, I guess that is consistent; The display for the songs looks  cool, nice Graphics too.<br /><br />All in all a great experience.<br /><br />Sept 18 2012:<br /><br />Judas Priest have the history and the ability to create music, and evoke an image of mythic proportions. It really<br />only took time before they got to the level where the music became mythic in the full sense, and Rob Halford is<br />fully aware of what he is doing in this sense ( The same way DIO always delivered in his iconic imagery in the<br />musical imagery). For a powerful album like the one delivered by Priest here, the image management is, I suspect,<br />very significant. And also on the audio level it is key that Roy Z has played a key part in the making of the<br />Album, since he has such a skill in bringing forward the power of any artist he has worked with. The stylistic<br />design of the album has what I suspect is a clever mix of light and shade. The two starting songs, JUDAS RISING,<br />and DEAL WITH THE DEVIL, are both great PRIEST rockers, but they sound individual. Key variation makes the sound<br />work work very well. For example REVOLUTION has at the fade out the call out \\"Break it Down, Break it Down\\", which<br />some may recall has been done by Zeppelin at the end of one of their songs. Then At the start of DEMONIZER, the<br />sound effect is close to being bone crunching. As the album develops, ANGEL, a much maligned softer tone has a<br />refined sounds for the guitar, and Robs voice, which works superbly to bring out a beautiful song. In EULOGY the<br />riff that echoes in the edge of the ear, as it were, is the piano tone, and LOCH NESS, though a good PRIEST rock<br />work, has some of the most clever imagery in this genre. The packaging as a whole is awesome, just brilliant in so<br />many ways. The DUAL-DISC that I bought was no problem. As soon as I knew it was a DUAL-DISC I was expecting a lot.<br />Although the DVD album side was not 5.1, if you play it through a 5.1 system, the sound is amped up, and the<br />Trident Logo looks brilliant. I had no problems with the CD playback, or the DVD side playback, not at any time,<br />and none of my gear is high end, just well taken care of by software and updates. PRIEST repay the fans with the<br />best music, and the Metal God lives on as the best of Best. An album I thoroughly enjoy.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|As a huge Metallica fan since '85, I was eagerly anticipating this DVD to gain insight into the guys and the music I admire so much.  I'm glad VH-1 showed it uncut - I now feel no need to own this. <br /> <br />I did appreciate learning a little more about Hetfield; namely, how he feels about the music, the band, Lars, and his family.  Lars, on the other hand, makes me want to slap him every time he opens his mouth.  This movie would have been a lot better if the creators had the guts to not allow him to hog the mike.  Yes, his the \\"mouthpiece\\" of the band (unfortunately), but he really doesn't know when to put a sock in it - and the producers took the easy way out and let him dominate the entire film. <br /> <br />As for \\"Dr. Phil\\" - absolutely, one of the best parts of the film was when the band had to let him know that he was not, in fact, a member of Metallica.  Did the boys really need this guy or someone like him?  Could they have figured all this stuff out for themselves (and saved 40K a month!)?  I think so.  Look at Aerosmith, the Stones, AC/DC...any band with a longevity of at least 2 decades.  Yes, it is a family, yes, it eventually becomes dysfunctional, and yes, you can work things out without professional help.  I'm with Newstead on this issue. <br /> <br />It was interesting to watch Dave Mustaine spill his guts in this.  Megadeth, founded 100% out of Mustaine's fury over being fired from Metallica and desire for revenge, always has been and remains one of the best metal bands ever.  Their latest, \\"The System has failed\\", is fantastic. <br /> <br />Watching this film helped me understand why St. Anger sounds the way it does...but that still doesn't make it listenable.  I've tried, believe me. I just can't listen to this thing even halfway through. It's extremely self-indulgent, lyric wise, and let's face it - the sound quality is crap. <br /> <br />Despite all this, I still love this band.  I still want to hear from them for years to come.  But some things are better left unsaid...and unwatched.
B000002JR8|5.0|And I stick to my convictions.  Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills....The Becoming....Shedding Skin.....WOWZERS!!!!  What a powerful friggin album.  The drums, bass, guitar.....all completely amazing.  Phil....wow....what a screamer.  And in the cover of Planet Caravan he proves he can also sing.  It's funny how Pantera took a totally mediocre song and made it beautiful.  This is the best metal album ever.
B000065VB0|5.0|<br />Of all the remastered Peter Gabriel recordings, this one sounds most outstanding.  I expected Security to be the stunner (and surely its remaster sounds really good), but Melt is virtually transformed into a new album. <br /> <br />If you give it a crank and check out Intruder, you'll hear a whole new level of intrigue and atmosphere right away, but then it's No Self Control that will blow the doors off the previous version of the CD, and it pretty much never lets up after that.  (I'd never been so crazy about I Don't Remember before, but the new mix really brings it to life - the transformation is THAT profound.)  The textural and percussive detail are simply beyond belief, and the vocal depth taken to a whole new level. <br /> <br />In short, if you own the catalogue already, I'd say this one is the MOST worth buying AGAIN.  Though Security's overhaul was woefully overdue, so perhaps buy the pair.  Especially since many would consider these PG's strongest two \\"mainstream\\" albums (setting aside the soundtracks into a wonderful category all their own.) <br /> <br />For those that don't know this record at all, it's a fantastic accomplishment of \\"dark pop,\\" mixing fundamental pop hooks, grooves, and anthems with a simmering borderline hysteria and anxiety.  There's one track that deeply annoys me (still), but the overall accomplishment is historic, truly a document of the creeping trauma and injustice of the latter 20th Century.  (Check out Games Without Frontiers and/or No Self Control to get a feel for the album's \\"voice,\\" and then deeper, darker tracks will surprise you further upon a full listen.) <br /> <br />If you're new to PG altogether, I'm not sure I'd recommend this one as a FIRST buy.  It's extraordinary, no doubt, but if you're inclined toward \\"more accessible\\" pop, you might try So or Us, both great records but more \\"easy-going\\" than Melt.  Or, if you're inclined to explore the most thunderously ambitious work he's ever done, definitely check outSecurity, one of the great 5-star albums of all time, especially now that it's been remastered.
1563890119|4.0|Preludes and Nocturnes was my first experience with a graphic novel. I'd had several friends tell me that The Sandman books were must-reads, but for a while I was wary. I just don't do comic books.  I do enjoy comic strips, but I tend to lose interest if the strip is longer than two or three rows in the newspaper.  I just can't follow them.<br /><br />I had, however, been told that The Sandman books read like a traditional story and since I love Neil Gaiman, I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />Based on Preludes and Nocturnes, I've come to two conclusions. First, though they don't read quite like a novel, as some of the story is told through the pictures rather than narration, these particular books are easy to follow and read enough like a traditional book to keep my attention.<br /><br />Second, these books are addicting. Every time I picked up Preludes and Nocturnes, I found it difficult to put down. I just wanted to keep reading and reading and reading and now that I've finished the book, I want to read the next one. I cannot wait until tomorrow when I get to pick up my copy of The Doll's House so I can read both that and Dream Country, which I already have. Unfortunately, the chances that those two books will occupy me until I can pick up book four are slim.<br /><br />One complaint that I've heard a couple of times about The Sandman is that the DC-universe characters were awkward because when the book was started they weren't sure how it was going to fit into the DC Universe, and it ended up that they created a new label for it anyway. I suppose this may be true, but as my familiarity with DC superheroes is limited to a small percentage of the movies that have been made about them, I would be the first to admit that I'm not the right person to judge that.<br /><br />For me, it was a little strange to have Batman referred to in the book as an actual person, but other than that I didn't see anything wrong with how they were portrayed.<br /><br />The rest of the characters were vibrant and interesting, though definitely very different than what I'm used to reading. Just the concepts of some of the characters were vastly different from any that I had seen before. It was very refreshing and I was impressed by all the different personalities that came through as I was reading.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't really like about Preludes and Nocturnes is some of the art. Most of it, I really liked as I thought that it helped tell the story very well and added elements that wouldn't have been possible in a traditional novel. However, there were a few panels that I just didn't like the art in. They were a bit too graphic and they weren't depicting things that I wanted to see. They made reading that particular part uncomfortable for me.<br /><br />That, however, is my only complaint about Preludes and Nocturnes.

6305922756|5.0|Spinal Tap the movie is a great piece of satire. For those who know the 70s and 80s, they can definitely pick who is being satirised, and if you have ever heard Harry Shearer's show on NPR, then you can appreciate the humour that goes in to one part of the writing of this film. <br />There are so many aspects of this film, and the DVD extras  package that is just plain brilliant. In fact with the Original film, the commentary, and the 1 hour and 7 minutes of extra footage, you basically have THREE  shows. The commentary adds absolutely nothing to the film itself ( it's not like it is an explanation of the film), but the bonus footage explains a lot of unclear, or \\"loose\\" thematic  threads. <br />The Value here is collossal, and totally excellent. <br />For those saying its dumb, boring, not funny, etc... well, this has its own sense of humour, very british, very subtle, and not for the \\"Crack over the skull\\" kind of humour that some people prefer ( not to say that a crack over the skull properly  timed cannot be funny), simply put, this DVD is a brilliant item, and well worth it for SPINAL TAP  fans. <br />ENJOY
6305903182|2.0|Scream 4/5 <br />Scream 2 3.5/5 <br />Both good movies, and Scream 3 is still directed by Wes Craven, but it's not as good.  Why is this?  Well, the fact that there are no characters that are really likeable as an enormous affect.  I mean Neve, David, and Courtney are really like the only characters who we've known from the first film.  Jamie Kennedy was FOOLISHLY killed off in Scream 2, but he's in this one, you'll see what I mean.  The hot famous blond to bite the dust in this movie is Jenny McCarthy.  I think she's really easy on the eyes in this.  I first saw her in Python and she looks like 10 years older in that movie for some reason.  Anyway...I do'nt know.  You might like this, but it doesn't really have any classic/clishe suspensful chase sequences like Courtney Cox towards the end of Scream 2, and it's just kind of a rehash of everything.  Who really cares about the revelation at the end of the movie?  It doesn't make it any more rewarding or good.  So, what does this have going for it?  The return of Neve Campbell, who seems to have considerably less screentime than in the previous movies.  David Arquette, who is not as likeable as in the first 2.  Courtney Cox, who look the worst, and just seems in the way.  Random cameo by Jay and Silent bob, Roger Corman, and Carrie Fisher.
B00005AAFS|4.0|I bought this cd last July after someone I liked said Rammstein was one of her favorite bands - and now I know why. \\"Mutter\\" is the cd that started my whole German rock/industrial phase. It's worth every cent. <br /> <br />The most memorable songs on the album are Mein Herz Brennt, Links 234, Feuer Frei, Sonne, Ich Will, Adios, and Mutter. This album is pure quality and just as catchy as any American industrial album. Give it a shot.
6305268843|5.0|{Sigh.} This is a sleeper movie that catches the viewer completely by surprise.  \\"Passion has no limits\\" proclaims the movie soundtrack which is now out of print and nearly impossible to find.  That statement is correct and the viewer finds themselves caught up completely in the storyline, such as it is, waiting in anticipation for the next clandestine rendezvous of the two lovers.  Who cares if the story is not historically correct or if the acting is not Oscar-worthy.  Sophie Marceau is in her element here, and Stephen Dillane, while not a super-stud, is still perfect for the part and is a believable partner for Sophie.  As for Louisa, the child is spoiled, obnoxious and difficult to feel sympathy for, but she is a creation of her environment and what her father made her to be.   <br /> <br />There are two flaws in this movie is the wife that is in a coma. Why the desperation for an heir if the wife is comatose and near death?  Re-marriage and children are always an option.  I thought this part of the movie was unbelieveable and silly.  The screenwriters could have come up with something better. But, ah - I am being picky here.  The second flaw is Louisa in the lake house, which was boring, and my attention drifted.   <br /> <br />The music in the movie is haunting and beautiful.  The music is composed by Christopher Gunning and the violin solos strike the heart and remain in your memory.   <br /> <br />I recommend this movie and also the soundtrack.  A+  Five Stars
044024157X|4.0|Having moved myself from a large city to a very small town, I thought Grisham's portrayal the characters you get to know when living in a more intimate setting was right on.  I enjoyed \\"living in this book.\\"  I was a Grisham fan when he first got started, but was subsequently disappointed in some of his books and stopped reading him.  In The Last Juror he seemed back in stride again.
B00005JL0U|5.0|This was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I wore the tape out when I was little and my mother had to buy me a new one! They need to stop playing games and release this on DVD.
B000002OTL|4.0|The name of this movie is as unforgettable as the movie itself. However, I do not find it the best movie ever as some people would put it. It is not even the best movie of 90's given the fact that the 90's saw movies like 'Philadelphia' and 'Titanic', which shall remain memorable for the story and ability to touch human heart. However, it is not fair to compare this movie with those as this movie is a different kind of cinema which presents the things in a cruder way than they really are in order to stimulate audience to watch it. <br /> <br />I watched this movie on TV which I would highly recommend rather than spending money on buying a DVD. I thought a lot about this movie after watching it not because of the movie itself but because of the opnions of  others about this movie.  <br /> <br />What makes this movies special is the way the story is told, the settings, the characters and most importantly the music which invisibily maintains the pace of the movie.  <br /> <br />Some memorable scenes from this movie: <br /> <br />1. Dance scene in the club ( John Travolta and Uma Thruman ) <br />2. Murder of John Travolta <br />3. Adrenaline shot scene  <br /> <br />Please avoid this movie if you do not like black morbid humour, blood, drugs and explcit language. <br /> <br />
068987474X|2.0|Ok, so he's not that into me. I got the message. Now what? This is where I was hoping for answers, and just didn't get them. The book is funny and easy to read, but it doesn't give more in the area of what to do next. I wish it did. <br /> <br />
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones' Feels Like Home feels good, feels soothing, feels like another world.  This lp is a jazz/country/blues mixture to make a perfect blend displaying Norah's range and versitility.  As the opening \\"Sunrise\\" I could feel the maturity and the talent.  The Handsome Band is an awsome live band to compliment her voice.  She even has country sensation Dolly Parton featuring on the swinging \\"Creepin' In\\".  Norah writes, plays piano and sings, a triple threat.  Narrated with a homely, more humble feel of loving and living for someone.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth are exactly that- a massive, thundering Behemoth.  Tis cd is amazing.  The brutality is mind-blowing, they are super-fast and excessively heavy.  The lyrics are very intelligent for a death metal band.  This band is miles ahead of the more popular bands like Cannibal Corpse and Six Feet Under.  Also check out the band Nile who I believe are even better than the mighty Behemoth!
B000003TA4|1.0|This for adam mckay, this band brought absolutely nothing to rock, and this album proves it, a lot of people say this band changed music from the hair metal bands and pop stars, please    the only thing they giving us is those stupid atrocious little bands (Limp Bizkit, korn, creed, puddle of mudd, etc) that has ruined the music industry ever since this band came out,   songs are so bad, it made me sad and the only good one is About a Girl    and as for the rest of the band, aside from decent songwriting, this band has absolutely no talent (except for Dave Grohl)    I Blame Nirvana for what's everything wrong in the 1990's, from the release of this album, to the creation of new genres (nu metal, pop punk, emo, all were influenced by this dreadful band) and finally the worst thing to come out of rock n roll since the dawning of that era St. Anger, Metallica died in a shameful horrible death by going nu metal in the worse ways possible.    It was one thing that nirvana changed the face of the industry, but it was another thing to make them majority overrated  and forever destroy american rock, but to go in such places that destroys the greatest metal band in the history of music.    And I Also agree with one person that this band gave grunge a bad name and it sure did.    I'm glad that this band is no more and Ted Nugent said it best, Kurt Nobrain (As We real rock fans call him) a weenie when he commmit suicide in 1994.    This Band was a watered down version of the Sex Pistols and the clash.    1. If kurt hated fame so much, then why did to sign to a major record label?    2. This Band is as manufactured and preposterous as backstreet boys pop.    3. Nirvana was the vanilla ice of grunge, except dave grohl had more talent.    Kurt fooled everybody that he was anti-mainstream, he became mainstream and a joke just like feminem and vanilla ice.    Throw this album into the dumpster with to the extreme and encore  and leave it there.      If you a real grunge album of the 1990's go back Soundgarden's first album and Alice in Chains's Dirt.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Everytime I see a director's cut, I am amazed at how much better the story is than the one in the theaters and Daredevil (Director's Cut) is no exception.  Instead of jumping from the first act to the finale there is an actual story going on here.  Not only that but the action scenes are better.  It was funny to hear the director's commentary talking about how the movie executives wanted to shorten the fighting scenes - in an action movie?  How ridiculous.  Movie executives should stay out of the creative process and let the story tellers do their job.  This Daredevil is the real thing, you won't want to miss it.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen all year.<br /><br />Has all the required ingredience for a great movie.<br /><br />- Makes you laugh, makes you cry, and has a very good story behind it.<br /><br />I recommended this movie to all my friends and family.

Well, on wretched you'll get what you always do but in a better form and more organized way even better then before and much more brutal with pounding drums and the sick vocals from (coprsegrinder) and you won't be dissapointed.

B0006399FS|1.0|After the huge musical dissapointment of ATYCLB - a smash of sales just because of September 11th -, we were hoping for something much more interesting and brand new again (like Pop, Achtung Baby or Zooropa)...wrong... we just got more of the same mainstream corporate s*** <br /> <br />This is just another lame attempt at Bono-the-skank making money off of U2's former glory.  <br /> <br />The songwriting is extremely poor and every track sounds like they are just doing a run thru no passion nor commitment. In trying to copy (yet again) their overexposed Joshua Tree sound they made a boring album with a cheap, artificial sound, that completely takes away whatever charm those unforgettable 80's stuff. Moreover, a toilet flushing sounds better then Bono's rough voice. I don't know why on earth he loves that strained raspy voice with the flu all the time. <br /> <br />For the uninitiated out there, I'm a die hard U2 fan (I have all their 80's and 90's stuff and I attended to 2 Pop Mart concerts in Buenos Aires 1998), unlike what some mindless 5 star \\"fans\\" believe. It's so easy to pretend that a 5 star reviewer is a true fan and every 1 or 2 star reviewer is an anti-U2 guy...let me say they're completely wrong and simply they don't want to realise most of U2 fans don't like this drivel. By the way, worst U2 album reviewed ever. Among the ones who love this \\"bomb\\", I bet at least half of them pretend to love it just because it's a \\"U2\\" album. <br /> <br />They are not meant for public consumption nor should they be marketed in such a way that unsuspecting fans believe they are buying a certain type of CD only to be disappointed when they actually give it a listen at home. This \\"U2\\" HTDAAB mess is best to be ignored. Period. Shame on them money grubbers, former band.  <br /> <br />I hope they realise that they're ruining their own legacy by releasing crap like this and over-commercializing everything they ever do.  <br />
B00009UW0N|5.0|John Carpenter's_Halloween is unquestionably the best horror film ever made. This film branches above and beyond conventional horror and could almost be on the level of science-fiction, no horror movie will ever touch the scope of this. The movie (technically starting October 31, 1963 in the Town of Haddonfield, Illinois) introduces us to 6 year-old Michael Myers who murders his sister Judith Myers (while dressed in an eerie clown costume) in cold blood. On a raw stormy Halloween Eve Fifteen years later on October 30, 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove Warren County Sanitarium. Michael's evil supernaturally transforms him into \\"The Shape\\" creating (upon his return) the darkest \\"HALLOWEEN\\" Haddonfield has ever seen, however (Don't Fear) The Reaper! He will prey upon youth (teen babysitters) who have no real knowledge of the danger that stands in the shadows. His motive is unknown, however his psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) knows he is pure evil. Pure evil that will take the life of Laurie Strode's (Jamie Lee Curtis') friends, while finding her deepest courage for survival. Laurie finds her final confrontation with \\"The Shape\\" while babysitting a boy named Tommy Doyle, however not even Dr. Loomis can shoot down and stop pure evil, for \\"The Shape\\" is gone! In memory of Donald Pleasence and Debra Hill. **Please see my review of HALLOWEEN II.
B00001U0E1|3.0|Cue Aerosmith riffs and I'm on my way. Right! First of all stop complaining that the facts aren't right. This is Hollywood after all. The facts of `Brave Heart' were way off too. Did that stop it from earning Mel an Oscar? No it did not. Did the glaring historical mistakes prevent Shakespeare in Love from winning an Oscar? Ditto to the first answer. There are numerous problems in this film. Ben Aflec to point a few. The fact is it's hard to pull off an English accent. Most Americans simply can't perform Shakespeare no matter how hard they try. It always sounds like they are reading poetry. Much as I enjoyed viewing Gwyneth Paltrow in a moustache (anyone who thought she resembled a man in any way needs their eyes testing), I don't think she came near enough to the calibre I consider worthy of an Oscar. I much preferred Cate Blanchett in Elizabeth. I love that womans voice, its sooo deep...erm anyway apart from that the movie is crammed with unfunny jokes that the majority of the general public seem to find funny. This scares me. Like the Avon cup, the constant changing of the play title (`Romeo and Ethel The Pirates Daughter', is that amusing to you?) and peppering the script with more excerpts from his works to make the audience nod in acknowledgement: `oh I get it! I'm enjoying this film! Haw haw!' <br />My enjoyment of such `wit' was cut short due to the fact that in the middle of this film I suffered a violent nosebleed. No really! The incident occurred in an old theatre in Wetherby (tiny village in England). I wasn't picking my nose, I just, you know, had an itch. Anyway I caught a vein and I'm talking about blood shooting out my nose like you'd never seen before. I made a mad dash to the bathroom and, in the dark, ended up in the broom cupboard where I, in my confusion, switched all the lights on. It was a tiny family run cinema you seen. Anyway the owner came running down the isle and shoved me into the bathroom. We're talking a tiny white washroom with a toilet and a sink, no privacy whatsoever. I spent the rest of the film with my head in that very sink and lost so much blood I nearly fainted. On my way out the owner proceeded to give me 2 free tickets so that I could come and view it again. Out of pure obligation and embarrassment at having turned her friendly country establishment into a blood bath I returned the next night only to be subjected to the entire rigmarole again. Okay this review is going nowhere.  Despite what you may think, I actually enjoyed the film, especially the final sequence. It was entertaining to some extent. That's it.  I give it 3 stars for the beautiful costumes and sets, including the lovely restoration of the old rose theatre. Joseph Fines wasn't too shabby either.    <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First off, you do NOT, I repeat, not have to get stoned to enjoy this album.  I haven't been stoned a day in my life (unless you count laughing gas while getting a wisdom tooth pulled, but then again, what are the odds your dentist pulls teeth to Mars Volta?  Ok, don't answer that) and this is one of the best albums I've heard in a while.  It's Parliament/Funkadelic.  It's Tool.  It's Rush.  It's Zeppelin.  It's Portishead.  It's Pink Floyd.  It's way far freaking out.  A little too far out sometimes. The ambience that connects certain songs is just a little TOO drawn out at times, but when they rock, they rock.  I doubt these guys are going to ever get really popular, maybe just a great band that those in the know will appreciate, while many dismiss it as \\"stoner rock\\".  I gave the CD to a friend of mine, and he said: \\"Too much French stuff going on there - or is that Spanish?\\"  And that's what you're going to hear from people who have no clue, and what THEY hear is \\"scream scream scream\\".  What we hear is something a little more complex, Jon Theodore, a drummer who kills most competition in the blink of an eye, and pretty much overall an epic that shouldn't be missed.  At times it's mellow, but most of the time it's hard, aggressive, and beautifully sinister (music to pull teeth to, even).  Like Floyd's Wall, this could be the soundtrack of one's descent into madness.  I'd advise newcomers to find the album at a listening station at a music or book store, since the 30-second clips on this site certainly won't do any of these tracks justice.  Wonderful album, one of my nominees for album of the year.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I don't get the negative reviews to this movie. I thought it was a great \\"dark action\\" movie. Not as bloody as most horror films but a bit more violent than most action films.<br /><br />I thought the premise was enjoyable, the sets apropros' to the film-dark and moody. The fight scenes are great-I think it's wonderful to see a female lead that kicks butt and takes no prisoners. I was also glad to see a Vamp movie where they're not all weeping and wailing-\\"poor-me-I'm-a-cursed-vampire\\". Interesting that you never know who to root for, the vamps or the werewolves-so the ending is satisying.<br /><br />Finally, face it, there are never enough cool werewolf movies! That's a major selling point right there:) AND Bill Nighy (Love Actually) as the head Vamp? So bad it's good!<br /><br />As with any fantasy film-if you're willing to sit back, suspend disbelief, and enjoy a \\"thrill ride\\"-then buy this film. If you're a classical vampire purist then you probably want to skip it.<br /><br />4.5 stars!
B00005JNEI|5.0|It's been some time since I saw it for the first time, but I never get sick of watching it over and over again. How on earth did Bush get re elected? <br />EVerything in the film is factual, to the point and makes you think. <br />Too bad half the Americans didn't think when they voted though.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I happened across this DVD in the bargain bin of a major video rental place. For $5 I thought, what the heck. I don't watch much Anime BUT I love foreign films and am up to trying new things.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW! What a funny, thrilling, touching story of love and the power love has to work miracles.<br /><br />I know that sounds hokey, but I think you'll agree when you watch how the films story falls neatly into place, almost like guidence from a \\"divine\\" hand.<br /><br />The trio of heros, three homeless folks who stumble across an abandoned baby, are priceless and entertaining. You'll definately be rooting for the three and hope for a \\"happy\\" ending for them as well as the baby.<br /><br />This movie is rated PG 13 but as a mom I think that some older children, with parental guidence, will learn a lot from the films story lines. That life is precious and we sometimes don't respect our own lives enough to realize that we deserve better. Besides minor violent scenes, the \\"drag queen\\" character, and one breastfeeding scene it's definately nothing compared to the violence/sexuality in US films. But use you're own discretion with your kids.<br /><br />This animation speaks for itself-a visual feast.<br /><br />5 stars!
B000001F76|5.0|I bought this CD from the AMAZON reviews, and I am SOOOO glad I did!!!  I wanted the original, gritty, tinny (but not remastered to DEATH) versions of Hank's original stuff, and this is IT. <br /> <br />This guy is (was) amazing - the wretching emotions that are played out in all his songs, yet the purely original sound and feeling, do NOT make this sound like an 'old country album'.  This guy was so far ahead of his time, it boggles the mind.  This stuff was hardly palatable to the Nashville scene at the time, yet it is legendary - and today's artists all worship it and only hope to make the same kind of 'mark' he did... <br /> <br />I won't waste your time (to whoever is reading this) with my praise for Hank Sr. - all I can say is that if you think this is some old cryin-in-the-beer-lost-my-dog-etc country, think again. This guy was a pioneer, and several ROCK artists would back me up on this one.  Heck, I didn't even know that 'Move it on over' was written by him!!!  I kinda knew that the Destroyers were not ones to do 'all originals', but silly me...should read the sleeve jacket more often.  And 'Jambalaya' - hearing the original was envigorating, after all the remakes I have heard ad naseaum over the years.... <br /> <br />This great double-dose of Hank is what we all need - whether you like country music or no - it does justice to documenting one of the true masters of music.
0440180295|5.0|This is the first Vonnegut book I read and I am quite eager to pick up another one.  The book focuses on the life of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man from the US midwest who is a soldier in WWII.  The defining moment in his life is his presence , as a prisioner of war, in Dresden during the allied firebombing that killed over 100,000 people.<br /><br />The novel has a matter-of-fact attitude towards terrible events, in a sense subscribing to the notion of fate being inevitable.  In a couple of different places it urges one to act on the things one can change, but then seems to say nothing can be changed.  Vonnegut blends in science fiction to get this point across, as Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens who can travel through time and see everything, but can change nothing.  What they do is choose to see only the good things in life.<br /><br />There is also a deep comedic sense in it, though one is prevented from laughing by the sheer horror of the situations.  It is quite a different depiction of life, fate and war, a very innovative way of seeing the world.  This is definitely an interesting book, one that is clearly written from an experienced point of view (Vonnegut was himself in Dresden during the firebombing).  I highly recommend it, especially since it very short, one that could be read in a two to three hour flight.
B00005YU1O|5.0|`Waking Life' uses creative animation techniques and a nearly plot-less conversational format to explore some of the deep philosophical questions of consciousness, dream, and reality. While this may sound heavy and boring, director Richard Linklater (`Slacker') brings a surprisingly light touch to the project, and the result is a fascinating, thought provoking, and highly enjoyable film.<br />I watched this movie twice in one week. I was alone the first time that I viewed it, and found myself hard-pressed to express either the density of the ideas presented, or just how entertaining that presentation was. So I rented it again, and sat down to watch it with my best friend. We put the remote between us, and then, every few minutes, one or the other of us would grab it, hit pause, and launch into a discussion of what we had just seen. It took us all evening to watch this hour and forty minute film this way, but the result of this exercise was both entertaining and mentally stimulating.<br />Richard Linklater has a knack for making this type of fare. `Waking Life' is similar in many ways to his debut film, `Slacker', which shares its loose, conversational format and philosophical bent. `Waking Life' is a much stronger, more focused and thoughtful film, however, and it is easy to see Linklater's maturation as a film maker and thinker.<br />If you simply want mindless entertainment, avoid this movie, it is definitely not for you. If, however, you enjoy films that are clever, innovative, and thought-provoking then `Waking Life' very well might become one of your favorites.<br /><br />Theo Logos
6305327041|5.0|Unless you count New York Stories, this is probably the only movie of it's type. 4 directors, 4 stories, 4 rooms, 1 hotel and 1 bellhop boy staggering from room to room and landing himself in all sorts of situations such as having the privalige of chopping off a man's finger, getting off with a witch, and having to babysit two young trouble makers plus much more! <br /> <br />Everything takes place either in the hotel rooms, corridor, elivator or hotel office. It's brilliantly done, with the 3rd and 4th rooms being the funniest and best put together. However the first two rooms are enjoyable also. <br /> <br />It had never really been tried before, however the four directors including Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodrequez, managed to pull it off! It's just a shame that this movie often goes completly unrecognised. It's totally under-rated. Buy it now. Really, no ones movie collection is complete without this.
1558908455|5.0|This film leads you one way, throws you another and leaves you wondering just what on earth you've just witnessed! What tremendous fun it is. The opening scene is utterly beguiling. Wonderful dialogue, humour in abundance and very, very violent. But we like that! We then embark on a road movie par excellence...at least for a while. Then something else happens!! When I first watched this, I didn't read the blurb.... and how much better was the film for that? So if you ain't seen it, don't read the back cover. Just allow yourself to be carried along with the sheer absurdity of it all. Clooney was never cooler, Tarantino never more psychotic and Lewis never sexier (in a strange sorta way!). This film is pure entertainment. Enjoy.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This is the author talking. The film is shattering. For me, and of course I lack objectivity, it is The Red Shoes of Horror Films.  It got my book, it got my script, and the person responsible was the producer David Geffen. He is the one who drew together the finest talent in every field to do this film. He asked me to write the screen play. Was I part of \\"the finest talent?\\" I hope so.  He is the one who sent me a video of the film even though I objected to casting and might have screamed. I loved it. I called him to tell him. When he sent a print of the film to New Orleans for a private viewing for me and my family and friends, I was so overwhelmed by this picture that I came out of it crying helplessly in the arms of my editor Victoria Wilson. I stood there sobbing, holding onto Vicky, as the whole crowd of concerned people looked on. I couldn't snap out of it. I went out, got in the back of my car, and was driven home.  The film took me back to the night I finished the book -- 4 a.m. in the morning in the year 1973 -- in Berkeley, California, in a shabby ground floor apartment full of junk shop furniture, a beautiful place, where I sat on the couch utterly overwhelmed by the experience of \\"the novel,\\" a coherence that had come out of me -- vowing to myself that if no one published it, I'd sell it out of shopping bag to people on the street.  The film took me back even further, into the soul that had exposed itself in the writing. Darkness. No grace. No salvation.  The film got it. It got \\"the glamor of evil\\" and that darkness, that hopelessness, that despair.  It is -- and I say this now as a film buff -- a great film. Forget me. Forget the book. It's a piece of sublime work in which genius \\"happened\\" as it can in film when great directors like Neil Jordan, and great actors, and great professional on all levels are giving it everything that they can -- when  they have but one goal and that is to be true to something in which the author was true to himself or herself.  It worked. It's magic. And now ten years later people are discovering it. They are sharing that sublime vision. I'm thankful; I'm happy; I'm proud to have been part of it. I'm grateful.  And I hope David Geffen knows. I hope he knows how the world values that film. He did that.  I hope he's proud.  Anne Rice, Paradise West, Californiarself.  It worked. It's magic. And now ten years later people are discovering it. They are sharing that sublime vision. I'm thankful; I'm happy; I'm proud to have been part of it. I'm grateful.  And I hope David Geffen knows. I hope he knows how the world values that film. He did that.  I hope he's proud.  Anne Rice, Paradise West, California
0800130928|5.0|Taxi Driver scores on so many levels. As a kid (about 14 years old in 1980), I got the video from the local store. I watched it. Then I watched it again. And again. The other kids liked the (violent)ending. I liked it for everything else.  The performances Scorcese draws from his cast are absolutely astounding. De Niro, in (in my opinion) his career defining role, is utterly mesmerising. This fantastic movie will stay with you. You will find a tale as haunting as it's compelling score. Magnificent.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|I rented this movie from Blockbuster after a lady that works there specifically told me that's it's a piece of crap and it's not worth getting.  <br />Well, she wasn't exactly right. It was bad, but it had some good parts too. It wouldn't be fair to say that the whole thing blew.  <br />The choice of actors was interesting because the 4 of them are driving the whole thing. They are basically the whole cast.  <br />Natalie Portman got more exposure and I think that it was a mistake because she cannot act. She's a cute girl, but she cannot act to save her life. Just watch the beginning part when she's conversating with Jude Law and the way she laughs at his jokes it's just...it feels unatural, it's almost like you're holding the camera yourself waiting to get the shot. Her performance does get better throughout the film, but only because of Clive Owen. <br /> <br />Julia was better than Natalie. More natural (which comes from more experience I guess) but there was still something that didn't quite click. I might have to do with the script as well, the way it was written.  <br /> <br />And for the critic's review with the whole \\"oh, the best romance film\\", that's a pure lie. It's the farthest thing away from romance possible.  <br />And not because of the bad language, that shocked so many. It didn't  really shock me; they were just mad and when you're mad, you're bound to swear and all that other stuff. Some people get disgusted when they hear \\"yes, I fu***d her hard\\" or whatever. If the point of all that was to shock audiences and give them something different, they failed on my part.  <br /> <br />I know that some people arleady mentioned this, but I couldn't fail to notice for myself the unspoken \\"attraction\\" between Jude Law's character and Clive Owen's. Actually, it was spoken.  <br /> <br />Jude would be like giving him these glances with fluttering lashes that I was almost expecting for him to jump on Clive; then Clive (when talking to Julia's character) wouldsay how easily he could \\"have\\" him if he wanted to.  Anyway, the whole movie they're like \\"OH! You slept with HIM! How was he??? IS he better than me?\\" or \\"HIM? why HIM? I'm going to go and see HIM to confirm you're telling the truth!\\" <br />I think the movie would have made much more sense if they just hooked up already and left the girls in peace to find other guys to obsess over. But then we wouldn't have the wonderful movie that we have now. <br /> <br />THis movie is more about lust and people that love to obsess and torture themselves and others. And not in a good way either.  <br />Personally, I didn't find any message in this movie, it was just a merry-go-round of obsession and craziness.  A movie that leaves you with a weird feeling. It leads to nowhere. POintless. And the words \\"i love you\\" are just said so that Clive and JUde can compete over and over again with no ending result.  <br />Still, it was kind of entertaining to watch them and how stupid they were behaving. Overall I had fun.
B00012FXB8|4.0|Alien I love but I can't stand it on repeated viewings because you know who's gonna bite it and when even the exact timing it'll help. Aliens is probably my favorite film of all time, at least one of them anyway. Alien: Resurrection...meh, it isn't horrible but it's certainly not a great watch either. So we come to Alien 3: an unfinished script, a hectic shoot, some cool visual and conceptual ideas but still is missing that thing that made the first 2 awesome. <br /> <br />The film begins with the mother of all plot problems: there's an egg aboard the Sulaco. How could that have happened? She got out of the ship, chased Ripley, tried to get at Newt than battled Ripley in the power loader only to be jettisoned into space. How the hell did she lay an egg? And not only that, how did she lay a queen embryo laying egg when all the other eggs were standard warrior ones? And why does the facehugger do it twice? May seem like nitpicking but if you're gonna make a franchise follow the rules set by the predecessers. <br /> <br />However, it does have some keen visual ideas. For one, the set design is very nice having a stylized run down feel, almost like ugliness filmed in a striking way. The \\"alien vision\\" is probably the neatest camera trick since Hitchcock's famous zoom even though the alien vision is pretty simple by design but boy it looks neat. And the idea that the embryos take on the physical attributes of its host is a nice touch without every single host just gestating a default warrior type, or Xenomorph. <br /> <br />So finally we come to the story and I am going to spoil the opening. During hypersleep, a facehugger tries to get at Newt only she's behind glass so the facehugger damages itself and eats through the flooring since the \\"acid for blood\\" idea has been established. The smoke from the acid burning causes the fire alarm to go off jettisoning the surviving crew from Aliens. They crash land on a planet called Fiorina 161, a mining colony filled with prisoners. Ripley discovers that the others died and her presence in a strictly male dominated facility is quite frowned upon. <br /> <br />Adding salt to the wound is that the facehugger not only implanted a queen embryo in her but also an embryo inside a dog(ox in the Special Edition) so it's a more faster, agile and downright meaner creature. And there's no weapons in the facility at all. So if Ripley got a queen embryo, why didn't the dog get one too? Add to that my comment about \\"impregnating\\" someone twice.  <br /> <br />It's not really a horrible film by any means although the plot holes are large enough for a freight train but it's got some pluses that warrants a viewing, even if it's only a couple times a year, if that.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is great, it is better than the previous Destiny's Child ones and saying that it is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better than Destiny's Fulfilled. Seriously, it sounds like the Destiny's Child albums before Survivor, where Beyonce basically sung every song! <br /> <br />1. Crazy In Love - The lead single, and its great! It has a great beat and a great film clip! 10/10   <br />2. Naughty Girl - Another single that was great, one of the better songs on the album 7/10  <br />3. Baby Boy - This is another single off the album and it has a different sorta sound, which is great! 8/10   <br />4. Hip Hop Star - I really dont feel this song at all.....It's kinda a space filler 3/10 <br />5. Be With You - This is a sweet and cool song with a great beat 7/10   <br />6. Me, Myself And I - this song is an anthem for all the ladies who have ever had someone in their life treat them bad. 9/10   <br />7. Yes - A song that is for the typical girl who dates a guy and all he wants is a bit of booty....Has that classical sound to it 7/10 <br />8. Signs - A different lyrical approach on this song, but very cleaver 7/10   <br />9. Speechless - This song it alright, not one of my favs but it is still good 5/10   <br />10. That's How You Like It - Reminds me a little of \\"Be With You\\" but its a lil different 6/10   <br />11. The Closer I Get To You - A duet/ballad, I dont dig it but I know that many other people do 6/10   <br />12. Dangerously In Love 2 - The original song off \\"Survivor\\", but a lil different. A very moving song 7/10   <br />13. Beyonce Interlude - Yeah I dont really understand why artist have interludes.........   <br />14. Gift From Virgo - Nice song, to end the album   <br />15. Daddy - a bonus track on the album, dedicated 2 Beyonce's father. 6/10 <br /> <br />As you can see most of these tracks have 7/10 or more rating, thats what makes this album very successful! <br />
B0000262I4|5.0|I must pass my verdict on this recording. Earlier this year I said that I thought that Caballe's 1974 Norma with Vickers and Veasey was the second-greatest interpretation of the role after Callas' Norma. I obviously didn't see this one on the rack! Never before have I heard the duets sung in the original keys, plus the beautiful aria Casta Diva, sung to perfection in yet again the original keys, with such drama! Scotto may not have the frightening lower registers that Callas put in the middle of her voice (unhealthy for her cords, but extremely exciting!!!), but she gave this Norma a life that not even Sutherland, Caballe, Sills, Anderson, Cerquetti, or Gruberova could touch. Christine Goerke, another modern Norma, couldn't even come close with Scotto's interpretation! This Norma truly is a revelation! Norma is my favorite opera, and I'm usually EXTREMELY picky about the Normas that sing this role, and Scotto comes close to my ideal Norma as any diva ever could. She at least had a Norma with a soul! Thankfully! From her entrance recitativo, Sediziose voci, each word is carefully sung with detail that could never be sung by any other Norma after Callas. Her Casta Diva is heavenly, and her duets with Adalgisa are beautiful! Her Deh! Non volerli vittime touches me deeply, and I'm glad that she recorded this role. The Adalgisa in this recording Tatania Troyanos, sings with a tenderness that I have found only in Christa Ludwig's Adalgisa. Montserrat Caballe was simply too much of a soprano to sing the role. I thought her voice fit Adalgisa beautifully, and she does sound young! She sounds even better here than she did in the Met Norma with Sutherland. Giacomini sings Pollione with a fire I haven't heard since Vicker's reading of the role. Very impressive indeed. And then Paul Plishka, the baritone/bass who sings the role of Oroveso with grace and style...and what a voice! He does Sweeney Todd well too, might I add? James Levine, the definitive Metropolitan Opera conductor, gives this performance quite the fast reading for my taste, but then slimming the performance down to two CD's gives this Norma a very \\"LIVE\\" feel. He does conduct with excitement though, and he still gives this a much better reading that Bonynge's two studio Normas with his wife. Highly recommended! <br /> <br />I can't wait until Rene Fleming sings the role of Norma. To see her sing the role of the Druid Priestess along with Vesselina Kasarova would be such a treat! Patrick Summers would make such a great conductor for such a performance, and believe it would be a good idea to cast either Marcello Giordani or Ben Heppner as Pollione. Paul Plishka or Samuel Ramey would be fine choices for Orovesos. Since Renata Scotto loves to work with Rene Fleming, I think she would be a great help in preparing Rene for this very very demanding role (Lilli Lehmann herself said that she would rather have three Gotterdammerung Brunhilldes in one night rather than one Norma).  <br />
B0006IIKS0|2.0|This one drags on far too long.  Heavy metal stars engaging in endless melodrama and psycho-babble isn't my idea of entertainment or enlightenment.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of the movies we luck out when it is made. Yes, while most romantic comedies are un-orignal and un-thought provoking every now and then a decent movie comes along by chance, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is nothing short of genius and made me believe in love.<br /><br />I love this movie!<br /><br />Jim Carrey gives his best performance as Joel who is determined to have his ex-girlfriend Clemintine- Kate Winslet erased from his mind. But, as the erasing process begins he remembers his horrible arugements and incidents that brought about their break-up. But, remembers the things and moments that made him love Winslet. As his memories of her begin to fade Joel realizes all he is losing and goes in a desperate race against time to remember Clemintine. It's a movie that brings a whole new meaning to you don't know what you have until it's gone. By of this movie I was close to crying.<br /><br />Kaufman has written a eleborate, touching, and funny script to the screen and deserved an Academy Award for his work. Jim Carrey has a future in romantic comedies after the first fifteen minutes I found myself swooning after him. Kate Winslet does an excellent portryal as Celmintine whose hair changes with her mood and deserved an Oscar. All in all this movie is spotless.<br />Rent or buy this one and share it with the person you love!
0385510454|1.0|What a let-down from one of our better writers of legal adventure novels. Does Grisham need money so badly that he'd write his own Italian travelogue and dictionary and call it one of his works?

B00005JLEX|5.0|I loved This DVD! I got it for Christmas.I watched The Chinese Restaurant,The Heart Attack,The Jacket,and The Alternate Side. I love it.
B00005JNRB|1.0|First, I must say that i have been looking forward to this movie for some time. I am a huge Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt fan. That being said, this is the worst book to movie adaption ever made. <br /> <br />Before people jump all over me, let me preface this opinion by saying that I understand that it is not possible for a movie to truelly emulate a book because the movie would be 7 hours long. I understand that and I go into the movie with a fair amount of lenience with plot and theme changes. <br /> <br />This movie should not be called Sahara and Clive Cussler's name should not be used in conjunction with this movie. People, The book is fantastic. It is smart, the characters are great and it is increadibly entertaining. Dirk Pitt is my all time favorite character in all of fiction.  The character portrayed in the movie was not Dirk Pitt. Not even close.  <br /> <br />I can honestly say that less then 5% of the books plots, themes, character types, and dialogue made it into the movie. I am talking about a best seller book here. Apparently, The director of this disaster felt he should change everything. And I mean everything. Not only are the charecters horribly casted (especially Al Giordinos character), the characters in the movie are pretty much opposite of what they should be. <br /> <br />The director apparently believes that the viewing public are idiots and cant understand complex and smart themes and plots. This movie is so dumbed down, its laughable. I have never been so disapointed in a film in my life. The characters are transformed from smart, poised, and clever science engineers to idiotic and silly treasure hunters. <br /> <br />Message to directors. The public are not stupid. If characters of a BEST SELLING book are not \\"treasure hunters\\" you dont have to make them \\"treasure hunters\\" to sell more movie tickets. <br /> <br />It really is a shame that Clive Cussler and his masterpiece characters: Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker and Rudi Gunnare portrayed in such a ridiculously bad manner.   <br /> <br />I ask anyone who has a serious interest in good stories and good characters to please read the book and save yourself from the the completely dumbed down and ludicrous action/adventure flick \\"Sahara.\\" <br /> <br />I must reitterate that this movie is not bad simply because they botched the book. This movie, even if it hadnt been a book, is absolutely horrible. Horrible with a capital H.  <br /> <br />It is my mission to spread the word so that this movie makes as little money as possible and hopefully we will never have to experience another movie like it. I am that passionate about my hatred for this film.  <br /> <br />Dont see it. Tell people not to go see it. If the preview comes on the TV, change the channel. If someone brings it up at a lunch or dinner, change the subject or leave. Just pretend it never happened. Im Serious...... <br />
B000008LOV|5.0|I bought this album (on cassette) when it was released, and I still consider it one of the 10 best ever, even though I can't seem to find it on CD.  Almost every track is brilliant, but what's most incredible about it is that it actually made me rethink my total hatred of \\"country\\" music...Roy Orbison's performance on this album made me go out and buy everything he ever recorded that I could get my hands on.  And then, just like that, he was gone.  I already loved the music of Harrison, Dylan, Petty, and Lynne, but this album definitely expanded my horizons.  Get it any way you can!
0780020693|4.0|Fellini's film 'Amarcord' catches glimpses of the directors' genius in a series of events tied together in poetic fashion. The Film has enough cinematic gestures and symbols to keep film students busy for years. The charm of this film, although it excells in so many ways, falls short of making it as profound as some of Fellini's films of the 60's. It did not have the same astounding feel of La Dolce Vita or 8 and a half.<br /><br />The style of the film, however, is flawless and the cinematography by Rotunno is beautiful. I am sure many people will like this movie and rate it as a masterpiece - it just did not give the 5 star punch I so wanted to get from it.
B0000074BS|5.0|This is one of my favorites. When I am stressed or feeling out of sorts, I just listen to this album and feel soothed. It is gorgeous and lush, yet simple. It has to be one of the most underrated, exceptional albums of all time.
B00005ASOC|3.0|I really feel that Rob Brown was miscast.  His acting is mediocre at best.  He has no presence, no passion.  The only way we know he likes to write is cuz he spends a good deal of the movie writing.  If the role of Jamal had been filled by someone witha  little more talent i think this movie would have been more worthwhile.  And as a side note Busta Rhymes performance was much better then Brown's until the end of the movie.
B00006IRJU|3.0|In my opinion, this was Icehouse's least impressive album. I believe this was their attempt at reaching a mainstream U.S. audience - John Oates co-wrote \\"Electric Blue\\", and Hall & Oates were one of the best-selling U.S. bands of the time. Given that their previous work, Measure for Measure, was produced by Brian Eno and was marvelous, this is a letdown in comparison. Way overproduced and the songs that are meant to sound deep and political come across as somewhat contrived and lacking substance. I'm a huge fan of this band, but this is my least favorite album of theirs.
B000089CJI|2.0|This is by no means a bad album, but it's a bit grating to listen to after a while.  Granted it has its catchy songs, the one played on the Garden State trailer, and so forth but even the Shins's cover of the Silhouettes song is better, and more interesting.  You've got \\"sad\\" (as in, please be more original) lyrics that you hope were better written: \\"Don't wake me up, plan on sleeping in\\".  Come on, Gibbard - you're in Death Cab...supposedly you're supposed to be somewhat inspiring.  Not that I like Death Cab at all. <br />Also, the electronic mish-mash which is at first interesting, turns out to be very repetitive, nondescript, immemorable as well as all the melodies sounding similar that by the end, you'll just be exhausted and not want to listen to it again. <br /> <br />Verdict, have not listened to it for almost a year and I do not miss it one bit.  It seems the whole album was rushed, and some songs tacked on to complete it.  Also, the guitar in the bridges seem out of place for being overly simplistic and in the wrong context.  It's like those crappy pop songs with random pretentious guitars.  Not worth your money, unless you really like Gibbard...he also sings in a monotone, devoid of emotion.  It's a \\"cute\\" voice, but lacking the range and expressiveness of many vocalists.
B00001OH7V|4.0|This, along with most of Lodger, is the best of the Berlin Trilogy. It has some of the Philadelphia R&B of Young Americans in Sons of the Silent Age and the synth-pop of Low and Station to Station in V-2 Schneider and most of the second half. It also closes with a cool, pop song The Secret Life of Arabia. Overall, the best of the three by far. I can't give it a 5-star rating because that belongs on Ziggy Stardust or Hunky Dory. But this, along with Station to Station and The Man Who Sold The World, does deserve 4 and 1/2 stars.

B000065V1V|5.0|I am a big fan of the Ziggy era, my favorite albums of David Bowie are \\"Ziggy Stardust and the Spider from Mars\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\". This album is quite different from both of these albums, but I think that Bowie still has some few tricks up his sleeves that everytime he makes more music, it sounds better than the last. This album is very relaxing and smooth. It is very creative and enjoyable. I hope others will enjoy it too.
B00005A46T|1.0|Don't waste your time on this cd or any from this genre if you want to listen to real metal. Mallcore is not metal. If you want to get into real metal, try prog, thrash, speed, death, melodic deeath, grind, power, black, or classic metal. Teenage angst-based immature lyrics, silly costumes, repetetive downtuned power chords, and mall rat fans all contribute to make Slipknot the pits.
B000670DQI|5.0|I was a casual fan before, liked his hits and loved Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust but never got into more of his albums. Back to Reality. I Like the music and lyrics even though the meaning often eludes me. It's produced well with good performances and harmonies by the band (mostly the same people that are touring with Dave on his Reality tour). Great sound textures. Get the album.
B000001Y2U|5.0|You can nitpick about Marilyn's antipathy with Christianity all you want, but this album has wonderful lyrics and good music that almost everyone can enjoy. This is a really personal album for him I think. He has three albums which are personal to him. <br />  Portrait of an American Family is about the secrets and all the two-facedness of American families. Mechanical Animals is about drug addiction and Antichrist Superstar is about the hypocrisy of religion and the way its only used to hold people down and keep people from truly expressing themselves. <br /> Irresponsible Hate Anthem: 7/10. It has awsome drumming but its a little too hard for me. <br /> The Beautiful people: 9/10. Great lyrics and good music. Its not the best on the album but nonetheless it got the most radio play. <br /> Dried up, Tied up, and Dead to the World: 10/10. Great lyrics, great electronics, great drumming and a really gritty and emotional look at drug addiction. <br /> Tourniquet: 10/10. A very good cover of a Rasputina song. <br /> Little Horn: 8/10. Is good and has good drumming but fades into white noise after awhile. <br /> Cyrptorchild: 9/10. Amazing lyrics. If you close your eyes listening to it, it has really good imagery as well. <br /> Deformography: 10/10 Good lyrics and a very cynical and biting sound <br /> Wormboy 10/10. A very good jab at Christianity <br /> Mister Superstar: 10/10. I think this song is poking fun at religion. Its saying, if people can take celebtries and worship them and make gods of them, maybe they did the same thing with Jesus and created a whole religion out of just a normal guy. <br /> Angel with the Scabbed Wings: 7/10 <br />
B00001OH7U|5.0|I like the whole album and just cant put it away sometimes. Bowie at his best again! If you've seen \\"A Knight's Tale\\", you've heard \\"Golden Years\\" already. This album is great. Check it out!
0694013889|5.0|My daughter loves loves loves this book.  She has about six other potty training books but could care less about them.  I try to read her any other potty book and she yells \\"No! Once Upon a Potty!  Once Upon a Potty!\\"  Yes, it is explicit.  Prudence is indeed stark naked.  Yes, she does bend over to show you the hole in her bottom for making poo poo.  But frankly, if you have a hard time talking about body parts and functions with your two year old, I fear for you when your child hits puberty.   <br />My daughter has been very successful with her training and in our house, we don't just go potty, we \\"go potty like Prudence!\\" <br />
B0007GADZO|5.0|First of all, Steve Vai is probably one of the most evolving guitarists of our times. In an age of talentless skanky (not that i don't like skanky) hags it's inspiring to hear someone with an incredible sense of harmony and music itself.]<BR>Building The Church starts out with a tpping intro where he mutes the strings with his picking hand and taps with his left hand. The song is so melodic and smartly thought putting emphasis on lyrical instead of blazing passages. Dying for your love is set in a eary melodic feeling with ok lyrics. Glorious is an awesome song on its own. K'm-Pee-Du-Wee is basically wat Steve makes his guitar &quot;say&quot;. Very legato feel to this beautiful lullaby. Firewall is a funk driven song that starts with a beat box percussion mouth thing, hilarious. Pretty good lyrics. NOw the climax, and my favourite song Freak SHow Excess, Steves result of his enjoyment of Bulgarian Wedding Music. He moves throughout the song focusing on the phrasing while blazing through 7/8 and 7/16 time signatures, WOW!Lotus Feet, made me want to cry, truly a masterpiece and YaiYai, well u have to listen to that one hehehe. Midway Creatures starts oout with a low tuned heavy riff and so does the rest. The 2 last songs are actually pretty good with lyrics. So if u are open to different ideas or just enjoy steves amazing chops and amazing fell for harmony and melodic passages, BUY THIS CD NOW
B00004ZD69|5.0|This album is incredible. The sound is like nothling you've heard before. I strongly recoment it to amyone who is interested in the progressive rock and is looking for a brake from the ordinary world to enter the world of experimentation and sensuality. Godspeed...
B0002X314C|5.0|In a medium overtly dominated by gimmicks and popular appeal with no meaning, finally music fans have a chance to experience a great artist in the making. Soul and R&B has been waiting for a male artist to break out of the box of normality and dullness, and bring back the pure art form of songwriting musicality. John Legend brings simplicity back to the industry while offering something that fans have been waiting for: originality. From beginning to end, this album bleeds of profound heart felt lyrics while musically staying on point with every track. Get Lifted is an incredible album and one that truly boasts the making of a remarkably talented individual and artist. We are truly noticing the making of a Legend.
B000002KIT|5.0|First off I'll start by saying that track #7 still in love with you, is the best live song that i ever heard, if your into that  slow ,heartbreaking,slice your wrist kind of song.Anywhoo the song warrior is a great example of that awesome live lizzy sound,I didn't even care for the song to much on the jailbreak album,however on this album the song is amazing!Emerald and suicide are also incredible on this album,and what else can you say about Phil Lynott the guy was simply awesome,if there was one musician in the world that i would like to meet it would be him, but unfortunately he left us to early. R.I.P to Phil Lynott your truly an inspiration.
B0000012Y1|5.0|I agree with Mr. Lau (the previous reviewer) that this magnificent performance under the direction of Raphael Kubelik is greatly under-rated and neglected.  I similarly concur with Mr. Lau's evaluation of the singers, except that I find James King even more effective than he does.<br /><br />Those who love this opera will want to search out and consider (and very likely purchase) two other recordings.  The first is the live recording of a 1954 Bayreuth performance under the direction of Eugen Jochum on the Opera D'Oro label (very inexpensive).  The mono sound is very good.  For starters, look it up here on amazon.com and read the reviews! The second (and most often admired) is the 1964 EMI studio recording under the direction of Rudolph Kempe with the Vienna Philharmonic.  It is available at mid-price.  The stereo sound, as with the Kubelik recording, is outstanding in clarity and depth.  Both the Jochum and the Kempe recordings are readily available.  DG (Universal) does not make the Kubelik recording generally available in the USA, so one has to hunt it down as a special import at higher cost.  It is worth the hunt and the cost.<br /><br />Kubelik's other Wagner recordings have deservedly won highest praise, but they, too, are hard to find and often neglected.  They are listed on amazon.com and it is worth your while seeking them out:  Die Meistersinger and Parsifal were recorded in glorious stereo sound with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and with casts that cannot be bettered.  They were recorded in the 1980s and each released some 15 to 20 years later on less known or in-house European labels.
B000002GLT|5.0|I bought the CD of John Mayall's album USA Union to replace my LP - it wears awfully well.  This is a soft, rhythmic album with a blues feeling.  I particularly love the contributions of Don Harris, an \\"improvising violinist.\\"  (Heck, I thought that was a fiddle).  Listen to him in the sample of the song \\"Crying!\\"  You've also got Larry Taylor, bass guitar; Harvey Mandel, lead guitar; and John Mayall's laid-back vocals, some harmonica, and some piano.  All songs written by John Mayall.  Good listening.
1591396190|5.0|This is the most pragmatic book available today for those wishing to guide their organization to new heights of success. Few of us will have a chance to implement Collins' ideas and lead a company from Good to Great. But, many of us will have a chance to design and lead a great strategic move. The unique value in this book is that the benefits of the ideas are actually within the reach of most readers.  <br /> <br />There are two great books on innovation: Drucker's Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Kim and Mauborgne's Blue Ocean Strategy. Drucker defines innovation as the tool of the entrepreneur. In this case, entrepreneur means the change agent not the small business owner. The entrepreneur searches for change in the economy and society, defines an appropriate response to change, and exploits the solution as an opportunity. Drucker's book stood alone as the best work on Innovation and Entrepreneurship for twenty years. Drucker also defines the entrepreneur not as a risk taker, but, as one that defines risks and confines them. <br /> <br />Blue Ocean Strategy contains a useful collection of tools to help entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial leaders identify opportunities, define and refine responses, and launch new products and services to create significant gains for their organization. This book teaches you how to succeed in the overcrowded markets of the global economy by keeping a focus on delivering superior value to consumers, and more importantly to those who are currently non-consumers. Unlike those who call for more risk taking, the authors wisely clarify the major risks to making such dramatic strategic moves and they provide tools to mitigate each of those risks. Drucker provides the context for innovation; Kim and Mauborgne provide the tools to do it. <br /> <br />I've been a serious student of innovation over the last few years. In this time I've collected and reviewed countless books and articles on innovation and business strategy. To guide my searchfor useful ideas, I had imagined a CEO delivering a compelling speech exhorting all in attendance to be more innovative. Then following the speech the business leaders agree and ask the question: What do you want us to do? I was searching for useful tools the CEO could use to answer that question. Blue Ocean Strategy is such a collection of tools. <br />

B000056IKU|2.0|As a big fan of 70's Krautrock, I've been intrigued by the buzz surrounding Neu! in hipster circles these days.  They seem to enjoy a higher standing than excellent bands like Can, Popol Vuh and Kraftwerk, and my excitement increased when the cashier at the hip, indie-type record store practically gushed over my brilliant selection.  So I rushed home to listen to it and.....was completely underwhelmed to say the least.<br /><br />This band has quite the cult following, who I'm sure will be hitting that \\"unhelpful\\" button, but I'm sorry.  I gotta call 'em the way I hear 'em.  The entire second half of this record consists of the band taking two (rather mediocre) songs and then playing them at the wrong speeds like little kids playing with their parents' stereo.  That's right, they actually recorded the songs being played at 16 rpm or 78 rpm or whatever, and expected people to both pay for and be entertained by it.  To me it's \\"experimentalism\\" at it's most pretentious and annoying (not to mention lazy-how about just writing some songs or something?)<br /><br />The opening \\"Fur Immer\\" is actually a very nice encapsulation of the Krautrock sound, as Neu! lays down some interesting synth and guitar textures over a driving beat.  Unfortunately, the bass player's decision to play exactly one note throughout wears thin about halfway through the eleven minute running time.  \\"Lila Engel\\" is instructive as an influence on the post-rock movement.  Play this for any Mogwai fan and they'll instantly recognize the musical language.<br /><br />Maybe I just picked the wrong introduction to the band.  Maybe Neu! and Neu 75 are better, but after blowing sixteen bucks on this one I'm not sure I'm in a hurry to find out.
B000002UAX|5.0|This supremely eclectic and sublime collection of songs and sounds by the \\"Fabulous Four\\" most assuredly bumps the Christ out of one Engelbert Humperdinck. No fooling.
B000002J0B|5.0|Here's the review song by song. <br /> <br />The Song Remains the Same: This is an interesting song because you can see their getting expiremental with how they use their instruments.  Not the best one, but it's good. <br /> <br />The Rain Song: Dude. Dude. Very good song.  Very calm and optomistic because it's about spring, not about sadness as the name might imply. <br /> <br />Over the Hills and Far Away: This song was so good, I felt obliged to learn to play it and plan to play it live (in front of HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE).  The beggining is calm but quickly turns into a fast and upbeat anthem.  Plant does very well vocally. <br /> <br />The Crunge:  Err... I respect it, but not MY personal favorite.  Seems unnatural for some reason. <br /> <br />Dancing Days:  This song is cool.  More signs of experimental riffs and lyrics.  Upbeat. <br /> <br />Dyer Maker: Haha, very cool.  Signs of Zeppelin having a since of humor, or they were being VERY experimental.  Reggae?  They really make it work, though the thought of Led Zep playing reggae is questionable. <br /> <br />No Quarter: This song is mystical, slow, and probably the darkest song on the album.  But thats not really saying much because it really is an upbeat album.  Fairly long and about 7 and a half minutes.  Just cool. <br /> <br />The Ocean:  This song most resembles their older guitar driven days.  It's very cool, but not \\"bad ass\\" like some people like.  It's modest.  I actually like the fact that it's not all \\"bad ass\\".  There's  also a hidden joke in this song.  At 4:20 in the song Plant says \\"oohhhhhh soooo goood.\\"  Oh those Zeppelin boys... (shakes head) <br /> <br />All in all it's just another brick in the wall.  What? No.  It's a good album, buy it or listen to it.  Yeah. <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|A relationship commences the instant two individuals meet.  Eye contact leads to conversation which builds a connection between the people involved in the mutual communication.  This moment of communication is occasionally emotionally loaded where the involved begin to explore each other's compatibilities.  If there is a mutual harmony the conversation usually progresses.  However, communication is not the only thing needed for a romantic relationship, as the possibility of physical closeness where an opportunity of sharing thoughts, feelings, and secrets brings about a bond of trust.  Trust is what unites people, as they let the other closer into themselves with the intention of mutual expectation of protection and nurturing love.  Some have much difficulty building this trust as it can take years after a painful memory when their trust once was broken.  Closer brings the audience the moment where trust begins and ends in a visual dissection of human emotions where pain, suffering, love, trust, and much more are explored.<br /><br />Closer offers a Bergmanesque experience which dives deep into the psyche of the four main characters of the story.  Through the four characters the audience is allowed into a secret and personal world, a world most can identify through self scrutiny.  In a sense, Closer comes closer to the audience, as the mirror of our thoughts and feelings creeps slowly closer until we can feel the cold reflective surface pressing against our noses.  Yet, it is also distinctively unique as the situation, location, and the words that are said are strange and unfamiliar to the audience, as the viewers bring their own notions, experiences, values, and morals to the viewing of the film.  Nonetheless, the director Mike Nichols, with the help of the four talented actors in the film, brings the audience a long painful lesson of how people are getting closer to one another.<br /><br />The story opens in London with Dan (Jude Law) taking his morning stroll to work, as he does everyday, when he stumbles across a refreshing sight in the American girl Alice (Natalie Portman).  Alice is accidentally hit by a car which brings them closer for the moment, as their closeness to one another continues through Dan's nurturing care for Alice's injury.  Initially they study each other visually, through words, and touch, as they begin to build an emotional bond through humor and personal thoughts.  This is the beginning of a romantic relationship that brings them close, but it does not eliminate a tiny space between them as Dan never truly gives himself to Alice.  It appears as if Dan is looking for something else, yet he is not really sure what it is he is looking for, but he seems to be looking for something better.  Yet, Dan remains within the relationship, maybe out of convenience and because he does not want to hurt Alice.  The mental absence of Dan creates an emotional distance between them, which Alice feels strongly as she senses a looming pain being sent her way at any moment through Dan leaving her.<br /><br />Through a couple of years of living together Dan has reached more success as a writer, maybe with the emotional support of Alice, and he is to take a picture for his upcoming book.  Taking the picture is a stunning American, Anna (Julia Roberts), who tells Dan that she liked his book, as he notices portraits around in the photo studio that catch his eye.  This begins an infatuation between Anna and Dan.  It seems as if Dan seeks someone equally successful that can provide additional emotional support to elevate his career.  In a sense, Dan seems to be an emotional opportunist that craves affection, yet he is incapable of fully providing for others who need it as much.<br /><br />On the internet, in a chat room, Dan pretends to be Anna where he meets Larry (Clive Owen), a medical doctor, as they preoccupy themselves with cybersex.  Eventually, this chatting leads to them planning a rendezvous at the city aquarium, as Dan has learned that Anna likes to find people there to take their portrait.  Larry who is all excited about the planned meeting finds himself in a somewhat awkward situation, as he realizes that he has been set up.  Nonetheless, Anna and Larry seem to find each other, as they begin to date through Dan's little prank which turns him into cupid.<br /><br />The film continues to explore more of the four characters personal psychology, and what drives them to do what they are doing.  Nichols cleverly depicts how they get closer through terrific visuals and a well-written script, which balances the brilliant performances of the small cast.  The visuals bring out their unique personalities through delicately balanced contrasts, warm and cold lighting, and mise-en-scene that offers both closeness and distance.  These visual elements enhance the emotionally painful moments where the cast must bring out the best of themselves in order to make it feel authentic, which they do to perfection.  This makes the lines sound vibrant and alive while hurtful and loving words are exchanged in the privacy of the characters.  At last, the film offers a poignantly brilliant cinematic experience that tears the soul and rips the heart while they all are trying to find a way to get closer to one another.m, as Dan has learned that Anna likes to find people there to take their portrait.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|I first must say, this movie is not for the prudish or self righteous.  There is graphic dialogue and actions.  However, I found it be a truly brilliant study of relationships.  I think it's for anyone who's ever been dumped, dumped someone, been cheated on, or cheated on someone.  If you think about it, everyone falls into one of those categories at one time or another.  Performance wise, I think Clive Owen and Natalie Portman steal the movie, and definitely deserved their nominations and accolades.  However, I also feel that Julia Roberts has solidified herself even more as a truly gifted and natural actress in this role.  Especially affective is her scene with Clive Owen on the staircase of their apartment, discussing past discretions with brutal honesty and emotion.  Jude Law, while a gifted actor, is the one who falls short in this film if you ask me.  While he doesn't necessarily fail, he just doesn't seem to be able to rise to the same level as the other three stars.  Needless to say, this is not a happy movie.  And it's not a movie for everyone.  But I think anyone who watches it can relate to it, in some small way.
B00009MGQL|4.0|If you can't get behind the guitar madness of the genius track Plan B then you are too stayed in your old ways or you might be dead already ! I'm 49 and a fan for years and can see what Jeff's doing..like Miles Davis before him he is staying cool for life. You old-schoolers like me (not) catch up to the 21st Century!

B0000TB03W|4.0|This is a very good DVD concert, and I would recommend \\"Up\\" for Shania fans and collectors of music performance videos alike.  Shania is beautiful, talented and personable, and has an amazingly tight and versatile stage band.  She also interacts very well with her fans; there were a number of \\"audience participation\\" vignettes, including an adorable accompaniment by three young girls singing \\"I'm Gonna' Getcha.\\"  The rest of the on-stage audience participation was interesting the first time, but one might fast forward through the second time.  Nevertheless, it was classic Shania making her fans part of the show. <br /> <br />The sound quality of this disc worked better for me in stereo than in 5.1.  I'm not sure why (I'll check my settings), but the center channel in 5.1 projected a tiny bit too weekly so the vocals didn't punch through consistently like I would have expected.  In CD stereo, everything was crystal clear, and given all the instrumentation of Shania's band, the balance was excellent. <br /> <br />In terms of video image, I'd rate this an A+, with vibrant colors and a sharp picture.  I was mildly disappointed with the editing, which I found to be much too rapid throughout the entire performance:  the same camera view rarely stayed on-screen for more than one measure, and I was wishing I had a little more time to dwell on some of the vantage points.  [Also, note:  there are no DVD extras] <br /> <br />All in all, this is a concert DVD that just about anyone can enjoy.
0312962118|3.0|It's 1953, and Joseph Stalin is nearing the end of his life.  Hardly a cause for celebration among his enemies, Stalin's impending demise signals that he's on the verge of his most reckless adventure yet - WWIII.  Hoping to forestall the Soviets before they can perfect the H-bomb, the CIA dispatches their most elusive assassin to off Stalin for good.  With a beautiful woman at his side - a Russian who escaped the brutal Gulags, but left her daughter behind - the assassin eludes every dragnet the Soviets leave in his pathm but one.  Unfortunately, the mission of the assassin, codenamed \\"Snow Wolf\\" is compromised before it even touches Soviet-bloc soil.  Yet the Wolf feels confident he can reach his target.  Meanwhile, Jake Massey, the American spymaster who set the mission going, is ordered to kill it - and his agents if he has to.  With the details of the mission known to the Russians, the west is terrified that the soviets will use Stalin's murder as an excuse for war.<br /><br />This was a book I'd wanted to read for years, but the results are disappointing.  There's little to break away from the pack of McLean, Forsythe or Ludlum or their imitators.  The dialog and prose are flat, and the characters are cardboard caricatures - you learn little more about them than needed to set the good guys from bad (especially a KGB sadist named Romulka who'll pose problems for the Americans and Russians alike).  Those flaws aside, \\"Snow Wolf\\" is boring - it takes forever to get its act together, and by then, it's lost sight of what its about.  Nothing in the latter part of the book ratifies the fears of the former - that Stalin is on his last legs, and plans to go out with a thermo-nuclear bang; that the Russians are on the verge of starting WWIII; that the Soviet Union is a police state inhabited by loyal and ideology-enslaved communists ready to destroy the world).  The story hints at some secret held by Anna Khorev, the Wolf's companion - but then forgets about her and turns her into the standard damsel-in-distress.  Worse, losing sight of the ideas it started with, \\"Snow Wolf\\" doesn't create any new ones, or become any character's story.  It focuses on the Wolf's hunter, a KGB officer names Lukin who, unsurprisingly, turns out to be a too-decent guy to kill his prey.  There's a late plot twist revealed in the last few chapters, but it's been botched as well - the existence of the secret is revealed near the beginning, so you're already primed for it.  The revelation of the secret follows the rest of the novel's style of unnecessarily over-baked dialog, and the revelation itself just has you scratching your head.  That said, the plot holes aren't terribly huge, but do beg for your attention - though the story is told from the viewpoint of Anna Khoreva (no spoiler - she's introduced early on), much of the book occurs out of her presence.  Also, the idea that Soviets would blame the west seems pretty much out the window once they learn of the Wolf's mission.  Don't they have enough to blame the west already?  The novel posits a Soviet armed camp poised to strike at the rest of the world, but never hints of this once we actually get to Moscow.<br /><br />But worst of all, \\"Snow Wolf\\" just doesn't hold your attention.

0385512058|5.0|A few months ago, I decided to leave a solitary life of working from home to reestablish a career in Product Management/Marketing.  Sorry to say, I had allowed my business contacts to wither and now face the task of rebuilding my relationships and my reputation within the high tech community I wish to rejoin. In this endeavor, I found the book both useful and inspiring.   <br /> <br />Throughout his book, Keith Ferrazzi emphasizes integrity, building strong lasting relationships, and creating abundance through learning to give and receive freely.  These elements are evident in the organization of the book into four sections: <br />1. The Mind-set <br />2. The Skill Set <br />3. Turning Connections into Compatriots <br />4. Trading up and Giving Back <br />This book has clarified my thoughts about networking which has helped me to become more focused and more confident in my interactions.  It has provided me with many ideas to better maintain and deepen my contacts.  And, it has provided me with food for thought as I consider how I want to put the lessons I've learned from this book into practice.   The book is a great read (including the \\"Connectors Hall of Fame Profiles\\") and has lots to offer to those of us who build our careers around networking as well as to those just looking for some advice in expanding beyond current boundaries.   <br />
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album is a lot less fluid and rap influenced than \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" \\"Meteora\\" is denser, with more real singing and there sure is a lot more yelling. Whether this a good thing or a bad thing, it's safe to say Linkin Park have survived their sophmore outing and escaped the \\"sophmore slump.\\"<br /><br />After \\"Reanimation\\", I was wondering just how much Linkin Park were planning on using their guitars on their sophmore release. I was not a fan of \\"Reanimation.\\" I thought it was more of a techno/rap C.D. But, with \\"Meteora\\", it's also safe to say that the guitars are very much involved.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Somewhere I Belong\\" has a good intro which leads into the guitars. This song has pretty good rapping with good DJ scratches, but I must have heard this song too much or something, because now I hardly listen to anything past two minutes into the song (the teen angst yelling at the end gets on my nerves.)<br /><br />\\"Lying from You\\" has another good intro (which makes a \\"beeping\\" noise), then explodes into the guitars. There are some good, swirling riffs and a couple of good DJ scratches on this song.<br /><br />The guitars on \\"Hit the Floor\\" grind well (some are comparing this song to Pantera), while \\"Easier to Run\\" boasts an irresistable, sing along chorus with soaring vocals. All of which would've made this song a good single. Most of the songs on this C.D. are centered around a similar, big and catchy chorus.<br /><br />\\"Faint\\" begins with what sounds like almost an orchestra, then turns to a typical rap/rock song. The rap on this one is smoothe and the yelling parts are towering, but what I enjoy most on this song is the catchy drum beat and the way the guitars start and stop.<br /><br />However, there are some \\"Hybrid Theory\\"-esque moments:<br /><br />\\"Breaking the Habit\\" is a personal favorite. It's a techno cut, making it a lot less noisy than all the other songs. The vocals (which are usually rapped or screamed) are calmly sung over the soft strings, a repeating drum beat and DJ scratching. It's a personal favorite, even though it's techno, because it's very nearly danceable.<br /><br />\\"Nobody's Listening\\" is more of a straight forward rap song, with another good chorus, while \\"Session\\" is an instrumental which echoes \\"Cure for the Itch\\". This song again shows us how talented the DJ (Joseph Hahn) is.<br /><br />But, for the most part, this album has less rap tempos, more powerful guitars and yelling. However there are some of moments (\\"Session\\", \\"Nobody's Listening\\") which are as fluid as anything on \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" Linkin Park have made more of a straight forward rock C.D., while also remaining true to their roots. The end result is a record which should please all of their fans. If you are sick of the radio singles, I urge you to check out the rest of the album, because there are several more good songs on here, and even a few great ones. However, if you didn't like \\"Hybrid Theory\\", don't expect this to change your mind.a repeating drum beat and DJ scratching.

015603008X|5.0|I've read a long list of books, and this one would definitely rank in my top 5.  Not only is this book entertaining, it is very educational and moving as well. <br /> <br />This is the story of Charlie Gordon, a 30 year old man with an I.Q of 68.  He is mentally retarded, but is eager to learn and wants more than anything 'to be smart'.  The book is told in first person, similar to a diary, but named 'progress reports'.  Charlie becomes the guinea pig of a very ambitious scientific experiment, designed to increase the i.q of the subject very quickly and dramatically.  Over the course of the book, Charlie changes from a man with the mental capacity of of a small boy, to a genius at his intellectual peak.   <br /> <br />This story is incredibly engrossing and interesting.  I myself had a fair few revelations during my reading, about the meaning being intelligent and what makes somebody a good person, and how to judge people. I felt thoroughly enlightened by the end of the book.   <br /> <br />What makes this book stand out is that it is very unique.  In a way, it reminds me of 'Catcher in the rye' by J.D. Salinger, as it is only a short book, but somebody could write an essay twice as long just talking about it.  I would recommend this book to anyone who took the time to read the review.  If you are interested in it enough to look at its page on amazon, you are the type of person who would like it.  However, friends would enjoy it too. <br /> <br />After all, famous books aren't famous for nothing -- they're famous because so many people have enjoyed them and passed the message on.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is my very first taste of Pat Metheny, as I'm more recently getting into smooth jazz and such.  I was just blown away as to how much I really enjoy listening to this album.  It has a little bit of everything but yet seems to all come together (hard to explain).  Just get a really good feeling when I listen to this album.  I usually listen to it in the car on my daily commute and haven't gotten tired of it yet!  It's the Best place to listen to this type of music so you can feel relaxed and ready for the day.  Pat's jazz guitar in track two is reminiscent of Django Reinhardt, which is intricate in itself.  I think this record just shows a well done band effort and definately got me started on my Metheny collection!  Also the recording quality is digital and sounds very clean.  Recommended!
0140277447|1.0|Quote from Economist <br /> <br />JAPAN'S prime ministers and its emperor have apologised to China for the brutal conduct of the occupying Japanese army in the 1930s-1940s on no fewer than 17 occasions since the two countries restored diplomatic relations in 1972. Seven years ago, Japan also made a written apology for its harsh colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, in 1910-45. But its expressions of regret have never been seen as quite sufficient, especially by China. So, though relations between the East Asian powers have improved greatly since the end of the second world war, Japan's big neighbours remain acutely sensitive to any words or deeds on its part that suggest a lack of genuine contrition.  <br /> <br />
B0006A9FMI|3.0|I saw this film at a theater when it came out, it was subtitled, but not captioned for the hearing impaired. It is a wonderful film, but NOT in this DVD release. I could only watch 10 minutes of it because every sound is labeled on the screen. It is very annoying and distracting. I wish I had read the customer reviews before I bought it!  <br />P.S. I mailed the disc back to the company and was sent a disc with English subtitles. Now I'm happy! This is a very artistic film, a philosophical meditation on the question, \\"What does it mean to be a human being?\\"  <br />
B00005JKGO|5.0|`La Dolce Vita' (The Sweet Life), written and directed by Fredrico Fellini is probably the great Italian director's best known film, which occurs on more than one list of the top ten films of all times. It is most certainly on my list. This new DVD set is a very capable presentation of the film, including my very favorite feature, a voice over commentary track. As the director and many other principles connected with the film are gone, American film critic and historian, Richard Schickel, does this commentary track.<br /><br />For those how know nothing of the movie, it is spoken largely in Italian with a few English speeches from American `film stars' played by Anita Ekberg and Lex Barker, among others. The picture covers an indeterminate number of days in the life of an Italian gossip columnist for, I believe, the International Edition of the Herald-Tribune. Schickel's commentary cites eight episodes, most beginning in the afternoon or evening, carrying through that night, and resolving in the early morning light. Aside from Marcello Mastroianni's character, Marcello, and his function as a reporter on cultural and entertainment happenings, there is relatively little direct connection between the events in the eight scenes. They all, of course, happen in and around the city of Rome in 1959, where we see an enormous amount of rebuilding after the end of World War II. As I was in Rome in 1964 and saw many of the locations where this movie was shot, this great construction effort is quite real. Since there is very little story in this three-hour movie, the whole point of the movie is the life and experiences of the observer, Marcello.<br /><br />Commentators on this movie, Schickel among them, have developed lots of theories about the images, allusions, and statements made, indirectly in the business and dialogue in the movie. And, since there is very little overt sexuality, I have to believe that some of the `messages', especially an anti-clerical message derived from the movie is very real, especially to conservative Europeans. This is probably the easiest subliminal theme to cull from the story, but it is certainly not the only one. With enough thought, I suspect one can develop some pretty cogent themes involving water, food (especially bananas), circular staircases, and animals (especially cats). All this means is that these 180 minutes are one of the richest cinematic environments created by any filmmaker.<br /><br />Since the movie is in Italian, there are few memorable quotes from the dialogue (although I have an excellent memory of one line, `And to think he played Tarzan', spoken about Lex Barker by one of the paparazzi. Lex Barker did in fact play Tarzan in several movies, and it is he, not Johnny Weismuller who sticks in my mind as Tarzan), but some of the visual images are among the most widely quoted pictures in the cinematic dictionary. Three of the most famous are the opening shot of a statue of Christ being flown to the Vatican by helicopter; the closing shot of the very large dead fish being hauled to shore in a net, juxtaposed with a shot of an innocent girl becoming to Marcello by the fish; and the most famous of all, the scene with Anita Ekberg wading in the Trevi fountain by night with a small cat (oddly, in the movie, Ekberg is never seen holding the cat in the fountain, although my feeble memory would swear to this scene before I watched it again on this DVD).<br /><br />One of the great things about Schickel's commentary is that since he had nothing to do with the making of the movie, he has no special knowledge of what may have been going on in Fellini's mind when the movie was being written or shot. Therefore, we are perfectly free to object to his observations. And, there is more than one of his observations with which I find issue. One is that Schickel buys into the theory that the movie is anti-clerical. There is no question that the church or some Christian image appears in many of the scenes, butI really do not see them depicted in a negative light. I see that the church is not relevant to Marcello, but then neither is his father or his girlfriend.<br /><br />And, it is Marcello's apathy towards everything except getting information for his columns and connecting with famous or rich women like Ekberg and Anouk Aimee's characters for inconsequential sexual liaisons. He seems quite detached from Emma, his live in girlfriend, as he seems almost totally detached from his barren apartment, since he can't take Ekberg there, as Emma is in residence.<br /><br />One thing with which I agree with Schickel is that `La Dolce Vita' seems to have more in common with films from Fellini's contemporaries such as Antonioni than it does with Fellini's earlier neo-realistic works and his later impressionistic works such as `Satyricon'. I would especially contrast it with Fellini's next film, `8 ½', which is often considered his best. While `La Dolce Vita' hides its moral behind a veiled curtain, to me the point of `8 ½' is positively opaque. I simply have never understood it, while I can watch `La Dolce Vita' over at least once a year. A sure sign of a film worth buying.<br /><br />One point on which I differ with Schickel is that Marcello is not really a paparazzi. `Paparazzi' are photographers and Marcello is a writer. This is important because this movie was the source of the word, based on the name of Marcello's photographic colleague who probably works on the same paper with Marcello, since they are seen going to assignments together.<br /><br />This is a truly great movie and I believe it is clearly Fellini's best. It is quite possibly one of the best films ever made. This DVD makes the movie especially worth buying.es, but I really do not see them depicted in a negative light.

1400043662|4.0|Author of acclaimed works The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Norwegian Wood, Murakami is Japan's leading writer of fiction. He is an original, offbeat writer with a wild and uninhibited imagination. In his latest work, Kafka on the Shore, the 15-year-old Kafka Tamura runs away from home on a quest to find his long-lost mother and sister-and to be rid of his father's prophecy. As he flees, so too does the World War II veteran Nakata, an older, retarded man whose quiet life has been turned upside down by a murder. Nakata suffered an unstated injury during the War that left him unable to read or write but able to talk to cats. This double odyssey brings Kafka and Nakata metaphorically together, as they both struggle to understand their respective journeys and what life has in store for them. <br />Murakami has never been shy about blurring the line between reality and, for lack of a better word, the oddly unreal. And true to form, in Kafka the reader is treated to the following: fish raining from the sky, a pair of Imperial Army soldiers unaged and still in the forest, and even a brief appearance by the characters Colonel Sanders (as a pimp) and Johnnie Walker.  <br />Murakami is that odd writer who manages to pull off postmodern, biting work that says something-and is at the same time fun to read. Both in Japan and abroad, he has been dismissed by some as lightweight-in part no doubt because of his popularity. However, mixing high- and low-brow, Murakami blends and spins wonderful and wild tales. There are references to fashion, jazz, popular music, Truffaut, Natsume Soseki, and many more. In Kafka, a prostitute quotes Hegel; Greek tragedy and Plato put in an appearance; and then, of course, there is the talking cat. It might feel Lite, but Murakami is deep. <br />Nakata and Kafka converge though never meet in rural Shikoku, both on a metaphysical quest for an \\"entrance stone\\" that Nakata must open and close. For the younger boy, this is a passage into adulthood; for theolder man, a search for a soulmate. <br />For Murakami fans, this is a must; for those yet to experience Murakami's world, Kafka on the Shore is an excellent place to start.

B0001ZXM54|3.0|The #1 cd of this collection is very good indeed, even though its always impossible to pick a collection of songs to fulfill everybodys taste. <br />Its a worse case with cd #2 which its spoiled by the including of the last three songs. Fare more better choises could have been added instead. E.g. I need you to night, Leila, Ten foot pole, to name a few. So this would have been a 5 star rate with a better # 2 cd.
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|This movie was a really fun movie. Cool gadgets. It was like Star Wars meets Indiana Jones meets Lara Croft. <br /> <br />But the movie really had a crappy story line. Like the big bad evil in the end was disappointing. So if you're looking for a good story...this isn't the movie for you. But if you want to be entertained with a fun movie, this movie is the movie. Especially if you like cool gadgets. The planes were spectacular. <br /> <br />I personally plan on purchasing this movie.
6305313687|5.0|This film contains lots of violence, but I see it rather realistic as hate crime is common in this country. Reverse discrimination is mentioned in one scene, and I somewhat agree that reverse discrimination accelerated hate crime. I did not grow up in America and do not know how it feels to hate other races, but I often felt hopeless being caught between black and white in times of conflicts since I am neither black nor white.<br /><br />The change in this film sadly cost them one of their lives. I think any time a change occurs there is a friction, and the friction can be extremely sad as a result.<br /><br />Also, the film reminded me of the fact that we all cannot escape Karma - a consistency of cause and effect. One kills someone, and that action will eventually comes back to him or her. I am not a Buddhist, but the consistency of cause and effect is there no matter who we are. We are living in an extention of what we did, and what we do now is continuous to our future. It's scary, but it's a reality.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Okay, let's be honest with one another -- this movie is tragic.<br /><br />I'm going to summarize my disdain for this movie by making one point and one point only.  The \\"midi-clorians\\", this has to be the saddest thing I've ever heard.  No longer can a kid playing Star Wars in his back forest become a Jedi in his mind and soul by making a personal commitment to honour and truth and chivalry -- like any knight in history, both European or far Eastern or wherever -- but by having a certain genetic predestination alone.  You see, as Qui-Gon tells us plain and simple, Force sensitivity is hereditary; it's in all of us, but in some more than others.  We can assume from Obi-Wan's astonishment at Anakin Skywalker's midi-chlorian count -- \\"Not even Master Yoda has a count that high!\\" -- that Force sensitivity is proportional to the quantity of midi-chlorians found in one's cells.  I can't begin to tell you how awful that sounds to me.  People are no longer on a level playing field; equal under the Force.  The Force (read God) is perfection, and some are evidently now closer to perfection than others as a fact of nature.  This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of, and has destroyed the magic that was Star Wars forever.  Star Wars ruled because it touched each of us as kids at a spiritual level, whether we realized it or not.  Each of us were Luke Skywalker standing on Tatooine gazing up at the stars wondering, hoping, wishing of what will become of ourselves.  \\"Owp, hold on kid, let me check your blood-type.  Hmm, so sorry, but it seems you are not of the Jedi race.\\"  \\"But, Jedi is not a race, it's a way of being, it's about goodness and virtue and all that and any kid can be a Jedi, no matter where he or she is from or what he or she looks like.\\"  \\"Well, part of that is right.  It doesn't matter where you are from or what you look like, but it does matter if you have the right blood or not.  For you see my worthless little friend, some people are lesser than others, and you are barely registering on the scale.  Being a Jedi is not an individual quest, either you are born Jedi material or you ain't.  And you ain't.\\"<br /><br />Hogwash.  Like the rest of people in the free world, I grew up playing Star Wars and my childhood was a lot more happier because of it.  I had friends back then as a small child whom I haven't seen or talked to in a long long time, but if I remember them at all I know they wouldn't stand for this baloney.  If I could build a time machine and go back to the Hoth that was Ontario in January and stop the Star Wars game that was going on in the street by all us kids and say \\"hey, wait a minute, have you guys heard about this midi-chlorians thing?  Where some of us are Jedi worthy by natural predestination and the rest are, well, nothing??\\"  The kids just wouldn't have stood for that, I can tell you for certain.  And why should they stand for it??<br /><br />Sorry George.  I think you forgot what being a kid means . . . what magic means., and you are barely registering on the scale.  Being a Jedi is not an individual quest, either you are born Jedi material or you ain't.  And you ain't.\\" <br /> <br />Hogwash.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|The above quote should alert you as to the type of quirky dialogue you'll find in this special, and rather precious, movie.  I think the best word for Napoleon Dynamite is \\"endearing\\" as you have no idea in the beginning how much attachment that will be formed between the viewer and characters like Napoleon, Pedro, and Deb.  It's not your typical coming of age film as it's set in Idaho and none of the actors are glamorous in any way.  Regardless, there are qualities displayed with which we can all relate.  It's a well-directed movie as not a moment is wasted and even the music is purposeful and excellent.  I haven't heard \\"Forever Young\\" and \\"I Promise You\\" in many years but am considering buying the soundtrack.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I have never been so enamored with an on screen couple before. It's honest and real. I felt like I was standing right next to them during their interactions. It didn't seem scripted...it was subtle and genuine. So often I see couples in movies I can't relate too..these characters were down to earth and were stripped of the superficial hollywood cliche'. Go get it this weekend...its unlike any other romances out there. <br /> <br />
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is one of the few movies that is every bit as good as its hype.  The story moves at a frantic, but believable, pace.  Like all of the great ones, this film is not tarnished by its age.  The unfortunate thing is that, in 2005, so much of the dialogue has so fully entered our cultural lexicon that the new viewer may be disappointed as to how cliche it sounds.  Yet, none of the lines like \\"play it again Sam,\\" \\"...out of all of the gin joints\\" and \\"this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,\\" were ever heard before Casablanca's release. Sure, Bogey is stupendous as is Bergman but what about Claude Rains? He practically steals the title role away from Rick.  His character is incredibly complex and interesting.  It is somewhat amusing as to the favorable spin that the French are given, but we must remember that back in 1941 they were a defeated ally.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This was perhaps the biggest waste of time and money I have spent watching a movie since I was back in highschool and my girlfriend made me go see the origional Bring It On at the drive-in.  Yes, the characters in the movie are crass self-centered a-moral jerks, but that isnt what makes this movie a waste of time.  Heck, those are the qualities tht made Seinfeld a great show.  What actually makes this movie almost unwatchable is how there is never any attempt to get you the viewer to care about what happens to any of them.  There is nothing to draw you into this movie at all and make you feel a single emotion.  In addition, nothing ever really happens with this movie. When its over, you feel like there should be another half hour or so of movie still to come where there will be some point to the whole thing or where someone from the movie will show some emotional growth or transformation.  Alas, this never happens and the viewer is left feeling empty.  Anyone who watches this movie and thinks its is an actual commentary on modern \\"romance\\" has my deepest sympathy. If you connect or relate to this movie on any level I hope you seek help soon.

Surely no one with any respect for acting or for Shakespeare would stage the \\"dagger of the mind\\" speech by having Macbeth chase a cheesy special-effect day-glo dagger all over the set!

B00005A46T|1.0|I wasen't a huge fan of Slipknot's first major label album (I'm pretty sure they had cds released before that one). I thought it was decent, but I've heard much better. It left plenty of room for improvement, but at least it was entertaining. Their follow-up, 'Iowa', is just a total disaster, from start to finish. In fact, the only song on here that is even listenable is the pretty good 'Left Behind', which is the only reason I'd ever pop this into my cd player agian. It all sounds like a big mess. I can never listen to it through all the way at one time because its so boring and unoriginal that I skipped each track. I must admit that the cover design with the holigraphic silver goat is pretty damn cool looking, but this is a review for a cd, not an album's cover. Its hard to believe this crap sold so well, and it didnt deserve those great sales. I still plan on buying the new Special Edition of 'Volume 3', though, since I heard it was much improved. 'Iowa' is so awful that it makes the debut seem like a classic.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|I definately thought this movie wasn't as good as it's prequel, but it was great anyways. Many people complained of the camera \\"shaking\\" during many action scenes. This shaking didn't bother me too much, and I thought there wasn't too much of it, definately not enough for it to become un-enjoyable. Of course, this might have been worse if I saw it at a theater, but I didn't.  <br />I thought the plot was almost as good as the prequel's plot, but not quite. The plot was very in-depth and very thought out, but there was just something missing. Over the months I've thought about the missing part and basically I thought this movie was a bit too much of a sequel to it's last one. Many people might agree with this but I really did think it was a bit too much sequel-ish. <br />This movie was definately a pretty good movie, and a great one to watch with multiple people, but not enough to give it the all out five star rating. <br /> <br />-Colton <br />
B000004166|5.0|Yet another Philips Mozart DUO that is at the top of the class.  Having the legendary Arthur Grumiaux on so many of these Mozart violin collections makes them easy choices.  His elegant, refined style and lucious tone (from an amazing 1744 Guanari) were born for Mozart. Just about every major reviewer (Penguin, Gramophone, etc) lists this particular CD in the top two best picks for Mozart's violin concertos, often citing Grumaiux's style as the ideal model for Mozart.  The recording sound is exceptional too as is typical for most Philips discs.  A superb choice for the violin concertos!  A rather unique version of these works come from Baroque specialist, Fabio Biondi (Virgin) which I also liked for different reasons.<br /><br />An alternative choice would be the intruiguing 5-CD collector's set of Grumiaux's Historic Philips Recordings from 1953-1962 which has these five concertos plus many and some rarer works from Paganini, Mendelssohn, Faure, Ravel, Debussy, Granados, Sarasate and others.  4/5 discs are in mono but the sound is fine really. If you admire this Belgian legend, then this historic set would probably be very special as it shows Grumiaux at his finest in a beautiful and diverse repertoire.
4789004546|5.0|Personally, I feel that these two books (basic/intermediate) goes together in order to have a complete reference.  If it's separated, it's like splitting elementary school's vocabulary and highschool's vocabulary into two dictionary.  Which dictionary should you buy if you want to check for words that seemed to be in between these two levels. For example, words like \\"honor\\". <br /> <br />The other reviewers are very informative, so i'll just give you a good example of a grammar from the \\"Intermediate japanese grammar\\".  (I chose intermediate because it can better express a more complete capacity of how the book work. (I apologize if you're a beginner audience) <br /> <br />\\"believe it or not\\" - nanishiro <br /> <br />Three ways to use it <br /> <br />#1. (sentence 1). nanishiro (sentence 2) <br />#2. (sentence 1). un, nanishiro... <br />#3.

(In Hinagana) <br />(He is rich, you know. *Believe it or not*, he has three Mercedes Benz) (gives you translation) <br /> <br />Unlike regular dictionaries, I find the joy in flipping thru these grammar dictionaries just because it's easy to read and it's also informative.  Other than *Nanishiro* in the previous sentence, didn't you also learn what kanemochi means?
B00009UW0N|4.0|That's a line given to the 'virginal' Laurie Strode played by scream-queen turned legit-actress Jamie Lee Curtis in THE horror movie that started the 80s slasher-flick frenzy.<br />The music alone is enough to give you the creeps; and  John Carpenter manages to do a lot more with a relatively low budget compared to the more big-budget stylised horror flicks that have been released ever since.<br />The only problem is the thin plot:  There really is no reason for the killings; you don't find out why Michael Myers does the things he does until part 2; and even then: Laurie Strode is his main target -- why is he killing everyone else? And the whole sibling connection is rather confusing (was Laurie Strode born after Michael killed his first sister, or was she already born?).<br />Also, some geographical issues: where exactly is Michael Myers's house compared to the houses Laurie Strode and her two friends are in? Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) seems to be near by (he sees the children running from the house Laurie is in); the car that Michael Myers rode in to Haddonfield is parked right outside and Dr Loomis doesn't notice this?<br />Regardless though, a great horror film that relies more on suspense and atmosphere than gore; in fact, I think the even-less gory TV version is better.
0385473788|5.0|This book is a perfect example of what happens to people in hard times.  The four Franks are living in a cramped space with four other people.  For two years they hide from the authorities in the back of a warehouse.  Throughout the war they endure many hardships as food becomes scarce and tempers boil.  All of the emotion and reality of this book truly makes it an amazing read.  For me the book ended all too soon.<br /> In the beginning you see how Anne's life is normally before the war, the Jews have restrictions but nothing is too serious till people are taken away.  When suddenly one night her sister Margot was called to be taken away the Franks flee to a pre-arranged \\"Secret Annex.\\"  Later they are joined by the another family, a mother, father, and then Peter.  The Van Daans are people who don't get along with each other and soon they start to bicker with the Franks.  It is a big circle of mini-wars till a dentist comes to live with them.  Things become better but as time goes on and the war tightens their limits, things worsen.<br />This story of how humans react to terror and to each other is simply astonishing.  Several times the readers have to stop and say to themselves that this is real and actually happened.  The hatred for Jews and the rivalry against one another was all real.  You become attached to the characters because you want to help them; you see how to improve things, you are saddened when something goes wrong, you see the truth behind what the others do.  When Anne was fighting with her mother you could see where both of them were coming from and you wanted to end it.  You see how Anne grows up from an adolescent to a woman.  All of the time she is forced to mature for her own sake and survival, as with the others.  You also see how Peter changes too.  They bond together towards the end of the diary and you see how much Anne needed someone real to talk to.  Their friendship grows and then they grow affectionate in the end.  With each other they solve their problems and help each other to help others.  The community in the \\"Secret Annex\\" improves and then everything seems perfect till tragedy strikes.<br />The diary ends rather quickly and it takes you awhile to register all that you have read.  You probably soak in more when you're finished with the book than when you were reading it because you think about it and then realize the significance of everything.  You reflect on why people acted in certain ways, the motives of the burglars, the struggles of the \\"helpers\\"- it all connects.  In the end you learn that struggle builds character and even in the darkest times there is still hope.  Sadly the Franks were captured and all separated to die in different ways.  They live on in Anne's diary.<br />Emily Ny solve their problems and help each other to help others.

B00029LNHS|4.0|I am not into hip-hop, but this album is awesome. <br /> <br />Most of the songs on here are really dance-able. Others are barely dance-able and played out. I was boppin' my head all the way from \\"Hands Up\\" to the bonus track (I don't know its name). My favorites are \\"Labor Day (It's a Holiday)\\", \\"Let's Get Retarded\\", \\"Smells like Funk\\" and \\"The Boogie That Be\\" (which is in a commercial for satelitte radio and the movie The Rundown). The only tracks I don't really listen to much are #9 and #11. <br /> <br />A longer, unedited version of \\"Hey Mama\\" is included on this CD. I'd like to add that this album includes some curse words and that the radio/MTV version of \\"Hey Mama\\" is different. Parents, be aware (not for kids under 12 or 13). <br /> <br />The main reason I made this review, though. Was to tell people that \\"Let's Get it Started\\" is lame. \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is the unedited version that came first. It's way less poppy, but also less radio-friendly. The Black Eyed Peas have not sold out. <br /> <br />I give 'Elephunk' an A (4/5).
B00000JLWW|5.0|The 1997 Blockbuster Titanic went on to gross roughly 600 million in the U.S. and a totoal of 1.8 billion including worldwide. No film has ever rivaled the sheer greatness to this epic that also won 11 Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture. That is tied for the most all time with the 1959 film Ben Hur and 2003's Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. <br /> <br />As for the film, I personally feel it is one of the most enticing, emotional, and thrilling pictures of all time. The story immediatly begins with a \\"treasure hunt\\" down to the real Titanic, to which James Cameron actually filmed there and ended spending more time with the ship than the actual passengers. They find no diamond but a picture drawn the night the ship sank. a 101 year old Rose sees the picture and heads to the vessel to talk with the capitan. She ends up re-living the entire experince on Titanic form the day the ship sailed to the night it sank. The story of the real ship mixed with the modern day telling is very effective in the way in which it gives the viewer something to follow rather than just the sinking. <br /> <br />I saw the film twice in theaters and over 20 times at home and still never get sick of seeing the film. The DVD was released in 1999 and to my surprise came out in a letterbox format with only a trailer as the bonus feature. I have to admit I was very dis pleased with the way the DVD was handled.Titanic is a movie that took 3 years in the process and thre are no special features? The truth is , that is what makes Titanic such a great film. It breks genres from a mystery, to a drama, to a love story, and finally to a thrilling race for survival. <br /> <br />I've heard many comments that come up in conversation and on numerous web sites including this, that Titanic was a poor script. Most people who say this have never even attempted much less wrote a script. They simply don't understand how hard it is to write. I will be the first to admit that Cameron is not the best writer in Hollywood,but he is surely better than half. When first hearing of this film being released I was sort of surprised Cameron was going to write/direct/produce with previous film like \\"The Terminator\\", \\"Aliens\\", \\"The Abyss\\", and \\"T2\\". He simply pulled it off with flying colors and the true spectacle that is Titanic is that it is a collaberative process. It simply has the best visual effects ever in an epic. The shots of the ship sailing into the sunset, and when it's sinking/ snapping in half are pure technological achievments. The sets off the coast of Baja and the tank that sat in for the drowning people are all amazing.  <br /> <br />The film was originally budgeted at 135 million dollars but went over 200 million. Paramount had to bring the extra 65 million because Fox could simply not afford it. It's amazing the movie ever got released. It went from July 1997 to December 19, 1997. The post-production went too long. To end the film on a high note the movies, sound, costumes, editing, effects, and the best musical score of all time make Titanic a movie for the ages. It will forever carry on as one of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br />FANS OF TITANIC. SPECIAL COLLECTORS EDITION DVD TO BE RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2005! <br />Cameron made the press conference quite some time ago in March. There will be two editions: A 2-Disc version with a new digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen and a branching feature, this means an icon will pop up in the movie whenever a deleted scene will pop up and you can view it from there, but Cameron considers the theatrical release to be his Director's Cut. There will be 58 minutes of unseen footage, and all will be brought up to date. The deleted scens can also be viewed seperatly on the DVD. The scenes will be polished. There will also be commentary by Cameron and possibly Leo and Kate. <br />THE OTHER EDITION WILL BE A 4-DISC SET.  <br />The first 2 discs wil be the same as the other edition but there will be 2-discs of bonus material. There won't just be a making of featurette but tons of them to deal with ALL aspects of the process from when the idea was first pitched to it's crazy success. There is going to be a Titanic load of Bonus features on EVERYTHING, with the making of to interviwe and everything. I get excited thinking about how Titanic is finally getting the treatment it deserves.   <br /> <br />Hope I made my point clear and that you enjoyed my review. TITANIC IS AMAZING!
B0000029GA|5.0|If you don't have it, just buy it. <br />If you're a fan of hip hop, just buy it. <br />If you don't have it, you can't be a real hip hop fan. <br />No sense in reviewing this album, all songs are classics, it's a 5 mic album and one of the 10 greatest hip hop albums of all time....so just buy the album if you don't own it already.
B00000I41J|5.0|Do not be surprised if you see the word masterpiece or classic a lot because there are a lot of excellent records out there. \\"Somethin Else\\" is definitely a masterful work of art and no one could have done it better than Cannonball and Miles. Joining the Horn men are Hank Jones on Piano, Sam Jones on Bass and the great Art \\"Buhaina\\" Blakey on the Drums. Hank Jones( older Brother of Thad and Elvin), as miles commented in the notes, a very light touch that is perfect for this kind of setting. Sam Jones(no relation to Hank) has one of the biggest sounds that any bass player has ever gotten. Blakey who is usually all fired up when playing with his messengers, shows that he can cool down.  <br /> <br />The opener is the well known standard \\"Autumn Leaves\\". Blakey and Sam Jones start off with a sort of latin beat and get the groove on. Miles plays the melody behind the trio and Adderley comes in to his solo. The ending almost has a feeling of leaves falling from the trees. Although Adderley notes that his biggest influence was Bird, he has a style, distinctly, his own.  <br />\\"Love for Sale\\" is another classic standard and Miles takes the theme and Cannonball, who is the only soloist on the piece, takes his time and blows some very fine lines out of his sax.  <br />The title track is an medium up-tempo minor blues built of the Harmonic minor scale. Miles and Cannonball get plenty of time to stretch out on their solos. \\"One for daddy-o\\" is another minor blues this time the tempo is slowed down and Adderley gets even funkier. Dancing in the dark is a ballad standard featuring Adderley. The bonus track, \\"Bangoon\\" is a Hank Jones composition and is based off the popular chord sequence known as rhythmn changes.  <br /> <br />Don't pass this one by because it really is Somethin Else!
B00030590I|5.0|Hero is a gorgeous movie, and when I say gorgeous I mean that it was breathtakingly beautiful. Although the translation from Mandarin to English lost some of its power and overall intelligence, it wasn't too bad after the first ten minutes of getting use to it.<br /><br />Hero is a movie that requires deep concentration as Jet LI and the king tell us their take on each side of the story portrayed here. It is a moving and emotional story of true love, revenge, desire and hatred that shaped and molded the future of China. It is a story of three people and their inner struggles to survive in a world that was ruled by a king they did not understand. Ultimatly it is a story of three people and their various struggles to overcome the passion and bonds they shared to shape their opinions on how the world should and would ruled.<br /><br />The ending is very sad, its not many movies that can force me to tears, but this one did. Definatly a must see for all Jet Li fans. You won't be disappointed in this particular Hero.
1558216847|2.0|I was half way through this book when I realized that the story line just didn't add up. I believe the author has fabricated most if not all of the events that take place. If I had to guess, I would say that it is completely fiction. Having said that, as fiction the book is only average. If true it is one of the most remakable tales, but as stated I believe it is highly unlikely that this book is accurate. I felt somewhat cheated after reading what I did.

B0006IIKS0|3.0|For anyone out there who is still convinced that Metallica is cool, this documentary will undoubtedly change your mind.  These guys should have retired after the Black album.  I am not sure how all these guys lost their touch, but everything they do now is cheesy and ridiculously amateurish.  Watch as they come up with the lamest lyrics you will ever hear, the weakest guitar riffs you will ever hear, and vocals so bad they'll make you cringe.  It's so sad what has happened to this band's auditory senses, after all, the fact that they can listen to those songs combined with the horrible sound quality and believe it's good enough to release to the world speaks volumes about their hearing loss.  By the way, why did Lars replace his snare drum with a hub-cap for this album??? The other thing I noticed is that these guys arent even rockers anymore.  At one point the video shows them all standing around the studio with Bob Rock, and I realized just how old and burnt out these guys look.  They are a bunch of balding, old, rich guys who look more likely to be playing racketball than metal. They have just completely lost touch with their audience, with their sound, and with rock n'roll for that matter.  I think they just have way too much money to be able to still think like the true hungry rockers they were in the early days.<br /><br />  Jason Newsted clearly gets the last laugh here, especially since he was lucky enough to escape before they created the ultra-pathetic St. Anger.  Lars makes a profound statement at an echobrain gig as he buries his face in his hands and declares,\\"Jason (and echobrain) are the future, Metallica is the past.\\"  Well, Echobrain may not be the future, but Metallica definitely is the past.  I only feel sorry for Rob Trujillo (who should have NEVER left Suicidal Tendencies)for joining the band just in time for them to release the biggest turd-sandwich album rock n' roll has ever seen.  I can only imagine him trying to act impressed as they played all the new material for him the first time.  It is so sad what is captured on this documentary.  Would be musicians should only watch this as an example of what NOT to do with your musical career.l the new material for him the first time.  It is so sad what is captured on this documentary.

0553573403|5.0|McNamara \\"sonofhotpie\\" below says it excellently when talking about seeing the different characters' points of view. That is probably my biggest beef with fantasy - I love the scenarios, I love the mythic themes, but lets face it - just about every bad guy all the way back to Sauron has one big evil ambition of taking over the world for his/her own personal glory and making all the little people squirm.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin doesn't buy into this.<br /><br />I really love the fact that, when the narrative takes on the perspective of a \\"villain\\" character, you get to see what they are actually thinking and how their actions make perfect sense from their point of view and the threats that they perceive. No one here is trying to destroy the entire world. They are simply human beings that are trying to get through a difficult time and trying their best to preserve their own family, power, wealth, honor, etc. It's absolutely refreshing and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B00004XMV6|2.0|The most shocking thing about \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" is that it was actually made by adults! When this came out in '86, I was 18 and I LOVED it, but NOT for the reasons you might think. I was a sucker for visual style at the time, even over content (Miami Vice, etc.), and I saw it many times in the theater. Having not seen it for about ten years I thought it would be fun to re-visit. What I found was a deeply dated film on the verge of self-parody. Certain episodes in their \\"obsessive\\" courtship are sitcom-ready but it's the characters themselves that just don't ring true. Kim Basinger, as Elizabeth is just kind of thick-headed. She's best in the final scenes but, prior to that, she's frustratingly naive and I don't buy her as an art dealer for a second! Mickey Rourke is equally annoying; answering most lines with his trademark smirk. Who would really put up with that?! What's interesting is how great he is when he's given a moment to improvise (as with the kids on the boardwalk) but then he's out of character. I like Mickey Rourke, and before Michael Madsen made a career out of stealing his whole shtick (right down to the mannerisms and delivery) he was truly unique (his cameo in \\"The Pledge\\" with Jack Nicholson is heart-breaking!), but he's not given enough room here.     Another problem is the music. This movie would be 50% better without ANY music, not just the pop songs but the whole sappy score as well. There's a nice Al Green intro at the beginning of the titles and Stewart Copeland, of The Police, wrote a cool instrumental for some Wall Street exteriors, but everything else should go! Of course, coming off of \\"Flash Dance\\", (the movie pretty much responsible for pop song soundtracks), I guess it's not a surprise, but the top 40 pop hurts this supposedly edgy, adult drama.     What does work is the brilliant casting of every other character in the film. From the sales woman in the department store (an AMAZING performance!) to all of Elizabeth's art world friends. Visually the film holds up alright but not as flawlessly as other, more imaginitive, visual films of it's day like \\"Blade Runner\\". It's a nice picture-portrait of New York at the time, though.     The truth is that the mid-80's were full of fluffy dramas and this one had the promise of going beyond that but, in the end, the director, or the movie company, totally betrayed its potential which is really too bad. As it sits, it's an achingly self-conscious and timid set of music videos.
B0007OCG56|1.0|This is a film that I was prepared to like. James L. Brooks, who brought us such great television with \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" and \\"Taxi\\" and the Oscar winning \\"Terms of Endearment\\" certainly knows how to write complicated characters and relationships, so the premise of \\"Spanglish\\" sounded like a winning idea. The fact that this film just does'nt work even as BAD films sometimes do, is a major disappointment. Part of the problem is there are simply too many people in this film and none feel fully characterized. But the majority of the blame falls on the two leads: Tea Leoni is an annoying, whiny, manipulative harpy and (gasp) Adam Sandler as sensitive Super-Dad John Clasky just don't work. Leoni overacts and destroys her character in the same way that Felicity Huffman  does on \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" She evokes no sympathy or identification with her character. Sandler tries to be sweet and real but only succeeds in being sappy and synthetic.  Paz Vega, the \\"Spanish\\" in \\"Spanglish\\" is better than either Sandler or Leoni, despite the fact she does'nt speak English for most of the film. Her heartbreak and confusion as her daughter, well-played by Shelbie Bruce, becomes more \\"LA\\" and less hispanic, is touching and real. Bruce and Sarah Steele - outstanding as the Clasky's chubby daughter - are the best things in this film. Cloris Leachman, an 11th hour replacement for Anne Bancroft, has some good zingers as Leoni's boozy Mother. She, Bruce, and Steele elevate this film but not enough.
B0001US8FI|5.0|This movie rules ,as we all know,but what makes this new special edition even better are all those bonus goodies included.Any Bruce Lee fan will love it.I think the most awesome feature is the GAME OF DEATH footage.Man ,that movie would have been AWESOME.Look at the bright side,at least this much footage surfaced,and all of us LEE fans can be thankful for it.TWO big thumbs up.There are also hours of other extras,so buy it and enjoy!

0399236201|4.0|Stormbreaker is the first novel in the popular Alex Rider series. The opening line sets the tone for the rest of the book: \\"When the doorbell rings at three in the morning, it's never good news.\\" The bad news for 14 year old Alex is that his guardian, Uncle Ian, (bow to Ian Fleming) has been killed. The events surrounding the death do not make sense to him so he begins an investigation of his own. As Alex uncovers the truth about his uncle's work, he is drawn into the world of MI6. As he works to unravel the mystery of his uncle's final days he must use all his smarts and skills to stay alive.<br /><br />The action includes cool gadgets, explosions, car chases, parachute drops and karate kicks. This is a terrific choice for guys who want lots of zap, pow, and boom in their reading.<br /><br />Boys are yearning for books with action and are ready to move on from the wizard/magic stuff.  These are books that will engage their interest. Of course they are echoes of James Bond but those movies and books have kept people coming back for decades.  I want guys to find books they WANT to read and the Alex Rider series fills the bill.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is so much infinitely better than Parachutes, it is, well, crazy. Not that Parachutes was bad, it was totally listenable...and Yellow is still clearly Coldplay's best tune. But, apart from Yellow, the majority of the tracks on A Rush of Blood to the Head are each better than the majority of the tracks on Parachutes. <br />And like all great CDs, for me, my favourite track has gone from Clocks, to In My Place, to God Put a Smile on Your Face, to Green Eyes, to A Rush of Blood to the Head, to Amsterdam...and probably included Polik and a few others for a while without me realising it. <br />I am not a huge fan of The Scientist (although the clip was genius), and A Whisper seems more like a Parachutes type song, but that hasn't stopped this album leading me to start crossing off the days till X&Y. It has to take something special for me to buy an album without at least having a brief listen first....A Rush of Blood to the Head has sealed X&Y's fate, for me. Hopefully now I'm prepared to give it a few listens before I begin to judge it.
B000957O7S|4.0|Will Smith is very enjoyable as the smooth talking dating coach in this light-hearted romantic comedy.<br /><br />His overweight client the accountant Albert Brenneman (Kevin James from sitcom King Of Queens) is perfectly cast and highly entertaining.<br /><br />If you're looking for some comedic romantic fluffy puffy movie you could do much worse than this movie.<br /><br />Plot: well I imagine you've seen it splashed across the ads, but here's a refresher:<br /><br />Will due to an early disappointment in love has become a smooth-talking cupid for those needing a \\"shoe in the door\\" of the dating game. He stars opposite Eva Mendes who plays a jaded reporter and the two meet and become infatuated with each other at the same time as Eva is chasing down Will's client Albert who is romancing (former top model) the heiress playing the poor little rich girl.<br /><br />In fact this romance between Albert & his heiresss although far-fetched, is a great deal more tender and humorous than the budding relationship between Smith & Mendes.<br /><br />There are some classic scenes and it is all amusing, although there is not a great deal of chemistry between Smith & Mendes, nothing like the sizzling air in How to Lose a guy in 10 days with Kate Hudson & Matthew McConnaghy.<br /><br />If I could rate a little under 4 I would, but I can't, and it's better than 3, so girls, it's worth a look.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|<br />In an age where documentaries are maybe six one hour episodes at most, seeing \\"World at War\\" is quite a revelation. No fewer than 26 one hour episodes, all masterpieces. <br /> <br />I really loved this series when it aired in the 90s, when I was fourteen. It pretty well started the obsession with history that I still have. But looking on it ten years later, I am even more impressed by this series.  <br /> <br />Having read thoroughly into World War II, I would have expected this series to begin to appear like other artefacts of childhood - i.e., not as good as I initially thought. But the sheer thoroughness and good judgement shown in these episodes is amazing. There is also some very unusual stuff, such as interviews with Himmler's aide, interviews with Arthur Harris, interviews with Gross Admiral Doenitz (who died an unrepentant Nazi). <br /> <br />Add to that the superb writing. The spoken narrative is delivered by Laurence Olivier, in a remarkable performance. It is full of choice phrases, such as \\"The Germans were keeping to the timetable of 1940, not 1914\\", and, \\"For one empire, the sun had set; for another, the Sun was still Rising...\\" <br /> <br />Overall, this is like the Iliad of World War II. It forms one coherent narrative yet can be watched in individual episodes. One is struck, at the end, by the sheer tragedy of what happened in this, the biggest war of history and THE epic struggle between good and evil in the twentieth century.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|First of all... some people seem to think that anyone who liked donnie darko is bellow their level of inelegance, and has never seen a strange or original film. These people can (...). I've seen films in which a nude man with an S and M mask and dog collar on, with his head in a toilet, discusses how going to houses of domination is the only thing that eases his destructive and homicidal urges... So don't tell me about what truly strange and original films are. I also got a high school diploma at 14, and started going to college at the age of 15.<br />So don't tell me about intelligence. That being said... The first cut of this movie was great. One of my favorite films. But this directors cut is total %$@!. There are almost no extra scenes, and pretty much so every scene they added could be seen on the special features of the original. This was more like Donnie darko with alternative editing techniques , and inferior ones at that. This directors cut just didn't feel as smooth as the first. This is just a scam to get everyone to buy 2 copys of the movie. If you already have a copy of the first don't bother with this, and if you don't have it, pick up a copy of the original. Like I said, Im a big Donnie darko fan, I liked it before it got popular (at least in the U.S), and Im sure I'll still like it once its popularity fades.<br />Hope this review saves some one from waiting their $.
0385510454|1.0|It's hard to figure out where Grisham is heading as a writer. I am a late comer to his work - The Last Juror was my first attempt at reading him. One gets the strong impression that all J.G. is doing is writing for the big screen (I'm thinking here of adaptations like The Client and the even better movie, Runaway Jury); there simply is not much \\"density,\\" as Ms. Tartt would put it, to his writing. Is it so surprising, then, that he has 18 or so of these kinds of books out there? I find there is very little literary value to be found in this guy's writing. I say just wait for the movie - same cost as a paperback, but only two hours wasted. A.L.
0385510454|1.0|Only because it was written by Grisham did I labor through this book to hopefully become consumed by a suspenseful denouement.  Unfortunately, Grisham suffers from the same malady as James Patterson in his book, London Bridges wherein both authors take the easy way out leaving many loopholes and unanswered questions.   In particular, we are told of a Chinese assassin who is pursuing the lead character but the story ends without any mention of the assassin.  The ending is much too contrived for my liking and doesn't justify the attempt at Italian language lessons (talk about boring).  Perhaps the book's only redeeming quality is that it makes one want to travel to Italy to enjoy the wonderful food.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Sadly I bought this movie. Could have watched a couple hours of soap opera for free. Just people cheating on each other and then cheating on each other. I wouldn't even give it 1 star....but I had to click on something.
B0000C1733|4.0|I find it disappoining that this greatest hits album from the Red Hot Chili Peppers is not a true collection of their greatest hits. For instance, why is Universally Speaking, from the By the Way album on the cd, but not Can't Stop or The Zephyr Song? And let's not forget that the Chili Pepper's career spans over twenty years. Where are the songs from Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, such as If You Want Me To Stay, Brothers Cup, Hollywood, Fight Like A Brave, Love Trilogy, Subterranean Homesick Blues, and Backwoods, to name a few. Why is Higher Ground the only song from Mother's Milk? Knock Me Down, Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky, and Taste the Pain should have been included. Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik, I Could Have Lied, If You Have To Ask, and Power of the Equality are some of the best from Blood, Sugar. And, please, for heaven's sake, what about the hits from One Hot Minute: Aeroplane, Warped, Coffee Shop, and Walkabout? <br />     Don't get me wrong, this is a great album. I would recommend it to anyone. I love the songs from Californication and By the Way. I just wish this was a true collection of their greatest hits. I mean, remember Hillel Slovak, Jack Irons, and Cliff Martinez?
B000002L61|4.0|The Last in Line was Dio's sophomore release in 1984 after the excellent Holy Diver.  Many fans consider this album Dio's best.  I give that nod to Dream Evil and would also rate Holy Diver ahead of Line, but it is still an excellent album that belongs in any 1980s metal fan's collection.  It begins, as did Holy Diver, with a strong rocker \\"We Rock.\\"  It is not as adrenaline-pumping as \\"Stand Up and Shout\\" but still prepares the listener for the awesome metal experience to come (cheesy, huh?).  The title track is classic and I like it better than the title track from Holy Diver.  It keeps up the intensity and doesn't drag like the latter.  Those who grew up in the 1980s probably remember the music video for this track which co-starred the kid from the short-lived Voyagers television show (one of the favorite shows of my childhood, I was depressed when it was canceled).  \\"Breathless\\" is a good rocker, though not spectacular but what follows is \\"I Speed at Night\\" which just flies!  It gives \\"Stand Up and Shout\\" a run for its money as the most kickin' Dio track of all time!  Unbelievable!  \\"One Night in the City\\" is a different-sounding track.  It uses some unique percussion and offers Dio's story-telling lyrics.  The evil voice at the end is a little much, though. <br /> <br />As with Holy Diver, the second half of The Last in Line is not as solid.  The second side of Holy Diver had one great track \\"Rainbow in the Dark\\" with the rest way behind.  The great track on the second side here is \\"Evil Eyes.\\"  It is an excellent rocker and always finds its way on my Dio compilation tapes.  The next two tracks are let downs.  \\"Mystery\\" reminds me of \\"Caught in the Middle\\" in that it seems to move towards the more \\"pop\\" sound.  It even offers keyboards.  Unlike the catchy \\"Caught in the Middle,\\" \\"Mystery\\" is not a very good song.  The weakest track, to me, is \\"Eat Your Heart Out.\\"  It sounds very disjointed after the chorus which bugs me.  Also the lyrics less than stellar: \\"You've been a bad, bad girl\\"?!  It ends on a high note; however, with the epic \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On).\\"  The ending with the guitar complementing Ronnie's vocals is excellent.  Although, I do not consider The Last in Line to be Dio's best work, it is still an excellent, fairly solid metal album with several all-time classic tracks!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Please, please, please buy this album.  I can guarantee that when Tori Amos listens to this she thinks Fiona is clearly a Better Version of Me. Oh, well.  The fact that Sony releases such trash month after month and won't let Fiona release the best album of her career just makes me see red, red, red and I just want to Waltz right over and break a Window! With this album Fiona continues to write psycho girlfriend, Get Him Back, Used to Love Him anthems that resonate and last listen after listen.<br /><br />While most of the songs really are not about love, they'll have even the most mysogenist progenitor whistling, Oh, Sailor!<br /><br />Free Fiona.  There is no one in the putrid Sony catalog as good.
B000002LCE|5.0|I became a metalhead in the late 1980s and immediately became a fan of Ronnie James Dio.  Dream Evil (1987) was the first Dio album I bought and it was and remains one of my favorite metal albums of all-time.  In fact, it is definitely in my top 3.  I went on to buy Dio's back catalog of albums, but Dream Evil is still the best.  Dio's previous albums are great, of course, but there are at least one of two weak tracks on them: \\"Mystery\\" and \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" on The Last in Line, maybe \\"Shame on the Night\\" off Holy Diver, and, let's face it, several tracks off Sacred Heart.  Dream Evil is absolutely solid!  Every track is awesome!  When I make Dio compilation tapes, it is difficult to decide which Dream Evil tracks to leave off.  <br /> <br />The best of the best are the powerful title track, the adrenaline-driving \\"Faces in the Window\\" and the beautiful epic track \\"All the Fools Sailed Away.\\"  The latter was a single with a cool, dark, nautical video complete with bon fires, spooky sailing ship, skeletons in a lifeboat, and Ronnie and the boys looking great in their classic frilly shirts and jackets. \\"I Could Have Been a Dreamer,\\" another excellent track, also offered a rarely-seen video. \\"Naked in the Rain\\" is another favorite of mine.  The line: \\"Two children, guns loaded, take aim and blow all the dreams away\\" is my favorite part of the track.  It is musically, and lyrically very powerful.  The use of keyboards in \\"When a Woman Cries\\" really makes the last track unique.   So I do not sound like a sycophant, I will give one criticism: \\"Sunset Superman\\" is extremely repetitive at the end.   Other than this one gripe, Dream Evil is just about perfect.  If you only have Dio's first two more well-known releases, and somehow missed out on Dream Evil, get it now!  It will not disappoint!
B000805796|5.0|Since I live in the US, I don't have the album yet and I'm not sure when I'll get it, but I'm writing my review using the 1 minute clips on her official site of all 12 songs ([...]) Anyway, Melanie C is back and better than ever with her third album Beautiful Intentions, produced by her new record label, Red Girl Records, which she made after being dropped from Virgin after the flop of her second record Reason. This album just may be the one to put her back on the map and show everyone what she's capable of.     1)Beautiful Intentions- The title track opens with a hard guitar riff and really brings you into her new hard rock sound. This song is about being able to see whether or not someone likes you. \\"So blind that I can't decide if you knew I harboured beautiful intentions for you/So cruel that I never knew truly if you harboured beautiful intentions for me\\" 5/5    2)Next Best Superstar- The first single off this album, which talks about the whole Pop Idol/American Idol phenomenon and this song really takes a bite at the whole pop culture. \\"Make a joke, do the show, where does all the money go?/You're living your dream/Crack a smile in denial, throw your morals on the fire/You're living your dream.\\" 5/5    3)Better Alone- The first of very few ballads on this album, which shows the more mellow, softer side of Melanie that we saw in her Reason album. 5/5    4)Last Night on Earth- The kind of fun rocker song on the album (all of them are fun, but this is the funnest of them all) that makes you want to rock out. 5/5    5)You Will See- Getting deeper and deeper into the rock sound, You Will See is another one of my favorite songs. \\"Cos it's only a matter of time til it finds you/Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you/You will see.\\" 5/5    6)Never Say Never- One of my favorite songs on the album, this song has a great rocker sound and Melanie's vocals are really good on this. 5/5    7)Good Girl- When I first heard this, it was one of my least favorite songs on the album, but after several listens, it's beginning to grow on me. This is another ballad and has a very mellow sound to it and Melanie's vocals are pretty good on this song too. 4/5    8)Don't Need This- After having heard Lisa Marie Presley's new CD, this sounds like it could have been on that record as well, but it fits very well on here. \\"Now I'm planning my attack and I will surely rise again/Running from yourself isn't gonna save you.\\" Great rocker song and another of my favorites. 5/5    9)Little Piece of Me- Yet another favorite song of mine and it's a great rock song. Melanie sings very well on this song. \\"All you want me to be is a little souvenir/Of a night you won't even remember/It's not because I'm worth it, not cuz I deserve it/You just want to get your hands on a little piece of me.\\" 5/5    10)Here and Now- A haunting melody begins this song and then moves into a more mellow ballad. It's another song that may take a while to grow on me. 3/5    11)Take Your Pleasure- We move back to the rock sound into my final favorite song on the album. This song is about someone taking pleasure from Melanie's pain. \\"You take your pleasure from my pain, inflict your damage/I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself, so take your pleasure from my pain.\\" 5/5    12)You'll Get Yours- The final song on the album is a beautiful ballad which really shows off Mel's vocals well. \\"If you turn the pages and look inside, there is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide/If you turn the tables and look at yourself, is there something you fear that you would have to confess?\\" 4/5    Overall, this album is one of the best I've heard in a while, not only from Mel but from the whole music industry. Having written all but one track (Next Best Superstar), Melanie is definitely showing off her lyricism and it really seems to be improving from album to album. It shows she has put so much work and effort into this album, crafting it to be the best. I can't wait toget this album.
B000002L7V|3.0|Dio was my favorite metal vocalist in the 1980s and his was one of my favorite metal bands during that time.  Still, I have to be more critical of this 1985 release than of his previous albums, and it appears a lot of fans agree.  Sacred Heart cannot stand up to Holy Diver and The Last in Line.  It is surprising to me that the album I consider to be Dio's best [Dream Evil] came out two years after this one.  Some fans point to the use of keyboards as a reason to dislike this album.  I don't mind keyboards/synthesizers in metal in fact, I like them (i.e. Iron Maiden's Somewhere in Time).  Even the highly-touted The Last in Line included keyboards (\\"Mystery\\") albeit on one of its weakest tracks.  I just don't think the music on Sacred Heart is that good.  It doesn't rock as hard but it is not just that.  I do not mind metal acts taking a softer approach, but the music here just seems stale to me.  Even the best tracks off Sacred Heart do not blow me away with the possible exception of \\"Another Lie.\\"  I included my favorite Sacred Heart tracks on a Dio compilation tape, and always seem to fast-forward through most of them.    As with Dio's previous albums, he starts this one off with a heavy rocker.  \\"King of Rock & Roll\\" is an awesome track.  It sounds like it was recorded live with the roar of the crowd and the slightly-unpolished sound, but there is nothing on the album cover or insert that indicates if that was the case or if an audience was dubbed in.  The reason I am reluctant to praise Sacred Heart because of this opening track is because the first version of this song I heard was off a 1986 various artist metal compilation tape entitled Heavy Metal Thunder.  This version is definitely live and blows the album version out of the water.  The compilation is out-of-print, but it is worth seeking out a used copy.  The title track is good, but not spectacular and, at 6:27, it just drags.  Dio seemed to center his live show around this track, with his face and distorted voice inside a crystal ball reciting an intro to the track and, of course, the giant dragon.  I want to like the song, but it just falls flat. On the other hand, the track which follows [\\"Another Lie\\"] rocks!  It is the best track on the album. \\"Rock `n Roll Children\\" is musically OK but, lyrically, is contrived and, among Dio's songs of sorcery and magic, seems a bit silly.  It is a song about kids alone, without friends, \\"but they got rock `n roll\\"?  Give me a break.  The video also seemed silly.  The young man, finally taking some responsibility by getting a job to pay for his guitar, ends up returning to his true being by rejoining his heavy metal girlfriend, who had accused him of \\"selling out,\\" and chucking his uniform in the garbage...ooookay.    \\"Hungry for Heaven\\" was on the Vision Quest soundtrack and is definitely a radio-worthy track with lots of keyboards.  I like the track.  It is catchy with a very cool guitar solo.  The rest of the album is unmemorable.  I can barely remember how the tracks go.  I do remember \\"Shoot Shoot\\" because it is so bad: \\"You can be free forever, so next time someone points a gun at you [does that happen very often?] say, `Shoot, shoot.'\\"  The way Dio sings  the word \\"shoot, shoot\\" is almost comical.  I don't think Sacred Heart is a terribly bad album.  It has its moments.  It just does not meet the high expectations of Dio's previous albums and his next release [and best] Dream Evil.
0743454537|4.0|This was the first novel I read from Jodi Picoult.  I intend to read more from her. <br /> <br />My Sister's Keeper is a story of two sisters, Kate with leukmia and Anna, created to keep her sick sister alive.  Anna has been in and out of hospitals to provide blood cells for Kate.  When the parents decide Anna will \\"volunteer\\" a kidney for her dying sister, Anna hires a publicity seeking lawyer and files for legal emancipation.  Sara, the stay-at-home mother and former lawyer, decides to represent her husband and herself. <br /> <br />Several plots are in the novel.  A past relationship between the lawyer and the court-appointed guardian.  The relationship between the husband and wife as disagreements arise over Anna's actions.  The oldest son and his bids for attention.  Ms. Picoult does an excellent job of realistically presenting several points of view and weaving the plots into a plausible story. <br /> <br />The reason this novel only receives four stars is how the story ends.  I was disappointed that the ending, though tragic, seemed to be too neat for such a messy situation.  To the author's credit, I'm not sure how else it could have ended without being formulaic.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend My Sister's Keeper.  Be warned, it is an emotional novel. <br />
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I have to admit I have a bit of thing for Hugh Jackman in the X-Men movies. I even have a poster on my wall of him as Wolverine. But give me another film with Hughie in it, and it's not so much. In fact, a complete turn off. Give me the hair, the beard, and the leather outfit over this any day. Apparently, he had extensions in for this, which was a major mistake. He was also supposed to appear nude in this film, when he becomes a human again (near the end), but spoilsport Stephen Sommers felt it would have been too distracting. (EXCUSE ME?!) The nude shot is still in the movie, but a CGI loincloth was animated to cover his rear. (Boo)<br /><br />I've had this movie for about four months now, and never even taken it out of it's shrink wrap thing. Don't ask me why it's taken me so long to watch I was just never in the 'mood' to watch it. I'm glad I've watched it now, as I really enjoyed it, although Stephen does like his disintegration & regeneration effects just a little too much. They're well used in The Mummy/The Mummy Returns, and although not so much in this, they're still used. It's almost his trademark! His scene where there are characters walking on walls & ceilings was OK, but much better done in Labyrinth. Stephen also uses some of the same actors that were in The Mummy/The Mummy Returns! So keep your eyes peeled for them! Top Hat, played by Tom Fisher, was Spivey in The Mummy Returns; Igor was played by Kevin J. O'Connor, who was Beni in The Mummy (he's not instantly recognisable as he's got a LOT of makeup on, but the voice is recognisable) and Cardinal Jinette was played by Alun Armstrong who played Baltus Hafez in The Mummy Returns.<br /><br />I have to say Kate Beckinsdale was really gorgeous in this (as is the scenery!) She was definitely wearing a corset though, and it makes her waist so tiny, but she did lots of stunts, which must have been really difficult. Her hair was nice, and she had the accent perfect (not much can be said for Hughie's accent - what was it supposed to be?) Her role does seem a bit similar to the one she plays in Underworld (which I haven't seen yet), but it's all the werewolves and vampires.<br /><br />Speaking of werewolves - there are three separate scenes where a werewolf falls off something and into a body of water, making a small but noticeable splash. This is an in-joke on Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />The special effects in this are absolutely terrific, although it does seem at times that they're over a little too fast, as if trying to cover up the fact they're probably not that well done. There was also a lot of them, just a bit too many for this calibre of film. There are special effects, and there are too many special effects. This movie falls into the latter category. Dr. Frankenstein's lab was equipped with antique medical equipment purchased on E-bay. Look out for Dr Jekyll (Hyde?) voiced (played by?) by Robbie Coltrane! Hehe, I was in fits at the voice, since it's soooooooo similar to Shrek (who was of course voiced by Mike Myers). Looks like Shrek too.<br /><br />There's a lot of influences in this movie, from James Bond (big time), the Matrix (which has a lot to answer for), Alien, Young Frankenstein, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gremlins, Romancing the Stone, Lord of the Rings, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twister, and Wild, Wild West. I also thought it had a bit of a Back To The Future influence, when they're about to go over the bridge in the carriage (train in BTTF), and half of it is missing. (I could also say there's a reference there to Speed)<br /><br />The scene-stealers in this movie are definitely Dracula's wives. Oh my God, there's three of them, and it's like Hocus Pocus all over again! :) And the character called Carl is also excellent! Richard Roxburgh overplays Dracula to the point of laughing, and winking at the camera.<br /><br />There are a few nonsense scenes in this, including the lack of explanation about Wolver...sorry, Van Helsing's past. There's bits about his past thrown in any old way, and don't really make much sense with the rest of the story. And the talk with the creepy undertaker doesn't really seem to belong to the film.<br /><br />The extras (on my single disc edition) include: commentary by director Stephen Sommers and editor/producer Bob Duscay; commentary by actors Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein) and Will Kemp (Anna's brother); 360° Tour of Dracula's Castle; Bringing the Monsters to Life - featurette; outtakes; You Are in the Movie (miniature cameras on-set) and the Legend of \\"Van Helsing\\".<br /><br />Overall this is a movie well-worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of the Mummy movies, or love Kate Beckinsdale. The effects are too much at times, and there doesn't seem to be much of a plot squeezed in, but it's well worth a quick peek.past.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|When you get actors of this caliber, it is pretty difficult for it not to be interesting.  Interesting it is, however, why put them in a movie that shows no progression. None of the main characters changes for the better by the end of the movie.  Alice shows some growth in trying to tell the truth but there is nothing to indicate that she is a changed woman. So what is the point?   <br />As a play it makes perfect sense to raise the idea and discussion of how people that have no sense of themselves act when in a relationship.  Even those that have a sense of self misguided as they are ( Clive Owen) can be fun to watch but usually there is a character around this self-absorption that sees a light at the end of the tunnel.  Well do not look for it here.  No one learns anything, and we are lead to believe that no one would do anything different in another situation. <br />Disappointing movie, that should have been one to shine.
0345442970|4.0|... and you'll thank me.  You'll understand the nature of the Trade Federation embargo that dominates the plot and provides it with its main conflict.  That Darth Sidious (Palpatine, the future Emperor) is engineering it to his advancement, as well as the downfall of the Jedi, is not news; however, I never fully understood why everybody else was doing what they were doing (why is the Trade Federation blockading Naboo, anyway?).  This book provides excellent backstory - as well as an interesting and entertaining plot of its own.<br /><br />I won't cover the plot details, as Guy DuBlanc and Alex Diaz-Granados have excellent reviews that do so very well.  What I will add is that the cover art was well-chosen, as the three on the front are indeed the main characters of this novel, as well as pirate Captain Cohl.  Palpatine moves chess pieces at will, and there's a great piece of foreshadowing early on (Valorum wonders where the galaxy would be without the Jedi.  Palpatine's reply: \\"I can only imagine.\\").  Qui-Gon chooses his own path, often against the collective will of the Council, but does so not to rebel as much as following his instincts in order to prevent disaster and nab the bad guys.  This is an important dimension of this character, one that Episode I did not (could not) fully explore.  My only lament is that this novel did not really have any humor in it.  \\"Star Wars\\" isn't a laugh-fest, but should feature some witty barbs and an occasional funny turnabout of events.<br /><br />I recommend reading this and then immediately following it up with Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter (an excellent, fast-paced novel - and tinged with humor, as all \\"Star Wars\\" stories should be).  Then go on to Episode I - and you'll get a fresh viewing of both the noble Qui-Gon and the vile Darth Maul.
B0007OCG56|1.0|... and those are the good qualities. Since when is breaking the law seen as \\"funny\\" and \\"whimsical\\"? Apparently it's when it involves breaking our immigration laws. Sad to see how \\"freely\\" this movie depicts the act. It really shows how we've somehow slipped into this euphoric state where we longer care about our borders. Really glad the Minute Men have the guts to do what our goverenment DOESN'T. Back to the movie: Ok, the characters were not likeable, the pacing was dull, and even Adam couldn't salvage this mess. If you liked real comedies like As Good As It Gets or Punch Drunk Love steer clear of this train wreck.
0743454537|5.0|This novel was an absolute treat. I could not put it down. Picoult's treatment of such a controversial subject, and her portrayal of the deeply conflicting emotions are definitely part of what makes this novel so wonderful. She makes you see both sides of the issue and understand, to the point where you can't side, both the sister's and the mother's situation. Absolutely fantastic. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good, hearty read.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I know, how original, right? Like every other indie rock mag and website hasn't said the same. I'm always skeptical of bands that are hailed as the NEXT BIG THING and the salvation of indie. But with this band, the accolades are not only well-deserved, but true. Arcade Fire's 'Funeral' is absolutely incredible.  <br /> <br />The CD begins with softly tinkling ivories and ends with a heart-stopping wail. In between, it's even better. Unlike quite a few bands these days whose songs seems to bleed together into one bland whole, each track on 'Funeral' is vibrant and distinctive, while still all tying together well. From the crunching guitars and soaring shouts of 'Power Out' to the lilting, carnival-esque 'Crown of Love', to the anthematic gem 'Rebellion (Lies)', every song reveals a new aspect of the band. It's a CD that can be listened to all the way through, and how often do you get that nowadays?  <br /> <br />'Funeral' in itself is a deceptive title. It sprung from the pain of the band who lost several family members during the course of recording. But instead of creating songs of sadness and death, they produced an album that celebrates and is brimming with life. Cheers to Arcade Fire, for taking their grief and turning it into a phenomenal, joyful catharsis.

B0001I55OC|4.0|I had heard this movie was bad.  But I love time travel and adventure so I purchased the DVD on sale.  Both I and my daughter like it (she had seen it in December) and I am 30 years older than she is.  Goes to show you, you can't go by everybody's reviews, you have to see for yourself.  The only thing I wondered was, how could the  sarcophagus be already there with both bodies depicted (and anatomically correct) if Marek had not gone back yet and Lady Claire was to have died and not lived on until Marek went back and changed things?  I could see the writing, which had not been uncovered yet, could have changed after Marek decided to stay but...Time travel stories always bring up those types of questions.  It sounds like the book by Michael Crichton was beloved by many so I need to go read it now.  I find that reading the book afterward is better -- you always find more information than was in the book, differences aside, and you won't be so disappointed if you read the book beforehand.

B000024KBZ|4.0|Coming off the horn heavy funk of \\"Notorious,\\" Duran Duran the trio stripped the sound down to some heavy beats for \\"Big Thing.\\" The first single, \\"I Don't Want Your Love,\\" sounded like a re-invention. Incorporating the current house and new-jack dance trends at the time, it was a major leap away from the candy-floss of \\"Rio.\\" \\"All She Wants Is\\" carried the same sort of dance-floor urgency, and the title track was an arena ready thumper.<br /><br />But the trademark lushness wasn't ever too far off. \\"Too Late Marlene\\" and \\"Land\\" are everything you'd expect from Duran Duran, rich arrangements, Simon's grandiose lyrics and Nick Rhodes' atmospheric keyboards. But perhaps \\"Big Thing's\\" best moment is the tribute to the band's late friend Alex Sadkin, \\"Do You Believe In Shame.\\" Slowing down the swamp groove of \\"Suzie Q\\" and laying in an emotional vocal, \\"Shame\\" connects on a level that only a few songs in the DD library have ever done before.<br /><br />Equally as good as \\"Notorious,\\" and in my opinion, better than the \\"Wedding Album.\\"
B0007N1AI6|4.0|The Good - Pretty much the first three song are a great rebirth of that old Arena-style 80's metal that we've come to love from Judas Priest. Powerful with the best of all the elements that attract us to JP: great riffs, great vocals and a grinding beat. The album is worth buying just for the first three songs alone. <br /> <br />The GREAT - LOCHNESS!!!! What a tune. It took me two or three times with this one because I originally thought it was hokey. But the massiveness of the chorus and pre-chorus will become a staple of the rebirth of Judas Priest for a long time to come. It grew on me to the point where I was looping it on iTunes. This goes up there with Electric Eye, Sentinel and Victim of Changes. <br /> <br />The Bad - Okay, enough already with the Key of E!!!! As much as it is hard for me to find fault with this album, I got to call that out. Come on KK and Glenn, you are Metal Gods! You don't need to do 9 of the 10 songs in the key of E. Throw an F# in there for us. It is for that reason (and maybe the song Angel) that this album get four instead of five stars.  <br /> <br />\\"Retribution\\" is a must have for 30-somethings who are trying to recapture the glory days (just as seeing them on this concert tour is). The goods are delivered! <br /> <br />Keep the faith <br />Davis

B000056NX5|2.0|What on Earth did the director do with the characters????  Great staging, costuming, updating, and fantastic vocal performances can't possibly compensate for the homosexual like interaction of Jesus and the apostles.  Either the woman director has an agenda she's pushing, or she simply has no idea about the way men relate and interact with each other.  One can't watch the scenes between Judas and Jesus without believing the two are 'breaking up'...  It's simply painful to watch. <br /> <br />The priests and guards are totally cool, Pilate is great, Simon Zealots is a tremendous improvement over anything done before, but... Jesus STILL ISN'T GAY - and shouldn't act like it!!   <br /> <br />The play LOOKS great, but because Jesus interacts with the disciples like he's dating them, it destroys everything else in the musical.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|First off I have to admit that the big reason I went to see this film was because Of \\"KING OF QUEENS\\" Kevin James, but it also helped that the very talented Will Smith is in this to. Director Andy Tennant did an excellent job with this film. Various types of humor are incorperated into the film as well as the romantic factor for all you date movie people. This would best be described as a Comedy with romantic elements, not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br />We will start with the star Will Smith, I for one think it is great to see him in something else other then a big budget sci-fi flick again. And he did a excellent job in his first role in this type of film, his preformance is amazing. His charisma and screen precence make his character very belivable. Of course that changes after meeting his love, and he becomes a clumsy idiot, and he plays it greatly. <br /> <br />That brings some one that was miscast, EVA MENDAS. I like her, infact I love her but she just didn't work in this role. She gave what she could, but the preformance wasn't belivable. That's all I can say about that, nothing more nothing less. <br /> <br />Now comes the highlight of the film, the one and only KEVIN JAMES. What can one say about this brilliant preformance. Why dosn't this man make some more movies in his off time from his excellent show \\"KING OF QUEENS\\". Kevin's preformance is so good, so brilliant, so belivable it is nothing short of a classic preformance. His nice guy shy role fits him perfectlly, so much so that when he isn't on screen you are left waiting and wanting more of Mr James. Most of the films best moments happen because of him, the ending is a perfect example, or his early dance scene with Will. <br /> <br />Which brings me to the on screen chemestry of these two brilliant preformers. When both are on screen you will laugh with out a doubt. After the film is over you might be left wanting to see more of them together again on the big screen. The chemestry between the two is amazing, no team I can remember has done so well together since Samual & John on \\"PULP FICTION\\". I'am sure there have been other great teams like Farley & spade in \\"TOMMEY BOY\\", but none have done so in the recent onslaught of terrible movies to come out lately. <br /> <br />Thankfully this film is a gem in the film industry, and I can't wait to own it on dvd when it is released.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I enjoyed Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\" and would recommend the film to those who have lived abroad, especially in Japan.<br /><br />The story involved Bill Murray's character, a washed-up actor in Tokyo to film a Suntory whiskey commercial for $2 million, and his bouts with insomnia, loneliness and questioning of his mid-life existence. He meets another lost soul, played by the up-and-coming actress Scarlett Johansen, and they have a brief, chaste, yet intimate friendship. She's stuck in the hotel where they are living while her photographer husband is out working.<br /><br />Much of the action takes place in their upscale Tokyo hotel, but there are some interesting scenes in surreal bars, clubs, apartments, karaoke boxes and a hospital.<br /><br />Having lived in Japan, I found that Coppola captured much of the intitial culture shock experienced by those new to the country. There is the dazzle of neon lights, indecipherable language, and over-stimulation of music, noise and hordes of people.<br /><br />I found the range of characters and their English language abilities to be fairly accurate, although I think the doctor at the hospital might have had a better understanding.<br /><br />If you're expecting a fast-paced film full of action and humor, this may not be the film for you. It is a subtle, nuanced, deliberate tale, with lots of lingering shots of details and on the characters looking out windows and thinking. It is definitely \\"directed\\" but I think that Coppola did an effective job. Murray's performance, against type, was also outstanding. Johansen has an engaging smile.<br /><br />I haven't read any other reviews, but I imagine that if one hasn't experienced what these characters are going through, you just might not get it. Hence the warning above.
B00001ZT8Y|4.0|I spent a half an hour going from my original 'Bring On The Night' to the anticipated remaster, and I gotta say...hm.  I think we've been had.  I agree with the reviewer that said the original's high end was much cleaner, a lot of which gets muddled on the remaster.  It sounds a bit canned, claustrophobic.  It's louder, that's about it.  Sting has always been meticulous about the sound on his discs and since 'Nothing Like The Sun' all of his recordings have been full 'ddd' digital.  I even recall noting the quality difference when they were first released, when compared to other c.d.'s  of that time.  I give the content 5 stars (no one should be denied this amazing album), the remaster, however...Track down the original.

0767817664|5.0|I'll make this really short.  I was 14 years old when I saw this film.  It scared the living hell out of me.  It also thrilled me to undeath.  The first DVD I bought when I bought a DVD Player in the Spring of 2000 was this one.  It is my favorite vampire film of all time.  Christopher Lee opened my eyes to the fun of vampirism with \\"Horror of Dracula\\" and \\"Dracula Has Risen From the Grave\\".  Public television used to run these films on Friday nights when I was a teenager.  So I say, thanks, Uncle Ted.  He was the host of the monster movie show which brought you older movies. <br />     Fast Forward to the eighties horror where sometimes vampires aren't seen or they're laughed at.  Don't do that to Mr. Holland.  His direction is extraordinary.  Twenty years have passed and this classic deserves a special packaging from Paramount Pictures with some bonus stuff if any exist.  All the traditional things you know about vampires are in this film.  Mr. Holland doesn't fool around and try to put a tolerance level of sunlight on vampires.  The crucifix is definitely painful, as is being staked.  Bram Stoker doesn't have to haunt the screenplay writer.  This is a wonderful horror film.  Treat it with respect.  It's even human enough that it pays tribute to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price.  Applause from me.  These guys made it possible for a film like this to be made.  Some humor is thrown into the film, since there is humor in life.  Real emotions.  Real actors.  20th Anniversary ought to be in session.  Mr. Sarandon, if I could, I'd hand you some kind of \\"Christopher Lee Award\\" for vampire portrayal excellence. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD.
0446525537|5.0|I cannot say enough about this novel. I read it a little more than 4 years ago, and it's still one of my hands-down favorites. It is a very moving storyline. It was the first time I was introduced to Sparks, and since then I have gone on to read all of his novels except \\"Message In A Bottle.\\" He did simply an amazing, amazing job writing it. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an amazing read.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|When I saw \\"Closer\\" in the theatre last December I was getting flashbacks to another Mike Nichols film about relationships gone bad from three decades ago, \\"Carnal Knowledge\\".  As provocative and engrossing as \\"Carnal Knowledge\\" was it was probably one of the more unsettling viewing experiences I ever had.  I felt as if I was eavesdropping on the worst type of behavior people who are allegedly in love could do to one another.  The central characters in \\"Closer\\" behave badly as well yet somehow it is a more palatable viewing experience than \\"Carnal Knowledge\\".  You cannot conveniently villify any of the principle characters in \\"Closer\\".  These are individuals who are caught up in complex emotions and situations that are just overwhelming.  Credit director Nichols and scriptwriter Patrick Marber, whose stage play this film was adapted from, for not providing us with easy answers.  The ensemble cast here is uniformly excellent.  Julia Roberts as Anna probably has done her best work ever here.  Jude Law as Dan gives complexity to a character that could easily be  dismissed as a cad.  Clive Owen's star continues to rise with his account of Larry, the working-class dermatologist.  Natalie Portman is effervescent as Alice, the mysterious stripper.  If you are looking for a provocative film that leaves a little food for thought \\"Closer\\" is it.
B000002H33|5.0|First of all,for all of you who said about Blink 182, Sum 41 or other crap bands like these, get real!If it weren't for the Sex Pistols, you guys would be smashing your heads against the wall, because punk music can't reach the heights of heavy metal.Metallica deserves credit for one of the best heavy metal albums ever, but unforunately acts like the ones mentioned above have totally eclipsed it.If you think Billy Talent or Sum 41 are better than real metal, you probably don't have any brain cells.They sing crap like \\"She left me today, I don't feel OK\\" etc, etc.And for those of you who consider this suicide music, it's not Metallica's fault if you don't got control and you're gonna throw yourself out the window every time you hear this album.Music doesn't kill you.It's your will that counts. <br />The only thing heavier than this was probably Slayer's Reign in Blood,which is great too.And who says this isn't professional?Today's music is full of synthesizers and riffs that a 3 year old could pull.You guys who listen to punk music and who think Korn invented metal, you're probably 5 year old tards that play Halo and eat popcorn.This is one of the finest metal albums of all time. <br />1.Battery-5/5.Great intro track.It deals with anger.Heavy riff. <br />2.Master of Puppets-5/5.An all-time classic, and one of the best heavy metal songs ever.Hammett's solo is wild here. <br />3.The Thing That Should Not Be-3/5.Not one of my faves, but it's dark and creepy.Catchy lyrics and a slower tempo. <br />4.Welcome Home(Sanitarium)-5/5.This song rules.It's about madness, and how insane pacients are treated.Some of it is slow, but that doesn't take off the intensity on other parts. <br />5.Disposable Heroes-4/5.A parallel to \\"One\\" from ...And Justice for All.It's a long song ,and its only flaw is that it might get boring at the end.Great,nonetheless. <br />6.Leper Messiah-5/5.I love this song.The lyrics are a real gem.Those of you who thought it's an anti-christian song, I wouldlike to remind you that Hammett is Christian. <br />7.Orion(Instrumental)-5/5.I'm actually puzzled if this is better than The Call of Ktulu, even though I listened to them countless times.Cliff's bass solo is simply amazing, one of the finest in rock music. <br />8.Damage,Inc-4/5.The intro of this song is most impressive.It's a slice of thrash in the album, and has brutal lyrics.The music is also aggressive,and it's one of the heaviest songs in the album.The ending could have been better, though. <br />Overall:5/5.It's probably the best heavy metal album of all time.Get it now!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is probably one of if not THE BEST album i've ever heard.  track for track this album is phenomenal.  it's beatiful, it's vulnerable, it's endearing, it's amazing.   <br />let's hope she keeps making music like THIS.  if so, she'll be around for a long, long time.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I am picky when it comes to films of the sexual nature. Gorgeous bodies of both sexes, the perfect man/woman scenario. This one, I felt didn't fall into this category. Both Spader and Gyllenhaal are simply....normal looking........<br /><br />The pain that she inflicts on herself did not bother me a bit and I found it very sexy film. It has a happy ending anyway. :0)
0618526412|1.0|In the grand list of books that you will have enjoyed having read, this one ranks slightly above \\"Tom and Jane Go to Camp\\".   <br /> <br />    Now, I'm not going to say that this book was trite, boring, lacking in substance or otherwise devoid of anything resembling redeeming merit, because it does have its purpose.  That purpose being to sit on your shelf and make it appear as though you are some kind of eruditic masochist. <br /> <br />    If, like me, you were forced to read this book as some sophomore hazing ritual, you will no doubt remember that this book contains very little in the way of plot and character development.  The characters don't so much grow as fester. <br /> <br />    I would not recommend this book to anybody, even those that I hate.  People who have suicidal tendencies are warned to stay away as the most cheery portion of this book is slightly happier than a crushed puppy. <br /> <br />    In closing, let me just summarize:  this book is bad. <br />
B000063CPL|5.0|Tremendous. Dickinson is well north of forty at this point, and gives the absolute best vocal performance I've ever heard. I have 10 live Iron Maiden recordings, spanning more or less their entire existence, and this one may well be peak. Bruce holds every note cleanly and in its entirety in songs like Run to the Hills, which is frequently not well represented at live shows.  <br />In addition, the crowd is absolutely electric, able to be heard nigh as loud as the group during play. I've never heard a more appreciative or enthusiastic audience. It literally gave me goosebumps to hear 150,000 plus letting fly with \\"TO MIDNIGHT!\\" Fear of the Dark, often a fantastic live piece, is done justice beyond precedent, with Dickinson working the crowd perfectly and at the most opportune times. There really is a sense that this band has been manipulating audiences for over twenty years; I've never seen or heard it done better. <br />However, the only drawback is a proliferation of newer tracks, disappointing to those looking forward to hearing songs like \\"Heaven can Wait\\" and \\"Wasted Years.\\" You will feel this show in your bones, the hair on your neck will stand up, you'll feel electricity radiate from your pores when this enormous, frenzied mass screams every last lyric of Maiden's absolute best. Enjoy!
0062502182|2.0|The author starts with a nice premise, but unfortunately there's not much plot development happening. All the ideas are carefully explained in a four-page prologue, which makes the book itself redundant. I read on and on, waiting for a revelation, but nothing happened. The writing style was so unbearably didactic that it might as well have been one of those horrible self-help books which seem to be so en vogue these days. Nice try at creating a new classic, but this book is really just a fad.
B0002858YS|5.0|I will admit when I first heard the killers on a Virgin recommends CD(Which I highly suggest you buy next time you are at a virgin record store I ended up buying every album off that thing.) Anyway back to my story. When I first heard them it was of course their first single \\"Somebody told me\\" While I thought it had potential I quickly skipped over it and moved on to the other artist. I was living in San Francisco at the time and was all about Franz Ferdinand when a friend and I got into a discussion about new music. I brought up the killers and commented on how I couldn't figure out their sound based off of \\"Somebody told me\\". One minute their electronica the next their new wave, then they sound like eighties pop. My friend agreed and then we moved on. So fast forward about four months. I have moved to Tampa Bay and watching the rock countdown on MTV 2. Mr. Brightside came on and I almost fell over in my chair. I was so in love with that song and with Brandon Flowers by the end of that song. I quickly ran out and bought the CD. It didn't come out of my CD player for a month and I have a 4hour commute each day. For all the reasons I said I din't like them just a few months before I loved them for. Mr.Brightside is truly an amazing song as is the rest of the CD and if you had to pick the weakest song on the album it would have to be \\"Somebody told me.\\" I suggest that you invest in this album. By the way I called my friend back in SF and said that I wanted to retract my previous statement about the Killers. I told him the story of why I know loved them. He listened to what I said then said that he too had heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and had done the exact same thing I did. So re-invest some time in things you first don't totally like.
0783219695|5.0|People can sometimes become complacent when it comes to technology and forget that it is the product of human endeavors that are far from perfect.  Usually, engineers and builders do their best to ensure that the technology to be used is safe.  However, mistakes can and sometimes do happen.  Such was the case during NASA's Apollo 13 moon mission that was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 11, 1970.  Intended to be the third landing and human exploration of the lunar surface, many people had lost interest in the program following the huge success of the previous two missions that included the first-ever manned landing on the moon.  However, such complacency was quickly replaced by fear and anxiety, as the fates of the three Apollo 13 astronauts were unknown following a potentially lethal accident.  These fears, anxieties and hopes were beautifully captured by director Ron Howard in his 1995, Oscar-nominated film aptly named \\"Apollo 13\\".<br /><br />In the film, the three Apollo 13 astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), have a flawless launch as they set out for the moon.  Jack Swigert was not originally supposed to be part of the Apollo 13 crew though.  It was supposed to be Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), but when NASA doctors thought that he might have the mumps, he was grounded and Jack Swigert replaced him.  This caused some minor consternation among all involved, but the mighty Saturn 5 rocket was launched on April 11, 1970 anyway.  Everything appeared to be going normally until April 14, some 205,000 miles away from the Earth.  Jack Swigert was instructed to mix the oxygen tanks, which, when he did, caused an explosion.  The explosion caused multiple failures on board making the Mission Control personnel initially think that there was simply a communications or monitoring equipment failure.  However, once Jim Lovell & Fred Haise regained control of the damaged ship, Jim Lovell reported to Mission Control those immortal words, \\"Houston, we have a problem.\\"  Once Mission Control personnel realized the severity of the situation, they considered ordering the crew to turn back, but there was no way to know whether the main rocket booster had been damaged.  Instead, they opted for the safer, but longer route that would have the damaged ship go around the moon, then begin its return to Earth.  Since the crew had to shut off power and had no active guidance computer, the tension was very high as Jim Lovell & Fred Haise manually operated the lunar-lander's rocket to cause the ship to return to Earth.  Other problems included the intense cold (since there wasn't enough power for heat), having to adapt the square air filters from one ship to work in the round filter holes in the other so that they would not die from asphyxiation, boredom, not knowing whether or not the ship's systems would come back on properly, not knowing whether the heat shield had been damaged and Fred getting sick.  This was truly one of NASA's finest moments in being able to assist the otherwise helpless crew be able to return to Earth, including Ken Mattingly working hard on the ground to help ensure that the Apollo 13 crew would be able to turn on what they need with the little power that they had available.<br /><br />Other memorable characters in the film include Mission Control chief Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan) and Blanch Lovell (Jean Speegle Howard, 1927-2000).  For its overall realism, wonderful cinematography, engaging story and wonderful acting, I rate \\"Apollo 13\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  The film won two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, but was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Art & Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.  Additionally, Ed Harris received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, as did Kathleen Quinlan for Best Supporting Actress.  If you have never seen the film, but aren't sure that you want to purchase a copy, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.ve never seen the film, but aren't sure that you want to purchase a copy, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.
B00018D3JQ|1.0|this band needs to be disbanded. They turned Love will tear us apart into an inspipid pop tune. such a blasphemy of one of the all time great song.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|'The Fable of the Brown Ape' is haunting and sticks with you for a long time, reminiscent of 'The Weeping Song'. 'Supernaturally' is very romantic, and rocks.  'Get Ready for Love' I didn't like at first but then I changed my mind after a while.  Same with 'O Children'.  This album definitely benefits from repeat listenings.  If you already like Nick Cave you will like this.  If you haven't listened to him yet buy 'Best of'.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The first time (of 10 probably) that I saw this movie it made perfect sence to me for some odd reason. I couldn't pin point why I thought I had some deap cosmic connection to this movie, I wasn't from Idaho, I was popular in high school,I am a female, never worn moon boots....was it just the good herb that night? <br /> <br />I started reading more about the movie and the writers to discover that they as well as Napolean (Jon Heder)  are LDS (mormon)....that was the connection! Even though I have long since been excommunicated, that is what made the movie make perfect sence to me. Remember the, singing sign language scene? If you were raised Mormon you too know one song in sign language, we all learned it, performed it.....come on sing along .....as I have loved you....loved one .......but I digress. Not that others wont love this movie just as much if they never were LDS....just gives me more inside appreciation for Napolean. <br /> <br />I HIGELY recommend Napolean Dynamite chemically altered, or otherwise. <br /> <br />VOTE FOR PEDRO!!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This film is great. One would compare it to Se7en, however the horror is more explicit. The story is brilliant, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire length of the film. This is definitely a must see. And what a sick mind the writer must have :-)
B00005ASHM|5.0|No, I'm not going to downplay revolver of course people claim the album to be so underrated that this inversely makes it overrated, but lets not bother with those \\"music elites\\".  Pet Sounds is a brillian album that grabs you through the hands of mild encouragemnt and intimate desire of love and dreams.  I think what is commonly misconceived is that this is an album and singling out certain aspects or comparign various songs to one another or to other bands is generically puerile.  This album stands well on its own and I suppose if you want to be hip and original rag on it some more and be openly orginal and say the world never noticed Revolver and you understood its genius even though you were born in 1985 and were forcefed the history of the record by Amazon.  I think there is a natural tendency to overrate the 1960s and Rolling Stone expemplifies this tendency through there much ambiguous \\"top 100 albums of all time\\". But of course I understand.  As long as Astral Weeks sits behind three Beatles albums on a top album list I'll be assured that people tend to prefer direct catchiness and originality in form of production.  and I'll understand.  Don't mind astral weeks complete rejections of melody and experimental contortion of tune and rhythm.  It's much too boring.  It doesn't vary enough.  Wawa.  Revolver is so experimental!!! Geez guys... \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.  I love it.  I'm so original nobody understands it and I'll explain why its so great.  It the sitar.. theres so much going on.  Great Great production....\\"  Wow. its a okay song that its just completely overproduced that sounds like a trip to another planet.  You people make me sick. <br /> <br />Yeah, so I'm rambling.  Is this a great album? Yes.  Don't let anybody sway you anyway.  Don't just skip to tracks 1 and 8 and turn off your album.  Don't call tracks 2,3, and 4, the down part of the album.  I'm sorry you were expecting something that didnt toy with melodies so much and with much more underground, \\"genius\\", production?  Maybe you should try Revolver.  Those beatles....
0743506650|5.0|For me, Stephen King was always more than a writer. He was a window to somewhere else-somewhere dark, spooky and magnificent.   <br /> <br />As a boy, while my mother lay dying from illness on the second floor of our home, I would lie in my bed and read as vampires took hold of a sleepy little Maine town. <br /> <br />It was fiction. But, it was somewhere else. It was dark. But, it was better than where I was. King's books got me through some tough times. It's a great feeling to hear someone say that to you.  It's an awkward and humbling experience. <br /> <br />When On Writing came out, I had to have it. I had to know what made this man tick. It was the best money I'd ever spent. <br /> <br /> I had read many books on the craft. King was right when he said that they were mostly B.S. other than Elements of Style.  <br /> <br />The fantastic thing about this book is it dissects not only the thought process of the writer, but the life. It puts things in perspective for those who choose to venture down the path of writing. It's funny, heart-wrenching, and at times, especially during the part about his childhood, tragic. <br /> <br />It was a fantastic look into the life and times of a living legend, and if you are a writer, I can't stress enough what a disservice you are doing to yourself by not owning this. <br /> <br />The insights in this book are priceless, and listening to it, I was sure I was right when I said if there was one author I would love to talk to, it would be King. He is candid, he's funny, he doesn't put on airs. He's  <br /> . . .well . . . just a normal guy with a great talent. And the fact fame didn't change him into a \\"Do you know who I am?\\" type is inspiring and says a lot about the man's character. <br /> <br />Now, as I start working on my third book, I feel somehow armed after listening to King's experiences. I feel better equipped to deal with characters who don't want to work, stories that fight you tooth-and-nail that you just don't think are worth sweating over-like King said of Carrie. <br />So, if you're a King fan or a struggling writer, plunk that money down. <br />It's worth it. <br />If you're already published, plunk that money down. <br />Only a fool thinks that there is nothing left to learn. <br /> <br />Stephen . . .  <br />After all these years . . .  <br />You still rock!
B000005JAX|4.0|Counterfeit is a quite odd album or ep as the proper name for it is and it is not my favorite album. The main problem is that it is a bit sparse with the sounds and some of the songs sound like they should have been worked on some more and Gore could have added some more layers of sounds. Gore has some of the best vocals in the business and on this album we can truly hear that he is not just the once in a while singer for Depeche Mode but an accomplished singer in his own right. The album cover is a bit cryptic but is probably to mean something which I have not grasped as of yet and to me it simply looks like avantgare art gone astray. Even though I have my reservations against this album, it still deserves 4 stars for the pure brilliance of Gore as a vocalist and for his ability to mold songs into his own creation and that is never easy.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine were definitely one of the best bands from the 1990s, and their debut remains their strongest effort. When RATM made it big in the early 90s, they were a breath of fresh air. They borrowed sounds and styles from other bands, like the MC5 and Led Zeppelin, but were also distinctly groundbreaking and original.<br /><br />First and foremost, they were just such a killer band. Drummer Brad Wilk and bass player Timmy G were an exciting and dynamic rhythm section. Guitarist Tom Morello came up with some of rock's best riffs and solos in years. Singer Zack De La Rocha singing/rapping was intense and urgent, and his lyrics were intelligent and insightful, yet never simplistic or pretentious. The lyrics will make you think, will make you question your life and your values, and societal values and norms. The band sounds raw and intense, yet the production is clean and crisp, so it's easily assessable.<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine is band that should appeal to all different types of people. There's definitely an element of rap/hip-hop, punk, as well as classic rock. This album never lets up. From the opening \\"Bombtrack\\" to the closing \\"Freedom,\\" every song is intense, and has an infectious groove and catchy riff. It's really impossible to choose any standout, because really the entire CD is quite excellent.<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine's other two albums \\"Evil Empire,\\" \\"The Battle For Los Angeles,\\" and the cover album \\"Renagades\\" are also quite good, but I'd start off with the classic debut. Easily their best album and one of the decade's best CDs.
B0001O3YEE|2.0|Pitch Black brings to the screen the story of a spaceship carrying a wide variety of passengers that experiences technical problems while en route and is forced to crash land on a planet dominated by flying pterodactylus type monsters.   <br />The acting is very poor to the point that acting lessons are needed ASAP for everyone involved.   <br />The \\"bad guy\\" is much more like the usual pompous high school jock/\\"pretty boy\\" seen over and over again in those types of movies.  Apart from his weak appearance he fails to convince in his role as a mean and greedy drug addicted mercenary. <br />Furthermore, he somehow manages to kick Vin Diesel's butt repeatedly!!!   <br />Moreover, what was the point of the Muslim cleric with his four acolytes??? <br />Or the Australian woman and the arrogant Englishman for that matter? <br />Not to mention the obnoxious, spoiled kid who for some reason is not scared at being stuck on \\"hell planet\\" and who has a \\"surprise\\" for us later on in the movie. <br />Unless of course the whole point of having these annoying characters in the film was for the audience to enjoy seeing them picked off one by one in true B-movie fashion (as I've seen other reviewers characterize the movie). <br />In a nutshell, it's an average plot, the acting and the actors are very weak, the dialogues are poor and the special effects are very good.  <br />The potential for a great movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than average.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a B-movie so one should not expect too much.  <br />Overall, both Vin Diesel as well as the rest of the \\"cast\\" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Pitch Black is shown on TV. <br />
B00003003R|5.0|Some of these songs are live, but the majority are the re-recorded tracks that Axl made in the studio with the new GN'R lineup. He extracted his audio and placed it over top of the old band's instruments, so they were legally allowed to say it's \\"live\\" (because only the vocals are updated, it's a technicality).  <br /> <br />It's easy to hear this in the songs, too. Axl was always a bit unreliable live (his voice often becoming raspy and out of key as he screamed so much and it hurt his vocal chords) but on Rocket Queen, Sweet Child O' Mine and Welcome to the Jungle he hits every note. Also you can tell it's the \\"New Axl\\" because he's got that high-pitched, \\"whiny\\" sound. <br /> <br />I am not trashing this album. It's excellent. I am a fan of Axl and support him. I disagree with people who diss Chinese Democracy; now that \\"I.R.S.\\" has been leaked, judging from how excellent it is, and how great Axl's vocals are, maybe the \\"Axl is an idiot\\" crowd will stop picking on him. <br /> <br />\\"Live Era\\" is a must for fans. It's two discs and features (basically) all their greatest hits. The Sweet Child O' Mine track is the same as the track recorded with New GN'R for the \\"Big Daddy\\" (1999) soundtrack. During the end credits, Sheryl Crowe's version \\"morphed\\" into New GN'Rs'. Pretty neat. <br /> <br />Worth a listen if you're a fan, or are interested in hearing what the re-recording of Appetite for Destruction sounds like, at least vocally.
B00000F3KL|5.0|Definitely a great movie, Black Hawk Down, brings to the screen a story that many followed at the time and thus are familiar with; the 1993 international (this one truly was...) intervention in Somalia, which ended abruptly and some might say in a fiasco.  <br />The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind. <br />Needless to say, Josh Hartnett, Jason Isaacs, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! <br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />In short, it is a movie worth watching! <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 is like luda...1 album wonders.  50 has one hot album- \\"get rich or die tryin\\"...luda has one hot album-\\"back for the first time\\".  to be honest i think rap is falling apart.  even eminem's new cd doesn't even come close to how perfect his past 3 were.  he's already rapped about everything he can think of so thats ok.  but 50...sad...
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Mystic River, brings to the screen the story of three old friends who reunite years after a traumatic experience made them drift apart.  The circumstances under which they meet again are not the best and their old friendship will soon be put to the test... <br />To a certain extent Mystic River bring to mind Sleepers (also starring Kevin Bacon, but in a much different role). <br />Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburn, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  The actors give it their 100% and it really shows! <br />The only setback is in relation to Tom Guiry who as Brendan Harris is not really convincing in his role as Katie's boyfriend (He does not seem to be \\"all man\\" if you catch my drift...).  <br />Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.   <br />Overall, Mystic River is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. <br />
B0007OASII|4.0|Kamelot.  With their 7th release, eight counting their live album, Kamelot is a staple of the Symph Metal genre.  When I first picked up this album, it was with a sense of uphoria in that I was about to be introduced to yet another masterpiece by Khan and the gang, and I was not disappointed.  March of Mephisto, the first single, pounds its way onto the scene with force and instantly establishes where the band stands musically speaking.  For those of you not familiar with Kamelot's history, their last album Epica saw a slight departure from the speedy melodic metal of old and an entry into a more progressive sound, almost a delicate mix of the two.  The Black Halo continues this, as most of the tracks on this CD follow the same principle.  Therefore if you are not a huge fan of say Karma, you might find it worth your while to check this one out.  The only reason I marked The Black Halo down a notch is because while it is a wonderful CD, I consider Karma to be my favorite Kamelot CD.
0452283760|4.0|First of all, I'd like to warn that this is a review focusing not only on the book: the only reason it got so high in stars from me is because it has a good story.  I'd like to focus a moment on the philosophy, because as Rand states this book is her one epitome of her philosophy.    Think about it. Rand wants a world where people listen to reason, for reasons sake, because reason is God and there is one mode of reasoning that is the all-encompassing truth: and that is hers.    Rand herself describes the book as philosophy put into form of a thriller. The fact is, if a person were to begin learning Rand's philosophy in its driest form with all the facts, and fewer immensely valorized events and characters, it would hardly hold the widespread appeal it holds to readers today. If she wanted to appeal solely to reason, Rand would not be openly resentful and effectively say \\"nobody's happy without my way of life\\".      Rand belittles, indirectly, those who refuse to patronize Roark's art, but what if his art doesn't make them happy?  Does this make them horrible people not to bend to his will?  He refuses to give any ground himself.  It seems to me like he is trying to force his will on everyone else JUST as much as he perceives all the \\"evil\\" people doing to each other in likewise fashion.    The Fountainhead is an extremely biased book, and claims I try to force my values on everyone because I am occasionally kind to people without having purpose in doing so, and am unhappy because I act on my emotions once in awhile. If you think about it, why do these characters do what they do? Because being unfailing \\"reasonable\\", seeing themselves at war with the world, and whatnot else MAKES THEM HAPPY.     I'm not Rand's printed heroes, so I know their actions and thinking would never make me happy; trust me, I've been down the road of zealotry toward objectivism for a long while, following my first reading of the Fountainhead at 17.  My happiness outside Rand's thoughtbox wouldn't fit in the objectivist point of view because all her ideas are absolute and irrevocable. Kinda like God's decrees.  However, I'm sure people are happy in this way and I won't stop you.    In my opinion, this is has all the signs of a religious text, complete with all the zealotry, valorized characters and events, even absolute answers to the meaning of life.  It's like a godless Bible.  Religion for the atheist.  Something vernacular one can believe in.  Yet Rand says we should have heroes we can live up to: I challenge anyone to find anybody in real life that can be as completely Roark as Roark.    This review is not to say Ayn Rand is a horrible author. She presents ideas that open my eyes to a different point of view, and certain points made I agree with in earnest. Also, philosophy aside the book is quite original (though, based very loosely on the life of the esteemed architect Frank Lloyd Wright), well written, and presented in a method that engages me quite well. I think Rand is a good author. But overall as a philosopher, I cannot take her seriously.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|Let me say about Sprinsteen's politics, I do not agree with them in the least. However, he is NOT like Linda Ronstadt, Steve Earle, or certain members of the Hollywood left who HATE America (Woody Harrelson, Jessica Lange etc), those people are on my boycott list. I will not listen to music like \\"41 Shots\\" cause I find them offensive, but this CD is ok for fellow conservatives to listen to. What is wrong with it, is not having \\"10th Avenue Freeze Out\\" and \\"Pink Cadillac\\" on it, which makes me deduct 2 stars.
B000001Y5X|3.0|This is a good solid album for Manson. Not his best work, which I personally believe is Holywood. If you are looking to collect Manson albums this however would be the last one to add to a collection. Has some good songs, but not his best work. If you are a hardcore Mansonite you will love this album, but if not you probably won't. It is just different from his later stuff like Antichrist Superstar or Holywood.
6303607942|5.0|Superlatives are usless in describing this performance. Horowitz at the age of 75, with hands that appear to be slightly arthritic gives an emotionaly charged performance. Faults? I was so entranced, I noticed none. Camera work superb, just enough of the conductor and great shots of Horowit'z face and hands.
0060090383|5.0|I was introduced to the amazing Marian Keyes through her hilarious book Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, and once i read that, i was hooked! I buy each one of her books as soon as i know it has been released, and i've never been disappointed. Rachel's Holiday is amazing. Funny, heartbreaking, shocking, i couldn't put it down. The story is shown through Rachel's eyes, so you really see her journey through denial, anger, and eventually realisation. But it is never dark or dull, always finding the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel! Her descriptions as she arrives at the centre are laugh out loud funny, with her insistence that they must be \\"in the middle of re-decorating\\" A must read!
B0007MVXQG|1.0|Back during Judas Priest's heyday, at the height of their popularity, they totally sucked (I still crack up whenever I hear the bone-headed \\"BREAKIN' THE LAW! BREAKIN' THE LAW!\\"). From what I've heard of this comeback album, they're still up to their old suckiness. Just plundering meat-head rock, hardly proficient or heavy.<br /><br />P.S. - If Rob Halford is as tough as he makes himself out to be, why did it take him so long to come out as a pachadermis? LOL
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I purchased this album when it came out under pure loyalty.  \\"Iowa\\" is one of the best albums that I have ever heard in terms of hard emotion and truth.  I was a bit thrown off by Vol. 3 when I got to track 6, \\"Circle.\\"  Good song, lyrically.  But far too Stone Sour for me.  Others have said that, but I must reiterate.   <br />Anyway, I recommend this album from top to bottom.  It is a new level of emotion for the boys and really, I just can't stop listening to it.  But if you are skeptical, pick it up for two songs.  \\"Opium of the People\\" and \\"The Nameless.\\"  Two amazing musical tracks that would probably get my mother's head to start moving.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|First, let's dispense with the plot.<br /><br />It's utterly preposterous, from the notion of flying giant robots to underwater airplanes to the hidden villain \\"Totenkopf\\" to rescue pods for the critters sent up on the rocket ark. (Why rescue pods for critters meant never to return to earth?) But then the plots of most of your lighter action/scifi movies are preposterous. Think \\"National Treasure,\\" any James Bond movie, most Jackie Chan movies. Moreover, \\"wooden\\" and \\"campy\\" are about the kindest descriptions I can think of for the acting.<br /><br />What makes \\"Sky Captain\\" worthwhile is its enthralling reimagining of the Art Deco Manhattan of the 1930s, with its muted colors and grainy film-stock texture. What makes it worthwhile is its bold creation of impossible technology that looks precisely as it should look, given the era in which the story takes place. What makes it worthwhile is its Saturday-matinee energy and optimism; the old can-do Americanism of Doc Savage and his crew. What makes it worthwhile is its verve, dash and over-the-top style.<br /><br />I mean, how brilliant is it to shoot the film in color, convert it to black and white in the computer, and then recolorize it \\"by hand\\"? A hand-tinted film!<br /><br />How brilliant is it to resurrect old footage of Laurence Olivier (gone 15 or 20 years now) and convert him into \\"Totenkopf\\"?<br /><br />Perhaps the most important thing about this film is what it might lead to. Now entire worlds can be created from pure imagination, a few actors, computer talent and a studio with a giant blue screen.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Kerry Conran does with Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"A Princess of Mars.\\"
0060934913|4.0|The first third is great; I couldn't put it down. Somewhere halfway through, I hit a speed bump, then struggled through the final third as it became somewhat repetitive. Having said that, this is a dynamically written, intriging tale of kitchen life. It will be highly entertaining to anyone who cooks professionally or to avid home chefs who spend a lot of time with Williams Sonoma catalogs.
B00003CY5J|1.0|one of the worst movie I ever saw and I am an amateur of the cast(Deer Hunter, American History X, Godfather, last tango in paris, Heat, ...) <br />I fell asleep and it was 5PM on a Sunday ..
0143034901|4.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon's Barcelona-set SHADOW OF THE WIND has been repeatedly compared--quite inaccurately--to Borges, but it is really more akin to Sebastien Japrisot's A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT and Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT: it's basically a multi-threaded story of doomed love, set against historical upheaval and pieced together years after the fact. It has fine Gothic atmospherics that really make it compelling. There are, however, quite a number of narrative lapses throughout that may betray the author's comparative youth. (For example, Ruiz Zafon frequently has his main character read documents by other characters that are all told in the same basic style and that have information within them to which the characters writing the narrative could not possibly be privy.) It was an enjoyable read all told, however--whatever its errors, I could not wait to get back to it while reading it.
B000002UDB|5.0|Rich Latta  December 12, 2004<br /><br />[note: although I came up with this idea on my own, I've since encountered bootleg mixes that attempt to do something along the lines of what I'm suggesting here. However, the running order I've come up with is far superior to anything else I've encountered (IMHO)]<br /><br />To: Apple, Capitol, EMI, Sony, Michael Jackson:: Whomever This May Concern:<br /><br />RE: an idea that may be even cooler than the YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack re-release.<br /><br />Roll the clock back to 1967 . . .<br /><br />Imagine an alternate reality in which the Beatles were still getting along famously and the group was not disrupted by the sudden death of manager Brian Epstein (to quote George Harrison, \\"by 1968 the rot had already set in\\"). Imagine it was acceptable for Beatles record singles to simultaneously appear on their respective albums. Now imagine the Beatles, after just releasing SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, have focused their efforts on making another fantastic album instead of becoming sidetracked by movie projects. Finally they emerge with a psychedelic masterpiece to rival SGT. PEPPER'S. The end result is a double album - the definitive MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album!<br /><br />This revised and expanded collection of classics would consist of material recorded from the first SGT. PEPPER sessions (that didn't appear on that album) up to before THE BEATLES (White album) sessions. This includes all the songs from the original MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (American album/British EP set), the Beatles songs from the original YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack, the singles from this time period, plus unreleased instrumental music from the MMT soundtrack recorded by the Beatles. As a special limited edition release, how about a double gatefold vinyl LP mixed for that format (still arguably the best fidelity around today). The cover could be more psychedelic, perhaps in 3-D, the inside could contain special photos and text (why not from the original British double EP?) and maybe even a Beatles adventure/story about an alternate reality that lead to this album.<br /><br />There's really no need for purist Beatles fans to get touchy with a little revisionist history since the whole project was pretty confused from the beginning. Had the Beatles maintained the focus they had with SGT. PEPPER'S they might have created the ultimate psychedelic album. In my view, this little idea of mine would come pretty close to achieving that.<br /><br />With the following collection of songs, you can create one side of 5 songs and 3 sides of 4 songs. The first side could contain the origial \\"Flying\\" instrumental while each remaining side could include \\"Flying 2,\\" \\"Flying 3,\\" and \\"Flying 4.\\" The extra \\"Flying\\" tracks would consist of instrumental soundtrack material recorded by the Beatles and never before released on record (Beatles fans would no doubt love to get their hands on this stuff): \\"Shirley's Wild Accordion a: Waltz b: Freaky Rock\\" and \\"Jessie's Dream.\\" Thus, you could have 4 sides of 5 songs each. Otherwise, there are a few other unreleased Beatles cuts that might be worth considering as well.<br /><br />Immediately following is my recommendation for the running order which I tinkered with and fine tuned extensively before creating my own copy. I found it useful to put 1 of George Harrison's 4 songs as well as original MMT songs on each side.<br /><br />MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR expanded Fourth Dimension edition<br />The album that could have been . . .<br /><br />Side 1:<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour<br />Penny Lane<br />Blue Jay Way<br />Flying<br />Strawberry Fields<br /><br />Side 2:<br /><br />Fool on the Hill<br />Lady Madonna<br />Flying 2<br />All Together Now<br />It's All Too Much<br /><br />Side 3:<br /><br />Flying 3<br />Your Mother Should Know<br />Only a Northern Song<br />Hey Bulldog<br />Baby, You're a Rich Man<br /><br />Side 4:<br /><br />Inner Light<br />Flying 4<br />Hello, Goodbye<br />I Am the Walrus<br />All You Need is Love
B000001GPX|5.0|There'd be a whole lot of dead copycats. His understand of Beethoven's fifth is thrilling in its completeness and warmth. His structural cohesion of this symphony is the ultimate winner of this set - very few(perhaps Toscanini and Furtwaengler) can match it, but never in Kleiber's own way. Carlos is a unique force, a singularity. His interpretation of the fifth says something that no one else has ever said, and that is quite a thing. Also, the sound of the Vienna Philharmonic here is the classic Kleiber family sound: lean, profound, and affecting. It adds a stamp of individuality to the definitive interpretation. <br /> <br />We come to the seventh, which is not worse than Kleiber's fifth, though I say he was outdone - not by much, mind you, but outdone nonetheless - by Furtwaengler's searing 1942 live Berlin Philharmonic performance, which has the sad defect of awful recording quality. So get this seventh, as it is the best alternative and will please you mightily. The Allegretto in particular is haunting and deep, and seems to have been written to fit the Kleiber sound.   <br /> <br />So get this CD now, or you might die empty.
B00004UEIF|5.0|Bill Evans will always be one of the most sublime exponents of the jazz understood and conceived as the supreme improvisation art. Evans `s sensibility and phrasing is absolutely evident in every little bar his velvet fingers played. He had as the most of the creators, the right approach, the sense of rapture, the discrete enchantment and the spelling atmosphere to show the core of every work.<br /><br />All his works through his career reveal that notable characteristic so typical of the poet man: the non exhausted capacity to re invent himself constantly: innovation is transformation.<br /><br />So in these terms his craft will survive generations and generations because it is based on convictions and inner values that have nothing to do with material issues.<br /><br />This historical record will be an unvaluable testimony for the future listeners about the trascendence and importance of this colossal musician.
B00005U8EM|2.0|This film has been shown in Eastern Philosophy classes to put reincarnation in simple context.  Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience.  Nevertheless the pros outweigh the cons, one being a great vehicle for Bill Murray's improvisation.<br /><br />  There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world?  The only possible solution to this, considering noone else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory.  So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see.  So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world.  So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more.<br /><br />  So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd?  The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him.  In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives.  So what could account for Phil?  Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours.  The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish.  The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory.<br /><br />  Now, I like the dialogue and find it funny, but one must admit some of it is strictly cheap laughs.  But as far as any overall \\"moral message\\" it gets lost in oversentimentality especially at the end.  The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use TRICKS to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).  The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes<br /><br />the TRICKS as to impress her beyond belief.  Remember that close to to last night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last \\"perfect\\" day.  On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so.  So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want.<br /><br />  If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a classic.  As it is it's a very good comedy...but it could have been so much more.is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use TRICKS to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).

1592400876|5.0|I had best proofread this carefully.  Lynne Truss has written what appears to be a little book, but in fact is a thought provoking, incredibly clever, laugh-out-loud-funny, and richly informative piece that I have read more than once.  As a teacher of English as a Foreign Language (and born critic) I have used Truss' little gem to check my own understanding of a fine point or two, to substantiate quite a few of my opinions, to brighten my day with a good laugh, and to feel less alone in a world of misplaced apostrophes.
B00008AY3L|2.0|Ben Harper is much hyped but after taking the plunge and listening to this album I was very disappointed. Harper's thin and whiny voice is probably the worst aspect, but the songwriting is insipid and repetitive, the arrangements standard off-the-shelf fare, and the lyrics trite. I'm sorry, but Harper is another derivative sound-alike and lacks the talent and originality to interest me. I'll give him a second-star for the admittedly competent musicianship, however. <br /> <br />For all those complaining about the copy protection of the CD, I borrowed it from a friend and ripped it to MP3 using MusicMatch 10 with no problems whatsoever - in fact I only became aware of the copy protection much later while reading these reviews.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be just another try-hard Thunderbirds imitation. Oh, how wrong I was! How very wrong! Puppets, yes. Kids, definitely not.<br /><br />The basic story follows an actor in his new life as a member of Team America, (the other member was killed in Paris). The Team are on the case of North Korean Kim Jong Il, and his plot to destroy the world, with the assistance of Alec Baldwin and the Film Actors Guild, (FAG).<br /><br />In the process, this film offends just about everyone, while following the violent and ludicrously funny exploits of Team America. This movie takes puppets and comedy to whole new levels in violence and sensuality, (if you can call it that). The laughs just keep coming relentlessly. Kim Jong Il's serenade about being so lonely is funny, and that is about as sensitive as it gets.<br /><br />The rest is in-your-face satire that is not too subtle, (a sledeghammer comes to mind). It is gratuitously violent, which just adds to the mayhem and laughter, and there is a fair amount of vomit as well. Refined culture is not a big thing for this movie as it pokes fun at just about everything and everyone.<br /><br />I have rarely laughed so hard in my life, and my tear ducts were soon dry. It was almost embarrassing choking in public. This movie is a must! It is awesome!<br /><br />Just don't take the kids, ok?
6304696515|5.0|This bitter statement comes from Glenn Close in the final dialogue with John Malkovich and somehow resume scrupulously the final consequences of defy and challenge such sensible and perdurable feeling as love is.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock sated in a famous interview with Francois Truffaut that the three fundamentals factors for a good movie were to his mind: 1)A good script, 2)A good script and 3) A good script. And if also you add the presence of this glorious cast you the obtained result will be by far, still major than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />This mature drama is a cold bet between two outlaw human beings, far descendents in spirit, evidently of Don Juan. One of them, the female will establish the rules of the game and the other part will have to make the agreement. In this sinister everything will be allowed and the goal will justify the way to reach it.<br /><br />The seduction has never had such sinister face, understood as the unspoken road to blend two different wills in the final act. In this case, the seduction is just the frame and not the landscape. You can argue all what your imagination, good manners, touch of class, and promises of never ending love the feminine soul can accept. And all this huge effort is done just to satisfy a genuine and perverse fascination: the vanity .<br /><br />But as you know the life owns much more imagination than us and in this macabre labyrinth the love may be spying on behind our unconscious wishes and twisting our original purposes.<br /><br />John Malkovich simply remarkable with the role of his life until the date, draws an admirable portrait . Glenn Close is superb too as the perverse, analytical and cold mind. Pfeiffer and Thurman are unequal playing the role of the ambitioned objects of desire.<br /><br />The dialogues are eloquent; the artistic decoration, design customer, photography and edition are first rate. This film owned all the demanded conditions to win all the possible acclaims and prizes all over the world. If the result was not the expected you will have to find other kind of explanations far distant and certainly not so pleasant.<br /><br />But the time has always been the best judge to emphasize the supreme qualities of the real masterpieces, and in this case this picture will not be able the exception. You can realize how its cult status has prevailed and even improved through the years and definitively this constitutes a good signal.

B0002VC924|2.0|A strangely dull and unsurprising effort, given all the publicity.  Right from the start I could see this was going to be far too biased and misleading to be taken seriously.  Moore's efforts to discredit the Bush regime are pretty laughable in places.  Then again, footage of Iraqi civilians killed and injured by the American army are powerful and moving, and interviews with soldiers who seem to find the whole thing &#34;awesome&#34; and a &#34;rush&#34; really do stir the anti-American, anti-war sentiments.  All the more confusing when, after showing them to be such a brainless and dislikable bunch, the film turns into a tribute to the soldiers and the sacrifices they make.  It all peters out rather disappointingly.  Still, Bush does come across as a bit of an idiot, and you wouldn't trust that Rumsfeld chap to make a cup of tea.  Just a shame Moore has to twist things round so much to fit his 'message'.

0060763280|5.0|No kidding.  My husband has suffered from suicidal depression for at least seven years.  When I decided to go to T. Harv Eker's \\"Millionaire Mind Intensive\\" three-day seminar, I told my husband I didn't care if he wanted to go or not.  He was so shocked, he actually chose to go.  Later that year, after having turned his life almost completely around he credits Harv's methods as the turning point for him.   <br /> <br />Harv knows what he's talking about, and even if you've heard it all from everyone else, Harv has a way of putting it that makes more sense than anyone else.  You will discover things about yourself you never knew you never knew.   <br /> <br />Harv's book is \\"worth its weight in gold.\\"  For any of you who have also read David R. Hawkins' book \\"Power vs. Force,\\" my family all calibrated Harv's book, and it came out at 870!  That's pretty impressive for a book about money.  What Harv teaches is timeless and universal.   <br /> <br />If you haven't been getting what you want out of life, it's because there's something you don't know.  Harv has it figured out, and he's not only using it to produce phenomenal success in his own life, but he can help you achieve it in yours.  If you never buy another book about getting rich, or living an abundant life, or even just being happy, this is the book you must have.  It changed my entire life, the lives of my husband and children, and of my extended family as well.  It has the power to change yours, but only if you buy it, read it, and DO it.  The great part is... it's not at all hard to DO.  (If I sound like I'm giving a sales pitch, it's because I am... I am completely SOLD on this way of living, and Harv teaches it better than anyone!)

It's no worse than 'Batman & Robin' (Yet again what is?) but it's still not something to watch, worst own or rent. Altho Val Kilmer still tried keeping its cool like Keaton, the original Batman, it doesn't mean it's average. Indeed it has a great cast like all Batman movies but literally it's junk. Do not get this, it will make the direcotr feel like he did a decent job which he obviously didn't. Besides this,  stay away from 'Batman & Robin' please! <br /> <br />Thank you.

B0007TX894|4.0|This is good stuff, a solid improvement on Stupid Dream and Signify (two very good albums in their own right). There's a lot of thematic stuff going on, and it's darker but not overly so. Porcupine Tree seems to be drifting away from catchier stuff into exploring themes that flow and ebb, building through songs, and I like it. I like it a lot.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I had an opportunity to meet Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher of Star Trek fame) who choreographed this film, and she has nothing but positive things to say.  So does David Holman, Palm Springs resident, Emmy winner (1984 Olympics) and Jim Henson's co-producer on The Muppet Show.<br /><br />I was a fantasy addict as a child and could relate to Sarah.  Oddly enough I never paid much attention to David Bowie until this movie, although I'd certainly heard of him.  His naturally mismatched eyes and androgynous shape-changing reinventing personality/persona (\\"artistic promiscuity,\\" he called it once in an interview) make him the ideal performer to portray the mysterious Jareth, who unfortunately gets kiddied up despite the off-the-scale sensuality.  Tormenting the one person who knows more about the Labyrinth than anyone, namely Hoggle?  Too Saturday-morning cartoon for me.  Sadly, all-powerful tyrants do make these kinds of mistakes, but Jareth was less the villain in my view and more an antagonist who had a reason for what he did, unless, like Dorothy, Sarah invented the whole thing in her mind.  Considering she was on the verge of womanhood, that would fit, and considering she resented her baby brother in teenage self-absorption, that would also fit.  There are actual spiritual Labyrinths that you walk, most notably in the Franciscan churches.  So Sarah's journey could have been a dream, except they never stated that expressly.<br /><br />Assuming that the whole Labyrinth existed and that Sarah's ordeal was real (as if what goes on in our minds isn't just as real more often than not), special effects aside, the Labyrinth's lessons are spiritual touchstones amounting to (a) Kindness rules, (b) Don't give up your dreams, but know the difference between dreams and fantasies, and (c) What the bleep do we know?<br /><br />And of course...it's just a show, I should really just relax.<br /><br />Still, it would have been nice if Jareth had been written a little less villainish and more mysterious.  Bowie's performance, however, breaks out of the script and gives us a glimpse of someone with an agenda, a mission that gets complicated by his attraction to Sarah.  It's an attraction he uses as another test, because clearly she is dazzled by him.  After hearing him sing, who wouldn't be?<br /><br />Sarah's courage (and Connelly's maturity) shines through as she does what must be done and puts her fantasy life in perspective.  One can imagine that after this Jareth would only admire her all the more.  That's why, nearly two decades after its release, the story still manages to captivate--well, that and the wonderful Muppet creatures, and Jim Henson's sensibilities.ie's performance, however, breaks out of the script and gives us a glimpse of someone with an agenda, a mission that gets complicated by his attraction to Sarah.

034537410X|5.0|I was quite surprised LaBerge's book was so readable.  Since he is strictly \\"scientific\\", I feared the book was going to be slow and dry.  It was just the opposite!  There are lots of first-person accounts, and the book never bogs down anywhere.  It is a very enlightening, non-neurotic dream book.<br /><br />If you are a believer of OBE's and ADC's, however, stand forewarned that LaBerge thinks there are no such things...you don't travel out-of-body at nights, and you can't \\"raise the dead\\".  No, you are supposedly just talking to yourself, if you encounter a departed friend or relative in a dream. He doesn't come across real authoritarian on those matters, however; he just says those who believe in OBE's and ADC's are \\"naive\\". Thus, you should have no problem seeing LaBerge as \\"naive\\" about those things, if you wish, and still have a great time reading his book.<br /><br />Personally, I've never understood the logic or the attraction of the idea that everyone in a dream is actually YOU, or some aspect of YOU.  If you saw the waking world like that, you would be considered either extremely self-centered or downright mentally ill. Likewise, if you just spent all your waking time talking to YOURSELF. Yet, supposedly, according to experts like LaBerge, you are suppose to see all your dreams in an exclusively self-centered way.  I simply don't understand that matter! :)<br /><br />But as stated earlier, the book should be a great read for anyone wanting a dream book to enhance their dreaming.  Even if lucid dreaming is not your target, I'd still highly recommend this book. It is very crystal clear.

The CD has definitely grown on me much in a years time, and man am i realizing how great of a CD this is. It showcases Lindseys finest work, even better than Tusk. My favorite songs of his on the CD are \\"Bleed\\" \\"Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\". Other great ones by L.B. are \\"Miranda\\" \\"Murrow\\" and \\"Red Rover\\" plus ALL OF THEM!! As a matter of fact, the only track that i didnt care for is \\"Silver Girl\\" but that is IT!!! This CD is still in my constantly played list and will remain. Even Minus Mcvie, this is a great CD
B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD arrived a couple nights ago, and it was so amazing that it moved me to write the following email to the performers. <br /> <br />By the way -- no need to hesitate... you'll love this show! <br /> <br />================================== <br /> <br />To my Celtic friends, <br /> <br />I'm simply at a loss as to how to start this message...  <br /> <br />I want to thank you all so very, very much for your angelic, inspiring work in \\"Celtic Woman.\\" I wish there were some way to box-up the immense joy and gratitude that is pouring from my heart, and deliver it to each one of you. <br /> <br />Together you brought something so Good and True and Right and Pure into this world... something so phenomenally uplifting, that its value could never possibly be measured because its value will remain hidden in how deeply it cleanses and restores the hearts of those it touches. But do know that something timeless, something of the Eternal was conveyed through your work that evening. <br /> <br />What is absolutely remarkable to me is how, while watching the program, one feels extraordinarily proud and honored just to be a human being, simply for what your performance shows is possible from us. It's almost too much to fathom. And what's even more remarkable is how this stirring sense of honor and appreciation is fulfilling in and of itself. How it feels absolutely no need to be anything more than it is. Somehow it realizes and is grateful for the good fortune it has just to be taking part in this tremendous beauty, just to be receiving it, just to be drinking it in. Somehow it stirs within this heart a Love that has no end, no aim, but that is whole and complete in itself, and that holds the entire depth of life within it. <br /> <br />Thank you Lisa, David, Meav, Orla, Chloe, and Mairead for the reminder of what is truly Good, Noble, and Innocent in this life. <br /> <br />With my deepest gratitude, <br /> <br />Tim

0060594888|2.0|Although immense, this book contains nothing new.  This is not surprising as the author made his Chicken Soup fortune by taking the (uncompensated) stories of others and marketing them brillantly.<br /><br />The aggravation generated by the continuous name-dropping and self-promotion was only surpassed by the endless plugs of products by friends and family.<br /><br />The advice is frequently contradictory and hypocritical.  For instance, it is suggested that one contact a successful person to be a mentor. That successful person, it is proposed, would be flattered and delighted to help the novice/wannabee. That is, of course,unless the novice/wannabee wants to work with the author. Don't bother, because one of his \\"rules\\" is that he never works with inexperienced writers, the learning curve is too high, etc, etc.  Similarly, be sure to get a prenupt--not only will you protect your riches and not have to share, your partner will no doubt to be happy to demonstrate that forgoing your assets is a sign of their deep and abiding love of you.<br /><br />I do not doubt that some people will find the suggestions in the book helpful and most of them are valid.  However, this same material has been covered in greater detail by others.  This book is superficial, a mere outline, the bones without the meat.
B00009Z574|5.0|I won't spend time sharing all of the titles of this record or the others. Suffice it to say, I agree with all of those reviewers who actually LISTENED. The songs tell a tale, the musicianship is incredible, whether you are a YES fan or not, and the diversity, humor, imagination and messages are all worth listening to more than once. You can actually visualize the story through the sounds and effects of the instruments. This has always been my favorite YES record, and without a doubt, deserving of better acclaim than it has received in the past.
B00069YDXU|2.0|I am shocked no one has mentioned in the reviews the most glaring flaw of this video- the camera angles are insanely bad and ill timed! The group is Emerson, Lake and Palmer but you would think it is Lake, Palmer and the off camera keyboard guy! It takes two minutes and sixteen seconds into Karn Evil 9 before Emerson gets onscreen- unbelievable. Throughout the show, Keith Emerson is performing a blazing solo, but you're seeing the back of Carl Palmer's head, or Greg Lake standing with his hands at his sides.. All I can figure is the producer was completely unfamiliar with the band and material. Buy if you enjoy yelling at your television.

0805047905|5.0|I never thought this would ever catch my toddler's attention at all, but it did!!!  He loved looking at the colorful and bold illustrations.  Eric Carle has done an artistic stimulation for the very young readers.  Illustrations were done so simple but captivating.  Carle & Martin were able to introduce animals and colors in one good book.  The text flows so well...repetitive and really stays in the mind after a couple of reads.  This book is like a journey on an enchanting zoo seeing different kinds of animals in varying colors looking at you as a teacher and children guide you till the end.  It brings out the best of a child's imagination, and adults alike.
038572179X|3.0|Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" has much going for it thematically -- betrayal, war, redemption, class bias, the art of writing -- but this novelist's irritating tendency to subjugate character to the interests of plot eventually drains it of emotional impact.    Early in the book Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year-old and central character, becomes frustrated in the process of putting on a play for her family: \\"The rehearsals..offended her sense of order. The self-contained world she had drawn with clear and perfect lines had been defaced with the scribble of other minds..\\" This statement carries a double edge: these \\"other minds\\" may be McEwan's own readership whom he invites to share his world and then, like his young protagonist (who abandons her cousins and her play), pushes away. But whether it's the unruly presence of his readers or some other force at work, McEwan seems to need to exert such total control over his novel that his characters, initially credible, eventually seem micro-managed, sometimes reinvented before our eyes.    One instance of this occurs early on in this saga of a pre-war British family.  In the library of the Tallis' opulent estate, Cecilia, Briony's pretty and willful older sister, has a tryst with Robbie, the son of a servant. While this encounter serves to move the plot forward, motivating Robbie's devotion to her through years of separation, its sexually explicit nature does not scan.  A well-bred daughter from an upper class British family in 1935, a virgin, whose most defiant act to date is to smoke in the hall in her father's absence, is hardly likely to carry on like a Cosmo girl, tearing into her man teeth first -- not in that new dress and not with her mother and guests in the next room!  Briony's accusation of rape, which follows shortly, is another example of reader disconnect, at least as far as this reader is concerned. The accusation, which is false, serves to set in motion the rest of the novel.  Yet McEwan seems to have forgotten that the Briony he introduced to us was imaginative, precocious, and affectionate, a bit confused, but not malicious and deceitful. Suddenly he has her acting like the \\"Bad Seed.\\" This abrupt shift in personality has the odd effect of simultaneously propelling the action forward and undermining our interest in it.  By the time we reconnect with her, after Robbie's long trek through France, the now 18-year-old Briony seems a flat, remote figure.  Attempts at reconciliation with her sister and Robbie feel academic rather than essential, like someone on autopilot.  The final twist of plot near the end of the book does nothing to repair the character dissociations that have taken place throughout and in Briony's case succeeds in making her seem more distant than ever.    The unquestioned brilliance of McEwan's prose reveal an intelligence at work that only makes his habit of sabotaging the credibility of his own characters the more bewildering.  The ideas in \\"Atonement,\\" while serious and diverting, never become part of the characters' inner lives in a believable way and therefore never truly felt in ours.
B00005QDW5|2.0|I love Pink Floyd, but I dont like this. Each Pink Floyd album has its own special little meaning to it, you can't capture the meaning behind their music with a bunch of thier songs all scrambled up and mixed together.  <br />   The ONLY good purpose to this album would be to give a newbie a taste of what each album is like.  <br />  HOWEVER, I think this gives a terrible job of giving what of Piper At the gates of dawn sounds like.

B00006JDVV|3.0|Hordes of fire-breathing, human-eating dragons. A devastated, smouldering modern-day England. Christian Bale as the monastic, stalwart leader of a besieged castle full of dispirited Englishmen. A wild-eyed Matt McConaughey as a rogue U.S. military commander.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention Apache helicopter gunships versus Dragons?<br /><br />If you want nearly two hours of char-broiled goodness and don't mind disengaging your brain, then read no further, and pop \\"Reign of Fire\\" on the hopper.<br /><br />Now for some background: Back in the early nineties, NYU college buddies Kevin Peterka and Greg Chabott went backpacking through the United Kingdom; as they hiked, they talked; Greg had taken along a vintage 1939 typewriter, and they typed up their ideas. They used the storied English landscape, with its castles and legends of dragons, to churn out their first screenplay, which was entitled \\"When Heroes go Down\\" and which they sold on spec , ultimately picked up by Spyglass pictures.<br /><br />Spyglass spiffed up the script and mercifully renamed it \\"Reign of Fire\\", but at the core of the movie was Chabott and Peterka's original vision of a fire-breathing dragon going claw a mano with an Apache gunship. And that, I'm happy to say, is what is at the center of this roaringly fun and occasionally inspired movie about fire-breathing dragons rampaging through the England of 2020.<br /><br />Yes it's flawed. Yes it's uneven. Yes, the editing on the battles between man and monster is often so bad as to make it hard to follow what's going on. And yes, you desperately want to see more of the dragons. But don't be overly critical, for \\"Reign\\" is a flame-roasted cheesefest.<br /><br />The movie's promotional campaign, featuring the sky above London's Houses of Parliament teeming with marauding dragons, was a bit misleading: other than a brief introduction by the narrator Quinn (played feverishly well by Christian Bale), the events of the movie are focused on the pitched battle between a gigantic uber-dragon, some frightened English civilians in a Scottish castle, and a band of renegade American soldiers under the command of Van Zan (played by a steely-eyed, cigar smoking Matthew McConaughey, who appears to be having the time of his career), who are there to chew bubble gum and kick dragon butt.<br /><br />Oh, and they're all outta bubble gum.<br /><br />The reign of fire, and the millions of dragons that come with it, was spawned by the nasty uber-dragon, who came crawling up out of the bowels of London after a development project unearthed his 'final' resting place---and that titular reign lasts about 3 seconds.<br /><br />That's pretty much all that is needed, though: the Earth itself is a burned, desolate wasteland, roasted by the dragons and decimated by mankind's last gasp, a futile nuclear strike that did more damage to humanity than it did to the dragons. Society has regressed to the medieval, and merely venturing out for a few turnips can mean death---nasty, screeching, fiery death.<br /><br />But what's bad for English civilians is great fun for the audience, particularly when Van Zann's dragonslayers (who have tanks and the obligatory Apache gunship) show up. The movie was made for a relatively trifling $117 million, and it's all up on the screen: movie dragons have never looked so terrifying.<br /><br />Nor has a B-monster movie looked so good, and that's not a surprise: \\"Reign\\"'s director of Photography is the brilliant Adrian Biddle, who did the cinematography for Aliens, Princess Bride, Willow, and The Mummy. All of the sequences, particularly the castle, are crisp, harrowing, and beautifully shot.<br /><br />The DVD is crisp and gorgeous (and stuffed with some useful extras), the setting is bleak and atmospheric, the dragons are gorgeous to behold, director Rob Bowman (who also helmed \\"X-Files:Fight the Future\\") keeps the action rolling along, and Matthew McConaughey's death-defying mid-air leap at a dragon's spikey, smelly,smokey craw must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Here be Dragons.<br /><br />JSGat a dragon's spikey, smelly, smokey craw must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br />Here be Dragons. <br /> <br />JSG
B00003CXAE|5.0|This movie IS not only the word....it is everything you'd ever imagine....wow....this movie is especially a BIG BIG BIG treat for all music lovers out there....it is TRULY a great movie and even greater musical. <br /> <br />I LOVE all the music and everything is so incredible....ineffables words of admiration just pour out of my mouth.... <br /> <br />in a way, the choreographing is lame but that's what makes it so fun! it's such a classic that no matter what funny actions they do, it's still so great. just awesome. <br /> <br />and i love Sandy(Olivia Newton-John)...she is so well played as a sweet, innocent girl. I'm in love with her. And her performance of \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\" is so powerful. wow. <br /> <br />For those of you who do NOT like musicals, you may find this movie a little bit lame because the big focus is the musicals. But hey, i'm totally in love with this movie cuz i adore all the music. <br /> <br />I wasn't born when Grease was first released...so i'm not those long time fans...that's right...i'm a youth who loves a movie from the 70s...=D <br /> <br />WOW
B0006J28L4|5.0|I first saw Malcolm X in high school, when it came out, and what a rush to have gone to see it in the theaters!  Denzel nailed his performance, and Spike remained faithful to the autobiography (which the movie is based).  I was particularly glad that Spike examined the ways in which Malcolm changed his philosophy slightly, after his trip to Mecca.  That was an important reminder of how both Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and other leaders were all converging on a similar, anti-racist (without being racist) philosophy of struggle.  Martin was becoming less moderate, and Malcolm was moderating his excesses in his struggle for justice. <br /> <br />The DVD's quality is great.  Dolby Digital sound which really booms in selected points, and the movie is crisp and sharp.  The documentaries are an added plus. <br /> <br />This remains one of my favorite films.  I highly recommend it.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|This cd is my introduction to The Mars Volta. I saw the video for the brilliant, atmospheric ballad with wailing vocals 'The widow' and just knew I had to get this cd.<br /><br />What a surprise I was in for. Nothing else on this cd sounds like that. In fact, hardly anything else can be termed a conventional song. It was rather difficult to listen to and get into the first few times I played it but worth the effort.<br /><br />The cd comprises 5, usually very long titles with various sub movements, which for the most part work.<br /><br />'L' via l' viaquez' is a 12 minute number that meanders from very high energy rock to mellow latin, almost a slow tango, with lyrics in English and Spanish, and great jazz fluorishes.<br /><br />'Miranda that ghost just isn't holy anymore: A. Vade mecum' starts with over 4 minutes of eerie sounds and birds chirping, which then flows into an astonishingly beautiful guitar and trumpet driven ballad. Parts B to D meander through various styles, moods and effects. Almost like a live jam session.<br /><br />'Cassandra Geminni' largely starts off spoken, rather than sung. 'Cassandra Geminni: D. Multiple spouse' is a very brief rocker, an excerpt from The B part of 'Miranda..', and the closing 'Cassandra Gemini: E. Sarcophagi' is a beautiful guitar driven ballad with alien-like sounds, which is actually the intro to 'Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus', itself another hard rocker with a long great guitar break.<br /><br />1 star lost though for some waste of cd/ipod space which was totally unneccessary. Almost like they are trying too hard to be weird and different. Still a great cd. Definitely unlike anything else out there today.
B0000630YA|5.0|There is clearly no doubt that this is a brilliant album.The longevity of the material is definitely a testament to that side of the material. <br />The Clarity of the disc is vastly  improved , and tracks 1-11 are as brilliant as ever, if not more so in this digital format.However, it would be nice to have this work in a DVD/THX/etc  mix  for  5.1. <br />The questionable  material  is tracks 12-14. The work sounds like temp tracks  with the same musical material, and no editing that is the hallmark of many Ezrin productions. About all we really learn is that the original learn is that the revised tracks are vastly   better lyrically, and that reducing echo can manifestly  improve almost anything. <br />A good buy, but the extra tracks seem to be there for reasons other than additional  good material ... almost like someone wanted to show that the producer makes the album when bringing it together.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The biggest complaint I have read in the reviews of this movie is people don't understand why they are using modern songs in in late 1800's. If you actually listen to the words you might understand. It is the words of the songs that tell the story. I personally think it was very cleverly done. As for Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, it also fits into the movie. The rich men are singing the line \\"here we are now, entertain us\\" from the song, as they are entering the Moulin Rouge nightclub. If people would pay attention to the words they might get it! It might not be a completely original story. In fact, it isn't. It's your classic boy meets girl and falls in love. Girl is with another man and has to hide her love, but true love conquers all. Yeah, it has been done before, but I've never seen it done like this. So remember, if you are going to watch this movie please pay attention to the words and you just might like it.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This was the most intriguing movie I've seen in months.  The best thing was the intense sexual nature of  the movie but they never showed any sex scenes.  That's HARD to PULL OFF!!! <br />I enjoyed the cleverness and how well each character played off of one another...could've had a better ending though.
B00079018K|5.0|The debut from Kasabian is drenched in synths, great beats, and killer hooks.<br /><br />The opening cuts 'Club foot' and 'Processed beats' are danceable rockers, which remind me of 'Think tank' Blur.<br /><br />'I.D.' is a mostly instrumental beautiful atmospheric number. 'Orange' is an angelic sounding instrumental.<br /><br />'L.S.F.' is another dance-y affair, anthemic chorus and great beats. In a similar vein is 'Cutt off' with an almost choral, anthemic chorus, and half sung/spoken verses. Sounds very British!<br /><br />'Ovary stripe' is a very space age, catchy instrumental. Another great song is 'Running battle'.<br /><br />The closing number, 'U boat' has a slight Radiohead feel. It's a great guitar ballad with eerie effects and great percussion kicking in towards the end, and a great string finale.<br /><br />All in all, a very impressive debut. Looking forward to more great stuff from Kasabian.
1573229725|3.0|On one level, Fingersmith, like Sarah Waters's other novels is a superbly plotted, highly suspensful Victorian pastiche, laden with twists that befall the main characters, wrenching the reader's sympathy from one to the other. The plot really is first rate, too good in a way, as it forces the story into the genre of popular literature populated by novels more noted for their page turning entertainment qualities than their deeper layers of sociological and psychological insights. The settings and characters are all unmistakably Dickensian - the grimy stew of poor London streets, the imposing country houses, the lunatic asylums. The characters that inhabit this world are clearly purloined from the classic annals of Victorian literature - Sue the wretch battling away in the slums, Mrs Sucksby the control freak baby farmer, Maude the pretty heiress, Mr Rivers the handsome suitor, Maude's strict Scrooge like uncle, Nurse Bacon the burly and brutal woman in the lunatic asylum. All this is familiar to readers familiar with the period. This is Dickens's territory, he got there first and evokes the characters and institutions of the age more elegantly and realistically.<br /><br />Fingersmith's main selling point is it's lesbiamism - a trait in all of Water's Victorian novels and one which makes it oh so appealing to BBC costume drama makers, knowing that the promise of a steamy romp with two girls is bound to generate viewing figures. You can try the recent DVD adaptation but it is pretty tame. The same goes for the book. There is some softcore girl on girl action here that will induce slight stirrings in the sexually libidious reader. But The lesbiansim doesn't really add much of a dimension to the story. It just sort of sits there as a key part of the plot but without really enlightening us much on Victorian attitudes on the subject at the time.<br /><br />As historical novels go, this is a great for popular entertainment, but it's lack of heightened literary depth means it's appeal is the ephemeral one of entertaining, twisty plotting rather than the lasting one of deep moral and historical insight.it's appeal is the ephemeral one of entertaining, twisty plotting rather than the lasting one of deep moral and historical insight.
B00005JLSE|2.0|After watching Moulin Rouge and loving it I decided to rent Chicago. I had heard it was so good and won such and such awards, so I figured what the hey. Boy, was everyone wrong. I thought the actual story was very good, but the music was terrible! I don't even remember much of the story because when they would flip over to a musical scene I would lose interest and start daydreaming about all the other places I'd rather be. If they had cut the music I might've gave this movie 3 stars. And as for Renee Zelwegger and Katherine Zeta-Jones dancing together, (or at least they tried to pass it off as dancing) what was that (...)? They were barely even in synch with each other. And these were supposed to be professional dancers in a very popular show? Spare me. Lose the music and maybe we'll talk.
B0007OCG56|4.0|This is Adam Sandler finest. I enjoyed this movie so much. And the ending while typical is nonetheless moving. Make this part of your DVD library.
1400032717|5.0|This was a very interesting book.  Narrated by the book's central character, a 15 year old autistic savant, Mark Haddon's masterful writing draws you in to a perspective most of us won't ever experience.  The story line is strangely compelling, as we listen in on Christopher's thought process as he solves the mysteries and challenges around him.  This may be the closest one can get to understanding how the mind of an autistic works and in that respect it was a compelling novel.  Take a chance and read this book.  It will make you think in new ways.
B00004TJWE|4.0|Even though I am a greying old child o' the sixties, I was unaware of S.F. SORROW until I heard the title track on a disc released by UNCUT magazine entitled THE ROOTS OF TOMMY. I loved \\"S.F. Sorrow Is Born;\\" a beautifully melancholy song. After much internal debate, I decided to order the disc from amazon, admittedly with fingers crossed because a) another reviewer complained that it was in mono and I KNEW I wished to hear it in stereo, and b) what if it was wretched? Well, a) the disc I received IS in stereo and b) the disc is decidedly NOT wretched; it's quite good. I will admit I am still evaluating S.F. SORROW (not every track is an absolute gem) but it is a fascinating creation and certainly undeserving the snubbing it received \\"way back in '67.\\"
B00004RF9I|4.0|Patty Chayevsky's scathing black comedy about network television and its insane and singleminded concern about only the ratings. It's the story of Howard Beale, \\"the first person killed on national television because he had lousy ratings.\\" Beale, a newscaster whose ratings have ben slipping, is about to be replaced; he goes berserk while on the air and tells his audience what he really thinks about the world. The ratings soar and the station goes on to use him for their own profits. Faye Dunaway does an excellent job as a soulless executive who would do anything to promote herself in her job.<br /><br />The only problem is that it goes on too long. All the points worth making are made during the first hour of the picture, and the second hour just keeps hammering away at them. There is also a middle-age love crisis suffered by Peter Finch that becomes pointless and obvious.<br /><br />But where it is good it is VERY good. There is an obvious comparison to be made with the more recent BROADCAST NEWS, which was a lot more subtle and multi-dimmensional. Definitely worth a watch, though.
B00080ZG10|5.0|What I expected from Aviator was \\"Gangs of New York\\" in the sky. What I received from Aviator was my imagination at full throttle.<br /><br />I have been blessed to lead a life where I had parents who introduced me to the classics of Hollywood since I was just old enough to crawl. Growing up, it was nothing to see Katherine Hepburn or Mickey Rooney, Dorris Day, or the Little Rascals on my tv set. What an incredible honor to be a part of the \\"revival\\" movement of the classics going on now. Thanks to our ol' pal dvd.<br /><br />That being said, the importance of Aviator is two fold. It is an intimate portrait of Howard Hughes and his ever growing madness. Also it is a widerange panorama of Classic hollywood. As I sat on the couch as a child, do you think it crossed my mind that these hero's and comedians had lives and problems just like the rest of us? It is so easy to think so... well not so much now, thanks to the hungry media. A lot of stories about those times have been lost, and now thanks to Martin Scorsese's film, we now have a glimpse.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio, according to my research, has nailed the realization of Howard Hughes. What a terrific performance! Best of the year in my opinion. No one in my mind could have pulled it off as well. I was a teenager when Titanic came out, and just like most guys, I hated Leo. Number one reason? You guessed it, probably because you experienced it on one end of the stick or the other: Jealousy. Well, now that I have grown up and knocked the green out of my eyes I can see what an incredible actor he is. Most people fall back on \\"Whats eating Gilbert Grape\\" as his best performance. Well, yes, that was great, but not the best...anymore. (Check out \\"Gangs of New York\\" as well. The price of the 2 disc dvd has fallen dramatically, it has awesome sound and video qualities.)<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, I have lived with the works or Katie Hepburn for a lifetime, so you can trust me when I say this: Cate Blanchett is Phe-nom-e-nal! The day someone gives a better performance, atleast personality wise, I will be a shocked individual. Even though some of the accounts in this film were very intimate, I don't think she would be upset. She was very candid in speaking her mind and letting people know what she thought. Then there's Mr Tracy...<br /><br />Aviator is a great movie, tragic and epic. One day this film will be recognized, maybe the same way as Raging Bull, Wizard of Oz, or It's a Wonderful Life, as a great film that will grow over time. ~saos~e Blanchett is Phe-nom-e-nal!

B00005A1VH|4.0|Based on the true story of Alvin York, the most decorated soldier in WW I, who captured a German unit single handed. York (played by Gary Cooper) lived in the Tennessee hills, was a rabble-rouser until he got religion one night; he enters the Army as a conscientious objector, but decides to fight anyway. By far the best part of this picture is the part that takes place in Tennessee; when York leaves the hills for the army the movie goes flat. At 134 minutes, it is much too long; the viewer gets antsy for it to end long before that. Walter Brennan plays a preacher and does an excellent job; excellent too is the country dialect of the hill people, although Cooper sounds at times as if his tongue is getting wrapped around his teeth saying some of the things he does. (Cooper won an academy award.) The movie is good, but not great. The cinematography is excellent, even though the hills are all dackdrops. Worth a watch.
B000683VI4|3.0|I am a sucker for chick flicks.  I love a good romance.  This was not one.  I cry at everything...I didn't shed a tear for this movie.  Maybe it's because so many people told me I'd love it that I went into it with very high expectations.  Maybe it's because the plot was so cliche that I felt like I already owned 5 other versions of it.  The guy playing Noah was not good and often times too emotionless for his emotionless character.   <br /> <br />Over all it was okay.  I'm glad I rented it free from the library.
B000002H6C|5.0|Hey, this cd is wicked. Its a real diamond. I dont understand wut the heck these people are talking about when they say it has no bass... I mean if u actually listen for it, u can hear it. Like bass is hard to hear even wen they had the legendary Cliff Burton R.I.P. I know the production isnt that great but it is still good. I think this is Lars' best work. The guitar sounds good. Theres alot of emotion in this album and thats wut i love about it. You can hear the sorrow in the music which is awesome, especially on to live is to die. I reccomend that you definatly check this thing out. Song ratings. Oh by the way this is definatly metallica's best lyrics. I think this is a good CD but master, lighting, and kill em all r much better in my opinion. <br /> <br />1.Blackened-10/10 Awesome song, wicked guitar,they play this song first in almost all there Concerts <br /> <br />2...and justice for all-9/10 good track, sorta long but still keeps u interested <br /> <br />3. Eye of the beholder-7/10- good song but not that great considering wut these guys can do <br /> <br />4.  One-10/10 Fcking awesome song, wicked lyrics starts slow then bashes u like a mother fcker. <br /> <br />5. The shortest straw- 10/10 i love the guitar in this one, i head bang to this everytime <br /> <br />6.

B0007OCG4W|2.0|Story is good in theory but comes across as a little confusing due to time shifts that are not always easy to catch. One scene jumps a whole year and one of the couples have got married in that year. It takes you a while to work it out.<br />I watched this with 4 other girls and we were all bored because there was a lack of anything going on, or when it was, it was too predictable. I thought this would be a tense psychological thriller.<br />Big disppointment all round, glad I reneted instead of buying it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It's a shame that it took me over two years to watch all ten episodes of this mini-series, as it turned out to be (in my opinion) one of the best thing made for TV (albeit cable) in a long time. I got this DVD set for Christmas in 2002 after having read Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name. The book and the mini-series chronicles the story of one of the most decorated and battle-hardened infantry companies of World War 2 as they participate in the European campaign. The book is brilliant as a work of historical scholarship that tells an important story, and the mini-series is brilliant because it's a fantastic work of film (TV?) that tells that same important story. Highlights are the episode directed by Tom Hanks and one of the final episodes that recounts Easy Company's first discovery of a concentration camp. There has been a recent resurgence in the public's awareness of the achievements of this \\"greatest generation,\\" and for these men it couldn't have come any sooner. The mini-series doesn't try to over-lionize them, but instead paints them as normal people caught up in extraordinary events, exhibiting all their various virtues and vices. Neither does it paint them with the brush of later days, but shows them as they were: flawed heroes that accomplished something truly great for humanity.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Sea Change is a wonderfully acoustic and guitar-driven album with a dreamy, often melancholic sound and the results are absolutely stunning.Sea Change has Beck reaching back to Mutations( another richly acoustic album) this time with a more mature and personal approach. In Sea Change, Beck shows that he is a master of mixing his guitar with lush, layered synth effects and orchestration in order to subtly weave a tapestry of great music.It's hard to choose which are the standout tracks in this album. From the opening country-folk like song of \\"Golden Age\\" to the hopeful yet sad \\"Lonesome Tears\\", there is not one track that stands above the other. Of course however, if you twisted my arm I would go with \\"It's All In Your Mind\\", the most stripped down song in this album; it exposes Beck in most personal and candid moment.This album is full of those candid moments where you can imagine Beck sitting there and just playing his heart out, making it his most accessible album he's ever writen. Coincidentally, it also makes Sea Change his best album to date.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This review is not so much a commentary about the first Star Wars film in 16 years.  I think there are plenty of other opinions on that (2500+ just on Amazon.com).  Instead, I wanted consumers to be aware of the unfortunate fact that the behind-the-scenes documentary was filled with partially-deleted expletives by production crew and principle actors.    This kind of thing would normally not bother me.  However, if it were not for the fact this movie has been rated PG and has gone to obvious lengths to target younger audiences I wouldn't raise a concern.  There was some attempt to audibly blank most of the offensive language out, however the efforts fell very short and even missed a couple of F-bombs.    The production quality of the behind-the-scenes documentary was also lack luster... of course I may have been spoiled after watching the endless hours of Peter Jackson's behind-the-scenes of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The 17 web featurettes are very well edited on the other hand, and were among my favorite of the special features to watch.  However, it would have been nice to have a \\"Play All\\" feature.    I would have given this movie 4 stars, but I'm forced to give the overall product 3 stars due to the poor editing of the main special feature.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is not just music it is an experience and a world unto itself. I am not a professional music critic and my words fall far short of conveying the absolute brilliance of the album (for a truly worthy analysis check out the work of famous Beatlologist John C. Winn) Some critics say this was the death nell of the Beatles pointing to the extreme variety of the style of the songs on the album. Others critics go further to say it is a collection of solo songs. <br />In my mind nothing could be further than the truth. On one level it reflects the chaos of the year was released (1968) on while another it is a continuation of the Sgt. Pepper album as their are definite unifying elements to this work. Further it is the final mature flowering of the whole Beatles musical aesthetic. <br />The Beatles flirtation with sounds and visually evoking lyrics of Victorianna began as early as the song \\"Penny Lane\\" and continued through Sgt. Pepper and into the White Album. Whereas Sgt. Pepper (even with it having the song \\"Day in the Life\\") is the bright and happy side of psychedelia, The White Album (despite a song like Oba-de-obla-da), while I still consider it psychedelia, is dark and brooding (helping with this is a dominating bass through out) . All of the songs are musically constructed in a way that dramatically emphasize contrast as if they were all played with the keys at the opposite ends of the keyboard while neglecting the keys in between as if, if I may wax poetic, the bright high notes are akin to the prevailing low notes as if aurally we are staring at stars on a black sky. The placement of the songs are no accident as they flow well into each other. This was no cut and paste job by George Martin. <br />In some ways the record is reminiscent of the Christmas recordings put out in a limited edition to members of the Beatles fan club as there is much under its moodiness that is tongue in cheek. Are the Beatles putting on false whiskers and playing the foolor is there something darker? I think there is. While like any great piece of great art it is open to interpretation but allow me to take the liberty of analyzing the album one song at a time for a section. As the album brings me into a state of rapture I could easily write about each and every song but I will limit myself so that I do not bore the reader to tears. <br />I do not mean to dissect so as to try to discover true meaning along the old saw of \\"taking apart the baby's rattle only to find that it doing so it no longer rattles\\". I endeavor rather to give some of my own interpretations to an album that is in the end undefinable while attempting to debunk some of its critics. <br />Back in the USSR: In my mind this song sets the stage for the entire album. It is both a parody of the Beach Boys and the Soviet Union. Their is a contrast to the high falsetto background (ALA Beach Boys) and the deep voice manic singing of the song itself. Is it political or musical satire? Well, yes and no. But it sets us up for a somewhat paranoiac vision of the world that continues through out the album. At the end of the song the singing of the high falsetto (whooweee wooowoo, whooweee wooowoo) merging into the sound of a jet aircraft engine is answered with the single pinging of a guitar in the next song. <br />Dear Prudence: Starting with an unaccompanied pinging of slow paced notes on the single string of a guitar the song starts off starkly (at the very beginning of the song we still hear the sound of the jet engine in the background providing another linkage). Where was that aircraft of the previous song going? We can assume it was going to India into the recent past of the Beatles trip to India as \\"Dear Prudence\\" was written for Prudence Farrow, sister of Mia Farrow, and played to her to comfort her as has John Lennon said on a Bootleg of the making of the White Album \\"the poor girl was slowly going insane\\".After a few versus the pinging guitar is accompanied by a deep heavy fuzzy bass, Harrison trills, and a now driving piano continuing to make another song with somewhat sweet lyric schizophrenic in the dark music that accompanies the words. The song ends with the following streaming high notes of on a piano. Which flows into... <br />Glass Onion:The song starts abruptly with quick sharp drum beats. The back beat of drums actually dominates the song. But Lennon's voice and the accompanying violin strings continue the the aethetic of the streeming piano effect of the previous song. The notes of violin strings   themselves rise and fall like an angry sea. The lyric of the song itself is a sweeping history of the Beatles making thinly masked references to earlier Beatle songs. The title of the song tells it all -a \\"glass onion\\" made of layer up layer yet transparent. Though a somewhat upbeat song with dark over tones the song ends with ominous violin music (de-de-de-de. DE-DE-DE-DE) which flows into... <br />Obla-de-obla-da: The song starts out with the happy ching-a-ling on the piano (an aesthetic continuation and metamorphosis from the notes of the violin now modified into a bright De-Dah-DEE-DEE DEE from the last song) and is followed by bass note reminiscent of a German Ompa band. The lyrics are again somewhat simple, telling a simple story of the love affair of Desmond and Molly (\\"Desmond has a barrow in a market place Molly is a singer in a band\\") that is somewhat reminiscent of Victorian ballads (see the book printed in Victorian times \\"Bab Ballads\\" -again Victorianna !) but towards the end Desmond and Molly are changing roles! (cross dressing as it were) where Desmond is now doing his \\"pretty face\\" and is a singer in a band. In the background one hears sardonic syncopated laugher (\\"hah-hah-hah\\"). We find ourselves originally being sucked in by sweetness that comes close to banality into confusion and darkness. The conclusion of the song lyric gives us even more confusion and a sense of paranoia with the line \\"if you want some fun take Obla-de bla -da.\\" Turning the song on its head into a possible drug song. Flowing into... <br />Wild Honey Pie: The high ching-a-ling of the piano of Obla-de-obla-da continues as an even higher pinging of a guitar sounding almost bell like. It is musically and lyrically sparse but also complex. The springy pining is answered by deep drum strokes that almost resemble a heart beat. <br />Some critics call the song a cast off but the melody is quite reminiscent of some medieval minstrel songs (It is also somewhat musically akin to the song \\"Fixing a Hole\\" that appears on the Sgt. Pepper album). The words \\"honey pie\\" are almost screamed and almost off key. The song ends with the almost spoken singing \\"whoa honey pie whoa\\" And whoa it goes in that the word signals a slight shift in the musical flow. Yet the resonance of that spoken word flows into the resonance of the guitar in the next song... <br />The Continuing Story of Bungalowbill: The song starts out with the sound of a Spanish guitar. The acoustic guitar solo's last notes are slowly spaced lulling us again into a type of complacency, a trick we should be now be familiar with from those lads from Liverpool, as it is followed by raucous singing of the chorus \\"Hey Bungalowbill, what did you kill Bungalowbill?\\" except or the chorus most of the words are spoken on the back drop of a creepy sounding bass. The song tells a somewhat absurd satirical story of a hunter (\\"an all American bullet head Saxon mother's son\\" -now there's social satire for you). The story concludes with Bill's hunting part being \\"taken by surprise\\" but then it continues ambiguously \\"Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise so Captain Marvel zaps him right between the eye's -zap!\\" Is Captain Marvel a member of Bungalowbill's hunting party (or is the name Captain Marvel synonymous with Bungalowbill himself) shooting a tiger (\\"where the mighty tiger lies\\")? Or is Bungalowbill and his party taken by surprise and subsequently shotby Captain Marvel? <br />The story ends with an epilogue in the form of a joke \\"The children asked him if to kill was not a sin\\"\\"Not when he looked so fierce\\" his mommy butted in\\"(these words being spoken by Yoko Ono)\\"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him\\". <br />I could go on but I will spare you (unless you want me to go on) but I hope by now I have enticed you to enter the complex dark psychedelic world of The White Album (my favorite song on the album is \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" a song that would require an entire page for me to extol its virtues). <br />To quote the first line of the last song on the album \\"Now it's time to say goodnight\\". Happy listening but don't forget to check for the monsters under your bed. <br /> <br />
B00005JNTV|4.0|The first thing to be said for `Sin City' is that it is unique and fresh. After sitting through a half hour of trailers for upcoming flicks that were mostly rehashed remakes of old movies without an ounce of originality or risk taking in them, this was immediately obvious. Though it makes use of conventions from the film noir tradition, they are all given new life and a fresh look in this stylized, highly original live action graphic novel of a movie.<br />Sin City is a place where the cops are so crooked, the politicians so evil, the tough guys and the prostitutes so hard boiled that Philip Marlow's Los Angeles looks like Mayberry in comparison. Its violence is so far over the top and sadistic as to make Pulp Fiction look like Saturday morning kiddy fare. The only significant difference between Sin City's heroes and villains seems to be a sense of honor that the heroes feel toward women - otherwise it is often hard to tell them apart.<br />  Three overlapping and loosely interrelated stories are presented, and Quentin Tarantino fans will recognize his style in the non sequential way in which they are told. Bruce Willis makes a strong showing playing the archetypical \\"last honest cop\\" whose sense of honor leads him into a world of hell on his last day on the job. But it is Mickey Rourke who steals the show as Marv; a Charles Bukowski meets the Terminator kind of guy who is the avenging angel of a murdered prostitute who showed him kindness.<br />Sin City may look film noir in its style, but its universe is pure super hero comic book. Characters routinely take punishment that no human could survive. Rourke's character is twice hit by a speeding car and just shakes it off, and is struck full force on the head with a sledge hammer which only momentarily knocks him out. This comic book resilience together with an intentional corniness in the dialogue makes for a strange, disconcerting juxtaposition with the sadistic ultra violence of the film.<br />Without a doubt, Sin City is pushing the cultural envelop further yet in testing just how much evil and violence we will tolerate in our entertainment. I must confess to feeling uneasy while watching it - it felt like the moral equivalent of watching a bull fight, or even a gladiatorial death match. I give it five stars for its style and creativity, but subtract one for the ethical ambiguity that I feel toward it. I would strongly caution that you should take your own ethics about violence as entertainment into consideration when choosing whether or not to view this disturbingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />Theo Logospushing the cultural envelop further yet in testing just how much evil and violence we will tolerate in our entertainment.

0385504209|3.0|Although a good page turned I believe the success of this book is not so much the ideas presented or the mastery of the writer. It comes more from it being a touchstone for the times we live in a world where it has become particularly harder to figure out the world especially after 9-11. Also contributing to its success is perhaps the current  backlash in our society against both Christianity and science where the X-Files is still fresh in our collective memory (\\"The truth is out there\\").  The DaVinci Code is an interesting exciting novel but nothing more. Unfortunately many are  to quick to accept the book as (if you will excuse the pun) Gospel, or more accurately said, history. History is full of arcana and DaVinci himself being one of the most intriguing and mysterious figures of the Western world has become a lightening rod of many a conspiracy theory. So to have DaVinci to play a role in plot is not new. Neither is the idea that Christ had a child by Mary Magdelane an idea that has been kicking around for quite sometime. It is one of but many ideas of those over the years that attempt to poke holes in Christianity (for those wishing to do so it is suggested to frame your arguments in logic rather than in conspiracy theories). For those interested in historical arcana pick your arcana wisely as odd disjointed facts are malleable to an infinite number of ways. Further examination of the facts soon debunk many of the ideas presented in this book that people are accepting as true. Take for example the myth of Arthur and the quest for the Grail itself. Two of the leading theories scholars hold about Arthur was that he was a Roman or that he was a British Celt. The later theory to my mind is most probable as the Celtic bards mention Arthur's quests fairly often as well as the quests of others for a \\"caldron of immortality\\" a legend which predates Christianity. When the legend came to France it was already modified many times.<br /><br />The author is no Umberto Eco and although it might be the current flavor of mind candy I believe this book will soon be forgotten.<br /><br />Recommended with reservations.though it might be the current flavor of mind candy I believe this book will soon be forgotten. <br />Recommended with reservations.

0316172324|3.0|For those of you have been sleeping over the past twenty years and have not been following developments in psychology and neuroscience some of you might find the ideas presented in this book new.  As a neuroscientist I could never recommend this book as a review of  current developments in modern neuroscience as much of the information is this book in regard to neuroscience is factually incorrect (Sometimes grossly incorrect). While others of you with a mystical bent have seen many of these ideas already presented in Buddhism. I can think of at least a dozen books on each side of that spectrum that make a better presentation of the ideas presented here than this book.  This is certainly not a book that will lead to better thinking or better living.

0804115613|4.0|i have seen and love the movie, but the book is much more indepth and you feel like you are drawn in to the world of Idgie and Ruth all over again. The relationship between them seems a little more intimate in the novel than as portrayed in the movie, i think they toned it down a little for ovbious reasons. but you learn so much more about different characters than you do in the movie and the ending is so much more satisfying.
B00007JVBI|1.0|Chan Marshall is famous for her voice.  This album forgets that fact.  Her voice is muffled, layered, and generally not highlighted.  NOTE TO PRODUCER: You stink.  All you have to do to record this lady is put a microphone in front of her and push record.  By layering and otherwise obscuring her voice, you've not only ruined this record, you've insulted my intelligence.  Folks, there is a recording of \\"To Be A Good Woman\\" (a great song) recorded on some BBC program.  It shows how awesome this album could have been, had the person who recorded it not gotten fancy.  I just don't understand it.

I spend a lot of time staring at code on the computer, and the Songs of Distant Earth is a perfect backdrop.  That's not to say that it's only background music, as it is even more rewarding listening to it at 1am under the stars with a good pair of headphones.<br /><br />If you have the chance, get the book of the same name by Arthur C Clarke, as this too will not disappoint.
0316172324|2.0|An entire book that provides nothing more than a problem with no solution.  How this book made it onto the front marketing tables at my bookstore, I have no idea other than Gladwell's hair.  It's certainly not his propensity for choosing interesting topics.  You could get this information, along with informative insight and possible solutions to the problems he presents, by watching some kid show on PBS.  Don't waste your time.
1400043662|4.0|I've finally finished Haruki Murakami's new novel Kafka On The Shore, and it was an entertaining read. I'm not sure where it ranks among his other books yet. I have to evaluate it in retrospect of what I remember about the other books I've read, some of which were four years ago or longer. It is another mysterious search for meaning and self-definition in the face of evil. There are several loose ends that don't quite get tied up in the end, but Murakami's novels often end up like this. You are often left to draw your own conclusions about the novel's meaning. As usual, there are several motifs and digressions about the individual's fate in society vs. free will, the existence of another world separate from everyday reality, fantastical elements intercede with everyday life. However, it is done in a way so that it seems completely normal and a necessary part of the story. I think the narration is a major departure in that it is from the point of view of the 15 year old Kafka Tamura and mentally challenged Nakata. Kafka must come to terms with his father's premonition that he will be with his sister and mother, and kill his father. Nakata, an old man who had a mysterious accident as a child that has made him a sort of autistic adult with the ability to talk to cats, goes on a journey to set the world right before dying. During the course of the novel we encounter Johnny Walker, as a cat murderer and physic representation of evil, Colonel Sanders, as a pimp and seer, fish and leeches fall from the sky, and there's another \\"pure love lost-story not unlike what we first saw in Norwegian Wood. This is his longest novel since The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, and it really allows you to get to know the characters as they move toward their respective fates. <br />
0670033375|4.0|I thought the premise behind the book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" was interesting so I decided to get the book and try reading it.<br /><br />The book is actually very interesting.  I enjoyed the reasoning in the book that it is societies that choose to fail or succeed.  Diamond points out that in nearly any society, the choices that are made and the reactions to the repurcusions of those choices are what help a society either continue forward or dwindle away to nothing.<br /><br />I found all of his explanations of different society intriguing.  I feel like I know those societies better - almost as if I had visited them myself.  I do think that sometimes the descriptions or explanations went a little long but I pushed through those parts and was rewarded with a fairly good read.  One thing that may hurt the book is that it is 560 pages of fairly small type.  This is not something you are going to finish in a week of leisurely reading.  But I think it is worth the time it takes to read the whole thing.
0316172324|5.0|I just finished reading Blink by Malcolm Gladwell; it's a fascinating little book about how some people make extremely accurate split second decisions. On the back it suggests placing the book in the \\"Self Help/Psychology\\" section of the book store, which I find a bit perplexing, it is about psychology, but it's nowhere near a self help book, in fact it reads like an extended New Yorker magazine article, which it might be, since Gladwell writes for the magazine. I remember reading some of his pieces before, and I've been recommended his web site by a friend. Anyway, it is interesting why some people are able to see things in a glance that regular people can't. I particularly found the section, 7 Seconds In The Bronx, which discusses what went wrong in the 1999 Amadou Diallo shooting (he was basically in the wrong place at the wrong time and took 41 bullets for it) and what it says about people under pressure and police officers in particular was quite revealing. But all of the chapters were equally interesting and well written. I found it though provoking to evaluate how I personally used \\"thin-slicing\\" (looking at limited individual moments of time with scrutiny) in daily life. <br /> <br />
B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD was absolutely fabulous.  It was about the beauty of the artists' voices and the music they were performing.  There was no glitz, no glamour, nothing fake, just beautiful music performed for music's sake.  I would totally recommend this DVD/CD and hopefully can see this show when they go on tour.
B0000630BT|5.0|Right now this album is in heavy rotation at my place... I cannot get enough of it... especially A Touch Of Evil (I end up listening to that song alone for a good three hours before I decide to move on!!) There's really not much else to say that hasn't been said by every other Priest fan... THIS IS ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS!!
B0007P3582|5.0|everyone is saying how much this album is bad. <br />i dont think its bad, i think this album, tops any other g-unit album came out this & last year. even the game, he blows. <br />my fav is \\"All A Ni&&a Really Want is A Lil Bit\\" and \\"I'll Take U To The Candyshop\\". cant get enough of it! so dont listen to every1 else, and if u like 50 get this.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Madness, Dixie Midnight Runners, Falco, remember these guys?  Well that is the feel of Franz Ferdinand.  Very catchy pop songs that has that 80s vibe.  I have to admit that I was impressed that 'take me out' was not the only good song on this CD.  I bought this cd on impulse from hearing the 'take me out' song played on the PSP (playstation portable) commercial. I started to ask around, 'who wrote this tune?' and soon found this band that I hope lasts.  Yeah it has some cliche pop sounds to it, but so did the Beatles.  Some of the best pop music I've heard in a very very long time!!  CD is 4 & 1/2 stars!!
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|both of these albums are oriented toward world music with an American folk perspective.  They are both extremely strong albums, and probably the best of Paul Simon's career.  This cd is mellower then Graceland, which has a real sweeping power to it.  The songwriting is more intrigueing and jumps right out at you.  it is atmospherically the same as Graceland, and maybe even a little better.  Simon really focused more on the \\"world\\" aspect of world music, more so than he did on Graceland. <br />Overall, the new Paul Simon fan should get Graceland first, and if you like it (which you will, everyone does!) then you are required to get this cd; they go together perfectly.  Then get Negotiations and Love Songs for a good sample of his work before Graceland, and get The Best of Simon and Garfunkel for his extraordinary work with Art Garfunkel, the collaboration he is most famous for.  Enjoy!
B000031WBV|2.0|i haven't the slightest idea why all these people rated this so high...same for all other rubinstein discs.<br /><br />firstly lets mention most were recorded in the 50s/60s.not exactly superb in terms of sound and his playing certainly boasts a diminshed sense of craft/despair.lifelessness in these pieces.Mr. rubenstein does not have the right chemistry to be playing chopin.he plays quite off rhythm sometimes and dilutes the piece.Call it 'interpretation' but it bothers my ears and makes me think of how the piece should have been played instead of getting me to that 'sensous' point of being carried away.<br /><br />i wasted a lot of money on a good deal of this collection buying all at once and basically putting faith in all the reviews.dont make the same mistake!-id go with the piano collection on naxos....
B0007O38F8|4.0|as i read almost all comments in 50 cent's new album the massacre. almost all people hate it and some just love it and the others doesnt have comments or dont give a damn about it.     for me this album doesnt suck, but it is not as good as \\"get rich or die tryin\\" album. but almost all people here are over exaggeratin that this album really sucks, im not a super fan of 50 but i listen to some of his music. almost all people here just expected so much about this album thats why they all over exaggeratin, 50's Get rich or die tryin' album was good 'coz he put all his efforts there, he put all his angers, experience, lovin, etc., now that he got busy and his livin a superb lifestyle his experience, and life change, thats why he cannot top his former album. not like pac, 2pac wrote his lyrics and made almost all his songs in one span of time, i mean he wrote all his songs and compose it with out stopping and just compiling it until it reaches to \\"how many\\" albums after he died and still have unreleased songs and that makes him one of the greates rapper of all time. if 50 did that maybe his new and upcoming albums will be like get rich and die tryin album that hit the charts. and by the ways 2pac era before and other rappers have differnt lifestyles than today's rappers 'coz we all know that the era before has a lot of violence, racist, east coast west coast war, different kinds of troubles and other source of criminal minds and acts, that's why a lot of rappers are good writer coz they can write about somethin. not like today's rappers they cannot write (the way the era before writes) somethin because we all know that the streets are in peace, the racist are gone, the east coast west coast war was gone and other old school sh*t rap style are gone,  today's rapper, raps about, chrome wheels, money, [...], and that makes the new rappers are no match against the old rappers due to their experiences.    but if you dont experience the rap era during 93-98 you will appriciatethe raps today but if you experience it you will say that it sucks or change alot or from best to worse.    50 cent album still good, just dont over expect

B00005ATQD|5.0|\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" weaves its web of psychological carnage with a power that has nothing to do with taste, or preference. Kubrick's images are undeniable and very, very startling. The eye must watch. There is a remarkable trademark of Kubrick's that lies in his spacing of dialogue. It is never as simple as \\"He said\\" - cut to Her - \\"She said\\". That is the formula, but Kubrick always cuts away early. He leaves a discernable pause. This creates a note of discord (emphasized in the music score with its jarring one-note piano stabbings), in that everyone who speaks in his films appear to be studying one another. People speak in measured tones, but rarely communicate themselves well to one another. Many have spoken of Kubrick's \\"coldness\\" as a filmmaker, and it is true that he always keeps his characters at arm's length, distancing them from each other and us. But the reason behind this would appear to be that in doing so, the film's eye catches everything. Nothing gets overlooked in the heat of the moment, in the messiness of emotional embrace. We watch Kubrick's players watch. <br /> <br />I have heard tell of a comparison with \\"The Matrix\\", which I find especially perceptive. Here, the matrix is created by us, by our own psychological make-up. Which of course is more terrifying and pessimistic, as well as more truthful. [Ah yes, the probing for TRUTH; look for that in \\"Ocean's Twelve\\"] While Kubrick unsettles with his world of penetrating observers, there are moments of participatory activity, but tellingly, it occurs in dream. Kidman's character is frightened by her dreams of actively humiliating and degrading her husband, more still because she secretly revels in it. Cruise, on the other hand, goes on a tripped-out 48 hour adventure in which he tries desperately to play the role of \\"outsider\\" his wife so desires, only to be discovered, revealed and publicly shamed. Kubrick's contrasts are obvious, but sooooo compelling: Kidman is active and cruel in her dream-life, Cruise is passive and reflective in his waking existence. As the film ultimately asks at its conclusion, is one more innocent than the other? <br /> <br />\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" may not be the most optimistic portrayal of a marriage and its strengths, but Kubrick has again, and sadly for the last grand time, allowed us to see through his eyes a world where the notion of communication is not taken for granted. His people struggle to express, and seem all the more human for it. Let it be said that Kubrick's eyes were always wide open, and to the details most of us figured too mundane to truly appreciate. He will be greatly missed.  <br />
0385335482|3.0|The good news: easy reading, good for the beach, goes very fast, and somehow, you want to finish (and even read the other books). The bad news: inane characters, inane plot, inane writing style.  Suddenly the market seems flooded with books about British women who are supposed to be loveable, if not quite competent.  But the main character here has no redeeming features whatsoever.  Instead of being delightfully ditzy, she is ridiculous, and makes a bad name for women everywhere.  And the biggest question:  why on earth does she attract this particular accomplished, together man?  I don't get it.

B00004Y6NP|2.0|I sensed trouble as I listened to all the noisy, obnoxious synths on \\"Alchemy\\".  I knew no good would come from the Miami Vice fashions sported by the band in the \\"Alchemy\\" concert film.  But I dumped the Straits after one spin of \\"Brothers\\".  Tracks 1-5 (Side One, vinyl) just flat out suck.  Where is the tight, groove-oriented playing?  The Knopfler knack for good storytelling?  Noticeable improvement on tracks 6-9 (Side Two, vinyl), but the Straits tank on the first half. Compared to the first four albums (self titled, Communique, Making Movies, Love Over Gold), \\"Brothers\\" is a lightweight, Mr. Mister-sounding stinkeroo.  Some record label hack must have sent Mark and the boys into a panic on this one.  They seemed to have lost faith in their instincts, and subverted their talent to achieve mass market stardom.  Pity.
B00004TH6O|5.0|This was the first Queens album I ever heard and is still one of my favorites.  The heavy sounds from the first album are tightened up and made more melodic.  The result is an album that kicks your arse yet is hummable.  My favaorites on here include The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret, In the Fade, Better Living Through Chemistry, Monsters in the Parasol, and the dumb-fun singalong Feel Good Hit of the Summer.
B00003CXA3|2.0|Don't be a sheep and listen to all the reviews about how great this movie is, because it isn't. The movie is very slow, the action is not as well filmed as newer films, and although on paper the plot sounds fairly intriguing (a true story of two cops who made the largest heroin bust in US history) the movie falls pretty flat. <br /> <br />Just for a little context on myself, I was born in 1980, so yes I am a relatively younger viewer. However, I am not a big fan of today's special effects oriented, plot light action films. In fact, in my opinion, the seventies were the golden age of filmaking.  <br /> <br />Special effects then were advanced enough to make action seem realistic, (but hadn't gotten so good that directors got carried away with them) acting had reached its pinnacle after having the method actors firmly entrenched in Hollywood by this time, and plots were still strong (some would argue weakening in the seventies, in my view they were stronger than the classics, but I can somewhat understand that view). <br /> <br />But what we have with the French Connection is basically a film which is caught between two eras, and succeeds in neither one. The action is closer to classic cinemotography than modern. The acting is fairly good, but with little plot to carry it (unless a two hour limping plot to catch the bad guys is a good plot to you.)  <br /> <br />The car chase seen is about as overated as overated can be stated without being a cliche. Here I was bored for an hour and a half, waiting for this car chase, and it really wasn't filmed that well or was that exciting, hardly the best car chase seen in any movie. <br /> <br />If you have nothing but time on your hands and want to see this because everyone else says you should, go ahead. But if you value your time and want to see a film that is both a classic and entertaing, I would suggest the Seven Ups with Roy Scheider. This may be actually be the best car chase in any movie, and although modern movies can film a bit better, I would argue it gives any modern film a run for its money in that department. Also, the film isn't dated, and the plot doesn't put you to sleep. Another suggestion would be Serpico, although also slightly dated to the younger viewers, it still manages to keep its edge, and even during its length and slowtimes, you remain engaged. <br /> <br />Why this film is so popular is beyond me. I think it is a combination of Gene Hackman's acting and a cool sounding name for a film, and then everyone jumping on the bandwagon about this being a classic. <br /> <br />Go ahead and ignore my review and buy it anyway, but anyone who likes a decent paced film with an engaging plot will wish they listened. <br /> <br />
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Don't believe all the hype that the Queens suck now because Nick Oliveri was fired from the band and now this album will be awful.  While it is different than it's predecessors, heading even further in the direction of Songs For the Deaf as far as conception and overall sound, this album ROCKS.  Just listen to songs like Little Sister, Medication, Tangled Up in Plaid, and the long space-outs Someone's In the Wolf and The Blood Is Love.  Heady (and heavy) stuff!
B00005JN0T|3.0|This is a great hectic thriller that along the way engages some interesting ideas leading to an overblown and incoherent ending.  Think about it: I, Robot succeeds where other movies that blend both science fiction and mystery fiction have mostly failed.
B00006FXB6|5.0|The Queens' third album finally sees them tie it all together...the sound, the melody, the tightness, and a cool concept about modern rock radio to boot.  Add Dave Grohl's arse-kicking drumming and you have a hell of an album.  From the savagery of You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar.... to No One Knows, the melodicism of Hanging Tree, Go With the Flow, and God is In the Radio....what a record!  And the little radio spoofs in between songs are humorous, though they get old with repeated listens.

A real band sound, or arrangements that sound like real instruments are being played (more acoustic ones than electronic).  Sgt. Pepper doesn't have a mellotron, afterall! <br />#4.  An album that features ballads, Elton's supreme contribution to music. <br /> <br />O.K..  If you agree with most of this list, my reviews of Elton are for you.  This is Elton's second-best album because it satifies most of the above points on my list.  The standouts (ballads, of course) are the great quartet of songs, \\"The Greatest Discovery\\", \\"Your Song\\", \\"First Episode at Hienton\\" and \\"I Need You To Turn To\\" in that order.  I wonder if Paul McCartney has ever commented on \\"Greatest Discovery\\", as it evokes his song, \\"She's Leaving Home\\", and, I humbly submit, is just as lovely and masterful a song.  I can only imagine that Paul wished he had written this song.  Stylistically, Elton is not his own person yet, this being only his second album.  It's a hodgepodge, but, interestingly, his ballads here will never sound the same on later albums, because he wrote them in an English folk manner, not in the later, Gospel-inflected tone of nearly all his future ballads.  Likewise, his singing is also borrowed, if you will, from English folk--I hear the sound of Sandy Denny's voice being imitated here.  Nevertheless,  \\"Discovery\\" and \\"Hienton\\" are uncommonly beautiful fruits of innocence, uncommon even for Elton, the greatest balladeer after (or since) Sir Paul.   <br /> <br />But, make no mistake, there's plenty of the gospel-tinged Elton here.  \\"Border Song\\" is better than nearly any gospel-tinged song he wrote. Taupin pulled off a simple yet direct message this time.  Musically, the detail of the piano part is astonishing, not a note was left to chance--this is the musicians' musician; all over this album fine touches abound. <br /> <br />The \\"band\\", such as it is for a pick-up group, is mostly good, just below that of Tumbelweed, which had Elton's best band.  The arrangement/orchestration is mostly very tasteful--except that ridiculous intro to \\"Sixty Years On\\".  Bernie Taupin's lyrics, which I've covered ad nauseum in other reviews, are, like Tumbleweed, mostly inoffensive here; he captures a mood of innocence that is almost beyond criticism. Yes, he overreaches  with highfalutin poetry, but I think it's out of a real fervor for the subject matter.  He would never again write so unself-consciously (rare for a green lyricist). <br /> <br />Footnote: Everyone knows Elton can rock; it's just that I don't see those songs as the supreme gifts Elton leaves to pop music.  But Elton makes one of his best country-rock songs here with \\"No Shoe Strings On Louise\\", not just a dead-on Stones tribute, but one of his loosest, least self-conscious rockers ever!

0385510454|3.0|Grisham's most recent novel, the Broker, while not his best effort, is readable and fun. The storyline follows one of Washington's most powerful, Joel Backman, after he is unexpectedly \\"pardoned\\" on the eve before the inauguration of a new president (remind you of the Clinton pardons?). Not only is Backman pardoned, but he is whisked off to Bologna, Italy under the protection and surveillance of the CIA.<br /><br />Backman, at the height of his power, became deeply involved in a scheme to sell Pakistani software that would render the satellite surveillance system of another foreign power useless. While this led to his imprisonment, it also kept him alive as US intelligence, the Saudis, the Israelis, and the Chinese all, for their own reasons, wanted him dead.<br /><br />The change of administrations and political winds, the firing of a longtime CIA director responsible for the Backman case, Backman's release and his adoption of a new Italian identity with Bologna as the backdrop, Backman's CIA handlers and the missteps of the CIA, the mysterious deaths of others involved in the software sale, a tenacious reporter, a new love, and the struggles of world powers are all woven into the fabric of this fast paced story.<br /><br />While there was much I enjoyed about the story, I found the ending to be unsatisfying.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This cd is simply wonderful. Rice's voice is chilling and haunting, but not eerily so. Jennifer Jordan was dead-on in her review when she stated Hannigan's voice begins where Rice's ends. It is such beautiful, painful music; also a bit sexy the way the voices intertwine. Defenately worth it.
B00006AW2M|5.0|Yeah maybe parts of this album are influenced directly by Sgt. Pepper, but so is everything in pop music since Sgt. Pepper. You can't blame the band for being swept up in psychedelia in 1967. What I think makes this album intersting is that it's not the same ol' \\"classic rock\\" Stones you hear on your local radio which, while great, historic and all that, have become almost R&R cliches. <br /> <br />Here's the greatest band in rock & roll doing something different and, whatever your tastes may be, there's value in that.
B000002UBB|5.0|March 19th 2005. Ken Johnson, thought by many to be the best of the elite group of drummers who  heve played on Steve Miller recordings, died of complications from diabetes. Ken   played on these tracks, as well as  'Book of Dreams'. He was a member of the James Cotton Blues Band for many years, and was Ike and Tina Turner's drummer when he was seventeen years old.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|WHY? WHY? I was never a HUGE slipknot fan. Who knows, i could've become one, but this album sure as hell didnt help. I own Iowa and think that is a truly remarkable piece of work. Awesome screaming, growling, and singing as well. This? I don't know what to say to this.I've been to numerous Slipknot concerts and have enjoyed jumpingdafukup with them and this cd has ruined that. Duality is an ok song, but alas, the radio has ruined it for me by playing it over and over and over and over again. Opium For The People Before I Forget and mabye Pulse of The Maggots are the only other songs on this Disk that are worth mentioning. Mabye Corey should've stayed with Stone Sour. We'd all be a lot better off. Overall i'm pretty much speechless on how big a piece of trash this album is, which is why i heavn't written much. And sorry to all the Diehard Slipknot fans out there who think this is their best album yet. I completely sympathize. But this is not.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|I think I bought Oh Mercy when it first came out, probably my first Dylan purchase.  I have since bought lots of his other cd's, and I like them all for various reasons, but Oh Mercy still has to rank as my favorite.  It may not have the historical impact of \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" or \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", but the songs on \\"Oh Mercy\\" really speak to me.   I love the way the cd kicks off with \\"Political World\\" (\\"your houses are haunted, your children aren't wanted, your next day could be your last\\"), slows down with \\"Where Teardrops Fall\\", and back at it again with \\"Everything is Broken\\" (\\"broken hands on broken plows, broken treaties, broken vows\\").  I like that little 4 beat drum thing at the end of Everything is Broken.  I didn't care much for \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\"(\\"there's a soft cotten dress on the line hanging dry\\") at first, but after a while the imagery really grew on me.  I love the \\"love-and-lost\\" of \\"Most of the Time\\" (\\"she ain't even on my mind, I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind\\"), the  plaintiveness of \\"What Good am I?\\".  I love that he would end this gem of a cd with a gem of a song \\"Shooting Star\\"(\\"was I still the same, had I ever became, what you wanted me to be?\\").  All in all, just a wonderful cd.
044024157X|4.0|This is a great book not a book that is superior by any means. Grisham shows us that he can actually can come up with a thriller so well we almost forget that this is actually fiction.  As is the book, A Time To Kill, we are in the town that made that book famous.  a GREAT BOOK BUT NOT A superior book by far.  I liked it but didn't love it!
0385510454|1.0|John Grisham is one of the best authors I have ever read. Now he's well and truly lost it. Every book since The Brethren has been nothing more than a sequence of unplotted events (this one being the worst of all, followed closely by the last juror). I know he's not renowned for his endings, but I don't even remember the ending to this (and I only finished it a fortnight ago!). It starts off really well- the first chapter or so is extremely good, very Grisham, then you're dropped in a hole. In a word: plotless
0152023984|5.0|My first encounter with The Little Prince came when i was twelve years old. It was the perfect time, though i soon came to realize that there is no im-perfect time for The Little Prince. His story is wonderful and enchanting on so many levels, with great illustrations as complement. His is a story that will illuminate your childhood and later, remind you that you had one. My senior french class did a quarter long study on the book, and discovered is allegorical side. This is truely a tale for all times, and for all people.
B0001I55OC|3.0|A Hero: a maiden fair; a castle; the ingenues - male and female; battles by sword, bow and arrow, fire; horses in their finery - ---- and ta-da! Time Travel!!<br /><br />The time travel is what fans of the book were looking for but to me was the least interesting part of an old-fashioned 'Errol Flynn' movie.  The buckles were swashing all over the place as we had sword fights.  We had castles under seige by fire, raining arrows, and catapulting balls of explosive fire.  We had the chaos of the final bridging of the walls and the two sides engaged in one on one combat.<br /><br />In the 'Flynn' part we had Gerard Butler, and he was a fine romantic lead.  Our fair lady was Anna Friel as Lady Claire.  Their sweet story is played out in way to short a time.<br /><br />The ingenues are Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor.  Attractive, but bland and banal.  Way too much of the film is watching them run here and there.<br /><br />Since this was based on a novel, I suppose they had to follow the time travel plot.  But the romantic 'Flynn' type swashbuckling story with the costumes, castles, horses  and scenery would have been a better film.  7/10
B000002WU9|5.0|I copped this album back in '95 and all I can say without goin' crazy is that no album is better. There are lots of classics that come right under (i.e., The Great Adventures Of Slick Rick, Illmatic, Liquid Swordz, Enter The 36 chambers, all GhostFace albums esp. Supreme Clientele, The Chronic, DoggyStyle, the Chronic 2001, and Ready To Die.). The only other album that might tie it is Life After Death. All my memories for my favorite year in life were blessed by GOD to be laid against the 2 soundtracks o' the hoods of NYC. Raekwons CD blessed the summer and GZAs CD blessed the Winter. I pray for another 1995. Peace 2 GOD, man, woman and child.

0743454529|3.0|I have read and enjoyed several of Jodi Picoult's novels, but something is really bothering me about \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and her current novel, \\"Vanishing Acts\\" (which I have just finished reading.) In \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", a character goes into great detail about how to make a bomb. In \\"Vanishing Acts\\", a character goes into great detail about how to make the drug crystal meth. Huh?????? While I doubt that the type of people who would use this information read Jodi Picoult novels, I am confused as to why such information would be included in the two books. What was the point? Maybe someone out there can explain it to me.
B00005AQE8|5.0|On 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, with some production by Daz Dillinger and DJ Quik, and various LA and Bay area guests, we have a powerhouse and a well rounded album.  Just about every song on here is listenable, and many are classic.  The album ranges from contemplative life and death ballads (\\"Life Goes On\\"), hard core gangsta rap (\\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah,\\" \\"Shorty Wanna Be a Thug\\"), fun lowrider music (\\"Thug Passion\\" with DJ Quik's Talk Box), to the sex anthems (\\"Ratha Be Ya N---a\\")all rapped over smooth to hard G-Funk beats sampling Roger and George Clinton Jr.  The beats that are sampled are well done.  One standout track is \\"Ain't Hard 2 Find\\" because the beat is strong, nice smooth G-Funk, and it hosts a variety of Bay Area rappers (Oakland's Richie Rich, Vallejo's D-Shot, E-40, and B-Legit, and Sacramento's C-Bo).  Tupac is great lyrically as well, and that is apparent in every track here!
B0002XL35G|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it was released.  I was only 23 then but found the entire movie mesmerizing.  It ranked then as the best movie I had ever seen, and now 21 years later it still ranks easily at the top of that same list. <br /> <br />In some ways having watched such a masterpiece of cinema at such a relatively young age was a mixed blessing.  I say that only in the sense that every movie I've seen since pales in comparison quality wise.  The average disposable Hollywood production starts looking like a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />Buy, rent, or borrow this film. You will not regret the 2 1/2 hours of your life spent watching it.
B00008FLQW|5.0|[-This refers to the dvd edition-]<br />George doing an acoustic Here Comes the Sun is worth the price; then 've got the great performance of Dylan, with Ringo, George and Leon Russell helping out - this is back when Bob could still sing!<br /><br />Then as a bonus, if you're a fan of Indian music, the Ravi Shankar segment is really one of the highlights! If not, no problem, just skip it and you've still got a LOT of great music, including some great stuff by Clapton!<br /><br />Billy Preston (some call him the \\"5th Beatle\\" because he played with the Beatles on the rooftop concert) brings the house down, Leon Russell rocks, and Clapton plays guitar!<br /><br />Great concert! And the new dvd has done a fantastic job of cleaning up the audio mix, which was never very good on the vhs.<br /><br />If you are a George fan OR a Dylan fan, you must have this!
B0000AM6IY|4.0|This is one of those movies that just stays.   Like the trailer of this movie says: \\"Unlike other classics, the Westside Story grows younger.\\"   When I first saw the trailer, I found that hard to believe, but when I saw the movie, I came to the conclusion it's the truth.     The movie is a classic that just grabs your heart.   This '60's Romeo and Juliet kind of story is maqnificent!  The dancing, the acting, the singing, the characters, the sets ,the feeling --> it's just special.    No wonder that this movie won 10 academy awards in 1961, it deserves it! You can see that much time and work has been put in this movie. The result? Breathtaking!     With songs like \\"Maria\\", \\"Somewhere\\", \\"One hand, one Heart\\" , \\"Tonight\\", this movie will leave a mark in your mind and your heart.     Even if the movie is over 40 years old, it keeps entertaining and one of a kind.  Oh so old, but oh so beautiful.
B00013RC66|5.0|Fiesty Federal Investigator is hot on the trail of a husband-killer, but to catch her she has to think like the killer thinks and play her game...I would love to see a rematch of these two dynamite femme stars, Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. The movie world needs them. Russell, as an actress, generally lacks Winger's inner-fire, but some of her close-ups are more revealing than her dialogue anyway(watch for the scene on the beach after the scuba diving accident). In 1987, this was considered a modest hit which got generally good reviews(Roger Ebert panned it, however). So it's fair to say the movie is highly underrated and should be seen by anyone who loves a good mystery or a great acting match between two top-flight stars. Supporting performances are also very good, and the direction is tricky & tight right up until the final scene(which seems a little rushed). Great cinematography, suspenseful music by Michael Small, incredible Winger & Russell!
0375507256|5.0|I loved reading this book, and at the same time was constantly impressed by how the author managed to pull it off.  Each section was written in a completely different style, so that when I started a new section I would be missing the last one and it would take a while to get used to the change, but then I would get interested in the new story.  How he can write well in such different styles is beyond me, and he manages to tie the stories together in subtle ways.  I enjoy science fiction and Sonmi~451 was my favorite section, but I cared about the resolution of every story.  I will now have to read his other books.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel(by Garth Nix, Harpertrophy Books, 1996) is set in a world far from our own, in the land torn between two eras. To the south, Ancelstierre, a nation much like England during World War I, whose soldiers were ordered to use trench warfare and toted machineguns and rifles. To the north,the Old Kingdom; a dangerous and collapsing society frozen in the Middle Ages, where Necromancers run amok and raising the dead at will. Right smack in the middle of all this, the Abhorsen: a Necromancer who laid the Dead back to rest instead of raising them. Sabriel is the daughter of the Abhorsen, born in the Old Kingdom (with remnants of its magic still lingering about her) but raised in Ancelstierre. She has always known about her legacy, but only the partial truth... and that ignorance hits her full-force when she is called back to the Old Kingdom by a desperate message her father sent through the gates of Death. So now, she has to save her father while a sinister force plots to eliminate the line of Abhorsens and seize control of Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom.<br /><br /> The average person can probably deduce from the summary that this is a fantasy novel. It is, but not in the traditional sense. The fantastic creatures that usually populate this genre of literature, such as elves, dwarves, and orcs, are conspicuously missing. In their place: a highly original, brilliantly conceived world and its own set of fantastic creatures. Charter-mages and the Abhorsen replace the overused sword swinging, spell chanting warriors and wizards. Though some may consider this heresy, I consider it a refreshing change to an already cluttered genre. Finally! Something that doesn't shamelessly rip off J.R.R. Tolkien and the Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan)!<br /><br /> Sabriel is a long book, the paperback version consists of 491 pages, but by no means a difficult read. Nix's beautiful prose and exciting plot help the story flow through the pages, leaving readers alternately at the edge of their seats and sighing in relief after a close encounter with some dark entity. Detailed descriptions of characters and settings bring the tale to life in the readers' minds and refuse to leave. Nix does an excellent job with pacing, giving the story a healthy mix of action, suspense, and very necessary humor. Character development is subtle but effective; readers can easily notice the main character's growth throughout the book. Nix also does an overall good job at relationships between characters, especially the playful but dangerous association Sabriel has with the strange talking cat.<br /><br /> However, like all books, this one is not without its weaknesses. Though originality is a big strength in this novel, it is also a point of confusion when Nix fails to explain some crucial background clearly, at some points, giving no background at all. For example, we never do find out what exactly the Charter (the source of all righteous magic) is, and why it never works quite well beyond the Wall. Also, many plot points aren't exploited thoroughly, such as drastic difference between Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom. The latter nation appears only twice in the book: briefly in the beginning, and briefly appearance at the end. Perhaps this is all bait for readers to come back and read the sequels (Abhorsen and Lirael) in an attempt to find out more about Sabriel's world. Perhaps more jarring is the rather unpolished relationship between main characters Sabriel and Touchstone.<br /><br /> In general, Sabriel is an enjoyable and entertaining read that could be polish off in a few days. Its originality serves it well and brings a welcomed change to an otherwise stuffed and almost identical genre.and sighing in relief after a close encounter with some dark entity.

B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day has always been evolving. Since way back with their first full album 1039/Slappy, each progressive album has grown and differed from what came before it. Warning is no exception, as the band expands their horizons, creating different songs with different instruments. Building from the experimental momentum of Nimrod tracks like \\"Last Ride In,\\" \\"King for a Day,\\" and \\"Good Riddance,\\" Green Day tries some new material and better song crafting. Don't be fooled though, it's still signature Green Day, with tons of hooks, energy, and clever, hilarious lyrics (Blood, Sex, and Booze, Jackass). And who cares if it's poppier than their previous releases? Green Day has always had a certain pop sense, but their punk roots always shine through. While Dookie was catchy and fun, and American Idiot is a rock masterpiece, this album is just good music. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />P.S. Green Day's the best live band I have ever seen. Watch them in their stadium tour!
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Bubl has been able to transform songs from rock and pop to jazz. I absolutely love Michael's version of \\"Can't Buy me Love\\" (Beatles) and \\"You and I\\" (Stevie Wonder). Michael's renditions turn these very well known songs into new creations. I highly recommend his music to those who like George Michael, Elvis, Sinatra, and Stevie Wonder. Your ears will have the time of their life.
B000002UAR|5.0|In my mind, The Beatles were the greatest rock n' roll band of all time. I am not a hardcore Beatles fan, but just happen to have the utmost respect for their extraordinary capabilities in songwriting, musicality and harmony. Now, for my review of their 1966 album, Revolver.<br /><br />This album, in general, carries limited hits and doesn't hold the catchiest of tunes, as some albums such as Help! or Magical Mystery Tour. However, despite that potential flaw, Revolver was an album that I found to essentially mark the point where The Beatles, as a band, have finally peaked their level of perfection, mixing in addictive, adoring harmonies, revolutionary lyrical phases and deliveries, and all in all superb production of songs. Their song writing branches out to a whole new level with Revolver, beginning with the poetry of Taxman.<br /><br />John Lennon seems to have come the furthest in this album, finding a more tasteful voice, and beginning to write much more passionate, and essentially more meaningful songs. Eleanor Rigby I think has the greatest intro for a song that I've ever heard in my life. The emotions drawn by the captivating lyric, \\"look at all the lonely people\\", is truly phenomenal.<br /><br />From that song on, everything comes together. I'm only sleeping has a very elegant feel to it, with a contagious tone of voice in the chorus. Love Me To is an early sign of psychadelia to come, with the citar opening. Here, There and Everywhere is well placed, an appropriate. Perhaps not a favourite, but a much needed song to complete the album. Then we reach Yellow Submarine. I have mixed feelings about this song. It is nice to sing a long to, however it is difficult to call it brilliant. She said She said, is a wonderful acheivement, very much so complimenting this masterpiece. I also adore And Your Bird Can Sing, featuring a beautiful guitar rhythm, which is generally heavier compared to the rest of the album. For No One is a melodic, well written song, highlighted by the lyric \\"Your day breaks, your mind aches\\". Doctor Robert is catchy, but far from phenomenal. I want to tell you is a superb song, and is generally unnoticed even among diehards. Got to Get You Into My Life is another great track which is definitely worth more than one listen. Tomorrow Never Knows is maybe the most important song on this album, as I think Sgt. Pepper wouldn't exist without Tomorrow Never Knows. It seems out of place the first time you hear it, but it's more than essential to complete the album. The sheer lyrical tones and phases of the track possibly held a place as a lead in for Lucy in the sky with diamonds.<br /><br />I adore this album, and as a whole, it is an extraordinary.  All Beatles fans should own Revolver, and I would also highly recommend the albums, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper's, Abbey Road, Help!, and Magical Mystery Tour.day breaks, your mind aches\\".

B000001FSU|2.0|The Anthrax back catalogue--both one of metal's strongest,and,one that has been with me since the halcyon days of the late '80's/early '90's heavy scene.Anthrax developed from a great Thrash-metal band into a dynamic,highly influential and pioneering act that expertly fused musical styles and ideas,broke new ground(Rap/Metal crossover)and,even up to 2003,released excellent and hugely underrated albums.  <br /> <br />Rewind to early 1988.The band were on the brink of metal-megastardom,and maybe even mass appeal a la Metallica after the enormous creative and commercial magnum-opus,\\"Among The Living\\"(and the ultra-popular \\"I'm the Man\\" song/single/E.P which followed it).What followed was,and still is,a major disappointment and an album that threatened to undo the progress they had made thus far.It's the Anthrax album most criticized and I must say I agree.Anthrax's first three albums showed such musical and creative growth,all three are essential,but '88's \\"State Of Euphoria\\" is mixed-up,dull and lacks that spark that ignited the 'Thrax passion heard on the first three albums.It's not flat-out awful,or even very bad,just irritatingly mundane and mediocre,a disappointment since you know they have so much more talent in them than is showcased here. <br /> <br />Highlights aren't exactly plentiful,but,there are a few saving graces--\\"Be all,End All\\" kicks the album off with some fine melodies and terrific DanSpitz soloing.In fact,the soloing on this record is,for the most part,exemplary.Shame such mundane tracks were built around such exquisite solos.\\"AntiSocial\\",even though it's a cover,breaks a sweat and is still in the set-list today.Not great,but,head and shoulders above such obvious and generic tracks like \\"Out of Sight\\",\\"Schism\\" and the woeful \\"Who Cares wins\\".Belladonna's vocals,while mixed up-front(as with previous albums)sound lost.\\"Among The Living\\" was a perfect match of thrash musical-muscle and Belladonna's mix of operatic and deep tones,but 'Euphoria' boasts(If it is a boast^) some of the most wretched of vocal lines.Another reviewer mentioned this,and,it does go a long way to taking away from some tracks.The vocal lines,in places,are very poorly written,acting almost as an anti-melody,something to turn you off a song than get you grooving to it. <br /> <br />Later albums were much better,although \\"Persistence\\"(the follow up to 'Euphoria'),while mostly good, still showed they were battling with vocal-melodies and arrangements. <br /> <br />'Euphoria'--a misstep by the band,and,save for two or three good tracks,a disappointment for fans.One for the hardcore only methinks.
B00003CY6M|1.0|This movie has almost no comedy at all, and it's a cheap romance that saves himself only due to the talents of John Cusack and that gorgeous British actress Kate Beckinsale. The story is crap. The movie is that kind of manipulative movie that makes you just forget about the poor pals (the bride of Cusack's character and the future husband of Beckinsale's character) that had their coming marriages falling apart fro the sake of only ONE encounter more than one year ago!! Think about absurd!<br /><br />This is cheese, absurd, false and not funny at all. But Cusack is a clever guy. He can alternate effortlessly between the box office champions and the serious movies...
B0007GAEW6|2.0|This album isn't really that bad, but it's not very good either.  I have two main problems with it that ruin it. <br /> <br />1. The singer.  Put the Led Zeppelin, Rush, and U2 singer in a blender and it's not a good sound. <br /> <br />2. It's sounds like Mr Bungle but not nearly as good.  I have only made it through this album once and every other time I stop at track three because it sounds like Mr Bungle but not nearly as good.  It's almost like these guys took everything good about Mr Bungle and combined it with generic 70's rock.  I also doubt that The Mars Volta has many fans who have actually heard Mr Bungle.  <br /> <br /> <br />The bottom line is why would I listen to this when I could listen to Mr Bungle which is better in every single way?  They also have a much better singer.
B0006MT314|4.0|Love it! <br />My favorites are the Tyler Hilton's acoustic \\"Glad\\" and duet with One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz aka Hailey (who is about to release her first album \\"Come On Home\\") \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" as well as The Get Up Kids \\"Overdue\\" <br />it's a great mix of sounds to just pop and listen to.  <br />highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br />also check out Tyler Hilton's \\"The Tracks Of...\\" and \\"Tyler Hilton\\"
1884822312|5.0|This book is like going to McDonald's and saying SUPER SIZE IT! There are so many problems to work on you will not need another book on tactics ever! Buy it and you will like it!
B0000CC5CS|5.0|Not as great as T-1 and T-2, but still good. Its unbelievable that Mr. Governornator had build up such a muscular body even in his fifties. Ladies bar scene is very funny. Truck chase in the beginning is awesome. Fight scene at the grave yard and the chase there after is great. Great action scenes, quite a few funny incidents. Over all a fun movie. EAST OR WEST ARNIE IS THE BEST.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|I watched closer with a friend last night. We had a very interesting discussion about it afterwards with two perspectives. My friend was able to give the male perspective and I have the female.  He thought that this movie showed how manipulative women really are, and I expressed how it was the men who continued to mess with the women's heads.  I found this movie to be very well acted and done very well for the silver screen.  (Having a stage background I could see how it would have been done on stage.)  This movie gave me a lot to think about, and it is very heavy, subject-wise.  This is not typical relationship movie, which falls into the \\"romantic comedy\\" category.  This movie is hard-core drama with a hard-core dose of reality.  For those of you like me who usually stay away from heavy movies and realism, you might want to pass on this.  If you think you can stand it, go for it because the acting is great.  For those of us who are single, this movie becomes the depressing thought that relationships suck.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|ive had this cd almost about since the time it came out last year. but a few days ago i actually started listening to it, and i was blown away. When i first bought this cd and put it in, i really liked the first song, but i thought the rest sucked. but now, i think this has got to be one of my favorite metal cds out so far. if you are a metal fan this is deffenitly a need in your cd collection.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I just viewed Van Helsing for about the 3rd time before I reluctantly had to admit - this was not all that AT ALL!<br /><br />The plot (if one can call it that) was so contrived one immediately wonders \\"why am I watching this again?\\"  Oh yeah...for ol' luscious Hugh!!!!<br /><br />To be sure the special effects are dazzling.  But this was the real problem with The Mummy Returns.  After salivating over the Rock and hoping that Brandon would reveal a little flesh, the movie descended into one big special effect.  This rather trite and boring strategy, an obvious (and unsuccessful) attempt to cover up plot holes, was alas, prevalent here as well.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this would have been infinitely more bearable if Hugh had shown a little more flesh.  After all these special effects slash changes, you'd think they'd have given the wardrobe mistress a free hand to work out a lil' sump'n sump'n a tad more titillating to show off Hugh so we can forget that this picture was just not the one. (belch)
0060934913|5.0|The funniest book on food I ever read.  A laugh on every page!  Tony wrote this book on the heels of the success of his novels, \\"Bone in the Throat\\" and \\"Gone Bamboo\\" and his non-fiction piece on \\"Typhoid Mary\\".  Well done!
B0000A118M|5.0|Probably the best-known selection in Coltrane's entire outstanding body of work, it certainly is among non-jazz listeners who have long made it one of the greatest crossover successes in the history of mainstream jazz.  The reason for this is all in the feeling.  From the opening stroke of the gong to Coltrane's chanting of the title to the evocative and moving saxophone \\"prayer\\" at the conclusion this is one of the most profoundly moving and powerful performances ever recorded, in a way that touches us as human beings, not as jazz fans or rock fans or as anything other than lovers of great music and great art.<br /><br />Anyone from the devout to the unreligious cannot fail to be moved by Coltrane's heartfelt expression of the spirituality that he found after sinking to the depths of addiction.  Coltrane's triumph over heroin and his thanks to God are what informs every note that is played.  Yet, the truly wonderful thing about A Love Supreme is that as instrumental music (aside from the chant) it is universal to people of all languages, all cultures and all religions (or even no religions.)  Everyone can draw strenghth and inspiration in their own way from this amazing and vital recording.<br /><br />Coltrane and his brilliant quartet (McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones) present a masterpiece of classical/jazz/spiritual that goes far beyond the reaches of mere jazz.  What it is, is a work of art, one of the greatest ever, and one that should be enjoyed by all for as long as hope and love remain in this world.<br /><br />Way more than 5 stars.  Timeless, profound and absolutely essential.
1591396190|5.0|Several theories and books have been published on doing business under competition. Each of these are aimed either at improving our chances of survival and winning or just a description of the phenomenon under study. However only a few eventually emerge as useful frameworks and remain in the managerial toolkit for successful deployment. There is definitely no \\"one best way\\" to manage competition. We can at best put our plans to the rigorous scrutiny of the wisdom of research conducted over the years and attempt to maximize the probability of success. Sometimes we need a totally new way of looking at things and suddenly a whole new world of possibilities emerge. Blue Ocean Strategy is a book that belongs to this class and proposes a radically new perspective to the issue. <br /> <br />The book opens with the concept of  Blue Oceans and how we can create new uncontested markets through value innovation. The Strategy Maps that give us a good pictorial comparison of market opportunities is sure to emerge as a powerful tool in most top management presentations like Michael Porter's Model or the McKinsey Framework did during in the last decades. However the book has not detailed the means by which the important value factors are identified and sequencing is done. This would be useful when we are dealing with dozens of factors and the different visual pictures that emerge based on sequencing. <br /> <br />While at one time Ford was successful based on Model T , mass production was soon overtaken and even ridiculed by customization to the extent we devised flexible manufacturing with batch size of one. We now seem to be going back in time when the authors recommend aggregation of similarities across segments as one of the strategies to create Blue Oceans. This reminds me of the double helix model ( \\"Clock Speed\\" by Charles Fine). <br /> <br />The approach of value innovation is to identify those parameters that are valued most by customers and offer these  in a mix that iscost effective and highly valuable. Excess of functionality not utilized is removed and functionality that is inadequate is amplified. This has a strong resemblance to and perhaps a corollary to \\"Disruptive Innovations\\" as described by Prof Clayton Christensen in his path breaking \\"Innovator's Dilemma\\". <br /> <br />The six steps - Search, planning, Scale, Business Model, Organization and Management for formulating and deployment of the strategy is neat.  <br /> <br />There are numerous case studies across various chapters that are so diverse that at times I lost direction in the ocean. Appendix 1 describes three industries - Cars ( how we go to work), Computers ( what we use at work) and the Movie Theaters ( where we relax after work). It would have been great if the authors had restricted to cases from these across all the chapters to lend continuity and clarity.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0066620996|5.0|I read Good to Great through the filter of someone who works on a college campus.  While it has now been on the market for four years, it merits attention because so many campus administrative teams are using it as a focal point for their retreats and discussions.  Jim Collins and his research team undertook a study of companies that were good, solid businesses that then took a turn for the better, achieving significant, sustained (fifteen years or more) growth beyond what their peers experienced.  They explored what made the difference at the eleven companies that went from \\"Good to Great.\\"  Since other reviewers have done a good job of summarizing the book's key points, I won't take the time to restate them again here.   <br /> <br />The book is very readable.  It is filled with stories and doesn't get bogged down in financial charts or research methodology, though that information is provided in the appendices.  Each chapter concludes with a summary of its key points for easy reference.   <br /> <br />In a time of reduced resources and increased expectations, most college leaders would benefit from reading Good to Great.  The book is thought provoking and enjoyable.  Furthermore, it is structured in way that makes it easy for the reader to refer to it later and find the needed information.  Its principles ring true and even if you don't work in a setting where they will be adopted campus wide, they can be applied to some extent even within a particular office or department.   <br />
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I had never heard of Madeleine Peyroux until she was recommended to me by a close friend.  If you like her voice, a smoky, sultry and silky combination of Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan, then you will not be disappointed.  Unlike Jane Monheit, who I was told sounds like Ms. Peyroux (I, for one, do not agree with the comparison), Ms. Peyroux does not have failings of phrase, pitch and pronunciation.  A remarkable CD.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I've been playing guitar for 25 years and I love DVD concerts that feature guitar.  Clapton's Crossroads festival is a heapin' helpin' showcase for some of the best fret-grinders in history.  The best part is you don't have to get blasted by the Texas heat in Dallas' Cotton Bowl to enjoy it! <br /> <br />With a line-up that reperesents many in the constellation of all-time guitar greats, some of the finest players shown on the DVD turn in mediocre performances, and some of these you might think less of, are absolutely killer.  I find most of the ensemble performances are lukewarm, including those with BB, Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Jimmie Vaughan.  Buddy DOES play great, no question, and he really stands out.  But I saw Jimmie Vaughan play live last year and he was awesome.  The playing I saw on this DVD of him was pretty tepid.  His requiem to his lengendary brother Stevie, \\"Six Strings Down\\", is pretty weak, but is rescued by the addition of pedal steel phenom Robert Randolph, who turns in a sizzling performance.  Other disappointments include Eric Johnson. His \\"Desert Rose\\" is one of his showcase pieces and he labors through it on this disk.  Johnny Langs hardly plays a guitar solo on his featured song.  Why the hell was that tune even put on the disk? <br /> <br />The Great stuff:  Steve Vai and his over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek antics are amazing. Beat-up and haggard,  JJ Cale is sublimely great.  James Taylor, as usual, plays with great warmth and subtlelty, and is accompanied by dobro giant Jerry Douglas, whom he refers to as \\"The Muhammad Ali of Dobro\\", and also by Joe Walsh.  It is Joe Walsh, in my opinion, who steals the DVD's show.  His electric blues-drenched stylings dipped into a bucket of digital delay is pure candy and heaven for guitar aficionados' ears.  I've never been a big fan of his, even though he's a respected player.  Joe's blues intro in his own set will floor you.  His tone and phrasing are fantastic.  John Mayer surprised the hell out of me...thought he was just a pretty boy, but he's an excellent electric guitarist.  Carlos Santana and Clapton play a guitar duel in the classic , \\"Jingo.\\"  Country player Vince Gill plays some hot Telecaster licks in his set, esp. on \\"Oklahoma Borderline.\\" Finally, Clapton himself plays some great stuff, clearly inspired, and he sings with a passion that burns. <br /> <br />Other issues: the sound mix has problems at times...the overall level dips now and again through Vai's song and Gills' \\"Oklahoma Borderline.\\"  Some of the audience reaction shots make the crowd look dazed and like they don't understand what they're seeing/hearing.  Maybe it's just the Dallas heat and dehydration at work.  Some of those shots look so out of place they appear to be taken from songs other than the one they're married to on disk.  And the director makes some strange choices, as in Gills' \\"Oklahahoma Borderline,\\" he gets confused and calls for the camera on Jerry Doulglas while Gill is playing a solo (I have not looked at the alt. angles yet). <br /> <br />Finally, we see or hear snippets of some other players not on the disk: Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny, John McGlaughlin and Neal Schon.  Schon's \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" is heard on closing titles and sounds great.  One can only hope those and the rest of the omitted performances are being saved for a Volume II. <br /> <br /> <br />Issues aside, I really like this DVD and show highlights from it to all my music aficionado pals, who end up digging it as much as I do. <br /> <br />Take it to the bridge!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie the greatest!  I've seen it 5 times already and I am definitely going to buy it the day it comes out on DVD.  I have never seen the play of phantom, but I doubt that it can live up to the standards that this movie has set.  The singing is magnificent, especially that of Gerard Butler and 'Christine'.  It's really entertaining and is really a feast for the eyes.  I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone!
B0007OCG4W|2.0|In the real world, nobody talks like the characters in this movie.  Here we have four fairly unlikable people, doing their level best to elevate their banal infidelities to the level of profundity. After ten minutes, the more astute viewer will ask, \\"Who cares?\\" The film uses an unusual time-compression gimmick, which some may view as \\"arty\\" or \\"cutting edge,\\" but it becomes clear (right around minute 40) that this IS just a gimmick, a way to pack the whole story into a workable timeframe. The piece was originally a play, and you'll know it: Despite Mike Nichols success with previous theatrical material, Closer is amazingly stage-bound, but then again, there's only so much you can do with a painfully bad script, lines that almost scream out \\"PROFUNDITY\\" and actors who are taking the whole thing much too seriously. Absolutely no chemistry between any of the leads, the viewer will be wondering how ANYONE (much less these silly characters) could find any single character attractive enough to torpedo their existing relationship.  Of course, the existing relationship is with yet another one of the four characters, so that may have something to do with it. From the over-the-top sex talk in the chat room to the ridiculous approximation of a strip club, we get the feeling that the playwright (and screenwriter) has no first-hand experience.  Instead, we have the feeling that the script was written by a high-school student imagining what it would be like to have deep thoughts about sex and relationships.  Much too chilly, academic and wrongheaded. Let's face facts, \\"intellectualism\\" simply doesn't work unless it has some connection to life the way life is lived.  This is an exercise, pure and simple, one that speaks to nobody.  Upgraded one star for a cool twist toward the end, a twist that takes up perhaps 10 seconds of screentime.  As for the actual final shot, someone please tell me what the point is supposed to be.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I am surprised that people are disappointed with this album. Yes, this is a departure from Discovery but so too was Discovery from Homework. The reason why DP is such a standout is because they take risks and not try to deliver the same album over and over. The beats are repetitive yet all their music is repetitive. They went with a much more simplistic style on this album - and most all the songs are so catchy I just can't get them out of my head. My favorites are -Television rules the nation  , Technologic, The prime time of your life , and Human after all. I would say to listen to this album a couple of times before forming an opinion. I love it !
B00006JKON|5.0|Back in the second half of the 70's,when I was a teenager,mostly everybody regarded this album as \\"the worst\\", \\"a departure from their original style\\",etc.HAH ! Now everybody seems to love it,which proves my point.I am not to be mocked again for stating this is my favourite.

0060555661|4.0|I am just a family man, struggling with a mortgage, four kids, and college tuitions. I bought this book to help myself get more insight into investing as I have received poor investment advice in the past. Honestly, the best part of this book for me was the commentary by Jason Zweig. I would often go immediately to the after chapter commentary, sometimes instead of reading the original chapter, his commentary was that good! <br /> <br />I keep this book by my night table, and reread sections of it, while I work on my portfolio.
0316172324|4.0|Lots of great stuff to chew on here. Not sure that it can all be scientifically backed up, but this info can come in handy for many who are in jobs/roles where they need to trust their gut instincts.
B00000DGXN|5.0|When you get Gary Burton, Chick Corea, Pat Metheny and Roy Haynes together, expectations are bound to be high. And do they ever deliver. These players are not only at the top of their game (and have been for 20 years +) but they have played together in some manner earlier (but never all together). These players have an uncanny ability to hear and respond to each other. The interplay or \\"conversations\\" offer some of the most beautiful yet complex listening that I have heard in years. Great musicianship, wonderful compositions along with what sounds like deep mutual respect has made a classic recording that any jazz fan should own and study - and enjoy - for years and years.
B00008WT5M|3.0|after reading the reviews, I guess I'm in the minority when I say that The Razors Edge is probably the AC/DC album I'm least likely to listen to. Yes, there are some great tracks on here, most notably \\"Thunderstruck\\", but \\"Rock Your Heart Out\\", \\"Got You By The Balls\\", and \\"Shot of Love\\" (nearly reminiscent of a High Voltage-era riff) get your feet tappin' as well. So I don't have any major gripes about the songwriting, for the most part. My main problem, however, is Bruce Fairburn's production...it's SO crisp and clean, it nearly chokes the groove out of many songs. With most AC/DC albums (particularily with Phil Rudd on drums), the rhythm section moves along like a freight train to where you can practically hear the \\"chug-a-lugg\\" noise coming from the tracks. On this album, I dunno...I can't put my finger on it, but it almost sounds like the band's playing along to a metronome, it's that precise. Even when Mutt Lange (AC/DC's \\"other\\" mainstream producer) was at the controls, he still managed to keep things raw & swingin'. Fairburn, on the other hand...well, put it this way: if there was an audio equivalent for a \\"new car\\" smell, you can bet Fairburn's patented the formula. Which, by the way, doesn't bode well when you're AC/DC IMO. Nonetheless, often the band still rocks in spite of the slick production, and The Razors Edge might actually be an ideal start for a newbie...y'know, as a way to ease 'em in slowly...lol
B00007AJF9|5.0|Overall, in my opinion, a five star movie.  Cate Blanchett's performance was excellent and her uncanny resemblance to the Elizabeth depicted in paintings was amazing, if not a little eerie.  The supporting cast was brilliant; Fiennes, Rush, etc. were all equally great.  The costumes were another highlight of this film and the setting/scenery was dark and surreal, as I imagined it would have been then as well.  Great historical account and a must see for anyone interested in the story of Elizabeth.
B000001EC1|4.0|With the exception of a girl I knew in elementary school back in 1988-1989, I've never met a real Bon Jovi fan.  Therefore, it's my belief that more people probably own \\"Cross Road\\" than \\"Slippery When Wet\\" or \\"7800 Degrees Fahrenheit.\\"  Quite frankly, from what I've heard, no one really needs any more Bon Jovi than the 14 songs contained on this one CD.  All the hits are here, and if you can think of even one Bon Jovi song that ISN'T on here and you absolutely MUST hear, then there might be something wrong with you.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is just an amazing album that has no flaws.  Nas's style and flow fit the production perfectly.  I didn't realize how amazing it was when I first got it but as I began to understand hip-hop and pay attention to lyrics it became one of my favorite albums of all-time.  Many young people today think the beats suck and don't pay attention to lyrics but for me both the production and lyrics are great.  Also some complain that there are only 9 full tracks but why would you add to 9 perfect songs.  There is no filler on this album and 9 tracks was perfect. <br /> <br /> <br />1. Genesis- N/A <br /> <br />2. N.Y. State Of Mind- 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Life's A Bitch- 5/5 <br /> <br />4. World Is Yours- 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Halftime- 5/5 <br /> <br />6.

0393035158|4.0|Many people are beginning to realize that religion is a threat to the peace and security of the world. In the near future world leaders will sanction the destruction of the world's religious system. The Bible foretells a time when such an event would occur. Revelation chapter 17. Mystery Babylon the Great - a symbol of the world's false religious system whixh has caused war, hatred, intolerance, bigotry, ect. for many millenium. If you compare the beliefs, doctrine, customs, and holidays of many of today's religions with the religions of ancient Babylon you can see the similiarities. So-called Christianity 'borrowed' most of its beliefs from mystery Babylonian pagan religion and put a 'Christian' label on it. What most people believe to be Christianity was created Roman Emperor Constantine the Great and disguised as Christianity. Mystery Babylon the Great, depicted as a prostitute riding on the back of a beast-like political system.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I am going to make this short and sweet.  I love this album.  Love it.  (I also love Josh Homme, but nevermind.)  This CD has not left my player since I bought it nearly 3 weeks ago. <br />The 2 best tracks in my oh-so-humble opinion, \\"I Never Came\\" & \\"Broken Box.\\" <br />In short, go buy this album.  You will love it.
B00004LN16|4.0|AC/DC was always a heavy band since Day 1, but over the years they seemingly evolved into heavy metal moreso than heavy boogie & blues (not a complaint, just an observation). Enter Stiff Upper Lip. Although released in 2000, at times it sounds like it coulda been bookended by the Dirty Deeds and Powerage albums...albums that rocked with raw energy, and not nearly as reliant with distortion as, say, Flick Of The Switch or Fly On The Wall. The title track, \\"Safe In New York City\\", \\"Satellite Blues\\", and \\"Give It Up\\" are vintage AC/DC, any era. The rest of the album is solid, even ambitious at times, and will probably take a few listens to warm up to (except for maybe \\"Can't Stand Still\\", which kinda falls flat IMO). No, Stiff Upper Lip is not the second coming of Back In Black, but nonetheless you'll still have to go back to the 80's to find another AC/DC album on par with this one...
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I'm not one who likes movies that dig out the past and then try to bring out  a person's life. Big Fish's interesting. The concept glorifies the script using appropriate character combinations. Its a big movie of its own sort. I wouldn't say its one of the best films I have seen without seeing it again.<br /><br />The much celebrated father's character in this movie is quite empowering. There are movies that I like and appreciate because they are well wound out as in the story relating is pretty solid. I liked OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU for it tales of past vast country lands and inane yet imaginable people.<br /><br />I liked Big Fish more for the eyes, the small trespasses and the fact that \\"A big fish remains a small fish if kept in a small pond\\"<br /><br />Cheesy? Go watch the film , lovers :)
B0007GAERG|5.0|Well what can I say I absolutley love the cd. Its her best since Rainbow.

B0002G2B2M|2.0|The bottomline about this film is that I DIDNT FEEL IT. I'm a very curious guy so when I was told there is something so insanely mesmerising about this film, I saw it again and even after watching it twice, I failed to feel it. This film is self conscious, stuckup, morally confused and pretty badly edited. I found two scenes in this film which tried to be very thunderous but failed miserably at evoking any sort of amusement or \\"whoa\\" out of me, except the original intented intent.I did not sleep during this film. It isnt the worst film I have ever seen. I'd still give it a four.<br /><br />All this is my opinion. Try not to knock on me.<br /><br />Do I hate it? I seldom use such strong words, but Yes, with every beat in my \\"Man On the moon\\" loving, Jim Carrey Fan HEART.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|Me and my four friends saw this movie at a theater cause we thought we'd see some action. We did see some action but the fact that this movie made me sleep with its absolutely non engrossing script made me feel I wasted my good money(and time) on something as small as this.<br /><br />I call it small because I fail to recollect one action sequence , one dialogue or one thing from this movie that I liked to the extent of saying it was better movie'd(my term) than some other.<br /><br />Please see: I felt quite disturbed at the money wasted on making this film. There are people who liked this and I respect them for it. But if there are some people as foolish as me who chose to go for this instead of some other hollywood flick STOP! I'd recommend any of the following movies instead of this sad tale of boredom. KING ARTHUR , TROY , Lord Of The Rings Two Towers...<br /><br />So Long , lovers :)
B00005JNTV|4.0|Frank Miller's Sin City is by far the best comic book adapted film in recent years. It's got very well written characters, and the often brutal and stylish actions is very unique and refreshing along with the mostly black and white cinematography. It's a very entertaining movie, but it's not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the graphic novels, because it's got three interconnecting stories that isn't neccessarily consistent in it's time frame. Also the over two hour long film is obviously heading for some sequels since the story didn't end when the movie was over.<br /><br />This is probably Mickey Rourke's career revival role since he has the juicest role that require him to looked semi-distorted, very muscular, endure various heavy-duty fight scenes, and he's got some very funny moments as well. With more screen time compared to other leads, it's unfortunate that he didn't even receive top billing like Willis, Alba, and Owen. He played Marv, and he's a street wise guy trying to track down the man who killed his hooker girlfriend Goldie(Jaime King). Kevin(Elijah Wood) is the scary and skillful hooker-eating mute that became Marv's relentless target. Elijah Wood had several scenes that consisted of fights with Marv, and he's so creepy different than his Frodo character.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is Hartigan, and he's the only good cop left when everyone else is corrupted. He was betrayed by his colleque Bob(played by the underused Michael Madsen) when he helped saved a little girl named Nancy Callahan, and ended up in jail for eight years. Nancy(Jessica Alba) grew up to become a pole dancer at a night club, and she eventually fell in love with Hartigan despite the age difference. Jessica Alba is very stunning on stage, and she was pretty convincing when she had to French kiss Willis.<br /><br />Clive Owen played the \\"Babe Magnet\\"/Dwight, who had a thing for helping the local prostitutes through hard times. Rosario Dawson is Gail, the leader of a group of highly skilled prostitutes. She was in some serious trouble when Miho(Devon Aoki) mistakenly killed Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro) and his men. Jackie Boy is an abusive husband to Shellie(Britanny Murphy), and a corrupted cop. Since Dwight has a thing for Gail, he was willing to do anything to bail her out. Devon Aoki is very striking as the lethal assasin with great martial arts skills and works as Gail's top sidekick.<br /><br />Other secondary characters include Yellow Bastard/Rourk junior(Nick Stahl), Senator Rourk(Powers Boothe),and Lucille(Carla Gugino) are very well played even though they have limited screen time.of highly skilled prostitutes.

Ashton Kutcher is the showcase here, delivering a strong performance as a college psych student who suffers from a troubling past.  The film is surprisingly graphic and disturbing, but offers some nice twists and turns that keep it interesting and offbeat.

B0006SSOHC|3.0|\\"Saw\\" wants to be \\"Se7en\\" with more blood and gore.  It doesn't succeed on any level, but is a decent horror/thriller.  The plot is intriguing and disturbing, as two men are locked in a dirty, closed room where the only escape is by killing the other.  The Jigsaw Killer is never as scary as he should be and the quickly explained twist is a little disappointing, but looking past plot holes and the rip-offs, \\"Saw\\" delivers some good scenes of scares and holds up as a decent horror flick, despite Cary Elwe's god-awful acting.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera plays it safe on her new album, \\"Stripped\\", but she also makes a commitment: to the terse, stream-lined pop that rose her to fame.  All of a sudden, it seemed, the lavishly acrobatic ballads and gleaming pop that showed off her multi-octave range and sold millions of her debut album were pushed aside by the sound of hip-hop grooves on the soundtrack cut \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and \\"Stripped\\"'s lead single, \\"Dirrty\\" featuring Redman. <br /> <br />Agulera's fully in the realm of pop on \\"Stripped\\", but hip-hop as redefined it.  Those weary of a hip-hop record may relax.  Yet the current popularity of R&B brings Aguilera to book some rappers and by setting songs gaered for the clubs, most notably on the album's first single, \\"Dirrty.\\"  Staying contemporary, Aguilera includes a sexually geared pop track \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and opts to sing lightly on \\"Underappreciated\\" instead of blaring her impressive voice. <br /> <br />Ms. Aguilera deserve some respect for writing her own lyrics, even if most of the time they're about hooking up.  But like the title of the album promises, Aguilera gives some insight into her personal life.  \\"I'm Okay\\" is a surprisingly deep look at her pain after her father's abandonment of her as a child.  She promises to appreciate herself on \\"Loving Me For Me\\" and \\"Beautiful\\", encourages others to do the same on  \\"The Voice Within\\" and \\"Soar\\", includes some personal hardships on \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Underappreciated\\", and gets pissed on \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" featuring an obligatory rap verse by Lil' Kim. <br /> <br />\\"Stripped\\" works well for the most part.  It's not the classic some are making it out to be, but it shows that Aguilera is truly a cut above the rest of female pop stars.  And with more songs like the stellar \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Impossible\\", she'll be far above the competition and not looking back.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Excorcist was directed by William Friedkin based on the novel by William Peter Blatty. The novel is supposedly based on a true events that took place in  Virginia where they had to use exorcism to drive the devil out of a young boy. This movie instead focuses on a young 12 year girl.    This is by far the scariest movie ever made. The acting in this movie is brilliant, the story is great and  it was well directed everything that happens in the movie is for a reason and fits well together. Its starts off with Father Merrin who is a priest turned archiologist and is digging up ancient artifacts. The setting is actually filmed in Mosul, Iraq. He comes across something ancient that has the face of a demon. Later Father Merrin stands face to face with the demon Pazuzu statue at the end of this scene, very scary.    Back in Washington DC near Georgtown University. You first get a glimpse of Reagan and her mother Chris.  Her mother wonderfully played by Ellen Burstyn is an actress working on a movie. It never tells you how she gets posssed  through the ouiji board. Reagen does mention becoming friends with Captain Howdy after playing with the board. Is Captain Howdie really Pazuzu or just an imaginary friend?  First mysterious noises start to happen in the house. Chris thinks they are \\"just rats\\" from the attic. If only it was that simple. Slowly strange things start to happen to her daughter Reagan played brilliantly by Linda Blair. Her mother starts to worry when she sees this and brings Reagan to the hospital. She goes through all these horrible and painstaking neurological tests and the tension starts to slowly grip you as soon see this young innocent girl slowly forming into the devil. Its starts slowly with just some bad language then escalates to more.     The scariest scenes follow after this when Reagan is fully possessed by the devil. Some of these scenes are the scariest I have seen in any movie. The 3 scenes that are the most frighting without giving to much away are, the posessed Reagen and what she says and does OMG,  a spiderwalk down the stairs by Reagen, and images of the devil pops up a few times when you are not aware and a scene with a crucifix, A priest Father Karras who is also a psychiatrist played very well by Jason Miller trys to figure out what is going on with Reagan after he is approached by an emotionally torn up Chris. He himself is dealing with his own problems regarding his faith to the Catholic church because his mother is very ill, which is shown in several scenes. He questions how this can be happening to his mother since he is a priest. After talking to \\" Reagan\\" he has a difficult time understanding that Reagen is the devil by using fake holy water and talking to her.  He thinks it is more of a psychiatrical problem. This of course start to get worse and Chris pleads with Father Karras to approve an exorcism because this is the only hope she has left in saving her daughter Reagon.    The last 1/2 hour of the movie is very gripping and scary. Father Merrin along with Father Karras try to help drive the demon Puzzu out of Reagon by performing an excorcism. Little to they know in the beginning how difficult and tiring it would be. This makes for more intense scenes.  This is not for the weak hearted. I highly recommend this movie if you really want to get scared!!! This DVD contains 12 minutes of extra footage that was not included in the original which makes it even more better!!
B0007O38F8|2.0|I know it's been a while since this cd has come out now, but for some reason after just listening to it i got the urge to write a review. I try and listen to it over and over again hoping that i will like it and find something positive about it. However, i have realized that this CD is total garbage. When 50 first entered the rap game in early 2000 he had the streets on fire. His lyrics were interesting, he could write a great hook, and he was creative. Then he came out with get rich or die trying which in my opinion was a classic. It had everything u could possibly want in a rap album. Great songs, strong lyrics, hot production, and a hot diss track in \\"Back Down.\\" Now 50 has gone along and exemplified everything that is wrong with the rap game today. He is overly cocky and arrogant and could care less if he puts out a hot album that relates to the streets. Just about all the songs on this album are either club,love, or radio songs. The songs that aren't club or radio just suck. For example, the song \\"I dont need em\\" copy's the same beat from Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies.\\" The \\"Hate it or love it remix\\" shows that 50 is too lazy to spit a new verse for the track that debuted on Game's the documentary. The song \\"Piggy Bank\\" is a pointless low blow to fat joe, jada, and nas. This song simply demonstrates 50's attempt to make money off dissing the games top rappers that did nothing to deserve it. However, they all owned 50 on their responses to Piggy Bank. The song \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" shows 50's attempt to be overly creative rapping as heroin to the addict, which didnt work at all. The song is dull and retarded.For some reason on this cd he sounds extra slow and stupid. This just adds to the boringness and uncreativeness of the cd. What can i say, this cd is just an absolut mess. I truly beleive that this cd wasnt bad because of lack of skill, but rather lack of commitment. On Get Rich or Die Trying he was focused primarily on the album. However, this time around onthe massacre the album was the least of his worries. He has been too caught up with sneakers, clothes, beverage drinks, and concerts. However, from here on out he will probably stay with the same format as the Massacre. It sold a ridiculous amount of copies and has been number 1 for a while. The album is more Hip-Pop than Hip-Hop and Hip-Pop will sell more any day. It seems that 50's a hipocrit and took a page out of Ja Rules playbook. Well i've said enough but if ive givin any advice at all its please dont buy this cd if your a true fan of Rap. It's corney, boring, and not hot at all.

B0006399FS|4.0|This is a top notch CD.  Unfortunately, there are many sad people here posting under fake accounts just to wail on this CD.  Especially Roberto Diaz who is really GDB posting under another alias.  He will be nailed shortly for account abuse.  I've been watching this group for a while and there's one loser continuously posting under new accounts.  IP tracking will be requested shortly.    All Because of You -- a great rocker which has gotten a lot of airplay.    Vertigo -- A FUN rocking song that most people will like if they lighten up a bit.  :)    Yahweh -- A simple, catchy, straightforward hymn to Bono's God.  I always appreciated his open spirituality, even if I don't believe the same things he does.    Crumbs from Your Table -- That funky chord they use and the rolling, rocking hooks.  Wonderful tune.    Miracle Drug -- Sounds like something from Boy and I can't get enough of it.    Yes, this CD isn't perfect, however, it is NOT even close to being a 1 star effort like the lamers here are trying to say.
0156027321|3.0|This book reminded me of Endurance - the story of Shackleton's gone-wrong expedition to the South Poll - in it tells how human beings can overcome great adversity.  The story is well written and hard to put down.  However, I would recommend the story of the Endurance because it is a true story.  I also found that the story's most enjoyable part was not the voyage across the Pacific Ocean but the boy's struggles to pick a religion at the beginning and the reaction of his family and friends after they discover he has become a Hindu, Christian, and Muslim at the same time.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monstropolis is experiencing a power shortage. They use the screams of human children to power their city. But the numbers are off and Monsters, Inc. is really pushing the people who work on the scare floor to create more energy. James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan (John Goodman) is the current leader. A large, fuzzy bear-type creature with horns, Sulley works with Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a round green guy with one eye. As a team, they are the current leaders. Randall (Stave Buscemi) is consumed with jealous rage and wants to be the top earner. Everyone in Monstropolis has been taught that the human children they scare are also toxic to the monsters. This leads more than a few monsters to become afraid of them and quickly call of the visit. One night, after everyone has gone home, Sulley revisits the scare floor and finds that a door to a child's room has been left behind. He pokes his head in and sees nothing. When he returns to the scare floor, he finds that the little girl who lives in the room has grabbed onto his fur. He nicknames her Boo and has to figure out a way to get her back home without causing the city to becomes panicked.<br /><br />\\"Monsters, Inc.\\", the newest film from Pixar, is a brilliant addition to their library. Directed by newcomer, Peter Docter, a John Lassiter prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the film starts with a brilliant concept, adds a delightful screenplay and tops it off with some of the best computer animation yet.<br /><br />Much like the previous Pixar films, the attention to detail in \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is simply staggering. Monstropolis is basically any large American city, down to the power crisis and potential rolling blackouts. The only difference is that it is populated by monsters of all shapes and sizes. The buildings are given brick detail, the cars are given grills, the interior of Monsters, Inc. has a large lobby. It makes it seem very real. The attention given to the characters is actually even more impressive. Sulley's fur coat seems to be very real and life-like. Every strand of fur seems to move individually. In a couple of scenes, his coat is buffeted by wind and seems to ripple like waves. His facial expressions are also very good and exhibit a whole range of emotions. Mike, the little round assistant, is given more of a goofball comic look, fitting the voice that Billy Crystal uses. His eye and mouth movements are very expressive and help to create an impressive character. Every monster has a different look; Celia (Jennifer Tilly), the girl Mike has a crush on, looks like a sort of Medusa slug, Mr. Waternoose (James Coburn), the head of Monsters, Inc. looks like a crab. This level of inventiveness never fails to amaze the viewer.<br /><br />The story is very involving, providing amusement for the adults while the kiddies are amused by the animation. The story opens with a little boy going to bed, as his parents close the bedroom door. Immediately, his eyes widen as he imagines the closet door open a crack and a shadow flowing from it. It turns out to be pajama sleepers, hanging on the inside. Then, a monster appears, ready to frighten the child, only to get frightened by the child instead. But all of this is actually happening in a simulator in Monsters, Inc., to train the monsters about frightening the children. The method used for getting into the children's bedrooms is very inventive. The story involving Boo, the human child is also very amusing. A chase through various children's doors is also an amusing highlight. Just these few elements represent more thought and inventiveness than that which is invested in most other Hollywood films.<br /><br />There are also a lot of jokes aimed at keeping adults occupied. First of all, the entire film is basically a tribute to baby boomers. Everything in Monstropolis is growing old and weathered. It is the children of today, harder to scare because they are desensitized, that are the problem. The children of the baby boomers are the problem, inferring that the baby boomer period was just fine for Monstropolis.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" has a message or moral and it is presented in such a way that all viewers can get the message and retain it. The message isn't rammed down our throats and forced upon us.<br /><br />\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is an enjoyable film for everyone in the family. The characters, animation and story will surely win over everyone who watches it. 4 ½ stars.ing that the baby boomer period was just fine for Monstropolis.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" has a message or moral and it is presented in such a way that all viewers can get the message and retain it.

6304645635|1.0|If you are a true Bronte fan. You will not want to watch this movie. I checked it out at my local library expecting something on the lines of Sense and Sensibility  and soon discovered  that the producers must have lost all sense during the production of this movie. What were they thinking?!! This is not Ann Bronte, it's a producer/director using the name of a book and writing his own story! I couldn't even finish the movie, it was too awful, the flashbacks were bizarre, and finally when it shows her with her \\"husband\\" \\"romancing\\" it was too much for this Victorian. After a while you began to count the minutes in between the conversation and people walking around on the screen looking bored! BBC should try reading the books first, that way they can end up with widows, not  prostitutes as the heriones of their next movie.
B0002W4SWC|4.0|Dear Diary,<br /><br />Tonight, I went to see 'Bridget Jones' Diary'. I know. I'm a guy and I didn't go with a woman. But I went. I'll confess. I went to one of the most anticipated 'chick flicks' in years without a woman. I don't know. I just feel that the whole 'chick flick', 'guy movie' thing is a disservice. If the movie is good, why shouldn't everyone see it? If the movie is bad, no one should see it. Calling 'Someone Like You' a 'chick flick' does a disservice to females. Does that mean that they like tepid, recycled cr*p? I hope not.<br /><br />I had a feeling I would like 'Bridget Jones' Diary', which is why I went on opening night, sitting in the middle of hundreds of women with their boyfriends and groups of female friends.<br /><br />I was surprised by how much I liked it.<br /><br />Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is a young, single woman living in London. At 32, she begins to wonder why she can't have a meaningful relationship. She begins to wonder why she isn't married. Her mother is no help. She attempts to fix Bridget up with Mark D'Arcy (Colin Firth), a former childhood friend. Things don't go especially well and she runs into the arms of her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Their relationship blooms, hot and heavy, until...<br /><br />'Bridget Jones' Diary' is certainly not the most original movie in the world. It is pretty evident who Bridget will end up with in the end. One of the things that makes the film great is the journey. Bridget has to deal with Cleaver's boss, an older gentleman who cannot remember her name, a lecherous 'uncle', three friends, a mother and father who are having their own crisis and her own relationships with D'Arcy and Cleaver. There are a lot of funny lines in the film, lines that are that much funnier because they arise from only slightly exaggerated circumstances.<br /><br />Zellweger is terrific. From the moment she opens her mouth, any doubts about a Texan pulling off a convincing British accent disappear. She becomes a young British woman, and they are very different from young American women. She has the mannerisms, the tastes, the size, the accent of a young British woman. Zellweger received a Golden Globe award for 'Nurse Betty\\", also a great film, and deserves another one for this role.<br /><br />Usually, a film with ongoing voice over sort of sends me over the edge. However, the voiceover in 'Diary' is very good. It serves to highlight points in the film, rather than bridge them and make up for a lacking narrative.<br /><br />Grant plays a character very different from his ultra-romantic, slightly dithering standard (see 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' and 'Notting Hill' for prime examples) and he reveals that he actually has a bit of range.<br /><br />Firth is a real find in this film. Usually relegated to period British films, Firth portrays a very handsome man who gets on Jones' nerves. His ability to woo Jones' provides for some very romantic moments. Zellweger and Firth are a great, romantic couple. The fact that they have to work for the relationship only adds to the authenticity of the story.<br /><br />Jones' mum and dad are played by Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent. Each is a very good actor, but their story seems tacked on and irrelevant. It only serves to draw us out of the main story, rather than compliment it.<br /><br />The third act has problems. Primarily, it goes on too long. We already know who Jones' is going to end up with, get to the scene in which it happens. The third act reminded me a bit of the television series 'Moonlighting' and the reason the series drove its viewers mad. The series took forever to get David and Maddie together. 'Diary' takes a long time to reach the inevitable.<br /><br />Overall, Diary, I really enjoyed 'Bridget Jones's Diary' and can't understand this whole 'chick flick' moniker it has received.

0345347951|4.0|Arthur C. Clarke is an exceptional science fiction writer. Childhood's End is a perfect example of Clarke at his best. Childhood's End is a story which relates around these `creatures' that settle above the earth's atmosphere in their space ships. These creatures known as the Overlords have neither exposed their appearances to the humans, nor told humans their purpose for coming to earth. Despite this secrecy, the Overlords have bought security and peace to the world. Along with peace and security, the Overlords brought much technological advancement. However as time passes the human race evolves, the change that occurred was not expected nor could it have been explained. At this point people have one question, was this dubious plan generated by the Overlords?  <br />Throughout the book Clarke creates a suspense that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. Until the Overlord's appearance and the Overlord's motifs are uncovered, anticipation is built up. Throughout the Golden Age section of the book Clarke does a very good job of keeping the reader engaged, by using descriptive language and describing each event as it occurs which constructs a clear image in the reader's mind. Though the book has many positive aspects, it also contains many flaws. Toward the end of the book, Clarke loses his flair for description, and jumps from one event to another without a thorough explanation about what exactly has happened. This fault of Clarke's leaves the reader confused about the ending, and gives an unclear impression of the book's plot. Despite a few errors, Arthur C. Clarke's, Childhood's End is a recommended book to those who like science fiction adventure. <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|\\"Moulin Rouge\\"... \\"Moulin Rouge\\"... \\"Moulin Rouge\\"... I had the distinct pleasure to watch the new film by Baz Luhrmann on Friday night. Why I am I just posting my opinion now? Why didn't I rush to my computer to start spreading the word? I simply couldn't even comprehend writing a single word about the film. I had to think about it. Think about it a lot.<br /><br />For me, a film fanatic, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a glorious experience. It reaffirms my love for movies. It came just in time. After watching two highly anticipated, but really dreadful films (I'm talking about you `The Mummy Returns' and `A Knight's Tale'), after finding out that my two favorite theaters started charging more for fewer bargain matinees, after learning that online movie tickets now carried a surcharge, after watching crap like `Joe Dirt' and `Freddie Got Fingered' clog the multiplexes, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" came just in time. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a film made by a filmmaker at the height of their talents. It is Luhrmann's `Godfather'.<br /><br />I frequently talk about the fact that we have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for any film to work. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" requires you to give yourself over completely. If you do, you will be richly rewarded. If not, you will hate the film.<br /><br />Christian (Ewan McGregor), a naïve British writer, arrives in Paris, 1899. Too idealistic, he wants to live in the shadow of the Moulin Rouge, the famed nightclub, and become a famous writer. Quickly, he meets Henri Toulouse- Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse- Lautrec is trying to put together a play called `Spectacular! Spectacular!' He has two problems. He needs a writer. He needs a backer. He realizes that Christian is the writer after he provides them with the words to a song they are trying to unravel. Christian belts out `The Hills Are Alive... With The Sound of Music'. The backer is Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the Moulin Rouge. To get to Zidler, they try to impress the famous, Satine (Nicole Kidman).<br /><br />From the first frames of the film, Luhrmann thrusts us into a world of make believe. His Paris, 1899, is a place of bright lights, bright ruffles and clouds to dance on. It is remarkable how quickly and completely the director accomplishes this. The film is about a play and never leaves the theater setting or sensibility that it depicts. The first few images are really remarkable and set the tone. Collections of moving daguerreotype pop-up storybook images take us back into time and immerse us in the story.<br /><br />Luhrmann first made his mark with a remarkable Australian import called `Strictly Ballroom'. In \\"Moulin Rouge\\", Luhrmann resurrects the live-action studio musical. This film is a love letter to the Astaire- Rodgers classics, the Gene Kelly classics, and the musicals of the 60s. Unlike many musicals, the songs actually help to advance the story. Also, Luhrmann made the choice to use 20th Century music throughout. Yes, it evokes laughter, but it comes at the recognition of the songs and how well they fit into the story at the time. He is also smart to use snippets of songs, to make his point, and then move on. Occasionally, he uses the entire song, creating show-stopping numbers that I will remember for a long time. I am still constantly thinking about Zidler and the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) singing `Like A Virgin' and the use of `Roxanne' at the beginning of the third act. How often can you say that you think about particular pieces of a film for days afterward?<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are both surprising. McGregor is a very good singer. Both actors did their own singing, but McGregor is the real standout of the tow. His voice has a lot of range and uses his songs to build a real chemistry with Kidman. I can honestly say that I have found Kidman to be a very overrated actress. In \\"Moulin Rouge\\", she is terrific. Funny, sexy, dramatic, it works. The story is an old one, done hundreds of times, but these performers make the story fresh by providing a much needed chemistry. Christian seduces Satine by singing her a love song, a collection of love song titles, in one of the most erotic sequences I have ever seen.<br /><br />Jim Broadbent is simply terrific. His performance made me think of Joel Grey's in `Cabaret'. This is only because their characters serve the same function in the nightclub setting. Zidler is the owner of the Moulin Rouge, but also a ham and therefore the Master of Ceremonies and frequent star. His character is very complex and he makes it thrilling to watch Zidler switch back and forth, using knowledge as a weapon.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film? John Leguizamo's Toulouse- Lautrec becomes a member of the buffoon Greek Chorus meant to provide comic relief. His part is not integrated very well and he is never shown painting. Instead, he stumbles around trying to put on a play? He also talks with a very strange accent.<br /><br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" is an outstanding film, filled with an exhausting energy. The camera never stops moving, careening over frilly, brightly ruffled costumes and intricately designed sets and stages.<br /><br />It is also the type of film that must be viewed of the big screen. There is so much texture, so much color, no television can do it justice.<br /><br />An amazing film.ese performers make the story fresh by providing a much needed chemistry.

0345347951|2.0|Being a 10th grade student I have read many books. I am not really a big fan of science fiction books as I only have read two. The book \\"Childhood's End\\" written by Arthur C. Clarke is \\"one of the goods books that science fiction has got to offer\\" as quoted by the reviewers. I totally disagree with this statement. Arthur C Clarke had a good idea about the future that humans were progressing towards. But in my opinion he couldn't explain it well enough.    <br /> The book begins in the twenty first century, where man is ready to explore the stars. As big silver ships owned by the Overlords (aliens) position themselves over every major city. They force the nations to live in peace and thus they create a utopia, but at what price? There was an uncertain future ahead which man can't imagine in there wildest dreams. Childhood's End had a great idea to show but it wasn't concluded well enough. The novel had a disappointing end to a great start. I felt as if I was trying to solve a puzzle rather than reading a novel. In my opinion it was a disappointing novel from a great author like Arthur C. Clarke.                      <br />
B00005T30L|4.0|Enid and Rebecca (Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school. Part of the anti-social crowd, they hate just about everything and make fun of everything else. Enid seems happy enough to live this way for the rest of her life, but Rebecca soon gets a job and starts looking for an apartment in earnest. Enid becomes fascinated with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a rare record collector, that they set-up on a false blind date. She genuinely likes Seymour and they become friends. As Enid and Seymour become closer, Rebecca moves towards a more normal, middle-class life.<br /><br />\\"Ghost World\\", directed by Terry Zwigoff (\\"Crumb\\") and written by Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes have created a really wonderful comic film. Clowes and Zwigoff have adapted Clowes graphic novel of the same name into a film that is original, funny and very memorable.<br /><br />Thora Birch (\\"American Beauty\\") is Enid, an 18 year old high school graduate who is floundering a bit now that she doesn't have the security of high school. As much as she hated it, it provided structure. Now she seems to be working overtime to find things to amuse her. Slightly chunky, wearing dark mismatched clothes, Birch accurately channels the spirit of a dissatisfied teenager. Scarlet Johansson is also very good as the second half of this relationship. More willing to adapt to the outside world, she is sort of the flipside of this record. A bit off the wall, but also more mainstream. The situations that they become involved in seem completely natural. It just seems natural for Enid to buy a leather cat woman mask at an adult book store. It just seems natural for Enid to wear the same mask proudly on the street.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi is brilliant as Seymour. Seymour is the type of guy who has let life pass him by. Forty something and still living with a roommate, he seems to covet his rare records than he does a relationship, causing him to be awkward and tentative when confronted by women.<br /><br />Illeana Douglas is also memorable as the summer school art teacher, the perfect embodiment of an artist who is struggling to make ends meet. It could be a caricature, but I have seen people like this in real life, and she captures it perfectly.<br /><br />Zwigoff has a decidedly offbeat sense of humor. His film is intelligent, thoughtful and very funny. The differences between this film and any mainstream studio effort at comedy (i.e., `American Pie', `Rush Hour 2') is that the comedy comes from natural situations, believable situations, which makes the comedy seem more real, more memorable and more funny.<br /><br />\\"Ghost World\\" is a great film and will most likely be on my list of best films of the year.n.  <br /> <br />Illeana Douglas is also memorable as the summer school art teacher, the perfect embodiment of an artist who is struggling to make ends meet.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|Over the period of a week, I was able to see two very different film biographies of two very different people. However, only one of the two films actually accomplishes what it wants to; \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" shows us why John Nash was different from the rest of us and why we should care about him or his life.<br /><br />John Nash (Russell Crowe), a promising, young mathematician, enters Princeton in the late 40s, ready to come up with a brilliant, original idea. He is so focused in this quest that he forsakes all of his courses and studies, constantly working out mathematical theories and formulas. He is shocked when his advisor (Judd Hirsch), tells him that based on his current level of work, he is not suitable for placement with any firm upon graduation. This causes Nash to work overtime and he finally comes up with an idea and writes a paper about this. Presenting the paper to his advisor, he is promptly scooped up by the Wheeler Institute at MIT. The institute provides him with a place to work, a staff, and the freedom to study but it does expect him to teach a few classes. In one of these classes, a female student, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) catches his eye. They date and eventually marry. Soon, John is approached by William Parcher (Ed Harris), a member of a very secret government organization. William wants Nash to work for him and break codes. Nash begins this work with his usual zeal. Soon, Alicia realizes that John may be losing his grip on reality.<br /><br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\", directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, from the book by Sylvia Nasar, is a very good, well-done film biography. Unlike the recent \\"Iris\\", Howard works small miracles to paint a picture of a brilliant, but troubled man.<br /><br />Nash is a brilliant mathematician and a Nobel Prize winner, but there are many Nobel Prize winners. Why make a film about this man? I'll get to that in a minute, but first we should discuss the math part of his personality. I think most studios would throw any film director out on their but if they presented an idea about making a film about a mathematician, but Howard found perhaps the one man, at the right time, who would interest any studio. He cast Russell Crowe, fresh off of his success in \\"Gladiator\\" and his Academy Award, as Nash. Crowe is red-hot at the moment, so his presence virtually guarantees a certain amount of tickets sold. Even if the film were terrible. Thankfully, the film is very good. Both Howard and Crowe do brilliant things to paint a portrait of a mathematician. Crowe works frantically through the math problems, displaying a zest for this type of work that Nash surely has. When confronted with personal relationships, Nash has a lot of trouble communicating and this is illustrated beautifully in a couple of brief interactions with people around him. When working on math problems, Howard uses filmmaking techniques to illustrate the thought processes Nash uses. Many filmmakers would have a tendency to use tons of special effects and bring the problems out of the story, but Howard uses a very skilled approach. For instance, Nash envisions the problem that he will eventually solve using figures at a local pub. Howard barely highlights the figures and moves them around a little, presenting them as Nash must have viewed them. It really is a brilliant method and works beautifully.<br /><br />Watching the previews for \\"Mind\\", I had a lot of reservations about Crowe's accent. I couldn't place where it was from and initially had some trouble accepting it in the beginning of the film. But Crowe does such a great job of making the character his own, that I am willing to overlook the less than perfect Southern accent. Crowe moves as Nash must, a man who is unsure about his surroundings, moving in a slow amble, his arms pulled in to ward off the attackers. I really felt that Crowe, a tall, well-built Australian man was the good-looking but tentative Nash. As Nash ages throughout the film, the make-up used convinces the audience that Crowe has aged as well. It really is an interesting sight to see Crowe convincingly become a senior citizen. As often happens with the Academy Awards, actors are awarded for performances in films that are not worthy, only to have worthy performances overlooked. I think this is going to be the case with Crowe.<br /><br />The film is really a showcase for two people. Crowe and Howard. Howard does some of his best work in this film. As the story unfolds, things begin to happen in the film which don't seem all that remarkable, simply a piece of the fabric of Nash's life, but as the story unfolds, Howard slowly lets us in on the secret, a secret which is backed up by all of the previous information. As Nash begins working for Parcher, during the Cold War, the film takes a bit of a turn into a spy film as spies battle for the information Nash is working on. The characters and the settings become almost animated and strange. But this is a brilliant method of painting what Nash sees and feels. The film is told through Nash's viewpoint, so any variation or change in the story eventually leads back to Nash and his condition or feelings at the time.<br /><br />Because the film focuses so much time on Nash, other characters are not as fully developed. Alicia, Nash's wife, is well played by Jennifer Connelly. Her character gives Nash a lot of emotional support and lives through some very trying times. But other characters, such as Parcher and Nash's roommate at college are given a lot of screen time, but don't really develop. Where did Nash's roommate come from? What is his story? Why is Parcher so gung-ho about fighting the spies? I realize that the answer to my questions are tied into the subject matter of the film, but I still think a little more background on these characters would have made the film even more rich and outstanding.<br /><br />Small complaints aside, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is one of the best films I have seen this year. As I left the theater, I walked right into the neighboring Brentano's and purchased the book the film is based on. Because I wanted to know even more about this amazing person. I don't think any higher compliment can be paid to a film biography.ilm, the make-up used convinces the audience that Crowe has aged as well.

B0007GAERG|5.0|I am not the biggest Mariah fan.  Over the years, some of her songs I enjoyed, but I can't say she overwhelmed me.  I must say, that has changed.  Mariah sounds wonderful on this cd.  Her voice is crisp, vibrant and there is just an energy and joy in her music.  I notice a lot of people seem to like certain songs,but for me Joyride and Fly Like a Bird lift my spirits.  I hope that anyone that enjoys good music will buy this cd and just let it put a smile on your face.
B0000640SB|4.0|I had the opportunity to watch the new collector's edition of \\"MIB' the other night. What a great DVD with a lot of neat extras.<br /><br />Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner Dee (Richard Hamilton) are two of the Men In Black, an elite force of men in a secret institution that are charged with \\"Protecting the Earth From The Scum of The Universe\\". Dee is unable to stop an alien from attacking, requiring Kay to blow it to bits. Dee wants out of the business. Kay needs to find a new partner. James Darrel Edwards III (Will Smith), a NYPD detective, is the best candidate. Kay sees something in him. Zed (Rip Torn), the director of the division, agrees to let Kay recruit Jay (Smith), despite his misgivings. Almost immediately, the Earth is threatened by an alien force that wants to prevent another galaxy from falling into the hands of Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), a hick farmer that has been killed by an alien. The alien, a roach like creature is using Edgar's skin as a disguise. Edgar is searching for the galaxy. The Men In Black must stop him, or the other alien race will destroy the Earth.<br /><br />\\"Men In Black\\" is a quintessential summer film, a film that works in so many ways. Released in July, 1997, the film cemented Will Smith's stardom. Smith is very good. He plays Jay in a somewhat somber way, cracking jokes, but in a more refined manner than we had seen him do to this point. He is actually trying for a character here and he succeeds. Tommy Lee Jones is just perfect as his partner, the aging, wiser mentor of the couple. Jones has many funny moments, allowing his dead pan persona to help define his character.<br /><br />The film is also aided immeasurably by it's brevity. So many films like this run in excess of two hours because they spend so much time establishing the characters and then telling a story. \\"MIB\\" does all of this in 98 minutes, moving along at a brisk pace, keeping us occupied and interested.<br /><br />Two of my favorite scenes both showcase Tommy Lee Jones. The first is the tunnel sequence. The Ford LTD that Jones drives zooms through the Holland tunnel aws Jones sings along to Elvis Presley. The catch? The car is riding on the roof, Jones is singing along merrily as Smith is frantically trying to get seated. The second is a scene in which Jones interrogates an alien that has disguised himself as a little dog. Jones is shaking the dog, trying to get information out of the alien. Very funny. Smith is also very good, perhaps best in the audition sequence. His character is participating reluctantly in the audition, trying to fill out a test with a pencil that breaks, no where to write. Very funny.<br /><br />The DVD presents a great print of the film, very clear and crisp, available in widescreen (yeah!) and pan and scan (boo!). It was a joy to watch the film again, so quickly transported into the world that director Barry Sonnenfeld creates along with the writer, Ed Solomon.<br /><br />The 2 DVD set has a second DVD with a lot of extras, perhaps the most interesting of which is a 'scene editing workshop'. I only had time to try one of the three options. This option presented three different takes of three different parts of the scene. You can preview each take, select one and then move on to the next segment. After you have selected one scene for each bit, you can play them back as you have edited them. Then you can compare them to the film.<br /><br />The second neatest feature is the 'special effects deconstruction'. Two segments are presented and you are allowed to view five different aspects of it, switching back and forth as you watch it. The first aspect is the original storyboards, then a blue screen strip, followed by a composite and so on. This allows the viewer to watch, in an abbreviated fashion, the process of creating these sequences. A lot of fun and a lot of information.<br /><br />There are also a lot of production photos, including a large segment of photos taken at ILM as some sequences were created.<br /><br />There are also the requisite trailers, talent files and commentaries.<br /><br />Interestingly, there is a teaser trailer for \\"MIBII\\", which doesn't reveal anything at all for the simple fact that they can't. The film has been delayed due to budget constraints and other problems.<br /><br />A great DVD.

B00005QDW1|5.0|When No Doubt first blasted onto the music charts in 1996 for \\"Don't Speak\\" everyone thought that..there was something different. Was it the edgy blonde lead singer? The quirky lyrics? The fact that it all came together? Who knew! All anyone knew for sure that they were a success, off of their originality and spark. But after a while, the creek is sure to run dry, so they say, which is why, after a steady pause in their careers after the \\"Return Of Saturn\\" (2000) sucess faded, everyone thought that the time was up. But that was not so.  <br /> <br />With \\"Rock Steady\\" No Doubt breaks out of their element, with reggae and hip hop, but comes back to their natural element, garage band creativity. Their original lyrics are still steady and fresh, with their little quirks here and there. The tunes keep getting better and better, and the more you listen, the catchier it gets. On \\"Underneath it all\\" a track supposedly about lead singer Gwen Stefani's relationship with Gavin Rossdale, blends swift keyboarding and funky beats with lyrics that no one else could think of (you used up all your coupons/ and all you've got left is me)mixed with delicious jamican dance hall (sing by Lady Saw). <br /> <br /> \\"Hey Baby\\" and \\"Hella Good\\" struck gold with their insane HOOKS. They both soured up the indivuidal song charts, flew out into the radios, TVS, and minds everywhere. Despite their immediate success with those three songs, every other song on the album was a gem too. \\"Making Out\\" is fun and feisty, with zaney background music that will get you dancing. \\"Detective\\" seemed almost as if the band were exploring  and singing and playing in a different music world then they were accoustumed to, while still being able to recognize it, *snap*, like that. <br />\\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"Running\\" sound like they could be fresh chops from \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" (a good thing, considering their success on that album).  \\"Platinum Blond Life\\" is totally edgy, with the kind of melodies and lyrics that make your body pump and your mind race, as does \\"In My Head\\" which also seems to serenade TK but with a fresh state of mind, (EVERYBODY WANTS, EVERYBODY ELSE, AND EVERYBODY WANTS, EVERYBODY ELSE) while still proclaiming that they are in fact the same wacky people who came up with the topic of realationship mental custody, and putting your life in prospective (I try to think about rainbows/ when it gets bad/ you've got to think about something, to keep from going mad/ i try to/ think about big fat roses/ when the ships starts going down/ but my head is wicked jealous/ don't wanna talk about it right now!). All in all \\"Rock Steady\\" is new and yet old, very fresh, and still INSANELY GOOD. I am going nuts for this album, and I think you will too.
B0000640VO|5.0|\\"Amelie\\", a French film from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (\\"Delicatessen\\", \\"City of Lost Children\\") is a fairy tale confection that is sure to please most everyone who has the opportunity to watch it.<br /><br />Amelie (Audrey Tautou), a young waitress living in Montmarte, happens to find a small box of toys behind a loose tile in her bathroom. She decides to anonymously reunite the toys with their owner, now a man in his late 40s. After she tracks him down, she leaves the box in a phone booth that he passes every day. As he passes, she calls the booth causing him to stop and find the box. Amelie stops at a local bar and the man also stops there, talking about the curious events of the day. He proclaims that he will call his daughter and grandson, because he hasn't talked to his daughter in many years. Gratified, Amelie begins to do small anonymous favors for the people in her life. Her path crosses with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a strange young man who collects discarded photo booth pictures. She is attracted to him, but completely unable to introduce herself.<br /><br />I think it would be difficult for anyone to dislike \\"Amelie\\". The story is so uplifting, the lead actress is so enormously appealing and likable, the supporting cast is so excellent, the production qualities are completely top notch.<br /><br />Jeunet has crafted a vision of Montmarte and Paris that is idyllic, picture book perfect, causing many intellectuals in France to denounce the film. In my opinion, these people are trying to find fault with the film because it is so good. They are jealous. This is a lovable confection for all ages. I'll address the all ages thing later.<br /><br />The film is washed in a sepia tint giving each frame the appearance of an old photograph. Set in 1997, the settings look like they were pulled from the 40s. With the exception of a modern video camera, pretty much the entire film is devoid of modern technology. None of the characters drive cars and only one of them uses a small motor bike to get around. This lack of technology only serves to make the film appear even more like a fairy tale.<br /><br />Amelie and her friends inhabit a Paris that is also extremely clean. No graffiti and little dirt appear in any frame as she travels to and fro. This helps attain and retain the idealized vision of life that in turn helps the viewer live inside this fairy tale.<br /><br />Amelie, as played by Audrey Tautou, is so kind, friendly and infectious that it is difficult not to like her. Tautou could pass as Audrey Hepburn's love child, the resemblance is so striking. She is a young woman that realizes she has a gift for helping people anonymously. With this realization, it becomes her reason for life. Amelie is a strange girl, quiet but pretty, unconfident with strangers but also looking for a relationship. She grew up in a strange family environment, which helps explain some of her behavior. This family history is amusingly, and quickly, presented by Jeunet at the beginning of the film. Audrey Tautou is very charming in this role and this film. I inadvertently watched a DVD of \\"French Beauty Institute\\" the same night. Tautou has a supporting role in the film, but barely makes an impact. Hopefully, she will be able to find the type of roles that will ensure a long and healthy career.<br /><br />The overall message of \\"Amelie\\" is so uplifting that it raised my spirits all day. Much like the disastrous American film \\"Pay It Forward\\", the film has a message that if we help strangers, our world will be a better place. The difference in the story between the two films is that \\"Amelie\\" does not rely on preachy storytelling or character martyrdom to get the message across. Amelie does her thing and the consequences happen, causing us to laugh and learn from her example.<br /><br />Another wonderful thing about the film is that not all of the consequences of her good deeds last for very long. Despite the fairy tale aspect of the film, this helpsit seem more real and gives the message more resonance.<br /><br />I would think that \\"Amelie\\" would be a perfect film to take the entire family to, but there are a few things to be aware of. The film is subtitled, which will prevent the youngest kids from understanding it. Also, there are a few very brief images of nudity in a sexual situation. Two scenes are set in a sex shop and the characters price sex toys before displaying them, but they don't discuss them at all or put them into the context of what they are supposed to do. These few things will probably keep parents from taking children, but, in my view, that is a mistake. If they can read subtitles, they should see \\"Amelie\\". The film is great for everyone and should eventually be experienced by everyone. Wouldn't it be better for your child to see a film about a girl who does good deeds than some violent action film at every mutliplex?<br /><br />\\"Amelie\\" apparently caused quite a sensation in France. It is now the top grossing film in that country and has inspired people to do little good deeds for strangers. I have even heard that a tour company is offering a tour of the sights used in the film.<br /><br />Hopefully, \\"Amelie\\" will catch on here in the U.S. as well.of the film, this helps it seem more real and gives the message more resonance.  <br /> <br />I would think that \\"Amelie\\" would be a perfect film to take the entire family to, but there are a few things to be aware of.

B000001FS3|5.0|Let me add my voice to the hundreds that believe this is a classic album.<br /><br />Without one iota of hyperbole, this is one of the greatest albums of the last thirty years.<br /><br />There hasn't been an album as breathtakingly cinematic since \\"Born To Run.\\"<br /><br />It is an album where skipping a song truly lessens the experience.<br /><br />In their catalog, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is where the U2 sound crystallizes. The first album was filled with ambition and experimentation. The second plagued with doubt and so meanders. The third was gloriously proud and defiant. The fourth, \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", was where it began to come together.<br /><br />Here...it's perfect. Each song is exquisitely crafted, yet clearly belonging to a whole greater than the sum of its' parts.<br /><br />\\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" begins with that orchestra-pit crescendo, and opens into a sweeping anthem. It soars; it acts as the introduction to an epic.<br /><br />\\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" continues in that vein, beginning low, ending in a joyous soulful high.<br /><br />\\"With or Without You\\" is introspection on a grand scale. It has a restraint that literally breaks free as it ends...you can hear Bono's voice elevate to a higher plane.<br /><br />Very few albums open with three time-tested classics...and the key to the three is Adam Clayton's subtle yet powerful bass lines. They're the frames the songs are draped across.<br /><br />\\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" used to bother me...until I saw it live. Then, I got it.

B00003CXZ4|4.0|As I left the theater, my mind clouded with all of the images and story of the film, I realized that I had seen a great addition to the film noir canon. I pass the line of people waiting for the next showing.<br /><br />The film ends and the lights come up. Wow! Wow spelled backwards is still Wow! I get up and leave the packed independent theater.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of good things about \\"Memento\\", the new noir film from writer - director Christopher Nolan, and I am not disappointed. Movies like \\"Memento\\" are perhaps the hardest to write about. I have to be careful to not give away anything. Anything at all. If I do, I will rob a moviegoer of a potential surprise.<br /><br />Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is in the middle of a mystery. He is trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Gorga Fox). Leonard has a problem that further complicates this mission. The trauma of his wife's death has robbed him of any short-term memory. He can remember who his wife is, how to drive a car, etc., but anything that occurs to create a new memory will be forgotten. Leonard must rely on notes, tattoos on his body and Polaroids of his friends, enemies, places he lives, etc. He can't talk to people for very long, because he will ultimately forget who they are. He can't talk to people on the phone, because he has to see their eyes, a skill he learned as a former insurance investigator. During his investigation, he meets Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), two people that may or may not be his allies.<br /><br />If \\"Memento\\" were laid out in a typical chronological fashion, it would be an interesting film with some good performances. Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, decided to tell the film backwards. The first indication of this is the first shot of a Polaroid undeveloping. We see a picture of a man's body in the corner of a deserted room. The hand holding the photo shakes it a few times, it becomes lighter. Shakes it a few more times, and so on, until the picture pops out of the camera. We then see the climax of the film first, shocking us into the film's different reality. As the film rewinds, we see Leonard slowly unraveling the mystery that leads up to the climax and the detours that he takes along the way. Each segment of the story is just a few minutes in length, the length of Leonard's memory. This helps the audience really feel for Leonard's plight. We essentially have the same problem Leonard does. We don't know what happened before, so everything is new to us, just as it is to Leonard. This construction is really brilliant and it is a testament to the skill of Nolan that the film does not seem as gimmicky as I just described it. We quickly buy into the world he has created and it seems natural.<br /><br />To provide a break from the rewinding story, Nolan inserts an ongoing telephone conversation between Leonard and an unseen caller between each of the short segments. In chronological fashion, Leonard recounts the story of his most important case as an insurance investigator, the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with a very similar case of short-term memory loss, and his wife, Mrs. Jankis (Harriet Sansom Harris). The story of Sammy Jankis provides a very human aspect to the story and allows us to see Leonard as a normal human being. The story also helps us to understand Leonard's plight.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is simply phenomenal. In each brief segment, he has to start each by figuring our what is going on, trying to figure out if the people around him are helping him or should be avoided. It doesn't sound like the character would allow a lot of time for development or allow the audience time to identify with him, but Pearce makes it happen. Because he is used to the problem, he knows to act quickly. He makes the character work hard throughout to find the source of the mystery. The scenes when he is on the telephone, recounting the story of Sammy Jankis also help to humanize the character. Much of the flashbacks present a different Leonard, providing a nice counterpoint.<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss is very good as the required Noir femme fatale. She has a simply amazing couple of scenes in the middle of the film during which we quickly see who she is, what her role is and how deeply Leonard's problem affects him. She is a very strong character. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, Leonard's ally. Leonard plays along with Teddy despite the Polaroid in his pocket labeling Teddy a liar. Teddy is a very complex character who likes to talk and he talks a lot. During his many conversations, he also takes advantage of Leonard's problem.<br /><br />\\"Memento\\" is a very memorable film, sure to delight you with its twists and turns.<br /><br />The house lights go down as the last minute stragglers try to find seats.<br /><br />I read the newspaper, waiting for the film to start.<br /><br />I buy my ticket very early. I know from the buzz that I need to buy my ticket early. A lot of people will want to see the film tonight.<br /><br />I do not mind paying full price for my ticket. Everything I have heard leads me to believe that I will enjoy the film immensely.lp to humanize the character.

B00012L786|1.0|If you're a big fan of film noir you might enjoy the camera angles, picture and sound.  Personally I was disappointed in the story.   <br /> <br />I heard a review and thought it sounded like a great idea for a story.  A guy on a train steals a woman's purse on a subway, not knowing that she's carrying microfilm which she's supposed to deliver to a Russian spy.  Suddenly, this thief has the cops and the Russians looking for him. <br /> <br />It sounded like a great idea, but the story was a huge disappointment to me.  The characters were not very believable.  For example, the woman who has her purse stolen, tracks down the thief and tries to get the film back.  He punches her in the face and she falls in love with him.   <br /> <br />To me the story was very weak, which spoiled the movie.  If you're interested in the movie for the technical stuff, you might enjoy it.  Personally, I didn't find it very entertaining or believable.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|All summer, as I experienced one dreadful film after another, I developed a mantra to get me through. \\"New films by Scorcese, Mann, Darabont, Crowe and the \\"Rushmore\\" guys are due before the end of the year. How bad could the year be?\\" Well, Miramax, in their infinite wisdom, delayed Scorcese's \\"Gangs of New York\\". Apparently, they were concerned about the public's reaction to a film set in 19th Century New York after the attacks of September 11. Presumably, they are using the extra time to use computers to erase any shots of the World Trade Center. That left four films to anticipate and hope for. A 50% batting average is pretty bad. \\"The Royal Tennenbaums\\" is a great film. \\"The Majestic\\" is a very good film. Hmmm. That leaves the Cameron Crowe and Michael Mann films. Both filmmakers have created some of my favorite films of all time. So it is extremely disappointing to have the experience of watching Mann's \\"Ali\\", starring Will Smith.<br /><br />\\"Ali\\" tells the story of Muhammad Ali (Will Smith) from 1964 until the famous Rumble In The Jungle. It seems to be a faithful visual recreation of the important events, but this is merely the frosting on the cake. What we don't get is the cake. The poster tagline is \\"Forget everything you know\\". Well, I don't know that much about his life, but I knew most of what was depicted. What wasn't depicted very successfully was `Why?'. The area the film depicts very well is Ali's struggle with religion. A brief flashback depicts his mixed feelings about his father's (Giancarlo Esposito) religion. This coupled with his feelings about race and the struggle of the African American man leads him to Malcolm X (Mario Van Pebbles) and the Muslim religion. Some of the film depicts their relationship, but then Ali seems to make a very conscious decision, yet the decision isn't depicted or explained. During the course of the film, Ali falls in love with three women, yet the moment when each relationship ends is not explained very well or very carefully. Most of the relationships in the film are handled in a fairly short-handed manner. We find out how they met, but the end of the relationship is left in the dark. Other relationships are just there and we really don't get an idea of how they met Ali or why the relationship continues. For instance, Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) is his trainer throughout the course of the story, but why? Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright), a photographer, appears to be at every event depicted in the film, snapping photographs. Each of these characters is really flat. Neither is developed and only seems to serve as background. Drew \\"Bundini\\" Brown (Jamie Foxx) appears to have been Ali's main supporter during his rise, yet, again, I have to ask `Why?' All of these questions are all the more shocking when you consider the filmmaker. Michael Mann directed \\"Heat\\", a great crime epic, starring DeNiro and Pacino. In \\"Heat\\" every single supporting character had a backstory which was explored, giving the film a rich texture.<br /><br />Will Smith clearly spent a lot of time and effort trying to develop his performance as Ali and he does a good job. He is emotional, bombastic, intelligent and motivated. All qualities that I would imagine the real Ali has in spades. But without the direction and the story to complement him, the performance lacks a large element. Why is he like this? What made him like this? We don't ever really find out. A little bit about his life is revealed in his relationship with Malcolm X and the Muslim religion, a little of his struggle with the US and his draft notice. What is lacking is any of the motivation behind his training and his rise to the top.<br /><br />Technically, the film is very good. The film opens with a montage depicting Ali training at the gym as he remembers two key moments in his life. The editing work is good and reveals some of the depth of his character. As the film progresses, the shaky handheld camera work used so consistentlybecomes annoying and detracts from the film. Meant to evoke a documentary, it robs the film of grandeur and style.<br /><br />Most annoyingly, we really learn nothing about what made Ali a great athlete. We don't see how he trained differently, how he fought differently, anything.<br /><br />\\"Ali\\" really is a disappointing film that did little to illuminate the life of a great athlete.sistently becomes annoying and detracts from the film.

B0007YEKZU|4.0|Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.<br /><br />\\"Kung Fu Hustle\\", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? \\"Hustle\\" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.<br /><br />The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.<br /><br />When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.<br /><br />The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.<br /><br />All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In \\"Hustle\\", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.of Pig Sty Alley.

B0007GAERG|5.0|I was at best buy and saw the cd and I was like what the hell I'll get it. When I heard each song i was very impressed. This is the old Mariah that I remember from back in the day with her strong vocals on her ballads and not the whispery Mariah from Charmbracelet. If you are a Mariah fan you should check out this cd. I was really diggin It's Like That, Shake It Off, Say Somethin', Get your Number, One and Only, To the Floor.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is entering a tomb, trying to get to a jewel placed on a pedestal. As she makes her way towards the jewel, a large metal creature unsurfaces and she has to fight it to the death. After she does disable the creature, she retrieves the jewel which is actually a computer chip containing 'Lara's Party Mix', which she plays on the sound system in her mansion. The tomb was actually a training room built in her large English mansion. Soon, Lara discovers a clock hidden under a staircase by her deceased father (Jon Voight, Jolie's real father). The clock started ticking exactly one week before a complete solar eclipse is scheduled to happen. Inside the clock, she finds a dial, which when combined with a mythical triangle (which has, incidentally, been broken in half), gives the holder power over time. The holder can move back and forth within history, changing things. Naturally, a mysterious society, the Illuminata, headquartered in Venice, Italy, wants the device and hires Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) to retrieve it. Manfred hires Alex Marrs (Daniel Craig), Croft's former nemesis and fellow Tomb Raider to help him. Lara can't let the Illuminata gain control of the device.<br /><br />\\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" is the latest example of why Hollywood should not adapt video games into films. No more successful than \\"Super Mario Brothers\\", \\"Tomb Raider\\" will probably gross more than $100 million dollars because it caters so brilliantly to the pre-teen boy audience that loves the video game.<br /><br />The film is filled with action set pieces, which look incredibly like set pieces. Each of the scenes is shot on a set. Each begins with the characters entering a room, tomb, cave, etc. and then, voila, they start fighting something, someone, each other. This creates a very claustrophobic feel which does not translate well to the big screen.<br /><br />The film was reportedly shot on location in Greenland and a sacred temple in Thailand (?). If this is the case, the filmmakers did a very bad job of taking advantage of the natural scenery.<br /><br />Jolie certainly fits the physical description of Lara Croft. She has the same voluptuous curves that the video game vixen uses to make grown men addicts of her adventures. I have never played the video game, so I am unsure whether Lara Croft is supposed to look so bored throughout. Jolie smirks and does little else to make the character seem believable. It appears as though the vial of Billy Bob's blood that she reportedly carries around her neck was missing most days when she shot her part. Where would they hide it? Jolie wears a series of skin tight t-shirts and short-shorts to reveal all of her assets.<br /><br />It was no suprise to see that the filmmaker's managed to include a shower scene. After all, Croft is an archaeologist and needs to be squeaky clean for all of that roughhousing. I only wish they had managed to get a couple of shower scenes into the Indiana Jones films. NOT. As the film is PG, they only show Jolie from the neck up. Boy that water cascading down her hair and lips and neck looks sexy. Strangely, a little later in the film, Alex Marrs gets equal treatment. His shower scene is virtually identical to Croft's. Thank goodness for equal opportunity. I'm sure all of the little 12 year old boys in the audience will love to see a half naked man showering and then walking around his hotel room.<br /><br />The other big problem with \\"Tomb Raider\\" is that we never actually see Croft engaging in any archaeology or tomb raiding, until the climax. Why is she so famous? What special skills does she have? Apparently, she can jump around on bungee cords and kill metal beasts quite well, but what about archaeology draws her into it? Apparently, nothing.<br /><br />Oh, wait, there is another big problem. After the device is assembled (big surprise, I'm sure), Croft is told that she can't use it for a personal reason and then does any way. Huh? I wasn't even aware that she liked the person she uses it for.<br /><br />Oh, oh, another problem... Oh, enough. \\"Tomb Raider\\" is a sloppy mess of an excuse for filmmaking. Will certainly join \\"Pearl Harbor\\" as one of the worst films of the summer if not the year.wasn't even aware that she liked the person she uses it for.  <br /> <br />Oh, oh, another problem...

B0002VKZL6|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of Mark Knopfler's best solo recordings.  I rank it right up there with Golden Heart and Sailing To Philadelphia.  There isn't a weak track on the CD, and \\"5:15 a.m.\\" is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best songs he has ever done, including his Dire Straits material.  To compare his solo material to his Dire Straits material is silly.  Mark Knopfler WAS Dire Straits.  He is one of the greatest singer/songwriter/guitarists of all time, bar none.  If you yearn for the harder stuff, then by all means listen to Brothers in Arms, Communique, Love Over Gold, etc.!  They are all fantastic!  And for those reviewers who think that Mark Knopfler can't rock anymore, I must inform you that you are sadly mistaken.  I saw him in concert last night in Munich, Germany, and he was incredible.  He played many Dire Straits songs as well as his solo material, and he closed the show with \\"Going Home\\", a beautiful instrumental from the Local Hero soundtrack.  Yes, he does soundtracks, too!  Check out Local Hero and Cal, you won't be disappointed.  Mark's music is a major part of the soundtrack of my life.  I can't imagine life without it.  Thanks, Mark, for your music.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|Yes, I know. Its sad that I would devote so much thought to a thoroughly forgettable film.<br /><br />Jerry Bruckheimer makes a certain kind of film. He makes films that are widely seen because they are the equivalent of an 'easy read'. People go to his films because they want to see a bunch of people break into Alcatraz or because they want to see a bunch of convicts save a plane or destroy an asteroid before it hits Earth. They are loud, slickly produced films full of explosions and action. They ARE the Summer Film. Most of these films are enjoyable in a rudimentary sort of way. It is the truly memorable films of summer that go beyond these formulas. Unfortunately, \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" doesn't even live up to the Bruckheimer standards.<br /><br />I have some questions about the film, well, 60 questions, and some thoughts about each of the questions.<br /><br />1. Why was the movie made?<br /><br />When a production company becomes as big, as well-known, and as important to the studio footing the bill, as Bruckheimer's company is to Disney, they have to produce films on a regular basis just to keep the cash coming in. I am sure that everyone involved anticipated that this film would be a huge hit, causing buckets of cash to fall from the sky.<br /><br />2. Why did Academy Award winner Nicholas Cage make this movie?<br /><br />3. Why did Academy Award winner Anjelina Jolie make this movie?<br /><br />4. Why did Academy Award winner Robert Duval make this movie?<br /><br />It's the cash, stupid. Cage makes about $20 million per picture. Jolie and Duval probably made a mint as well. They've got mortgages just like everyone else.<br /><br />5. Why is Cage's character called 'Memphis' when he is from Long Beach, CA?<br /><br />6. Why is Jolie's character called 'Sway'?<br /><br />7. Why is Vinnie Jone's character called 'Sphinx'?<br /><br />Only the screenwriter, Scott Rosenberg, can answer these questions. The answers certainly aren't in the story. In Rosenberg's last film, 'Con Air', many of the characters had nicknames, but we learned why they had those nicknames. At least Duval's nickname is 'Otto'. That makes sense.<br /><br />8. After his brother, played by Giovanni Ribisi, fumbles a car theft, causing Cage to come out of retirement to save him, why does Cage agree to let Ribisi and his friends join the crew?<br /><br />Their great track record?<br /><br />9. Why is their Cajun music playing over the credits?<br /><br />The main characters are from Long Beach. It makes perfect sense. Of course. Cajun music.<br /><br />10. Why is so much of the daylight action shot with brown filters?<br /><br />It makes the entire film look muddy. Great idea, guys.<br /><br />11. Why is Christopher Eccleston's villain British?<br /><br />Yes, I know the actor is British, but there is no reason for the character to be. Watch the very good, but very depressing 'Jude' or the simply great 'Shallow Grave' to see how good this actor can be. And then, wonder aloud why he decided to appear in this film.<br /><br />12. Why is it so easy for Cage and his crew to steal cars?<br /><br />Most of these scenes are interesting, but not suspenseful. Because they only have difficulty grabbing a small number of the 50 cars, everything appears easy. The suspense is gone.<br /><br />13. Because of #12, the climatic car chase is predictable. Why?<br /><br />Because everything else is so easy, naturally something will go wrong with the last car. There is no suspense anywhere. In the entire film.<br /><br />14. Why is the actual climax so boring?<br /><br />Because it has been done hundreds of times before.<br /><br />15. Why is the only sex scene between Cage and Jolie less erotic than the two lovers that they are watching at the time?<br /><br />It's the chemistry, stupid. There isn't any.<br /><br />16. Why is Delroy Lindo's character driving a Cadillac and then a BMW while undercover?<br /><br />Not exactly standard police issue.<br /><br />17. Why are we introduced to Frances Fisher's character at all?<br /><br />She has literally one line. She also pops up in the background twice.<br /><br />18. Grace Zabriskie played Cage's mother?<br /><br />Yes. At least her one scene had some point in the story.<br /><br />Okay, so I'm not actually going to ask 60 questions about the movie. The movie attempted to live up to about a third of its promise, so I think it is acceptable for me to live up to a third of mine. It promised a lot of car chases, it has two. It promised interesting characters, it has none.<br /><br />If I really went to the trouble of listing 60 questions, and you read them, we are each devoting far too much time to a film that will live up to its title in more ways than one.<br /> <br />17.

The only problem for me are the tracks with Nelly and Shake It Off but the rest is great. Who knows these songs might grown on me.  <br /> <br />My favourites are Stay The Night, We Belong Together, Fly Like A Bird, I Wish You Knew.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this CD.
B00005JKJA|2.0|David Lynch returns to the big screen! If you are a die-hard Lynch fan and have praised every one of his films, you should read no further. If you, like me, have liked some of his films and disliked others, you will probably find some useful information within my review.<br /><br />A voluptuous brunette (Laura Harring) survives a car crash on Mulholland Drive. She stumbles down the hillside and into a vacant department. Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), fresh off the airplane, ready to make it big, is housesitting her aunt's apartment while she is away shooting a film. She finds the woman asleep in the apartment and misstakes her for a friend of her aunt's. The woman has amnesia but decides to call herself Rita because she sees a movie poster for \\"Gilda\\" in the bathroom. Betty decides to help Rita figure out who she is. After Betty wows them at an audition, she quickly leaves to help Rita in her search. The journey begins.<br /><br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" began as a pilot for a proposed television series on ABC (the same network that aired \\"Twin Peaks\\"). After the network rejected it, Lynch went back and shot an additional 30 minutes to tie up the loose ends. The material created for the television pilot is very good. The problems arise with the material designed to `tie up the loose ends'.<br /><br />Lynch has always created films that depicted a strange, alter universe. His best works, \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Twin Peaks\\",combine this strange vision with fully developed characters and an involving story. His worst films, \\"Lost Highway\\" among them, let the strangeness overtake everything else. \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is neither the best or the worst film he has created.<br /><br />Technically, the film is superior to most of the other dreck out in the multiplex. Lynch devotes a lot of attention to detail. Set in modern day Hollywood, everything has a sort of smudgy feel to it, but there are also places that have retained the beauty of Old Hollywood and this beauty shines through.<br /><br />The story follows Betty and Rita as they navigate through the mystery of who Rita actually is. They encounter a number of strange people and the people they encounter also come into contact with even more strange people. For the first 90 minutes or so, all of this is very interesting. But you keep hoping that it will pay off. We meet Coc Lenoix (Ann Miller), the apartment building manager, Vincenzo Castigliane (Dan Hedaya), a `connected' movie producer, Detective Harry McKnight (Robert Forster), Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a young movie director, the Cowboy (Monty Montgomery) and many more.<br /><br />Betty and Rita are the main characters and are in just about every scene of the film. Laura Harring is certainly a beautiful actress and has the body of an old-fashioned screen star, a Rita Hayworth for the modern day, but she is not a very good actress. From what I understand, she has had limited film experience and it shows. Both actresses act too much at times, much like a soap actress might. Rita talks with a slight accent and has a slow, extremely mannered way of speech. Naomi Watts plays Betty as a fresh-off-the-truck wannabee, but it appears as if she is actually just that. In one scene, she mouths \\"I love you\\", to another character, eliciting giggles and laughter from some in the audience.<br /><br />In the first 90 minutes, as we watch the endless parade of supporting characters, it is easy to see that the television series Lynch envisioned would be endlessly fascinating. Unfortunately, the tacked on ending doesn't bother to follow story threads that were created in the previous 90 minutes. Instead of following any story through, Lynch uses the same infuriating story device he used in \\"Lost Highway\\" as a means of tying everything together. I would've been happy if just two characters made any sort of sense. Ultimately, nothing makes sense. Many characters have one scene, never to appear again. Adam Kesher's part of the puzzle seems particularly short. For instance, why does a woman sing \\"Crying\\" in Spanish (I think) and then fall to the stage? It just ends up being a mess.<br /><br />It is also at about the 90 minute mark that Lynch begins using some of the more far-fetched plot devices he has employed in other projects. Alternate realities, magical devices, demons, etc. all get thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Lynch's projects are usually multi-layered stories that involve a little deciphering. In listening to Roger Ebert's review last night, he mentioned that he loved the film because it resembled a series of dreams or nightmares, with characters and events changing with each successive dream. Some scenes that didn't interest the director were cut short, more emphasis was placed on other scenes. This is very true, but I don't feel Lynch was completely successful. Something is missing to make the dreams, nightmares, alternate realities, etc. interesting, believable or enjoyable.<br /><br />I think \\"Mulholland Drive\\", the six or thirteen episode television series, would have been a constant source of discussion among viewers. I think \\"Mulholland Drive\\", the movie needs a tremendous amount of road work to become passable.particularly short.

B00005JNTV|3.0|I have never read Frank Miller's Sin City comics.  I was only vaguely aware of them when I saw the ad for the film.  I just thought that the imagery in the commercial was striking and so I went to a matinee.      I have read in other reviews that the movie is more of a recreation than an adaptation of Miller's comics.  Now, as I have stated, I don't have any first hand knowledge of this particular comic, but I have seen enough comics to know that this is the most faithful and evocative depiction of the comic strip form that I have ever seen on film.  Visually, Sin City is stunning.  It is a comic strip come to life.  The only thing is, this comic is dull.  Not just dull, but dumb.      Miller may have a gift for drawing, but he is no story teller and his prose is heavy-handed.  Sin City is Film Noir because it deals with hard boiled guys and urban settings and violence and underworld themes but it seems to have more in common with low-budget sleaze than with The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep.  Actually, I really like some low-budget sleaze and as a big-budget \\"low-budget sleaze\\" film, this movie is great.  All the men are old and surly.  All the women are barely clothed and are either innocent virgins or callous whores.  The bad guys are really bad and hold all the chips.  The good guy is washed up and cynical and has nothing to lose.  The violence is great,  Thank goodness for the violence.  It's all over the top (think comic book) and fun and there isn't much squirm factor.      This review turned out much more negative than I had planned.  I enjoyed Sin City.  I just had to get used to the idea of absolutely no intelligence and then I settled in and enjoyed the spectacle.  Style can go an awfully long way and Sin City is dripping with it.
B00003CXXP|2.0|\\"AI: Artificial Intelligence\\" is the work of a master filmmaker at the height of his power and also the work of a beginning storyteller, straight out of film school. For \\"AI\\", these two people are one and the same.<br /><br />In the future, the ice caps have melted and drowned many coastal cities around the world. This causes government bodies to enact laws restricting newborn birth, in an effort to save the dwindling resources of the Earth. Because of this, the scientific community continues to create and advance the science of android or meccas. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) creates a little boy mecca that is so advanced that people mistake David (Hayley Joel Osment) for a human. He even has the ability to love. David is adopted by a couple, the Swintons (Sam Robards, Frances O'Connor). The Swintons' real little boy is in a coma and David could provide the love that Monica Swinton is lacking. Things get complicated when the Swintons' little boy comes out of his coma and sibling rivalry develops. Monica can't bring herself to take David back to the laboratory, so she sets him free. David begins his journey for the Blue Fairy, from \\"Pinocchio\\". He is convinced that she will make him a real boy. Along the way, he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), another Mecca.<br /><br />\\"AI: Artificial Intelligence\\" is a film that began with the late filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Somewhere along the line, he asked Steven Spielberg to become involved. Upon Kubrick's death, Spielberg resurrected the idea as a homage to his friend. Spielberg wrote the screenplay and directed the film.<br /><br />\\"AI\\" is simply one of the most outstanding visual feasts ever committed to film. Spielberg has created a concert of images and special effects which, for the most part, bring this future society alive. Future homes are just slightly modern. But future cityscapes on the other hand... Wow. Scenes are set in New York City, after the floods, and I quite honestly felt that Spielberg had filmed in a flooded New York City. The obvious use of CGI has become so advanced that it looks that realistic. The scenes in Rouge City are also very effective: a riot of color, sound and neon. Rouge City, a descendant of Las Vegas gone bad, is flashy and bright, filled with whirling holograms and characters. But it is believable. There is also an extended scene underwater which looks real. Everything looks real. Including the mecca that has her face pulled off. She looks like a human until her face splits in half and reveals a circuit board underneath. Gone are the shaky computer animated aspects of such a creation. Also, the climax, while fairly unbelievable, is also very convincing. Everything is done so well, that we could imagine that this happened, if the story were as effective. Visually, the film is stunning and a true example of a master at work.<br /><br />Hayley Joel Osment further cements his reputation as a great actor. He takes a very difficult role and makes it believable. He brings a lot of subtle nuance to the role of a mecca that wants to be human. Every moment, we get a sense that his character is working things out, trying to figure out how he can become the Swintons' new little boy. Osment doesn't rely on the theatrical gestures that many actors would employ to create the character of a robot. No jerky movements or stilted speech.<br /><br />Jude Law is the other stand out in \\"AI\\". Perfectly cast, Law plays a gigolo mecca, created simply to pleasure others. This is his role in life and colors everything he does and says. He has the looks, the swagger, the bravado to pull the character off.<br /><br />It is fairly important for people to pay attention to the fact that this film was inspired by Kubrick. At times, the ad campaign paints the film as a cross of \\"E.T.\\" and \\"Close Encounters\\". It does have elements of each, but despite the presence of a talking teddy bear throughout most of the film, there are some disturbing un-child friendly scenes.<br /><br />\\"AI\\" fails as an exercise in storytelling. Spielberg pens a screenplay that moves coldly from one scene to the next. Probably conceived as a warning of sorts, the film loses impact because there are no characters in the film that are affected by the warning message. Without giving anything away, I understood that the film wants to warn humans against too much technological advancement. However, there are no humans in the story throughout. The journey is made by the product of our technology. The journey is entirely through his eyes. David also has a different journey, as he searches for the Blue Fairy. This journey takes him through the various stages of our obsession with technology, but doesn't seem to affect him in any way.<br /><br />The film is about thirty minutes too long. Essentially, there is a lengthy epilogue which stretches the imagination far too much. While it is created in a very real way, we have to wonder again why we are taking the journey. Young David doesn't experience what a human would experience. How are we supposed to relate to this message? In the end, I don't think that we do and the message loses power.<br /> <br />\\"AI\\" fails as an exercise in storytelling. Spielberg pens a screenplay that moves coldly from one scene to the next.

B00005JMAH|4.0|Director Cuaron has created a darker cinematic vision that matches J.K. Rowlings own deepening sense of complexity as the series continues.  Here, Harry Potter, after the usual disastrous break living with his aunt and uncle, returns to Hogwarts a much more mature - and volatile - teenager.  Sirius Black, the man rumored to have had a hand in the murder of Harry's parents, has escaped from the famous prison Azkaban, and is said to be after Harry.  The Dementors, terrifying beings (reminiscent of the LOTR Wraiths) that suck the soul of out those who get in their way, are sent to guard the perimeter of Hogwarts, although they also pose a danger to the inhabitants, particularly Harry.  When the new Professor Lupin takes a liking to Harry, Harry begins to put together pieces of his history as well as to realize some of his inherent powers.  With best buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry gathers his strength to face Sirius.<br /><br />In Cuaron's hands, Harry, Hermione, and Ron appear as true teenagers, often dressed in contemporary clothes inside of only their black gowns.  They bicker, goof around, and help cover for one another like true adolescents.  Daniel Radcliffe had grown into his role with authority so that even spunky Emma Watson as Hermione no longer upstages him.  Michael Gambon picks up the role of kindly Dumbledore without flaw.  Perhaps because we've already seen so much explaining Hogwarts, the school is more of a natural setting in this film.  Of course, with any adaptation from book to film, some things have been left out, and others are not adequately explained; however, all in all, this is a competent adaptation which will delight fans.  Even those who haven't read the book will be able to follow the plot.<br /><br />Not recommended for young children, as the Dementors will give them nightmares for a long time, this film should appeal to older elementary school children through adults.  The special effects are seamless enough to whisk viewers into this world of wizards and witches and all the strange creatures that surround them.nd witches and all the strange creatures that surround them.
B00005ASOC|4.0|Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown [in his screen debut]), a high school student living in the Bronx, does all of the right things. He goes to school, he plays basketball and he hides his intelligence. In an effort to be accepted by his friends and colleagues, he receives straight Cs and most of his teachers recognize that he is capable of more. After receiving very high scores on the Statewide standardized exams, his teachers urge him to accept a scholarship at a private school in Manhattan. He goes to check it out and meets Claire (Anna Paquin), his guide for the day. The school is very interested in having him join the basketball team, to help them make it to the championship. Jamal finds that he might be challenged here and decides to attend. Jamal has also just met an old recluse living in the top floor of an old brownstone near his basketball court. The recluse (Sean Connery), a local legend as a scary being, reads some of Jamal's writing and encourages him to write more. They meet daily in the old man's apartment and he stirs Jamal's creative juices, getting him to further enhance his already considerable writing skill. Jamal soon learns that the old man is William Forrester, a J.D. Salinger-esque novelist who wrote one widely acclaimed novel (think \\"Catcher In The Rye\\") and then disappeared from public view.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed the work of Sean Connery. His screen presence has always been magnetic and he has used that to great advantage in most of his films. He earned fame and riches from playing icons, creating a character that will probably forever be credited to him. He has been unable to shake that character even though the last time he played the character was over fifteen years ago. Connery has created some incredible performances through the years. He played an aging Robin Hood against an aging Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) in a very good film that many people have never heard of. He played a great thief in a film called \\"The Anderson Tapes\\". He played a great con man that would become \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\". He played an aging mentor in \\"The Untouchables\\" adding a lot of class and earning an Academy Award for his portrayal. He has played a lot of memorable roles that challenged his acting skills. He has also appeared in films like \\"Meteor\\", \\"Just Cause\\" and \\"First Knight\\". Truly terrible films that only served to mar his work. However, he has never played a character like William Forrester. We have all seen characters like this in a number of films. A recluse, a famous person, a bombastic person. Yet Connery brings a quality to the role that is very unique. Often, actors use this type of role to chew the scenery and run around screaming and yelling. This only serves to undermine the character. If the character is an old man or woman where are they getting all of this energy. Connery plays the character old. He does raise his voice, but to make a point. He does impart his wisdom, but his wisdom makes sense. I actually believed that he was a writer, listening to the advice he gives his young protege. It is an incredibly rich performance that should know become the standard for which Sean Connery is judged. James who?<br /><br />Rob Brown brings a lot to the role and manages to hold his own against Connery. This is no small feat. A lot of this can be credited to his naturalistic performance. Brown has obviously lived through events that are very similar to those depicted on the screen and he channels his own emotions to that of the character. One of the many good things about the film is that Jamal and Forrester seem to teach and learn from each other, enriching each other's lives.<br /><br />Gus Van Sant returns to territory that is very similar to \\"Good Will Hunting\\", but he creates a different mood and feel, helping to set \\"Finding Forrester\\" apart from the other film. The film opens with a shot of a marker with Van Sant's name on it followed by some documentary style footage of kids in the neighborhood. This immediately heightens our awareness of the neighborhood and the people who live there. It is actually a great touch, bringing the audience into this world very quickly and effectively. The film is then told in a fairly conventional style as Van Sant concentrates on the characters and the story. The film moves at a leisurely pace; it takes about four meetings between Jamal and Forrester before they actually start working together. This allows us to get to know these characters in what seems a natural way.<br /><br />Van Sant and the writer, Mike Rich, another first timer, focus on a lot of details which make the film seem very rich. Jamal's mom, Ms. Joyce (April Grace), is a very good mother who encourages her son and provides a good home. His brother, Terrel (Busta Rhymes), encourages Jamal to take chances, to avoid making the same mistakes he made. He had dreams of being a rapper but is now the supervisor of parking services at Yankee Stadium. He hasn't achieved his dreams, but he doesn't let this make him bitter. Jamal's friends are also a very close bunch. Forrester is a recluse, yet he insults the few people who are required to visit him on a regular basis. These details may seem insignificant, but they help create a richly textured film.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham plays the English professor at Jamal's new school and he is very effective. His snobbishness affects his every exchange with people. They are either less intelligent or undeserving of such an education. Anna Paquin plays a young girl who becomes closer to Jamal. Her performance is very good because she seems more attracted to Jamal for the dangerous aspect of an interracial relationship. At times, she seems to wonder if she is actually attracted to Jamal or the color of his skin.<br /><br />I found one thing odd. In a film about writing, we hear almost none of either writer's work. We hear a couple of lines here and there, but it is difficult to take that in in such a brief period of time. I would have liked to hear more of the writing in the final competition, to get more of a sense of the authors work. Instead, Van Sant shows us reaction shots of the various students, set to music, which I didn't feel was very effective.<br /><br />\\"Finding Forrester\\" is one of the best films of the year.

B00005JNRB|3.0|Why National Treasure? Both Sahara and National Treasure are somewhat similar movies about treasure hunters (or \\"preservers\\" or whatever Nicholas Cage was pretending to be) and both movies have segments of US history included into the plot (National Treasure - some of those debt-ridden Founding Fathers actually had access to all the gold that has been stolen/captured/gathered throughout history - and there is a scene set in early US history; Sahara - Rebel Ironclad carrying huge amounts of rebel gold, sails away from Richmond as it is attacked (the boat and the city)). Both treasure hunters track the gold (though the Sahara fellow is tracking the Ironclad filled with gold, didn't realize it had gold in it).      Matthew McConaughey plays Dirk Pitt from the Clive Cussler book series.  Steve Zahn plays his sidekick and William H. Macy plays the ex-Admiral that runs NUMA (which Pitt and partner are members of).  Penelope Cruz and unknown actor (Glynn Turman) are doctors with the World Health Organization.  Pitt and partner search for the Texas (the Ironclad) in Africa after they finish a mission off the coast of Africa.  Cruz and fellow doctor are following a plague out-break that seems to be coming out of Mali.  Lambert Wilson plays the French bad-guy and Lennie James plays the Mali dictator.     The movie plot has huge holes in it, and some of the sequences seemed to just be there because they thought it would be fun to include (like that desert craft made out of the downed plane). The Sahara people stumble along and oops, they found some clues.  The National Treasure people actually seemed to be tracking clues instead of stumbling over them (however implausible the clues might be).    - Michael S. Briggs -
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors. He creates films filled with interesting characters, involving stories and production design all of which really help to create the world his films inhabit. When \\"Collateral\\" was released in theaters, I heard and read more than one review that stated \\"Michael Mann returns to the Los Angeles streets in `Collateral'\\" or something similar. It seems as though he is being typecast. In a good way, this is understandable. He is the director of \\"Heat\\", one of the best crime dramas ever made, an epic starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, a sprawling film showing characters on both sides of the law as they make the streets of Los Angeles their personal battle ground. And he is the director of \\"Collateral\\", another film set in Los Angeles, this time during the course of one evening, as a hit man travels throughout the city, fulfilling his latest contract. In a bad way, this severely limits the breadth and scope of this director. He has also directed \\"Last of The Mohicans\\", starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe, one of the most romantic films ever made. \\"The Insider\\" and \\"Ali\\" are also on his resume, two very different dramas of mixed result. Perhaps we should simply typecast him as a great director and move on with it.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" follows Vincent Vega (Tom Cruise, sporting graying hair) as he travels throughout Los Angeles one night, fulfilling his contract. Presumably, because he is just visiting, he doesn't rent a car. Maybe he can't drive. Maybe he's from the East Coast and doesn't have a car. This part of his character is vague. For whatever reason, Vincent uses cabs to get around while in LA. At a downtown office building, he jumps into the cab of Max (Jamie Foxx), a man with a dream, who tries to make the best of his days. Max has just dropped off a woman that he is extremely interested in, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and still daydreaming. He quietly takes Vincent to his first stop, stating that it will take 7 minutes. It does take seven minutes and this impresses Vincent. He asks Max to take him to all of his stops for the rest of the evening; he'll double his usual take. Max eyes the money and agrees. Waiting for his Fare, Max starts eating his dinner, daydreaming, until a body crashes into the top of his cab.<br /><br />Much like \\"Heat\\"'s blue landscape and sun-drenched backdrops, \\"Collateral\\" goes the opposite direction with equally stunning results. Mann and his crew used a DV Camera for the film. Using a digital camera is a gutsy move and provides a unique look for the film, enhancing the atmosphere. The story actually begins in the late afternoon and every image is crystal clear, much like watching a HD TV. As the light wanes, the images become darker and grainier. When the characters move to a brightly lit area, their faces pop out in sharp relief, but the backgrounds are still grainy. This makes the characters appear as though they are walking among two-dimensional backdrops. When they enter a brightly lit building, everything becomes crystal clear again. Mann is using this as another way of indicating what the characters are feeling and experiencing during these scenes.<br /><br />The story is about as simple as they come. Vega has received his contract and has a fancy tablet-like computer with pictures, addresses, schedules, etc. of each of the victims. He announces to Max that he has five stops, so the viewer has a timeline of sorts, very clearly on. Basically, a two-character set piece, the film is about Max and Vincent. How they interact, how they change each other, what they learn from each other and more. At one point, Vincent learns that Max has a mom in the hospital and he drags Max to the hospital for a visit. They become a sort of guardian angel to each other. As they make their way to the various stops, Max, the good guy, continues to look for a way to stop Vincent. They stop at a Jazz club, a Latino nightclub, a nightclub in Koreatown. Each of these stops introduces a new, interesting character into the mix, however briefly.<br /><br />Less successful, and necessary, are the action scenes. Because the film is essentially a character piece about two people interacting over a single night, big action scenes don't really fit. At the Koreatown club, in particular, the action seems excessive, over the top and unnecessary. Cruise's acting in this scene rivals Pacino's ham-fisted dialogue delivery in \\"Heat\\". I'm not knocking Pacino in \\"Heat\\", but he is ham-fisted. With the exception of the Koreatown club and the finale, the action scenes are smaller and lower key, which fits perfectly into the story. I am more willing to accept the action of the finale, but it also seems a bit obtrusive. Because it is the finale, and it is foreshadowed at the beginning of the film, it seems to fit more generically.<br /><br />During the 2004 Academy Awards, there was a lot of talk about how Jamie Foxx \\"almost stole the film\\" from Tom Cruise. What this means is that people felt Foxx did a better job in this film than his more famous co-star. This is incredibly subjective, but each of them portrayed characters that were different for them. Foxx, who began his rise to fame on TV's \\"In Living Color\\", was more well-known for his comedic work. In \\"Collateral\\", and later \\"Ray\\", he shows remarkable skill at drama. In \\"Collateral\\", his character is quiet, observant and a bit of a loser. He comments that the job driving a cab is just temporary; he's working on things, trying to get a business started. When Vincent asks him how long he's been driving a cab, Max answers 12 years. There's nothing temporary about it. We then realize that he is a dreamer who has never, and will never realize his dreams. Max becomes all the more real because of this. Cruise has become one of the world's biggest stars playing heroes. So it was a risk for him to take the role of Vincent, a cold- blooded killer. Like most of Cruise's films, he brings an intensity to the role that fits the character. Cruise's role is the more showy, and noticeable, but it was probably less of a stretch for him to pull off than Foxx's performance. Because of this, Foxx is receiving the lion's share of attention. Both performances are very good. Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Barden and Barry Shabake Henley (a very recognizable character actor) pop up during Max and Vincent's travels. Ruffalo has the most extended supporting role, and is the most successful with it.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" was released in theaters during the summer of 2004, and it, and \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" signaled that perhaps the studios have realized that there is a market out there for adult action films. \\"Collateral\\" is a very good film that will take you along for the ride.h of these stops introduces a new, interesting character into the mix, however briefly. <br /> <br />Less successful, and necessary, are the action scenes.

I'm not knocking Pacino in \\"Heat\\", but he is ham-fisted. With the exception of the Koreatown club and the finale, the action scenes are smaller and lower key, which fits perfectly into the story. I am more willing to accept the action of the finale, but it also seems a bit obtrusive. Because it is the finale, and it is foreshadowed at the beginning of the film, it seems to fit more generically. <br /> <br />During the 2004 Academy Awards, there was a lot of talk about how Jamie Foxx \\"almost stole the film\\" from Tom Cruise. What this means is that people felt Foxx did a better job in this film than his more famous co-star. This is incredibly subjective, but each of them portrayed characters that were different for them. Foxx, who began his rise to fame on TV's \\"In Living Color\\", was more well-known for his comedic work. In \\"Collateral\\", and later \\"Ray\\", he shows remarkable skill at drama. In \\"Collateral\\", his character is quiet, observant and a bit of a loser. He comments that the job driving a cab is just temporary; he's working on things, trying to get a business started. When Vincent asks him how long he's been driving a cab, Max answers 12 years. There's nothing temporary about it. We then realize that he is a dreamer who has never, and will never realize his dreams. Max becomes all the more real because of this. Cruise has become one of the world's biggest stars playing heroes. So it was a risk for him to take the role of Vincent, a cold- blooded killer. Like most of Cruise's films, he brings an intensity to the role that fits the character. Cruise's role is the more showy, and noticeable, but it was probably less of a stretch for him to pull off than Foxx's performance. Because of this, Foxx is receiving the lion's share of attention. Both performances are very good. Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Barden and Barry Shabake Henley (a very recognizable character actor) pop up during Max and Vincent's travels. Ruffalo has the most extended supporting role, and is the most successful with it. <br /> <br />\\"Collateral\\" was released in theaters during the summer of 2004, and it, and \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" signaled that perhaps the studios have realized that there is a market out there for adult action films. \\"Collateral\\" is a very good film that will take you along for the ride. <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|WTF?  How do you come out with a sophomore album that is decidedly worse than your debut?  I've never seen the likes of this before.  I hate it, through and through; oh, one exception:  Candy Shop.  I was feeling that one for a while but now I'm sick and tired of hearing it.  Is this a \\"I'm large now so I don't have to try\\" kinda thing?  I am terribly, terribly disappointed and can't understand why it is selling at all.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Sir William (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia (Kirstin Scott Thomas) McCordle host a shooting party at their country home. During the weekend, the lives of the various servants and guest interact and have an impact on the weekend. Also, over the course of the weekend, Sir William is murdered and many people appear to have motive for the murders. Among the various guests: Countess Trentham (Maggie Smith), an elderly dowager and financial drain on Sir William, Lord and Lady Stockbridge (Charles Dance and Geraldine Sommerville), brother and sister-in-law of William, each of whom is interested in the McCordles, Ivor Novello (Jermey Northam), star of the Silent screen and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a Hollywood producer. The various servants include: Jennings (Alan Bates), the McCordle's butler, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper, Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), the head cook, Probert (Derek Jacobi), Sir William's valet, Elsie (Emily Watson), a housemaid, George (Richard E. Grant), First Footman, Robert Parks (Clive Owen), Lord Stockbridge's valet and Henry Denton (Ryan Phillipe), M.r Weissman's valet.<br /><br />\\"Gosford Park\\", the newest film from director Robert Altman is a very engaging, very well-made film about the lives of these people. As the film progresses, you realize that the film is less about the murder that takes place over the weekend and more about the class differences between the two sets of people. It quickly becomes apparent that there really is no difference between the Upstairs and the Downstairs people. Certain people receive different treatment with respect to their birth and upbringing. Also, due to the amount of fooling around between the two groups, it seems fairly silly to have one person referred to as Lord or Lady when they are perfectly happy to jump into the sack with a footman or maid.<br /><br />The fact that the mystery is not a primary factor is made very clear in two ways. Mr. Weissman (Bob Balaban) soon reveals that he is a producer of the Charlie Chan movies and is working on a new film called \\"Charlie Chan in London\\". He is asked to tell the group about it, but won't reveal the ending. As he describes the film, we realize that the film he is describing is the film we are watching. I don't know if you have ever seen a Charlie Chan film, but the outcome of these films is rarely based on any detective or police work. Soon, Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) enters the picture. A bumbling idiot, he is clearly overpowered by the class of people he is dealing with.<br /><br />\\"Park\\" is filled with virtually every British actor currently working and each is very good. The sheer magnitude of the characters would seem to suggest that many of them would end up being two dimensional. However, almost every character has something going on, which helps to define them and provide interest to the story. Certainly, some characters become more prevalent and integral to the story, but Altman has a way of bringing a character into the picture at just the right moment to renew our interest in them.<br /><br />Maggie Smith is, as always, brilliant. As the elderly dowager, she uses her place and title to full advantage, and seems to love everything about her life, except for the size of her allowance. Just as she is commenting about the ineptitude of her personal maid, Mary Macreachran (Kelly McDonald), she makes an aside that she is very cheap, than goes on to talk about her state of financial affairs. Jeremy Northam and Bob Balaban provide the other standouts in the cast. Northam, playing Ivor Novello, an actual silent film star, seems genuinely perplexed by the state of his career and takes to singing one song after another. Bob Balaban plays Morris Weissman, a film producer from Hollywood, whom the kitchen staff soon finds out is a vegetarian.<br /><br />The cast of actors playing the staff is generally more interesting. Alan Bates heads up the service staff as Jennings, the head butler. He maintains a tight grip on the household with the help of Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper. Mirren brings an iron rule to the role but also makes the character sympathetic and interesting in small, interesting ways. Ms. Wilson and Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), the head cook, seem to have a small feud of power going on. Each character has secrets which are revealed in subtle ways. Clive Owen, as Stockbridge's valet, provides a quiet force in the servant's quarters and his presence eventually shakes things up. Derek Jacobi and Richard E. Grant also play members of the staff, adding to the mix.<br /><br />Ryan Phillipe also appears in the film as the Scottish valet to Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban). At first, his accent seems very 'actorly', as though someone who studied the accent for a bit suddenly thinks they can do it. Another character comments on the accent and soon we realize that perhaps he is not everything he seems. Phillipe is OK, but he is outmatched by every other actor in the film both in skill and physical presence. It smacks of a desperate attempt by the filmmakers to attract a portion of the American audience that never would go to a film like this. As his character becomes more clear, it also appears as though the filmmakers are trying to create a plausible excuse for their own actions in casting him.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Altman seemlessly weaves back and forth between the characters and their developing relationships, revealing little bits and then moving on. This manages to keep the cumbersome film and cast of characters fresh and to maintain our interest, while helping us identify the various players.<br /><br />\\"Gosford Park\\" is filled with interesting characters and very good performances, providing two hours of fun for everyone.e maintains a tight grip on the household with the help of Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper.

B00005OWEG|5.0|I am not a huge fan of war films. For this reason, I avoided watching \\"Apocalypse Now\\" for a long time. As most film students, I am at least familiar with the history of the making of the film. Coppola spent years on the film, he spent his fortune on the film and reportedly threatened suicide, Martin Sheen had a heart attack, Brando was, well, Brando. The film has a mythic status and I wanted to finally experience the film. Infrequently, a film director creates a film based on material they passionately believe in. When this happens, every frame of the film reflects this passion. It creates a riveting experience for the viewer. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is one of a handful of films in which this happens.<br /><br />About eight or nine years ago, Francis Ford Coppola presented a new print of the film at the SF International Film Festival, on a big screen, in the original \\"Roadshow\\" presentation he intended. The lure was too much, I ran and bought a ticket and waited eagerly to watch the film. My first experience of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was not a pleasent one. The film is not supposed to be pleasant, but I did come away with a greater admiration of the skill of the filmmakers. Coppola, the actors, Vittorio Storraro, Walter Murch, Dean Tavoularis and others poured their heart and soul into the film. The film is a great work of art.<br /><br />Francis Ford Coppola decided a few years ago to revisit this film. With the advent of DVD, it became possible to rethink the film and rerelease it. Coppola and two of his associates looked at all of the footage shot for the film (reportedly 1.5 million feet) and decided to add an additional 50 minutes of footage. They reportedly took the original negative and reedited it, adding four key scenes. This means that the original version no longer exists except on tape or in a copy.<br /><br />This new version was unveiled at Cannes this year and will be released in the States in August. On Friday night, the film was screened at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.<br /><br />Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's \\"Hearts of Darkness\\", \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" follows the journey of Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), a man sent on a mission. His mission is to find a renegade Green Beret, Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz has become a God to a small group of Cambodian natives and American soldiers and the Army wants him exterminated because he is running a dangerous operation with no connection to the US. Willard must find and terminate the Colonel, with extreme prejudice. His journey up a treacherous river, from Vietnam into Cambodia is a terrible one.<br /><br />Martin Sheen is outstanding as Willard. He conveys the pain and conflict this character is experiencing, yet also conveys the sense of duty the Army has drilled into him from day one. Brando is riveting as Kurtz. Reportedly, Brando wanted every scene to be filmed in shadow. It works. It makes the character mysterious, dangerous and mythical. Duvall was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lt. Colonel Bill Kilgore. Kilgore is the first 'obstacle', if you will, Willard must overcome to get to his ultimate goal. Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, a very young Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford make memorable appearances.<br /><br />The film depicts Willard's journey, up the river, to his goal, Kurtz. Most of the obstacles take the form of people. Soon, he and the rest of the crew of the boat experience a supply outpost getting ready for an appearance by Playboy Playmates. This scene is interesting more for the fact that it is pretty much the only time a female is present in the film. The journey takes Willard and the other members of the boat through the nine levels of hell as they travel up the river.<br /><br />The film is memorable from the beginning depiction of Willard's memories, a helicopter flying through his subconscious as he watches a ceiling fan spin lazily to his final confrontation with Kurtz.<br /><br />There are basically four major bits that have been added to \\"Redux\\". A small bit segment has been added to the scenes involving Kilgore and his men. This adds more texture to the relationship between Willard and the crew of the boat. Rumors have circulated for some time that there was an extended scene featuring the Playboy Playmates and a scene set on a French plantation. Both of these have been reinstated for \\"Redux\\". The Playboy Playmates are stranded at a base further up the river. When Willard and his crew meetv them again, they interact, adding more depth to their characters. It is also most notable for the nudity involved. Further up the river, after they have crossed into Cambodia, the ship comes across a French plantation. The plantation is now being defended by the French family that owns it. Naturally, they offer Willard and his crew a place to rest and eat. Willard soon spots a widowed daughter to the patriarch. As soon as they lock eyes, it becomes evident what will happen between these characters. Soon, everyone sits down to dinner and the patriarch and his family get into a fight about the war, who started the Viet Cong, etc. This scene was easily one of the most tedious I have ever seen on the big screen. At the time of the film's original release, the politics and ideas expressed in this segment would have been more meaningful and powerful. Today, the scene preaches what many people have already learned and come to realize. The scene is completely unnecessary and slows the film down. The final addition of importance involves Kurtz and Willard. It is a small scene but adds further texture to the characters and their relationship.<br /><br />\\"Redux\\" is not a better film, or more meaningful, or more powerful. If anything, the additional scenes detract slightly from the power of the original vision. However, that vision is still one of the most powerful ever committed to celluloid and worth viewing on a big screen.is final confrontation with Kurtz.  <br /> <br />There are basically four major bits that have been added to \\"Redux\\".

B00005JNPZ|3.0|\\"Hitch\\" (Will Smith) is a professional date doctor. He helps men get through the nervousness they experience when they are pursuing the woman of their dreams. His latest client, Albert (Kevin James, TV's \\"The King of Queens\\"), a portly CPA, is smitten with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), an heiress whose every romance is plastered across the tabloids. Hitch agrees to take Albert on as a client, because he likes the challenge. Also pursuing Allegra Cole is Sara (Eva Mendes), the star reporter for one of those tabloids. Hitch spots her in a crowded bar one night and strikes up a conversation. Hitch and Sara's dates are disasters, but they agree to keep trying. As Albert becomes closer to Allegra, Hitch is still trying to pursue Sara, as she tries to pursue the elusive Albert.<br /><br />\\"Hitch\\", released rather fortuitously the Friday before Valentine's Day, broke a number of box office records it's opening weekend. This shouldn't be a surprise. Everything about the film is designed to make women go `aaaah, Will Smith is so cute.'<br /><br />The film is a pleasant diversion, but it only works sporadically. The film is at it's best when the story centers on Albert, the Kevin James character. He has a couple of scenes of inspired comedy, which surely must have been adlibbed. One scene, in which he demonstrates to Hitch how he would dance is the funniest thing I have seen in some time. Another nice touch to Albert's character is that although he is portly, this isn't necessarily the cause of his nervousness. He's just nervous around women. It doesn't help that he is pursuing one of the most beautiful socialites in New York, but it's nice to see a big guy portrayed in a film that isn't a slob or completely useless.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is also the part of the film that concentrates on Hitch's relationship with Sara. I guess the filmmakers felt that they needed something a little more grounded to balance out the film. Smith and Mendes are certainly likable enough as actors, and their first date is slightly amusing. But this is the relationship in the film where nothing works. They get in fights, have miscommunication, have bad feelings, in others words, like a real life courtship. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see Will Smith, in a comedy, in a relationship attempting to be real life. It brings the entire film down. This story line might have been more successful but there is also a lack of chemistry between them. They don't kiss until the end, and by that point, we have sat through about 60 minutes of this. It's too little, too late.<br /><br />The funniest bit with Smith is the very beginning of the film as we eavesdrop on him working with three clients. Its fun to watch how he helps them win the ladies of their dreams.<br /><br />The technical aspect of the film is okay. The fairly straight forward approach works for the story. Everyone lives in a great apartment in New York City, enjoys going out all the time and are basically burning up the town. They must all make a lot of money. What \\"Hitch\\" does well is provide a very nice portrait of New York City. It looks like a fun place to live.<br /><br />Too bad the film doesn't provide as much enjoyment as living in New York seems to for these characters.enough as actors, and their first date is slightly amusing.

B0007GAERG|5.0|It's hard to imagine that it has been 2 years since Mariah last released an album.  However, you realize it was worth the wait after you get done hearing \\"The Emancipation of Mimi!\\"  This cd is absolutely amazing!  It is hands down her best cd since \\"Butterfly\\" and it takes her back to the old days where you would just lay back and let Mariah take you to a different place!  I know a lot of people have gotten sick of Mariah or maybe lost interest in her, but I promise you if you get this cd you won't be upset. <br /> <br />Your dance tracks include \\"It's Like That\\", \\"Say Somethin'\\", \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"To The Floor.\\"  Every one of these songs hit just the right notes and really all could be hits for Mariah.  \\"Get Your Number\\" in my opinion is the hottest track on the cd. <br /> <br />Your slower more old-school Mariah tracks that really make you sing are \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Stay the Night\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"Your Girl\\", and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\". <br /> <br />The rest of the tracks are equaly as good, but those are the songs that really stick out and will for sure be huge hits! <br /> <br />This is the first time in a long time where I haven't skipped over a song while I have listened to a cd.  You won't want to miss these songs after listening to the cd time after time. <br /> <br />Mariah is back, like it or not!!!!!!!!!
B000002HMH|1.0|Bad album, bad cover. This signified the end for Jason Newsted. I don't blame him one bit. The heaviest band on the planet with a cover of cow semen in blood? I know, it's not about that, it's about the music. So let's get into it. THIS IS TERRIBLE! Yes I understand growth but c'mon. The real problem isn't the haircuts or any of that crap. IT'S BOB ROCK! He needs to go. He ruined a great band. Anyone who loves this cd probably jumped on the wagon after the Black album. Well posers, stay on the wagon. You'll find me listening to Kill-Ride-Puppets-Justice-Music that still holds up today.
B000002LGW|5.0|Being only a teenager now i didn't know much about depeche mode, only what older friends had told me. I probably would never have become the fan i am now if i didn't find this cd in the bargain bin at my local cd store. The wonderful thing about depeche mode is that they are perfect for fans of all types of music so dont let the fact of them being an electronic band turn you off. They are very talented musicians. After just a few days  i had adapted to there style and i feel in love. Standout tracks for me include:everything counts, Blasphemous rumours and a question of lust
B0007GAERG|5.0|First of all i would to say that i have been a Fan of Mariah's since i was a little kid. She's made some amazing albums and a few missed efforts which i'm not ashamed to admit because it's true and for a certain point i lost touch with Mariah as a fan...But Fell back in love with her voice after hearing tracks from her new album....Her voice is amazing we all know that....But their was something about her voice that made me a fan....She puts emotion into her music...Sings her songs with such ease, and makes u feel like your right their with her!....Her new album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\"....Brings back \\"THE VOICE\\" as many of you have seen the Promo adds everywhere and it's the truth...It's quick to past judgement on her and their are going to be alot of negative people who are gonna post reviews about her cause they have nothing better else to do....She's been criticized for her Flop movie \\"Glitter\\" and the Flop album that went along with it...Her \\"Supposed\\" Diva behavior..Her breakdown....Her skin showing outfits....But all that is behind her now and in this new album she proves that through everything she's been through she can still Sing like she did before, and deliver the Amazing songs that we expect to hear from her....Her vocals are in a better place than it has been in years according to her, and with tracks like \\"Mine again\\", \\"We belong together\\", and \\"Fly like a Bird\\" (Just to name a few)..She proves that....Their are also some Funky tracks like \\"Shake it off\\", and \\"Say something\\" That get you in the groove....and her First single \\"It's like that\\" a club track that delivers the vocals and the beats that made it her biggest hit in years peaking at #14 on the Billboard hot 100......This album is a Very Solid R&B effort that may suprise people who are quick to call Mariah \\"Washed up\\".....well she is far from it, and Deserves all the Success with this new album.

B0007GAERG|1.0|Well, I purchased the CD, and from what I heard, I think there is no water for it to stream, it has the usual Mariah ballads, and the same generic Hip Hop beats.  <br /> <br />To me, this album is pretty much the same Mariah we heard back with Charmbracelet, and Glitter. I really was not happy with the purchase, and plan on returning the new CD when I can.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Cant NONE of the female singers come close to Mariah.....Mariah is always often immitated but never duplicated.This is a cd you can put in and just let it play i LOVE it so so much Mariah really poured her heart and soul into this album thank you so so much Mimi for keeping good music alive =)
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love, love, this album....it's so HOT!! The collaborations are just as good as all her ballads....it's not overdone...it's absolutely perfect...the album...is sooo good from beggining to end...If you are a Mariah fan then most definately pick this up!! Even if your not...pick this up. It's just such a perfect blend of the perfect song under an amazing voice. Just excellent!! It's so smooth. WOW!
1573223085|5.0|Dan Pink's book lays out three significant factors that affect our lives - abundance (too much stuff), Asia (outsourcing of labor) and Automation (replacement of labor by machines) - and provides suggestions on how one can \\"survive\\" in such a world (hint: different sets of skills, ways of thinking and networking). The book takes an optimistic point of view, which is a relief these days, with all the Doom And Gloom books around. It is well-written and provides excellent examples at the end of every chapter (URLs as well as books) for people who want to rise to the challenge of the Three As. I like Dan's writing style and presentation. His previous book \\"Free Agent Nation\\" is also a must-read.
0767805712|5.0|+++++<br /><br />(Note that this review is for the DVD \\"Gattaca\\" released Oct. 2003.)<br /><br />This is a fascinating movie that gives the viewer a glimpse into humankind's possible near future.<br /><br />The beginning sets the viewer up for the rest of the movie.  We are shown the birth of the hero of this movie, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), and hear his genetic profile for major afflictions:<br /><br />(1) Neurological condition 60% probability<br />(2) Manic depression 42% probability<br />(3) Attention Deficit Disorder 89% probability<br />(4) Heart disorder 99% probability<br />(5) Life expectancy 30.2 years<br /><br />This genetic profile has sealed the infant Vincent's fate.  He is now labeled an \\"In-valid\\" or \\"de-GENE-erate\\" because of his bad genetic profile.  This means that the adolescent Vincent's dream of \\"going into space\\" will not come true.<br /><br />Vincent's parents decide that their next child will be almost genetically perfect.  Vincent was conceived the old-fashioned way (so he's known as a \\"God-child\\") but this new child will be genetically engineered where procreation is done in a Petri dish.  The parents have decided beforehand that Vincent will have a brother named Anton (Loren Dean), and that Anton is to have \\"hazel eyes, dark hair, and fair skin.\\"  The geneticist (Blair Underwood) who will do the genetic engineering will take care to remove \\"any prejudicial conditions\\" like \\"premature balding, myopia [near-sightedness], alcoholism, addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence, obesity, etc.\\"<br /><br />This genetic make-up will insure that Anton has a bright future.  He is labeled a \\"Valid\\" because of his good genetic profile.<br /><br />Welcome to this new world where there now is a new kind of discrimination called \\"GENE-oism.\\"  Vincent enters this world as a young adult who wants to attain his impossible dream.<br /><br />He soon secures a lowly job at the \\"Gattaca Aerospace Corporation,\\" a private space institute that at this time is planning a manned space mission to one of the moons of Saturn.  (Saturn is the sixth planet of our solar system.)  At this time Vincent meets a genetically enhanced person named Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law).  But Jerome is special.  Why?  Because he is disabled and even though he is nearly genetically perfect, his disability makes him useless in a world obsessed with perfection.  Jerome helps Vincent try to achieve his dream.<br /><br />Vincent also meets a genetically enhanced female named Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman).  She also indirectly helps Vincent to achieve his dream.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is well done.  Ethan Hawke and especially Jude Law give very convincing performances.<br /><br />The sets are very good, creating a futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.<br /><br />Viewers who have some science background will also appreciate the science aspects of this movie.  Some examples:<br /><br />(1) The name \\"Gattaca\\" is composed of the first letters of the four building blocks that make up DNA (namely \\"G,\\" \\"A,\\" \\"T,\\" and \\"C\\").<br /><br />(2) Jerome's middle name is \\"Eugene\\" which in Greek means \\"well born\\" and is the basis of the word \\"Eugenics.\\"  Eugenics is the movement devoted to improving the human species through the control of hereditary factors.  (It is actually the central theme of this<br />movie.)<br /><br />(3) Irene's last name is \\"Cassini.\\"  This was the last name of the seventeenth century astronomer who discovered, amongst other things, the prominent gap in Saturn's rings.  (Recall that the space mission in this movie is to one of Saturn's moons.)<br /><br />Besides Eugenics, I think another theme of this movie is that your genes don't have to determine your fate.<br /><br />Finally, DVD extras include a short featurette and deleted scenes.  I found these interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a rare movie since it's an intelligent combination of science fiction and thriller.  With a great plot, good acting, and great visuals, it is a movie not to be missed!!<br /><br />(1997;  1 hr, 45 min;  widescreen;  closed-captioned)<br /><br />+++++n of science fiction and thriller.

1400032717|4.0|A great book! So funny, so eye-opening...so entertaining and fascinating! I won't go on repeating what the other reviewers have already said. <br />The only thing that disappointed me was the family Christopher had to learn his values from. How much he could've done with some knowledge about moral and religious truth - now he excludes it all with few very poor arguments when otherwise he's so smart. If his parents hadn't been examples of extreme selfishness this guy would've made miracles.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002KVUKM|1.0|If we graded JUST for special effects, this would be a 5, but thats ALL this film is! story line?, doesn't exist, stupid dialog?, got all you want. I wanted to like this film because it wore me out just watching it, but the question in my mind at the end, why was this made? totally empty of any reason. Great eye candy, but that's ALL.  BEWARE!

B0002OERI0|5.0|While I was never a big fan of Green Day, I have to say this album is phenomenal.  With elements of the Who, the Beatles and the Sex Pistols woven into its structure, the album is nevertheless completely original.   <br /> <br />The socially conscious and thought provoking lyrics are extremely well written and illustrative of the current political climate.  The sequence and structure of the songs form a compelling story similar to great concept albums like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Tommy\\".   <br /> <br />After listening to this album you can officially count me as a fan of Green Day.
B00079018K|5.0|My CD collection is 800+ and growing.  I wanted to add this CD to my collection, but the draconian copy-protection system prevents me, on priciple, from its purchase.  I agree with the sentiment expressed by others, that we must take a stand -- the only message the record companies understand is dollars.  By refusing to purchase we deny them the incentive to continue this abhorrent destruction of our \\"fair use\\" rights.  It is a great disappointment that the band themselves will suffer royalties, especially with what seems to be a very good album.  But to purchase this album would be to condone and even encourage other bands and record companies to release other protected albums, or worse, other more diabolical schemes to prevent ripping.  I like the convenience of listening to my music collection via my Sonos, iPods or on my computer, and NO record company will EVER remove my right to do so. <br /> <br />Please, show the record companies what a mistake they're making with these heinous INEFFECTIVE copy-protection schemes.  \\"Voting with Dollars\\" is the *only* thing these capricious b*stards understand.  The legal customer is the one that pays the most -- if I wanted to download/steal this album off the internet it would be trivial.  Why punish your honest, loyal customers the most ?
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey is an amazing singer, but sadly her last two albums failed to capture that beauty in her voice that was always evident in previous works.  But thankfuly she returns with her newest work Emancipation of Mimi (Mimi being her alter-ego).  Throughout this album she finally returns with the reason I always like Carey.  Throughout she accomplishes to produce club tracks and ballads ... good, good God sent ballads.<br /><br />Mariah returned with \\"It's Like That\\" which was obviously meant for clubs.  It is produced by the great Jermaine Dupri and Mariah gets to show off her vocals, well, as much as she can in a song like this.  But on her second single and next track \\"We Belong Together\\" is where she can shine in this delightful and sensual ballad.  Raw emotion comes together towards the end where she starts to blast off the pipes I've missed for so long.<br /><br />But things only get better with her best pieces on the album such as the spiritual and uplifting \\"Fly Like a Bird\\", \\"One And Only\\" ft. speed rapper Twista, Kanye West produced \\"Stay The Night\\" and my personal favorite \\"Mine Again\\" where she blasts her pipes.  As she said to AOL, it's definitely the power ballad of the album, and boy she isn't lying.  She also predicted it to be a lot of people's favorites, and she predicted right.<br /><br />The album really has to weak moments, which is a big relief after her last two albums.  Emancipation of Mimi is one of the best albums of 2005.  That's not me on the hype, that's not me being humble, it's the truth.  Mariah has made a long awaited and well deserved come back that many have awaited.  It's good to see Mariah come out with strong material since many thought she was on the verge of collapsing as a the soulful diva she once was.
0345347951|3.0|Without warning aliens arrive on Earth in the science-fiction novel, Childhood's End written by Arthur C. Clarke. The Overlords as the aliens are called are not the typical kinds of aliens who suppress humanity causing a rebellion against alien supremacy. Instead the Overlords lead the world into a golden age where famine, disease, war, poverty and boundaries cease to exist. The Overlords intentions are unknown and some believe that their ultimate objective might well indeed be rather malignant. The outcome of the novel is rather gloomy but can either be perceived as the end or the beginning of mankind. <br /> <br />Childhood's End is quite an enjoyable tale booming with interesting details and twists but Clarke's weak points are clearly visible. The story itself is very original. It is not the traditional man versus alien story which tends to drag on but one of more complexity which definitely adds to the enjoyment of the novel. Sometimes the details are so original and fascinating that the imagination of the mind is truly tested. Nevertheless the complicated originality sometimes leads into a slight boredom or frustration. The story continuously swings between different characters and different settings and the plot takes giant leaps at times which make the progress of the book seem to be confusing and unnatural. Even though mistakes were made by Clarke, his novel Childhood's End is definitely an enjoyable book due to its sheer originality. <br />
B00000DHRZ|4.0|!Heather's Teenage Son! <br /> <br />Being a die-hard Offspring fan, I of course enjoyed this album alot.  But, it's definately not them at their best.  Their best albums are definately Ixnay and Conspiracy of One, while this is their worst...but I'm giving it 4 stars.  So, that should tell you how purely awesome this band is.  The track \\"Walla Walla\\" is fast and fun and I love listening to it over and over again, so I would suggest you listen to that one.  \\"She's Got Issues\\" is great and catchy, and my favorite track on this CD.  \\"Pretty Fly\\" is entertaining, also along with their other single off this album \\"Why Don't You Get A Job\\".  But, there is one song on here called \\"Have You Ever\\".  It sounds so much like \\"Dirty Magic\\" from the album Ignition it's not even funny.  So, skip that one unless you want to hear \\"Dirty Magic\\" only faster. <br /> <br />So, overall this album entertains but their lyrics are not as meaningful as on their other CDs.  Get this one if, like me, you absolutely love this band.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I remember hearing The Widow for the first time on the radio and wondering who was singing this terrific song.  When it wasn't announced, it became a quest for me to find out who it was.  Eventually I found out it was Mars Volta and that their new cd was coming out soon.   <br /> <br />When I picked up the cd, and heard the first song my immediate reaction was, this can't be the band that did that song I heard on the radio.  It was so different from the song.  Then the next song was just as different as both the Widow and the first song that I was not sure what to think.  It wasn't until after the Widow I heard a song with its Latin beats, changing time signatures and just a really awesome funk that I started thinking, man this is something.  And since that moment I was hooked.   <br /> <br />This cd is not like anything I have ever heard before and I like that.  At a time when I've been growing sick of the current crop of music that lack originality, Mars Volta helped restore my faith that unique and creative music was not dead.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been listening to Green Day since 94 and this, while not thier best album (that title still belongs to Dookie) but is one up there. With the exception the overplayed Boulevard of Broken Dreams, this cd is exceptional. It tells a great story when listened to from start to finish, but even each song on its own is great. Some notable songs on the cd; <br />St. Jimmy: best song on the album; fast, furious, and hardcore punk. <br />Jesus of Sububia: Great intro to the story and one heck of a song. <br />Wake me up when September ends: a somber song thats played wonderfully.
B000002H97|5.0|Truly, there probably is not a band out there which demonstrated how much of a role image, popularity (or lack thereof), and mainstream/underground appeal apparently play in determining what is quality music. Metallica, a band which throughout the 80s were at the forefront of the thrash metal scene, decided, with their fifth album, known as \\"The Black Album\\" to take a different direction from that which they had been pioneering. A smash upon release, it shot up the charts to number one, introduced a whole new audience to their music, alienated many of their hardcore fans, and became the center of a war of the popular vs. the underground.     It's a shame that the war of popularity and the unwillingness of fans to let a band change would become such an issue with this album, because people quit looking at the album for what it's really about: music. The Black Album may not be another slice of what came before it from the band, but taken for what it is, it really is a good recording.    Of course the question is: what is The Black Album? Certainly not a thrash album, The Black Album is actually return to roots of sorts. Having pioneered and played the thrash style well for nearly a decade, Metallica steps back with this one, dipping a bit into the blues-rock/hard-rock/heavy metal tradition of the late 70s whose evolution would eventually be their own music, and combining those elements with many of harsher elements of their signature thrash style. The result: an album which, while not particularly appealing to fans who wanted thrash and only thrash from Metallica, stands as one of the best hard-rock recordings to come down the road in a long time.    And really, it's that successful melding of elements that give this album its flavor. Songs like \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Sad But True\\" capture the indellible hooks of hard-rock but add the brutal intensity of thrash to the guitar attack, while others like \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"My Friend of Misery\\" meld intricate, almost delicate guitar picking with thrashy verses/chorouses to paint some truly beautiful, disturbing, and sad musical pictures. And \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" while a bit lyrically simple, is played sincerely and beautifully, succeding without the Metallica tradition of a thrash intro/outro for their ballads, a bold move for a thrash band indeed (plus, as a love song, it's a fine antidote to Bryan Adams' overplayed mega-hit \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\\" of the same year).    There are still some exercises is speed and thrash, and while they don't stack up to the efforts of the previous four albums, they are solid songs, and provide a nice balance to the slower tracks, as well as at least recalling the direction from which Metallica had just come.     Overall The Black Album is an excellent album, if not as a metal album, than at least as hard rock. It's a damn shame that this album became so caught up in the politics of fan/band relations, because it really does succeed brilliantly on its own merits. Those who only like Thrash Metallica will be dissapointed, but those who don't mind something different may well enjoy this album. Different from those classic first four albums, yes. Still great. Still reccomended.

B00004Y2QT|5.0|Prince's \\"Rave un2 the year 2000\\" is something of a surprise for many. On the eve of the millenial new year, Prince decided that a new year's eve concert as a pay-per-view event was a good idea. Many didn't think so. At first it was named after that year's lackluster album \\"Rave un2 the joy fantastic\\" which didn't show Prince's full musical genius to a cynical public who thought him to be a product of the 80's (how wrong they are) and to make matters worse, the concert was marketed as the last concert to ever feature a live performance of the song \\"1999\\" !. All that aside, one thing is proven after watching this concert, Prince was, is and always will be a musical force to be reckoned with. From his truly individual musical style, to his unparalled ability in instrumentation (anything from guitar, keyboards, drums to even Harp!), this man was created for music and in this concert it shows. From the opening moments with a blazing guitar solo on \\"Let's go crazy\\" to a truly rocking version of \\"She's always in my hair\\" to a blues medley that is nothing short of amazing to even a funky version of \\"Higher\\" to numerous other gems, this is what all concerts should be: raw, adrenalin-rushing music performed by a man whose eneregy and love for what he does shows in every single minute of this concert and supported by a band that couldn't be any tighter (just wait for Maceo Parker's entrance !). Directed with pure energey and featuring moments of musicianship that would make even the harshest critic acknowledge the undeniable, this is Prince at his best, pure and simple.
B000002IQW|5.0|When Nirvana became huge and forever changed the face of rock, bands that had been huge were instantly killed overnight. A lot of these bands were awful (Slaughter, Trixter) and the world was better off without them. But some bands were unfairly thrown to the wolves. Any hint of being a pop-metal band was the kiss of death in '92. Unfortunately for Skid Row, many lumped the band in with the hair-metal crowd, and they were one of grunge's causalities.  This was a real shame, because Skid Row was a great band, and their sophomore album \\"Slave to the Grind\\" remains great record.<br /><br />I would argue that Skid Row was second only to Guns N' Roses, as the best hard rock/metal band of the late 80s, early 90s. Skid Row was one of the last few bands, before the rise of the popularity of Grunge, to have some originality and creativity. Their self titled debut album was a little generic, but it still rocked harder than most of their peers (Warrant, Poison) and is a classic 80s rock debut. But it was their second album \\"Slave to the Grind\\" that Skid Row really took off.<br /><br />\\"Slave to the Grind\\" is far heavier and meaner than the debut album. It sounds like \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" era Guns N' Roses meets Pantera. The songs are heavy, and in-your-face, yet also highly melodic, and filled with killer solos. Singer Sebastian Bach has a very distinct set of pipes that make him unique and set him apart from all the generic David Lee Roth wannabe singers from the late 80s. Snake Sabo may not be the most gifted guitar player ever, but he sure came up with terrific, catchy riffs and solos.<br /><br />It's hard to choose any standouts, because really the whole CD rocks, top to bottom. This is easily one of the best metal albums of all-time. Unlike the debut album, this album doesn't sound dated. It sounds as good today as it did in '91. I would highly recommend this CD to hard rock/metal fans.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It's about time Mariah listened to what the fans wanted... actually, what the general public wanted! This time around we have Mariah belting it out, having catchy hooks, and all that. Looks like she finally may have the comeback because if anything would do it, this record would! Best album of hers since Butterfly.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey seems to be one of the few artists who I truly admire for a number of reasons. She is, first and foremost, an amazing vocalist. Her music is always appealing to me, and her lyrics are also very professional. She displays an air of talent not seen from someone who is commonly perceived as a blonde bimbo.<br /><br />Aside from the cover versions she has recorded, Mariah Carey writes and produces nearly every song. Not many artists can do this successfully. Mariah can, and her latest album proves it. At this moment in time, I admire Mariah the most for clawing her way back to the top. From 2001's \\"Glitter\\"-era, Mariah has risen from the ashes and become a beautiful woman all over again. It's taken her a few years, but the wait has been truly worth it; \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" ranks amongst Carey's greatest work of her already-impressive 15 year career.<br /><br />This album is one of the most anticipated of the year, and the hype has been swirling since January. Anything Mariah releases I will buy, so there was no question that I would be buying this the day it came out. Many people were disappointed with 2002's \\"Charmbracelet.\\" I was not. However, it wasn't an album that left you speechless. The Emancipation Of Mimi most definitely is. Here, Mariah stays loyal to her trademark ballads, but they're different somehow. Mariah is less dramatic with the vocals, and the songs sound fresh and original. The R'n'B edge of the album is incredible, roping in only the best in the industry.<br /><br />The album opens with the first single \\"It's Like That.\\" This song hit No.4 in the UK charts last week becoming Mariah's biggest hit single in almost six years. Mariah is NOT over, people! This song is a hot summer club banger with a catchy hook and some quirky vocals. The lyrics are cool and sophisticated, and the beat is addictive and very now. \\"We Belong Together\\" is the second single from this album, and it's a very catchy mid-tempo ballad, reminiscent of \\"Always Be My Baby\\" from exactly a decade ago. The piano here is superb, twisting around Mariah's emotional vocals. She really belts the song out at the end in grand style. \\"Shake It Off\\" features Jermaine Dupri and is a catchy club hit. The beat is soft but very addictive. The vocal-whoops are catchy and tight, creating a perfect summer song. \\"Mine Again\\" is a classic Mariah ballad which might take a while to grow on you. I didn't really like it at first, but it has definitely grown on me. Mariah's vocals are very powerful here.<br /><br />\\"Say Somethin'\\" is an album highlight for me. This song features Snoop Dogg and is absolutely incredible! With The Neptunes behind this track, you might think it's becoming a bit old-hat for these guys to work on every song around, but this is very catchy and so irresistible. This is a true club banger that reminds me of Snoop's recent duet with Justin Timberlake. I love the way Mariah has arranged the vocals on this song and the hand-claps and drum beats work amazingly. \\"Stay The Night\\" has a brilliant atmosphere in it which is very soulful and old-school. The chorus is amazing and Mariah's vocals are superb, especially towards the end. \\"Get Your Number\\" features Jermaine Dupri and is another brilliant R'n'B club song with an edge. The beat is dirty and funky, and Mariah's got a really sexy whisper-section going on. \\"One And Only\\" features Twista and is a good song and is something you'd totally expect from the guest on this song. I'm not really a fan of Twista, and his rapping is so fast it makes me laugh more than anything else, but this song is so catchy.<br /><br />\\"Circles\\" is another amazing song. It's just Mariah on her own, and the instruments are kept back for most of the song. This allows Mariah's vocals space to stand on their own, which really shows her incredible vocal range. The backing vocals also really add to this song. \\"Your Girl\\" is a light, mid-tempo song which features a chimp-like voice at the start! I had big fearswhen I started listening to this, but they were dispelled as the song progressed. The chorus is very catchy and beat-laden. Mariah almost screams her lyrics in the chorus, but believe it or not, it works very well. \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" now THIS is something special! Albums usually get weaker towards the end, but obviously not in Mariah's case. This song is sung as if live on stage in front of an audience. We hear a screaming crowd going wild for Mariah, as she sings in a 60's style ode to Miss Ross. The music is very representative of that era, and the spoken section halfway through is amazing. This song also has the high-note! It's incredible, and the audience goes wild! Hehe.<br /><br />\\"To The Floor\\" features Nelly, who is an artist I usually cannot stand. However, he's working with Mariah so I'm prepared to make an exception. This song is so tight and it knows his duet with Christina out of the water! The drum beat is very funky and will bang into your brain for days on end. \\"Joy Ride\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album, but I still really like it. This song is rather sickly-sweet with soppy lyrics and a light piano. The album closes with the amazing \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\" This is one of my favourite final songs from any Mariah album, because it's the song that best epitomises EMANCIPATION on this album! Backed with a soulful and soaring gospel choir, Mariah's vocals hit the high-notes over and over in this powerful and memorable mid-tempo song about going higher and higher through the night like a bird.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album has been out for a week in the UK so I've had time to really listen to it. To be honest, I wasn't very impressed with it to begin with, but that's because other things were on my mind and I couldn't truly get myself focused on the songs. If there's any doubt about Mariah's talent, then this album will dispell those rumours. Not many artists can release albums this good after 15 years in the business, but Mariah can. That's because she has longevity and a real eye for amazing music. This is her second best album ever in my opinion, second only to the masterpiece that is \\"Butterfly.\\" I so hope this album does well in America because Mariah deserves success after the past four years. Buy this now, you'll surely not regret it.ut they were dispelled as the song progressed. The chorus is very catchy and beat-laden.

B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is way to good not to be #1! There ain't a bad song on this album and she uses a lot of the same smooth beat that Usher used!  This album has so much too it!  But in the end the VOICE is not gone! (It never was) I shouldn't have to beg to many people to buy this gem! I'd give it 10 Stars if I could Mariah's best album ever! <br />Songs that Stand out! <br />It's Like That <br />We Belong Together <br />Mine Again <br />Fly Like A Bird <br /> <br />But like I said before there are no bad tracks on this album. <br /> <br />Mariah is now and forever on Fire!
0763624292|2.0|This CD is rather a disappointment.  It starts off quietly with somewhat hushed voices that I hardly knew it had begun.  I have gotten used to the vibrant and joyous toddler cds that this was a surprise and very disappointing considering how exciting the story can be.  I like to read Going on a Bear Hunt in a happy exicted voice with little toddlers following along.  This is not that story with any of the same excited enthusiasm.  I'm sorry i bought this one without hearing any of the tracks first.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I give this a half star more then The Emancipation Of Mimi because it has a beautiful poster of Mimi herself in it! <br /> <br />Like I said on The Emancipation Of Mimi review, every track is great!  This is the kind of album you can put on and just listen to from start to finish. I even found myself stopping myself from skipping tracks because I love the song that is playing just has much.  It will bring you in and take you to another place and time.  You'll get lost in the beautiful music. <br />So go get The Emancipation Of Mimi!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Mariah's R&B Music, but I must say that this album has a lot for every fan. There's pop, r&b, hints of jazz, and even gospel. I think her voice is definitley better than Charmbracelet, Glitter, and Butterfly, although you can tell that she's not the same as she was in the 90s. But can you really expect her to be? If you like \\"It's Like That\\", buy this album b/c almost every other song on the album is better. Her second single, \\"We Belong Together\\", is great.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Ok her first single sucks, and I have previewed the rest of her album and was very dissappointed with the entire album, there is nothing new to this album it is just a new version of her later albums. Mariah needs to leave the rappers alone and go back to the old mariah that we love and know.
0698119347|5.0|This is one of the best books I ever read! I don't really like reading but this book I could not put down. It is a seat grabbing, thrilling, and AWESOME book! I would tell everyone to read it.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|I agree with the reviewers who wrote that they can't stand this CD. I'm one of those who like some of Dylan's music, and who can't stand some of it, too. <br /> <br />I borrowed it from a library, and am now returning it.  Glad I didn't buy it.
B000001FFR|5.0|I love this album. It's not as good as Among The Licing, in my humble opinion, but it still kicks arse. There are great guitar solos courtesy of Dan Spitz, with tight rhythm work from Scott Ian, great bass-lines from Frank Bello, great vocals from the legendary Joey Belladonna, and awesome drumming from Charlie Benante (esspecially in \\"Gung-Ho\\"). The album starts with \\"A.I.R.\\". It's a good song, but it isn't the best song they've done, but it still rules. Another great song is \\"Madhouse\\". I'm sure everybody has heard it, so I guess I don't need to say anything. My personal favorite track here is \\"Gung-Ho\\", the closer. I love that opening riff, and I LOVE Charlie's double-bass drumming. All in all, this is a great album. It isn't as good as Among The Living, but it comes REALLY CLOSE. This album is recommended for fans of thrash/speed metal, heavy metal, Anthrax, or just good music in general.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1. A.I.R. 5/5<br /><br />2.

B0001XTIUO|5.0|Here's a superb long-lost gem from the end of the 1960s, a perfect example of the more thoughtful & optimistic sensibilities of that time. Linda Perhacs' voice is haunting, playful, yearning, sensual, or soaring, just as each song demands. There's intelligence & a certain otherworldliness in her songs, along with an occasional streak of whimsy & mischief. An album just made for solitary listening, it will take you to a sunnier place (with patches of cool, mysterious shade) ... and isn't that what we all need at times? \\"Chimacum Rain\\" & \\"Hey Who Really Cares?\\" are standout tracks, along with the wonderfully spacey title track, which just shimmers with eerie beauty. Highly recommended!
B000060K4O|5.0|I haven't eaten or seen a marshmallow since 1984 that didn't remind me of the climax of this classic comedy.  GHOSTBUSTERS still holds up twenty years later as a marvelous takeoff on ghost movies and the prime of the SNL's cast therein.  Bill Murray is as droll as ever, interpreting his character and delivering his lines as only Murray can.  Sigourney Weaver was a comic revelation in a slightly underdeveloped role, but who can forget that sexy demonness?  Dan Aykroyd is perfect as the brilliant, if somewhat dotty, paranormal expert.  And don't hash on Harold Ramis---his stone faced delivery is a perfect compliment to the other actors.  Ernie Hudson is appropriately cast as the new recruit.  And let's not forget Rick Moranis as the nerdy neighbor and the delightfully nasty William Atherton as the EPA man, nor the hilarious Annie Potts as the ghostbusters secretary.<br /><br />The special effects are cheesy, but they are what makes this movie so delightful.  And remember, 1984 didn't have CGI effects.  All in all, GHOSTBUSTERS remains one of our finest film spoofs and set the trend for more such seriocomic thrillers of the future.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|We always expect top-notch writing from Dylan, and of course he delivers here.  But what really shocked me was how unbelievably musical it is.  A breath of fresh air, with a return to the roots of rock & roll.  Great blues, jazz, and gospel influence, with some of the best guitar work you can hear.  I agree with others who said it doesn't matter that this is from one of the greats, it's just good music, period.  Head and shoulders above anything else being released now days.  Get this record.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Whatever Mariah did to prepare for this cd was ingenious.  The choices are catchy - club conscious and youthfully contemporary (check out \\"To the Floor\\" with Nelly to hear what I mean) but not so urban it disenfranchises her very earliest fans.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"It's Like That\\" but the choices are incredible so it doesn't feel as if a single track is just filler material.  I love how much vocal flare she uses to her fullest possible potential on this cd.  She never wavers or cracks and it's wonderful to hear her in top form again.<br /><br />\\"Mine Again\\" is for her fans from the beginning as is \\"Circles,\\" a genuine love song that proves she-has-no-rival-as-a-pop-diva.  I absolutely love her gospel sound in \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\"<br /><br />She has some of the most contemporary brilliance behind her like Twista, and Jermaine Dupri but she managed to hold onto what makes her who she is.  She incorporated the best in current R&B and balances all the best of her own vocal league into a fantastic cd.  VERY highly recommended.
B000002J2D|5.0|Obviously ATTWT is a transition album for Genesis, if not THE transition from their art rock roots to their 80's pop destiny, but many fans have a difficult time placing it within the Genesis timeline.  Is it the end of the old?  Is it the beggining of the new?  Maybe it's a little of both? <br /> <br />I'm not going to go too much into a typical review here, you can read other peoples' reviews for that.  This is a re-review tailored mostly for Genesis fans, and an insistance for looking at this album in a new light.   <br /> <br />Up until this point, each Genesis album seems to have had a specific theme and atmosphere to it, whether it be rooted deep in the English psyche (as in Selling England), shrouded in a classical aura (Foxtrot, Nursery Crime), or steeped in a judeo-christian satire (Trespas, some of Foxtrot).  Trick of the Tale and Wind and Wuthering both seem to fall under the Very English category, for reasons obvious to any familiar with the albums, but And Then There Were Three seems completely alien to the Genesis catalog.  Indeed, while it shares a certain 'comfy' feeling with Trick of the Tale (at least on some tracks), the only other album that seems to resemble this one in its theme is The Lamb.  And perhaps this is no coincidence, for both albums diverge greatly from Genesis's English mystique and venture across the pond into an aura of Americana.   <br /> <br />It is no secret that much of the inspiration for The Lamb came from the band's visit to NYC during the Selling England tour.  The Big Apple must have left an impression, for it found its way into the atmosphere created by The Lamb.  Something similar seems evident in ATTWT.  Absent in this album are songs accounting old classical mythologys and biblical tales, or illustrating the warm hazy landscape of a freshly mowed English lawn complete with the indistinguishable aroma of grass clippings in the air.  This album sings about the New World.  Take a good listen to songs like \\"Down and Out\\"and \\"Ballad of the Big\\".  Or better yet, the one line from \\"Deep in the Motherlode\\" which captures this essence completely.. 'Go west young man'.   <br /> <br />ATTWT is as much a tribute to the Americana psyche as Selling England is to the British psyche.  This album is not the first of the New Genesis, it is indeed the last of the Old Genesis, answering the call to go West.. and onto newer and more profitable adventures.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It is about time, I'm so glad to see Mariah is back with a new cd. I think this is one her best albums to date, and I have to say that it is very rare for me to buy a cd and like almost every song on it and this is one of them. Some of my favorites on this cd are It's Like That, Say Somethin', Mine Again, To The Floor, but my absolute favorite song on the album is We Belong Together, it is such a beautiful song and I can't wait to hear the club mixes for it!!
B0007GAERG|4.0|Its about time Mariah starts singing in her songs instead of whispering. While I feel this is a very good cd, it still has some whispering moments, but they are all intact and where they should be. The past couple albums there was too much whisper singing and trying to sound sexy which to me ruined alot of good songs on those cds if only they had been sung better. I read in an interview she doesnt feel she should have to blow you away in every song, yet in my opnion she doesnt have to either yet come on and sing and not whisper girl!. LOL. Anyway this cd is very good. I hope it does well for her. I wasnt going to buy it, so i made sure I listened to it first before buying and I must say today Im going to go buy it. The whole cd is very good and hopefully should do well for Mariah. While my favorite music of Mariah's will always be her first 3 cd's, she will always have a place in my heart for anything she does. Good luck Mariah :)
1582403589|3.0|The artwork in this comic is good, the story is well done to. I didn't like that they copied the begining of \\"28 days later\\", but that's only one of the few negative things I can say about it. I thought it was okay. Some bits were a bit boring, but otherwise a fine comic for zombie fans to put in their collection.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is back on the charts!!!! <br />I love all songs specialy Circles,I wish u knew,and We belong together.After smash hit It's like that be sure to check out new single and video We belong together with new sexy look. <br />Emancipation of Mimi went no'1 in Japan.In UK it debuted on no 7 <br />so USA I think she deserves No1 :) <br />WE LOVE U MARIAH!!!! <br />MARIAH ON COVER OF FHM MAGAZINE MAY EDITION
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I was recently listening back to Daydream and Butterfly and found out she had a new album coming out. Anyway, its amazing! Best Mariah cd ever released in my opinion. She's back and hopefully her new cd gets the attention it deserves. I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good music.
B00001NFCY|5.0|they don't play the same technical guitars and market to artsy college students who think they're jesus christ.  just because it doesn't sound like pavement, pixies, converge, my bloody valentine, and throwing muses and other artsy i think i'm better then everyone else hype doesn't mean it's not good.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Heard them in concert on KOCE, had to have the cd...picked it up at Barnes & Noble, have enjoyed it for over a month...Chloe the 15 yr old has a wonderful voice.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey's 10th album was worth the wait.  This album is amazing.  Mariah sounds excellent on all the tracks.  My favorite are We Belong Together and Stay The Night.
B000065PUE|1.0|now every football player listens to this band.  crash and burn kiddo
B0000028VT|5.0|In the order of her best albums, I would put this at third (her debut being first and \\"Butterfly\\" being 2nd) but this album was Mariah at her commercial and vocal peak. The number do not lie: this sold a little over 25 million copies worldwide! In addition, her singles from the album stayed at no.1 for a combined total of 13 weeks! Of course, she topped that alone with her single \\"One Sweet Day\\" from \\"Daydream\\" that was no.1 for 16 weeks! Vocally I haven't heard her belt out a song with blow away voice like hers since \\"Without You\\"(the best single from the album) which was her first international hit. The Voice popped up occasionally sincebut she was at the height of her vocal powers on this album. A good example of the Voice would be \\"Hero\\" which is sappy (not in a bad way though) but incredibly inspiring. And then my favorite song on the album \\"Dreamlover\\" (I love the background sound of it)which was a huge hit and also hinted toward the direction she would take with \\"Daydream\\" and \\"Butterfly\\".
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is great and no queston about it! <br />She did a magnificent album with tons of possibles single to hit the radios <br />Her voice is stronger then ever and the music is invincible.. <br />I didnt know what to expect from Mimi but I'M SO HAPPY <br /> <br />BEST TRACKS:WE BELONG TOGETHER,SAY SOMETHINGH, STAY THE NIGHT,CIRCLES,.....ALL ARE GOOD! <br /> <br />SHE IS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK <br />
B000002BQK|5.0|While not vocally her best album (that would be \\"Music Box\\") or overall her best (that would be her debut \\"Mariah Carey\\") but artistically the one I would say is top. She had a freedom to explore the music that she really wanted to sing. Most of the album has an R&B/Hip-Hop/Pop fusion that works better than on \\"Daydream\\". However, while nothing has the R&B perfection of \\"Always be my baby\\", but \\"Honey\\", \\"My All\\", \\"Whenever You Call\\", and (what I consider the album's center-song) \\"Breakdown\\" all carry an energetic release that Mariah equally displayed on her debut. The production is great (especially \\"Breakdown\\" which I consider Mariah's best collaboration song). The lyrics are a little shallow compared to her last album but Mariah really achieved musically what she was hinting at since \\"Dreamlover\\".
B0007GAERG|5.0|OK, I admit I am in complete disbelief of how great this album is.  When I bought it, I thought OK I'll give this a try and when I listened to it I was completely floored!  This album is incredible.  It is definately the Return Of The Voice.  I really did not know Mariah still had it in her to use that incredible voice.  Her voice shines in every single song on the album.  And this has something that was missing in her last 4 albums, \\"LOTS OF POTENTIAL SINGLES\\".  I couldn't even begin to tell you what the next single should be because it would probably be the hardest decision I would have to make this year LOL.  Every single song on this album is a classic.  This is an album that has something for everyone.  It has the club tracks on it, it has mid-tempo songs, and Ballads.  If you can only buy one album this year, THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI has to be it.  GREAT JOB Mariah! <br /> <br />It's Like That- 10 out of 10.  Great club song.  Sounds great.  Puts you in the mood to listen to incredible music. <br /> <br />We Belong Together- 10 out of 10.  This is perfection.  Great sad love song.  Very emotional lyrics (I didnt mean it when I said I didn't love you so, I should've held on tight I never should've let you go..) <br /> <br />Shake It Off- 9 out of 10.  Great mid tempo song.  Similar to Confessions Part 2 by Usher. Good vocals. <br /> <br />Mine Again- 10 out of 10.  This is my personal favorite.  She belts her heart out in this song.  It has a 70's feel to it.  Vocals are INCREDIBLE! <br /> <br />Say Somethin'- 10 out of 10.  This song is so innovative.  It's definately the most unusual track on the album.  Within the first 10 seconds you will want to start dancing. <br /> <br />Stay The Night-  10 out of 10.  Incredible vocals.  This song goves me chills.  It's a mid-tempo ballad produced by Kanye West. It has an old school feel to it. <br /> <br />Get Your Number- 10 out of 10.  This is the best party song on the album.  It samples Imagination's \\"Just An Illusion\\".  This will be huge during the summer. <br /> <br />One And Only- 9 out of 10.  Great beat.  It features Twista.  Mariah keeps up with Twista very well.  She sings this very fast. <br /> <br />Circles- 10 out of 10.  Wonderful song.  It has heartfelt lyrics.  It's definately a tear jerker.  Great vocals, Especially at the end. <br /> <br />Your Girl- 10 out of 10.  Again, this is a wonderful song.  It has sort of a doo-wop feel to it.  Incredible vocals. <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew- 9 out of 10.  Very catchy song.  Similar to \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" by Alicia Keys.  Great vocals. <br /> <br />To The Floor- 10 out of 10.  This has #1 club hit written all over it.  Produced by the Neptunes.  Great to dance to. <br /> <br />Joy Ride- 10 out of 10.  Very pretty song.  Her voice is perfect.  This is the \\"baby-making\\" song of the album. LOL <br /> <br />Fly Like A Bird- 10 out of 10.  WOW.  She tears it up like there's no tomorrow towards the end of this song.  Brilliant. <br /> <br />You will hear ALOT about this album for years to come.  Welcome Back Mariah!
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is, in my opinion, The Beatles at their very best. While you can easily make a case for the uplifting Sgt. Pepper's, and many prefer their earlier work such as Revolver and Rubber Soul, to me this stands as the pinnacle of their achievement.  <br /> <br />One of the factors that sets this apart from other Beatles incursions is the light-hearted attitude of the album. From the deceptively simplistic Maxwell's Silver Hammer to the outright goofy songs such as Polythene Pam and Mean Mr. Mustard to the joyful footnote of Her Majesty, this is a showcase of the Beatles having fun, and creating brilliant music. <br /> <br />Much has been said about the second-side suite, and to me it expresses more than any of their other work the genius of the Beatles. Each of the songs in this medley is fantastic, and comes across as the skeleton of a major hit. However, to compress each of the songs into barely more than a minute and weld them together creates 10 minutes of listening which is unparallelled in modern music. <br /> <br />The first side is more reminiscent of a traditional Beatles album, but this takes nothing away from the fantastic songs that are there. True to the rest of their work, there is no filler here, each of the songs is different and excellent. Octopus's Garden is, again, the Beatles just having fun and creating great music, whereas Lennon's Come Together is truly a rock masterpiece, and is said to be one of the only Lennon songs that the man himself was satisfied with. <br /> <br />In summary, Abbey Road is a true epic, and should not be overlooked by any self-respecting fan of great music.
B000002G8H|2.0|(...) Clapton's heroin days definately produced more intersting results.   I always hear masterful, understated, laid back, and assured when describing this album and to me it's just a polite way of saying boring as hell, which is basically what every Clapton album after 461 Ocean Blvd. is.  Slowhand is a middle aged persons excuse to say they are still rocking out when they are certainly smack in the middle of the road. Cocaine is one of the most overrated songs in the history of rock & roll. Two chords and a lackluster guitar solo. I've seen bar bands look bored playing it. Wonderful Tonight is a song I wouldn't be surprised to see some aging crooner like Pat Boone cover. The ultimate wedding song, and it was Clapton's plea to his wife to get her butt in gear and get going!! That in itself is kinda funny, but still a bit pathetic. Lay Down Sally is country rock with a nice guitar riff, one of the few redeeming songs on the record, but it was overplayed when this album was released. We're All the Way is a straight country song written by Don Williams and played straight by Clapton, a glimpse of the direction he was heading. Core is probably the most rocking song on the album and the female vocals are top notch, but it goes slightly into jam band territory in what should have been a 3 minute song. The rest of the album is fairly pointless, as Clapton mauls Arthur Big Boy Crudup's difinitive Mean Ol Frisco and just rests on his laurels on the remaining songs. Clapton was capable of much better than this MOR schlock, but he has never really recovered from the blandness of this album except when playing blues with others who demand more out him, like B.B. King.
6305428042|5.0|Besides Nightmare Before Christmas, this movie really is a classic. It's the perfect movie to get anyone into the Halloween spirit.  Filled with great laughs and Disney-style suspense, it really is the epitome of a seasonal classic. Sometimes, when it's not even Halloween, I still watch it. My favorite character in this movie is Binx, a black cat that's actually a teen boy who's been cursed. But enough of that, don't confuse this movie for the one with Eddie Murphy. It doesn't even compare to this one!
0553802534|4.0|I'm a fairly new Lisa Gardner fan, having only read her books for a little over a year.  I've devoured her previous works and was anxious to get ALONE, her latest.  It definitely lived up to my expectations!<br /><br />ALONE starts off with the reader learning about a Massachusetts Trouper, Bobby Dodge, who while on duty is called out on a domestic barricade issue. Things go from bad to worse, when Bobby, serving as a sniper for the SWAT team, kills Jimmy Gagnon, a rich abusive, jerk of a guy.  This is done in front of his beautiful wife and son.<br /><br />Bobby is put on administrative leave and learns that he may have been set up to kill the abusive husband.  Could this have been a ploy by Catherine Gagnon to relieve her of the sadistic husband who was getting ready to file for divorce?  The same husband who blames her for their son's sickness.  Added to this, the parents of Jimmy are wealthy and his father is a very powerful judge - both of whom think poor Jimmy didn't deserve to die, even if he was holding a gun on his wife and child.<br /><br />You'd think Catherine had enough to deal with before this situation - she had been kidnapped when she was a child and held for 28 days by a pedophile.  Now she must deal with the death of her husband, a custody fight for her son, the son's mysterious illness, and the unexpected release from prison of the man of her nightmares.<br /><br />Soon people close to Catherine begin to die and the cops and DA begin to suspect that Bobby is involved.  At this point, there are so many support characters it's hard to keep them all clear.  In fact, one character had been introduced at the end, and I was left wondering if I had forgotten her from the previous pages.  Nope, introduced and killed in the matter of a few pages...<br /><br />The action doesn't stop in this book and I read with moderate interest - it was a typical mystery plot.  But Gardner fooled me, 50 pages from the end, a huge plot twist takes place that put me at the edge of my seat.  It instantly went from an OK book to a very good tome.<br /><br />The development of the two main characters (Bobby and Catherine) is excellent.  Some supporting characters are also well developed, but the majority has only minor progress in this area.  The plot is good, but some of the sub-plots could have been weeded out (along with the associated support cast) and it would have been a much smoother read.<br /><br />Having the unexpected plot twist at the end is what made this book wonderful!  Ms. Gardner didn't let the readers down and this is another great psychological thriller!t me at the edge of my seat.

0061091480|5.0|My mother recommended this book to me- she had an old 1970s edition, when it was first released.  It soon fell apart because I read and lended it to so many people, so many times.  This is an incredible book that states in simple, beautiful terms the intrinsic ability for everyone to control how they feel, love themselves, and LOVE LIFE!  If you ever find yourself apologising for no reason, allowing others to manipulate you, or feel depressed based on externalities, Wayne Dyer describes specific steps one can take to never be bored or out of control again, ironically by realizing so much of life is OUTSIDE of our control, and thus the only thing we can control is our reaction to life. <br /> <br />\\"Get busy living, or get busy dying\\" <br />- The Shawshank Redemption <br /> <br />Highly recommended self-help and self-esteem builder- this book will, if not change your life, teach you steps to take control of it!  :-)
B0007GAERG|3.0|This newest CD isn't the greatest, but I think it is much better than Chambracelet.  My favorite Mariah albums are still Emotions and Butterfly.
B00028FDRA|5.0|I have to say, Comalies by itself is not worthy of a 5 star review.  It's not that it's bad music by ANY stretch, it's simply not as experimental as their last several discs.  All the songs, incidentally, are very close in tempo... although the feel of songs change. <br /> <br />That being said, the original Comalies has some wonderful offerings, such as the first 4 tracks, The Prophet Said, etc.  But the real magic in this set is in the second CD. <br /> <br />First off, I got this in the US domestically for the price of a normal CD.  Don't let this price fool you as the only way to get this set.  Secondly, I'm beginning to believe that Lacuna Coil's signature sound should not have been the stuff you hear on the radio.  I think it should have been the acoustic sound you hear on the last 7 tracks of the second CD.  The 12 string guitars combined with the mellowness of Cristina's voice (which at long last doesn't sound forced due to softer music), and the true range of Andrea Ferro's voice, which is nice and low, instead of the higher pitched stuff he usually \\"pulls off\\", make these songs which fans will already know a whole new experience.  I actually heard the acoustic version of Senzafine before the hard version, and between the two I'll take the acoustic most days.  This is where they actually shine brightest; where they never meant to.  Aeon, by the way, should never have been electric based on what I heard of the radio acoustic version. <br /> <br />Incidentally, the videos run kind of funny, which might be only me and my friend's computers, but they're very well made, with some awesome effects and scenery.  I haven't found the desktop themes... I'll have to look through that later.  Buy and enjoy, folks.  And stop comparing them to or with Evanescence... dark lyrics and a female voice doesn't make two bands alike.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album has no fillers, and every song is great in its own way..Mariah proves that she is truly a legend.  15 years into her already record breaking career, she has put out her hottest album ever. We Belong Together, It's Like That, Mine Again, Stay The Night, Get Your Number are just a few very radio friendly hits...The biggest selling female artist of all time is back with avengence...
0385512058|5.0|I love this book, and wish I'd been handed the wisdom it contains as I stepped from the stage at graduation.  <br /> <br />What I enjoyed most is its plainspoken, rubber-meets-road applicability: Ferrazzi has distilled his natural gifts and hard-won insights into an engrossing roadmap of human interaction and business we all can put to use starting now.  The networking and time-management advice is powerful, yet there is no MBA-speak to be found here -- just candid, \\"tell-it-like-it is\\" guidance on effectively interacting with others, laid out in refreshing prose that I imagine both Andrew AND Dale Carnegie would enjoy and endorse.  Ferrazzi peppers his book with sometimes hilarious and often intimate \\"behind-the-scenes\\" personal examples from his high-wattage career that illustrate his principles indelibly.  Is he brash, insouciant and nearly-over-the-top?  Yes!  But his understanding of human nature rings true, his take on the power of human interdependence is bang-on and his book offers tools every ambitious person can use.  Besides, we all need out-size models to point the way -- they provide memorable guidance and add color to life.  <br />  <br />As Emerson said: Only Connect!
B000069AUI|5.0|First of all, the popularity of bashing Coldplay, while fairly universal, is ridiculous. The foundations of such arguments are based on the precept that either a: somehow fame automatically negates any talent or creativity, or b: being mellow means being bad. If a reader of this review cares to defend either of those points of view, feel free to post a dissenting post; we'll have a nice debate of sorts. For the select few Coldplay dislikers who have hated the band from the day they first heard Yellow, I have a glimmer of respect. <br /> <br />Seondly, whoever Clark from Toledo is, take a bow, buddy. You are one of an increasing group who are realizing that the post-punk rock/pop hip-hop we grew up with in the 90s was an absolute travesty to music, and to the legacy of Kurt Cobain, the unwilling postmortem leader of that movement. I have tremendous respect for you (and frankly I LIKE rap). And I agree, why Amsterdam is not universally acclaimed as one of the most moving songs ever recorded entirely baffles me. <br /> <br />Anyway, I think everyone (including those who dislike Coldplay) probably owns this album, or at least has stolen Clocks from Kazaa, so I won't insist that anyone buy it. I will however encourage anyone who is interested to join me in waiting outside the music store on the night June 5 (June 6 release date for X&Y, see Coldplay's site for details).

B0007GAERG|5.0|This is, so far, the best album to be released this year.  it is pure r&b top to bottom.   <br />stand-out tracks are: <br />2. We Belong Together (about to be a HUGE hit) <br />6. Stay The Night (i believe will be 3rd single, hot tamale) <br />7. Get Your Number (SHOULD be 3rd single. people will buy the album for this song by itself!) <br />9. Circles (heartbreaking ballad...especially the 2nd verse.  my favorite song lyrically) <br /> <br />Overall this album will be a commercial and critical success.  with such mass appeal it's bound to garner a few more hit singles, and probably a few awards come next spring.  Go Mimi!
B000001ES9|5.0|Rush - First formed of Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee, and John Rutsey - put out this album which most Led Zeppelin fans thought of as Led Zeppelin's newest album at the time. Many of the hard-core Rush fans today, like myself, see this album as an apparent lack of something. Something's missing from this album. And what would that be? Neil Peart. He had not yet arrived to the band, but would during the same year as this album was released. The obvious absence of Neil Peart leaves us with \\"Ooh\\" and \\"Baby\\" lyrics that both Alex and Geddy composed at the time - some in only five minutes. While Alex and Geddy show their skill, John Rutsey is the odd man out. He's no Neil Peart, that's for sure, but he'll remain in the band until Mr. Peart arrives. At this time, a general description of the band is that they were kids, having fun and with no certain forward direction of progress. <br /> <br />The hard-rockin' debut album opens up with Finding My Way, an anthem that is great to listen to. Alex is on the guitar, and he would rival Jimmy Page. The music flows smoothly throughout this whole song, and it's a great way to kick off a one-time-only album. <br /> <br />Need Some Love is next on the playlist. Played often during their first tour, but has been forgotten over time. It is the shortest track on the album, and is just as good as Finding My Way. <br /> <br />The third track in this Zeppelin-esque album is Take A Friend, which is among the very few Rush songs to have never been played live. This is full of guitar, and is an awesome song to listen to. You'll get this stuck in your head for hours - maybe even days. Just remember, \\"Take yourself a friend, keep 'em 'till the end...\\" <br /> <br />This is where side one of the album comes to a close, with perhaps the deepest song on the entire album. Here Again is one of two extended tracks (the other being Working Man) that would pave the way for future epics such as By-Tor & The Snow Dog, The Necromancer, The Fountain Of Lamneth,and so on. This seven-minute plus ballad is surprisingly excellent. Played often in the band's early touring days, and was a crowd favorite. <br /> <br />Side two of the album kicks off with a furious hard-rocker, titled What You're Doing. This song became a popular live show closer well into the late 80's of the band's touring years. The lyrics are fun to sing and listen to, and is a simple song which is just great to hum. <br /> <br />In The Mood is another live show closer for the Power Trio, often played in a medley form. Accompanied by Fly By Night on the All The World's A Stage album, this song was one of the band's earliest written, going back two to three years before the debut album was released. Like What You're Doing, this song stuck in the setlist well into the 80's tours and the lyrics are composed entirely by Geddy Lee. <br /> <br />Before And After is very Led Zeppelin-like, and is another song that has never been played live. It is almost like a cut-down version of Here Again, but just as good. The track kicks off with an acoustic intro, then plunges into hard-rockin'.  <br /> <br />And finally, the album closes with what quite possibly could be the best song on the entire album, Working Man. This song appealed to the midwest of the United States, and with good reason. This is a serious hard-rocker, and it's not hard to imagine Jimmy Page at the guitar of this one. The middle of the track contains a kick-ass solo, which displays Alex's best guitar work. Good luck trying to play this song by yourself! <br /> <br />This album is an excellent way to begin a long career in the music industry. This is what built their fan base that stuck with them through more of their early albums. John Rutsey would leave the band before touring began, due to diabetes and the sheer workload of the extensive touring schedule. However, this would prove to be a blessing in disguise as the world's most talented drummer would grace the presence of Alex and Geddy - which we shall see on the next album to come - Fly By Night.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|i got this cd because im a fan of mariah carey and loved her other albums. so when i heard some songs on this cd i was pretty impressed. and i suggest you get this cd as soon as possible.
B00003CY5J|4.0|There's a fence, a weary veteran safecracker, and an eager outsider.  There's a valuable whatsit in the Montreal Custom House that's guarded as if it were the crown jewels.  It ain't quite that, but it is a many-centuries old scepter that's worth tens of millions of dollars.  It's got `last big score' written all over it.  The eager young one has an assistant janitor job at the Custom House and is in the perfect position to case the joint, get the schematics, cut the video feed, what have you.<br /><br />  Sound familiar?  Save for a end game twist or two THE SCORE is pretty much the same heist movie you've seen time and again.  It's a strong enough story that doesn't stray too far at all from the tried and true.  What sets this movie apart is its cast.  To say THE SCORE is actor rich is an understatement.  Its three leads - Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Ed Norton - have all been hailed the greatest actors of their generation.  Brando plays the fence, De Niro the old pro who wants to pull off one last job before calling it quits, and Norton the neophyte looking for respect. Director Frank Oz wisely highlights characters and the `job' intrudes only when necessary.  With a different cast I probably wouldn't have liked this one nearly as much as I did, but Brando, De Niro, and Norton are all on their game and a joy to behold.<br /><br />  The special features includes trailers, a short `making of' feature, a commentary track with Oz and cinematographer Rob Hahn and three or four unused scenes, one of which features Brando and De Niro improvising a scene.  The track lasts about four minutes and shows the two going through the same minute or so long bit of business three times.  I've never seen two actors of this caliber building a scene before, and it's fascinating to see them hit the same marks - Will you do it? , six million, I always pay your fair - while shading each take differently. It's my favorite four minutes on the dvd.<br /><br />  What the heck, heist movies have been done but they're fun.  The characters in this movie are layered and interesting.  A strong recommendation for THE SCORE.n done but they're fun.  The characters in this movie are layered and interesting.  A strong recommendation for THE SCORE. <br />
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|Ray Charles is a legend and with good reasons....The reasons he became a legend are not so evident on this overtly commercial, syrupy, sappy, overproduced, and highly stylized characterization of Ray by Ray and this label on this album . . . . many of the guest stars don't belong on the same stage let alone in the same studio.<br /><br />I understand the success of this and how this works so well for the Krall fan or Norah fan who wants Ray lite.... but I must say: The duets feel so phony, so sterile that it is a disappointment.<br /><br />This isn't so much music as it is candy, prepared for commercial sale on a vast scale. Gives me cavities. Makes my tummy hurt. ask a musician - call me if you find one who cares for this album.<br /><br />Oh Ray , we miss you so. I'm sure you'd have really enjoyed all this success and the huge success of the movie.<br /><br />I love Ray, just don't expect this album to represent him so well. There are so many better albums and tracks from his career and from those musicians that particpated..... This is cheese<br /><br />This is a prefab confab. Go delve in and get the real thing and develop a soul!<br /><br />(written after this has sold about 10 million worldwide- whats the point:)
6305546789|5.0|John Carpenter's groundbreaking masterpiece slasher \\"HALLOWEEN\\" may very well be the best of its genre! Put part 1 & 2 together as one whole movie & you have for sure got the best slasher flick ever! One of my very favorite horror films.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is genius! It's a must have for any CD collection. Mariah gives great vocal performances on all tracks and occasionally hits her signature glass shattering notes. Honestly it's an album that you can play from beginning to end and it has the perfect mix of ballads and uptempo songs. I have to say \\"The Voice aka Ms. Mariah Carey\\" is back. I love \\"We Belong Together \\" ,\\"I Wish you Knew\\"  \\"Be Mine\\" , \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" and her collaborations are great.
B000007S5B|4.0|I can't really understand why people feel this is The Doors most pop oriented album. It is actually very similar to Strange Days in the fact that it is psychedelic. Yes The River Knows, Summers almost Gone, and The Unkwn Soldier are all great. As are the less psychedelic Love Street, Five To One, and the signature song Hello, I love you which is pretty pop sounding. All the other songs are pretty good with the exception of Not TO Touch The Earth, i really do not like this song. Then there is Spanish Caravan which i think is the album's best song and one of The Doors' best.  <br /> <br />ALl Together this album isnt as consistently good as every other doors album exceprt for The Soft Parade which this beats out slightly. Then again every Doors album is great, and this is an excellent output from one of the greatest rick groups ever. If you like a strange, slow, haunting but mellow music this album and all Doors albums are for u.
630521610X|4.0|Scream is the first decent scary teen slasher movie I have seen. I have watched it like maybe seven times and I never get tired of it. It's the best horror movie ever!! If you are not affected by things like killing, blood, gore, intense graphic violence or if you get scared easily then this movie is for you, but if you are this movie is a no-no. Some parts are scary: like when Tatum gets killed in the garage at Stu's party. The most scariest part is in the begining when Casey Becker gets killed. It's the best part in the whole movie. <br />But still, Scream is the best scary film out there and one of the classics, and a must-see for all horror and teen slasher movie fans.
1559408855|2.0|The enigmatic Pier Paolo Pasolini final piece of work was quite the statement. Pasolini was man not afraid to state his views and did so rather grotesquely in Salo. A film which was difficult to `digest' did have some underlying meaning. Pasolini successfully was able to show the harsh reality of living under a fascist regime and how it feels to be controlled. A fervent Marxist, Pasolini made a political statement in the film and also tried to show the disintegration of society's values. So to put it lightly the film was filled meaning, but the manner in which his message is portrayed is disturbing to say the least.
B000002JSP|4.0|Everyone is quick to bash this album, even though it is perhaps their most progressive of all.  Their sound had to change over their 11 year existence and it finally did on In Through the Out Door.  Anyone who says the the synthesizers detract from the quality of the album is just being silly.  If they kept with the same old style, which was not in any way getting old, they could not call themselves an actual BAND that makes actual MUSIC that actually has to CHANGE over time.  They owed it to themselves, as well as the fans, to show everyone what they were made of and come out with something a bit different.  In Through the Out Door is no better nor no worse than any of the other Zep masterpieces and anyone who thinks any different is really not a TRUE Zeppelin fan, but someone who is meerly finding small flaws in the greatest collaboration of talent ever put together.  May Zep's music live on forever to show future generations what music should actually sound like.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying I am a big fan of Jay-Z.  When I heard he was doing something with Linkin Park, I didn't really know what to expect (they made Collision Course, a great six song album, a must buy).  Anyway I bought this album to see if Linkin Park was anygood on there own.  I like this album a lot.  Though in one song they try to rap and it's just not good.  Linkin Park I think you guys should drop the rap and stick to rock music because you're very good at it.  This is a great album and if you liked Collision Course your going to like this.
0440238609|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've ever read. It is intelligent, subtle, deep, exceptionally well written, defies comparison or classification; and it will tickle your imagination up to the very last page. A great look at the intricacy and complexity of the world, and our place in it.  <br />
B00004SZWD|5.0|I first came across this Album in the summer of 1991 whilst on Holiday at my Uncle's Place in France <br /> <br />He has a Wide Range of 60's and 70's Records <br /> <br />If he was to auction the record I am sure he may get something for it <br /> <br />This LP took 2 years to make and is among one of the Very best Double Albums ever Made, I also came across Innervisions, Hotter than July, Talking Book at the same time whilst on the same Holiday. This Album is just some of the Very Best Music you will ever come across. One thing I have not heard many people talk about is the Track \\"Contusion\\". It's one of those songs that goes well with Driving on Country Roads at great Speeds (Just be careful not to go too mad). Please if anyone is going to add to the Review after me, say something about Contusion, this track alone Ranks up with Earth Wind and Fire, Average Whiteband and Heatwave, as for the Rest, Just Discover what is Missing in Modern Day R&B. This Album will not Date <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am soooo happy that Mariah is back with such an amazing and beautiful album!  I was disappointed with \\"Charmbracelet,\\" and Glitter was actullay a bit underrated.   <br /> <br />But she comes back real strong with this album.  For those of you who don't like it on first listen, it quickly grows on you, and you're singing all the songs.  Mariah's voice is def. the focus of this album, and it sounds wonderful.  I am happy to have an album to once again be able to listen to EVERY song on it and be happy.  I haven't been able to do that since Butterfly (with Mariah CDs that is).   <br /> <br />It is almost impossible to pick some favorites, but if I had too they would be: We Belong Together, Shake it Off, Mine Again, Say Somethin', Stay the Night, Circles, Your Girl, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird.   <br /> <br />Wonderful is all can say.
1593973594|2.0|It is amazing what a best seller can do for an author's previous efforts. Dan Brown has managed to turn `The De Vinci Code' into a vehicle for his other works. `Digital Fortress' is bad, bad, bad. It is a stupid plot; for example the National Security Agency, the most secret, secure, agency in US government hires a convicted felon with a record of security violations to work in the crypto center because he busted and exposed an NSA effort to tap emails! The story is supposed to be two simultaneous plots; one in Washington D.C., one in Italy. But the point of view is all screwed up. The story line in DC takes hours that in Italy takes days. And that ain't the worst! At the Climax of the book someone announces there are 3 minutes left until the end of civilization as we know it. This is followed by 10 minutes of action! Then 2 minutes! followed by 5 minutes of action. 1 minute! 5 more minutes of action! Is that all? No! 30 seconds! more action, 15 seconds! more action, 3 seconds! followed by at least 5 minutes of action! I'm not kidding! Doesn't this guy, or his editors, own a watch? There are entire chapters about two characters opening a door! And to top everything off, the book is suppose to be about codes, but it seems Brown doesn't know the difference between a code and a riddle! It is a riddle that solves the entire boring mess. The book, and Audio CD which I listened to, is boring and badly written and I strongly urge you to avoid buying this junk.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Music has so many different meanings for people. OK Computer is one single musical piece; a song with twelve different movements. Is this a concept album? I do not know. It seems that over the last eight years, this album has meant different things to me. At 33, I relate the album to the hidden frustrations that we experience while we are mired in the socioeconomics of corporate structure. We put on our smart business attire. We go to work. We work 60+ hours climbing the corporate ladder. When we are at home; in the dark, washing dishes, or in the shower, we are struck with a thought. Who are we? Are these my hands? Is this my house? At those times we dwell on the `what ifs', we try to remember who we are, where we are going, or just plain think/stare at the walls. What hits me the most now is the words of \\"Fitter Happier\\". Are you happier because you are \\"getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries\\"?  <br /> <br />The song (or spoken word piece) goes on to contradict the message in the earlier verses. This is the feeling that many individuals face as they become older. Are you living your life, or are you living as you are told?  <br /> <br />OK Computer is a very adult album. It makes you think. I believe this is the reason that people love this album. The music creates something; a thought, a memory, or motivation to write/paint/go hiking/sing a song/ride a bus/be a better consumer/and so on. Other individuals enjoy the bread and circuses aspect of American pop. These individuals will not enjoy this album. It is a preference, nothing more. <br /> <br />Buy this album if you enjoy thought provoking music. Do not buy it if you avoid such products. Regardless, this album will be one that your children will share with their peers in the distant future. It has a timeless quality that will survive the evolution of music.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is Truly the first Mariah Carey CD that I have listened to the first time buying it and have loved it from beginning to the end.  She is a true acrobat with her voice.  This is the best I have heard her in years. But this album!!!!!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I bought this cd because I am in my third trimester (yeeeeeah) of pregnancy and my little girl listens to a lot of classical music but I wanted for her to hear a variety of songs with different tempos. I want her to feel comfort in knowing that her mommy is here and will love her, care for her and sing with her and to her. My favorite songs in this CD are: of course we will start with Miracle because that is what she IS for me. (complications before pregnancy and in 1st and very early 2nd trimester) Brahms lullaby is a classic.. \\"If I could\\" is one of my favorites that I play over and over for her especially because she says to the baby that all bad if she could she would change and make good only if she could... I definitely would change the world if I could so my baby girl could come into a brighter, easier, happier, peacefully world- ONLY IF I COULD.. hehe... \\"a mothers prayer\\" is nice and the \\"1st time I ever saw your face\\" is beauuuutiful..... lets just say that the rest of the songs are very nice and the whole cd is played to my baby right along with the song by Martina McBride \\"My reluctant daughter\\".. she is going to be the sun in the clouds in my life and I will be happy with my baby girl... so 2 big thumbs up for this cd as well...
0061015725|5.0|Nano-bots have been written about a lot in science fiction novels. Even if you hate science fiction, this book will change your mind. The only thing I can say is AWSOME!!! <br /> <br />On the positive side it got a great science fiction story and purple babies. <br /> <br />On the negative side in the beginning it focuses to much on his marital problems. <br />
B0007TKNL0|1.0|The film tells the story of the of a young and upcomming opera star, And the love for Christine. This was a film brinking on disaster from the word go. When I had herd they had made This film I wanted to see it, I had been warned from sone of my friends(Who sing in stage playes)not to waste my time, I had to find out for myself.  <br />Not as bold as Evita (excellent film)or Jesus Christ Superstar But don't get me wrong but i wasn't expecting anyone to be as good as Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman or even Madonna(in Evita) in this film, but I was exepecting actors who could act and singing to match.  <br />Why (in my opinion) would you get actors that can't act or sing when there are hundreds maybe even thousands of people, that would jump at the chance of a roll of a life time. <br />The songs are great, but Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lacks the singing power To make them great songs. Jennifer Ellison (playes Meg Giry), would have made a better Christine if she was a little louder. It did add some comfort when Raoul steped on stage, he was the best actor of all. He could sing and act. <br />If you don't stop watching after hearing the excruciatingly bad rendition from the Phantom of \\"Music of the night\\". You where warned, this is not one to waste your time with.
0385507755|5.0|A Million Little Pieces is certainly one of the best books I've written in quite a long time. His writing style--lacking quotation marks, paragraph indentations, and most commas--does an excellent job of conveying a profound sense of desperation and near-defeat.  For me, Frey's most impressive achievement is his ability to write about personal emotional exchanges in a very simply way without seeming cliched or overly sentimental. The only story in the book that seems a little unrealistic is his relationship with Lilly. Otherwise, this is a fantastic read.
0670033693|5.0|I'm always reading a stack of books at any given time. The better books wind up at the top of the stack. Johnson's book made it to the top and stayed there till the surprising conclusion. The characters jump off the page and the plot heats up in the very first chapter. While Johnson's strong suit is the imaginative and interesting characters he creates and sets in motion, I also enjoyed the richness of the background he provides including the quirky small-town Wyoming culture, the intertwining of an American Indian perspective, and the history behind \\"sharp shooting\\". I'm looking forward to the next visit from this memorable cast of characters.
B000002KMV|5.0|This album is in many ways a companion album to Dirty Mind. Many similar styles are tried out and performed that were on the previous album. <br />However, Prince has gotten more ambitious. Controversy was his longest song to that point, I believe, and was similar to Dirty Mind yet more political. In fact, the whole album is political with Prince shouting off about his own view points which are sometimes surprisingly conservative. Not that they're anything Regan would like, but just conservative for Prince.  <br />The ballads are better on this album too. And the song rock harder: Ronnie Talk To Russia features some of Prince's best guitar work. Some say it's a pale retread of Dirty Mind: not so. It's similar, yet Prince finds enough variations on the style to keep things interesting. Must have.

0783225849|5.0|I am a total Psycho fan and often watch the movie just to fall asleep to. So, when I finally got the movie on dvd I was freakin out because of the over an hour of bonus features which was all behind the scenes of the movie stuff. Very cool and might I add that Janet Lee was one very cool and very down to earth actress.
0316172324|2.0|I agree with mr. bookworm, this book doesn't contain any secrets or insight...and I'm still not sure of the point...but some of the studies are amusing...though taking a nap could possibly be more useful if you have some insightful dreams...
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ah, yes, the much talked about Star Wars Trilogy DVDs.  <br /> <br />Personally, I'm happy to have any version of the films available on DVD. And indeed the visual and audio quality is superb - the old VHS editions just don't do the films justice.  <br /> <br />Now the real problem emerges when you start talking about Lucas's changes. First he comes out with the \\"Special Editions\\" in 1997. We get CGI stuff added to Mos Eisley. These effects are cheesy, and you can tell they're from '96 or '97. Although Star Wars fans grimaced, we probably could have tolerated it if Lucas had stopped there. <br /> <br />But no - he decided to tinker his movies further with this DVD release. He gets rid of Boba Fett's awesome original voice, instead using the guy from Attack of the Clones who played Jango. He adds a ridiculous scene in Jabba's lair with some CGI weirdo. I would say this scene is worse than anything Jar Jar Binks ever did/said on screen (which is saying a lot).  <br /> <br />Even with all this stuff, SW fans STILL would probably accept the films...but then Lucas adds Christiansen at the end of Return of the Jedi. I personally don't really mind...but I don't understand it either. What difference does it make if Christiansen or Sebastian Shaw is seen at the end? Why not replace Alec Guiness with Ewan McGregor too? It just doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br />In my mind this whole debate would go away if Lucas would just release the original versions on DVD. Then fans could choose for themselves. I think they will, someday. Lucas at first was reluctant to put even these versions on DVD, but he was forced to when people were getting them by bootleg. Same thing is going to happen with the originals. Lucas is going to cave someday and release them...maybe at the same time he releases a \\"super\\" set with all six episodes.  <br /> <br />Lucas has said these are his movies and he can do what he wants with them, and that's fine. But I think any more alterations to the movies willcause open revolt against Lucas :)  <br /> <br />I love the movies, and if this is the only version I can have on DVD then I guess I'll live with it.

B000002MT0|4.0|This is kind of like Lovesexy. Great grooving, great playing, and short enough for a sit down and listen once thing. But the songs aren't memorable usually. It's kind of a different sound for him, kind of darker, but he never went back here. Of course it's a contractual obligation but it's not bad I think. The title track is damn good and so is Space.
B0007YVBFC|5.0|Can somebody tell me if this is the Japanese Edition? Because I can see \\"Sprung\\" but no \\"Secret love\\"...
B0007Y4USW|5.0|This is a review from USA today, which I totally agrre with: <br /> <br />With her imitators all over radio and American Idol, it's sometimes hard to recall what pop-soul music sounded like before Carey came along. The diva herself remembers, though, as evidenced by the wistful, old-school vibe on Mine Again, Circles and other endearing new tunes. Breezy, playful tracks such as Say Somethin' (featuring Snoop Dogg) and Get Your Number (with Jermaine Dupri) prove the singer hasn't forsaken her passion for hip-hop. But it's the ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.  <br /> <br />The limited edition also contains an awesome fold-out poster. Worth buying.
0743454529|1.0|Gosh, what a busy little novel.  There's hardly a character who's not totally maxed out their crisis \\"credit limits.\\"  Mom and Dad fall in love and have a boy and a girl.  Girl gets sick.   Mom and Dad create a spare girl for sick girl.  Boy is awfully neglected and develops a right temper, one might even say, fiery.  Ironic see, 'cause dear old Dad, gosh he's  a fire-fighter. Oh, and a backyard astronomer.  Meanwhile spare girl contacts a lawyer who just happens to have a mysterious canine called \\"Judge.\\"  Get it?  A lawyer has a dog named Judge.  Clever.  This is the basis for many witty remarks as various business proprietors remind \\"Judge\\" that no lawyers are allowed on their premises.  Then there's the court-appointed guardian who, though straight, naturally has a lesbian twin sister.  Oh, and she just happens to be said lawyer's long-lost, jilted, first love.  The straight one, not the gay one.  Oh, and the evil Mom, she's a lawyer, too, and ends up representing sick girl but really just herself.  Oh, and nurses, aren't they just the nicest people?  One thing I did learn: Rhode Island, the setting of this novel, truly *is* our smallest state. <br /> <br />Practically obscured inside \\"Sister's Keeper\\" is a really cool idea for a novel, one that would explore the obligations parents have toward children, and each of us has to one another.  Picoult didn't end up writing that novel though it's fairly evident she could have--she has the necessary talent.  Do stay tuned though to find out about \\"Judge.\\"  Arf, arf.
6302767741|5.0|This is a \\"comfort movie\\" for me -- always great to watch. Fans of Hugh Laurie ('Blackadder'series, 'Sense & Sensibility', currently on 'House' on Fox) will enjoy seeing him here, along with Emma Thompson, Kenneth Brannaugh, and Imelda Staunton (most recently Oscar nominated for 'Vera Drake'). Great laughs in this one -- please, a DVD would be great!!
B000002L9B|5.0|That is a bit untrue. This album at times does seem like a run at Sign O. But it's not a fair comparrison: this album is MUCH lusher than Sign O, and just as brilliant. The songs man, the songs. This album also fufills the promise made on Around The World, ten fold. <br />Highlights \\"Life Can Be So Nice\\" and \\"Mountains\\" one of Prince's lushest songs. Anotherloverholeinyohead which is a great Prince funk song, Kiss which is an AMAZING Prince funk song, and all the ballads. They are as equally brilliant as the funk songs, something Prince sometimes couldn't pull off.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This marks Mariah's second album from Universal and is better than that dismal Charmbracelet, or Rainbow, or, yes, Glitter. <br /> <br />This is from a review from USA today, which i totally agree with: <br />With her imitators all over radio and American Idol, it's sometimes hard to recall what pop-soul music sounded like before Carey came along. The diva herself remembers, though, as evidenced by the wistful, old-school vibe on Mine Again, Circles and other endearing new tunes.

B0007V5WUU|4.0|The last album by the Queens of the Stone Age was \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" a frenetic collection of the hardest kind of rock. It was a thrilling, visceral experience, not one soon forgotten. Then nude bassist Nick Oliveri departed from the band, taking the wilder edge of the band with him. Oh, what would become of the Queens of the Stone Age?<br /><br />Well, if \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is any indication, then they are doing fine. This album relies on Josh Homme, and it's stripped down to... well, not down to the bare bones, but some very strong, lean sinew. The albums opens with a little acoustic ballad, \\"Lullaby,\\" which starts things off on a strong footing.<br /><br />From there on, things get stranger -- fast paced songs that just keep speeding up, ominous buildups, and nightmarish undertones.There are moments of quieter catchiness -- \\"Little Sister\\" seems perfect for the album's first single. And a few tracks feel a bit like filler. But overall, \\"Lullabies\\" is very much in the flavour of the Queens' second album, \\"Rated R.\\" Only darker and somehow more whimsical.<br /><br />Singer/songwriter/guitarist Josh Homme gets to rule in this one. Truth be told, he ruled all through the Desert Sessions, Kyuss, and now he sits in the middle of the Queens of the Stone Age, like a sinister-but-not-evil mastermind. Oliveri's manic style and gimmicks are gone, and in their place is steady, dark rock'n'roll that takes strange and unexpected twists.<br /><br />It's not a concept album, but it feels that way -- the mood gets generally creepier as \\"Lullabies\\" goes on. Fuzzy guitars, dark metallic riffs, and eerie harmonies get a few unusual flourishes, such as that broken music box. And Homme's vocals blend into the songs like another instrument -- great stuff. It only emphasizes how central he is to the band's unique sound.<br /><br />Queens of the Stone Age seemed to be endangered when Oliveri departed, but \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" shows that the band is just fine. Not quite perfect, but a solid creation.ne. Not quite perfect, but a solid creation.
0385512104|4.0|This was a very interesting look into the world of autism.  Knowing absolutely nothing previously of this condition, Christopher's first person narration clearly illustrated the way he thought and lived.  The story begins when he finds his neighbor's dog cruelly murdered, and he decides to use his detecting skills to figure out who did it and why.  His lack of emotion, brilliant mathematical skills, and innocence of one not knowing how to lie makes for a unique outlook on life, relationships and science.  A nice change from the usual, I recommend.
B000002LE6|4.0|The Black Album wasn't going to be done. So Prince did this album. It's ONE track which was a bad idea. One of his first really bad ones. However, the music is compelling. Not much on here is really as memorable as his earlier stuff, but there is a lot of fun music on the album. I never want to turn this album off when I listen to it. I haven't listened to it much, I've only owned it a year or so. So I can't really describe the individual songs very well. I think it's worth getting, but not first.
0394800184|5.0|There's nothing deep here, but \\"Are You My Mother?\\" has a simple eloquence in the story that seems to enchant small children. The drawings, too, are simple but appealing. This is classified as a \\"I can read it all by myself\\" book, but I've found it best as \\"read-aloud\\" book for my two kids at around age 2.  My son, now 2, asks for this book again and again.  <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah lost it for me after \\"Daydream\\"....very depressing. But this IS the Mariah I have been missing for 10 years!!!! <br /> <br />Not one bad song at all!!!!!!!! Which is awesome to pay for 14  GREAT songs and no filler! <br /> <br />Another great CD to cruise and listen to on the headphones!!!!!
B0007O38F8|3.0|Now im no fan of 50 cent and i think he can't rap at all and if it wasn't for the beats that Dre produces for him and his flow then his music would be complete garbage.This cd at first was garbage for me but after listening to it a lot it is actually an all right LP.Even tho he has absolutely nothing to actually rap about except things that mean nothing like his money and cars about half the songs are catchy and i give the man credit because he sells records and he will be known forever in hip-hop history which is y i had to pick up this cd so i have a piece of hip-hop history.
B000002L68|5.0|The album where Prince finally completely synthesized all his influences into a giant melting pot of genius. Of course, the movie is really stupid but we all know that. What matters is the music. Let's talk about the music. <br />Well, Prince has pushed synths to the background. Way to the background. Oh yes, they're still there but Prince has replaced his synth layering wizardy with something else: a full band. For the first time in his career, Prince plays with a full band and the results are shocking. Going from full muscular rock and roll roar, to delicate balladry, the band Prince had chose was not only accomplished but diverse and ready to challenge various styles. And they do. <br />Not only is the album more full arrangement wise because of the band, it is also more spontaneous, and it breathes more. Earlier Prince albums could be seen as a bit claustrophobic. Not here. This is a wide open technicolor album. Prince wanted to do everything on this album, and he achieved that. He would continue to try to do everything for his whole career, and though his albums remained brilliant for over 90 percent of his career, none ever his this peak. Purple Rain is one of hte most beautiful songs ever, that alone gives it a five. BUY IT NOW. <br />
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Mariah's newest album is absolutely great! In her last album, Charmbracelet, she did a lot of soft singing and whispering, but in this one she's got lots more strong vocals and lots of the high notes that she's famous for. It's almost like she's getting back to her roots, where she sang very powerfully and did lots of variations. While I wish she would stop doing collaborations with rappers, which this album has 4 of, it's still worth the money. If you are or ever were a Mariah Carey fan, add this album to your collection.

B00005QDW1|5.0|After 1995's undisputed breakthrough \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", it was almost inevitable that attempting a similarly-awesome follow-up would be a challenge.  Unfortunately, it was a challenge No Doubt simply could not overcome with \\"Return of Saturn\\".  The 2000 release was a universal disappointment (even for non-traditional-rock fans like me, whom they scored with the '95 release).  But this album, is a masterpiece all in itself. <br /> <br />When \\"Rock Steady\\" was released, I was so excited, so proud of the group for coming back with such a smash as this.  It had people and critics who were formerly negative saying \\"Return of What???\\"  \\"Rock Steady\\" hit the pop/hip-hop/dance chord with unexpected greatness, and easily surpassed other unmentionable 2001 releases.  From start to finish, it is a uniform, cohesive set of songs that tackle the emerging hip-hop sound of the new millenium with candy-coated melodies and production that spells out pure perfection. <br /> <br />With a slew of notable producers (Pharrell & Chad are on here, so is Nellie Hooper, who would later spice up Gwen's solo debut), this album is their best group work yet.  From the irrestible stellar beat of \\"Hella Good\\" to the smooth lullaby-like love chant \\"Running,\\" to the millenium-sparkled, updated ska-punk sound of \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" there is something special about each track.  There is an evident confidence on this album, on songs like the seductive, trance-laced \\"Making Out,\\" the Jamaican-funky \\"Hey Baby,\\" and the suggestive, out of this world \\"Start the Fire.\\"  That confidence -- that 'self-assuredness' -- may have just been the element that was missing from 2000's \\"Saturn\\".  If there was ever a good time for No Doubt to enter back into the pop mainstream, it was with this release.  And the quartet did it with unmatched expertise -- and created a danceable, unforgettable jam session of an album.
B000002LHX|4.0|This is a fun Prince album. It's essentially an album of throw aways: but fun, funky, danceable throwaways. Prince's throwaway's are usually better than the best band's 4 month labored over song. It's also fun to hear these songs and remember them from the movie, which I haven't seen in years. Worth buying, but don't expect brilliance.

B00005J6T0|5.0|\\"Live to Tell\\" preceded the release of this album, as it was the title track from Sean Penn's forgettable 'At Close Range' in early 1986.  The story goes that the vocal track on \\"Live to Tell\\" is the actual demo that Madonna recorded when the song was written for the film.  If you listen closely, you can hear the innocence, the longing in her voice.  This new maturity paved the way for her \\"new image\\" at that time and the rest of the album.  The new found maturity apparent in Madonna's voice in \\"Live to Tell\\" set the score for \\"True Blue\\".  The album is a truly breathless effort.  From the stunning cover photo of Madonna up against the wall with her eyes closed, as if to be taking a silent breath after coming to a new peak in her career, to the virtual impeccable production, the album is truly one of Madonna's greatest efforts.    Some of my earliest memories of being a MUSIC LOVER include the singles (and videos) released from this album - \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" is a young adult's street-smart proclamation of her independence; The title-track is the underrated love homage to '50s and '60s doowop beats and classic girl-group pop; \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is a masterpiece in itself, with Madonna's smooth vocals chanting about a beautiful dream she had of her time in the Latin community of San Pedro.  \\"Isla\\" was originally written for Michael Jackson, but Madonna nailed it in a way that no male artist could have done at that time.  By far, my favorite from the album is \\"Open Your Heart.\\"  From the determination in her voice (\\"don't try to run, I can keep up with you\\") to the hard-driving bubble-pop drum beat, it just makes you want to move and gets you in a good mood!  She raised eyebrows in the memorable video with her coney bustier and suggestive stripper-like dance moves, but it set a new trend for female followers after her!  (Just take a look at Paula Abdul's videos from the late 80s/early 90s).     Critics may disagree, but I feel there is no filler on this album.  The other songs, also, (the up-tempo \\"Where's the Party\\", the Jimmy Cagney tribute \\"White Heat\\", the ambitious \\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\" and even the '60s-nostalgic \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\") have a coolness about them that was not evident on the first two Madonna albums.  Not to deem the first two albums uncool ~ they were just \\"cool\\" in their own special way.  This album was the first album she released after her much publicized marriage to Sean Penn and her considerably successful dabble in film (Summer 1985's 'Desperately Seeking Susan' - let's just put the 'Shangai Surprise' disaster on the back burner).  That new understanding, that secured knowledge is at the forefront of the album.  (Her voice sounds better as well.)  Not to mention she had already established herself as a star in demand.    All in all, this album has a certain slickness about it -- in the matured vocals - the sweet production -- as if Madonna calculated exactly how she wanted this album to sound.  While some may see that as a marketing technique (It most certainly is), it worked!  The album topped the charts in '86 and took three undisputed songs to #1 (four if you count the reign of \\"Isla\\" on the Adult Contemporary charts in '87).  As a whole, I think it ROCKS!  It is one of those albums you can play from beginning to end and get something out of the total production.  Compared to other albums of its time (Whitney Houston's self-titled debut; Janet's \\"Control\\"; Belinda Carlisle's solo debut), it is TRUE definitive dance-pop, and a timeless, near flawless masterpiece of the 20th Century.
B000002KLP|5.0|His first masterpiece of songs. The sleazy, sexy atmosphere, mixed with a collection of songs that doesn't include even one less than genius song, this album was the album Prince tried to one up allt he way until 1999, where he actually perfected and expanded upon this style to the point where it was time to move on. To Purple Rain. <br />Any ways, not one song on thsi album is bad. Dirty Mind, When You Were Mind, Sister, Head, Uptown, christ. All amazing funk songs. The ballads are good too, but really the funk is what hits you hard on this album. If you are interested in Prince, this is a good album to start with, but it's also good to just get them all from this to Sign O The Times.
0345347951|5.0|After the spontaneous arrival of the Overlords over every major city in the world, man kind's future is altered.  Aggression towards the invaders soon proved to be futile and useless. The Overlords assumed an authoritative command over humans, restricting them from certain things. It then became apparent that the Overlords were there to stay. A utopian world was created under the Overlord's authority. Life on earth became better with the elimination of war, disease and poverty. This change was welcomed by many on earth but the question still remained. Why were the Overlords here? <br /> <br />Childhood's End is an excellently written book about mankind's  future. It is totally unpredictable and surprises the reader with its dramatic turn of events.  It is highly original and creative. The author Arthur C.Clark brilliantly describes objects outside of man knowledge. Childhoods End proves to be a good imaginative Science fiction book that engages the reader.    <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I dont think anyone should have any complaints about this album because Mariah has given everyone what they've wanted. youve got amazing vocals, high notes, strength, great beats, dance tracks, soft R&b/ballads. <br /> <br />Its defintely soft to the ear and amazing. I really recommend this to everyone and anyone
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album ROCKS!! I just bought it today and I can't stop listening to it. There is not a bad song on it!! How many albums out there now can you say that about?  <br /> <br />Mariah's voice is just amazing!! I can't get over how much I love this cd. It is a definite must in everyone's cd collections. <br /> <br />My favorites are Joy Ride, Circles, Stay the Night, and We Belong Together.
B000002L7R|5.0|Going full bore psychadelic with this album, Prince lost some of his momentum and probably some of his fan base. Raseberry Beret was a hit, but I have a feeling this album sold a lot less than Purple Rain and I know it's less esteemed. <br />However, it's still quite brilliant. Prince's appopriation of psychadelic stylings is quite accomplished: the songs are brilliant, and the arrangements are trippy. There is some funk, but little: this is a \\"weird\\" album, the way they designed it, and it works. Some of it is very political, like America. Some of it is very insanely bizare, like the epic Temptation where Prince speaks with God about getting laid. Definitely Prince's \\"mad artist\\" album (or okay \\"one\\" of his \\"mad artist\\" albums) and not for everybody but worth having.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Being one of the biggest Mariah fans for 15 years (I was 9 when her debut was released), I feel qualified to make a fair & accurate assessment of this album. There have been the ups (Music Box, Daydream, Butterfly), the downs (What was she thinking with 'Loverboy'?; bad decisions concerning Charmbracelet, notably covering Cam'Rons' \\"Oh, Boy\\" less than a year after the original was released & THEN making it a single), and the hardly memorable (The Greatest Hits album was completely unnecessary, since everyone who would've wanted the biggest hits had bought #1's already; The Remixes was an even bigger mistake, because the fans already had all the singles, and that's who that album was aimed at).  <br />   Our Mimi has had to deal with plenty of injustices with her career, from being controlled by her husband/boss, to having another artist rip off her material (J.Lo, your true colors are beginning to finally show), but that's all behind her. With this new album, she's determined to show that nothing can get her down. And she's pretty convincing.  <br />  <br />   1. It's Like That <br />             This is the first single, and while it was very successful compared to Mariah's previous efforts, it's a little misleading in terms of what this album is really about. Anyone listening to this song might think the whole album is going to sound more like something from Fat Joe than Gladys Knight. But they would be wrong. Everyone has their own opinion about this song, particularly the line \\"Them chickens is ash & I'm lotion\\", and the potential for this track being a classic is pretty slim, but it's undeniably catchy nonetheless.  <br />  <br />   2. We Belong Together <br />  <br />        The second single, this is Mariah like we haven't heard her in a while. Even the first 7 seconds recall the opening bars of her classic \\"Can't Let Go\\" from the Emotions album, back in '91. Then a bass line kicks in, and you realize time has marched on, now a song without that would nevermake it to the radio. That said, this song crosses so many boundaries, it's as easy to imagine this song being played at proms as it is to hear it on a beat box in the hood. As an added bonus, we get to hear Mariah belt from 3:04 to 3:16, and if this doesn't give you goose bumps, you're made of stone.  <br />  <br />   3. Shake It Off <br />  <br />          The \\"Ooh-ooh\\" in the beginning makes for a happy feeling, and the clever pop culture references (the Calgon commercial, Louis Vuitton bags) make for a lighthearted kiss-off song. You get the impression that even though this song is about a girl leaving her man because he's cheated on her (With this one & that one/By the pool, on the beach, in the streets), it's more just a happy tribute to R. Kelly's \\"Ignition\\". Definitely a summer, cruise in your car song.  <br />  <br />   4. Mine Again <br />  <br />        This song starts off sounding like a Prince song circa 1984, complete with an organ and restrained vocal, but it soon morphs into a sexy song that's easy to imagine stripping to, and then finishes sounding like a song that Star Search contestants would have clamored to cover. It's a little overblown toward the end, but it's worthy of listening to. <br />  <br />    5. Say Somethin'     <br />  <br />          This is a catchy song produced by the Neptunes and featuring Snoop. It's a laid back dance track that's perfectly nice & melodic, but not all that memorable. The only part that really sticks in the mind is the repeated line \\"So whatchya gonna do?\\", and even then, not for very long. It doesn't help that Snoop's part sounds phoned in and recorded in 10 minutes.  <br />  <br />   6. Stay The Night <br />  <br />         This song has been consistently mentioned in reviews of this album because it was produced by Kanye West, 2004's IT Boy. All in all, it's a pretty unremarkable track, and anyone looking for a classic song produced by West for a diva doesn't need to look any further than 2004's Janet Jackson track 'My Baby', from DAMITA JO. This song lags until 3 quarters of the way in.  <br />  <br />   7. Get Your Number   <br />  <br />          This is one of the best on MIMI. It features JD singing (and sounding just like Nelly), and Miss Mariah at her breathiest, extolling the virtues of having \\"A house in Capri/And my own G4/And a Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor\\" and \\"A pimp penthouse/With a sick hot tub/We can watch the flat screen/While the bubbles fill it up\\". It's catchy, it's fun, and it's better than  \\"Last Night A DJ Saved My Life\\".  <br />  <br />   8. One & Only featuring Twista     <br />  <br />         This is the second song that recalls R. Kelly's 'Ignition', but this one works as well as the other does. It's starts out as a mid tempo ballad about a girl wondering why everytime she trusts a guy, he betrays her. Then Twista comes in, and it suddenly becomes more of a club song. It's strange to hear the woman who describes herself as \\"eternally 12\\" & \\"Mary Poppins\\" to confess that's she's \\"Looking for a man that'll rub me slow/Make me sing real high/when he goes down low\\". It's interesting to note, though, that she sings these lines so fast, it's almost hard to understand what she's saying, as if she's embarrassed. No need to be, though, because we're all human and we all have needs, and if being emancipated means that a 35 year old woman is allowed to admit that, that's the way it should be.  <br />  <br />   9. Circles  <br />  <br />         This is classic Mariah, with the track itself sounding like \\"Underneath The Stars\\" from her DAYDREAM opus. It's laid back & breezy, perfect for the radio at the end of summer. Her range changes slightly between breathy & high to belting and back to sexy sighs. Definitely worth listening to.  <br />  <br />   10. Your Girl <br />  <br />           The best track of the album, the first line \\"See, I used to be so shy/Sit at home & fantasize\\" makes you wonder if she's referring to her Tommy Mottola years, locked up at 'Sing-Sing'. Her vocal on this song is the best she's done in literally years, and the chorus is reminiscent of the Brownstone classic \\"If You Love Me\\", which Mariah was rumored to have helped with. Whatever the case may be, the chorus is catchier than anything on the radio right now, and if this song isn't released as a single, her record company would be doing a disservice not only to Mariah, but the public itself. If you're not planning on purchasing this album, this song is worth an i-tunes purchase by itself. <br />  <br />  11. I Wish You Knew <br />  <br />        This song embodies how Mariah's hardcore fans got to be that way. We love her vocal ability first & foremost, but we also can't help but love how over-the-top she is. This song starts out with a fake live audience screaming for her, and as if that wasn't enough, she also whispers sexy sweet nothings over the track, which is reminiscent of Diana Ross, but she comes off sounding eerily like Alicia Keys. All of the gimmickry aside, it's a strong track that's perfect for those moods where you just want a ballad.  <br />  <br />   12. To The Floor featuring Nelly <br />  <br />          Like 'Stay The Night', much more attention has been placed on this song because of the guest star (this time, Nelly), than because of the actual strength of the song. It's understandable that this song would be great in a club situation, but it's easy to think that without Nelly shouting over the entire song, it would be much more palatable. Mariah sounds great, but all you can really focus on is Nelly grunting & moaning. It's a shame, then, that he couldn't have employed the same kind of sing-songy voice he did on 'Dilemma' with Kelly Rowland back '02. <br />  <br />   13. Joy Ride <br />  <br />          This is a slow, baby making song that plenty of people will enjoy. Unfortunately, to me at least, it's draggy & not really anything notable.  <br />  <br />    14. Fly Like A Bird <br />  <br />The quintessential Mariah gospel track, in the same vein as \\"Vanishing\\", \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\", \\"Jesus Born On This Day\\", \\"I Am Free\\", \\"Close My Eyes\\", \\"Petals\\", and \\"My Saving Grace\\". It's amazing to note that with 2 more songs in this lineup, Mariah would be capable of releasing a great gospel album. This song is just as good as all of those previously listed, if not better than some. It's hopeful & still a little mournful of all of the \\"atrocities\\" of life. It's easy to get the impression that this is, in it's own small way, an anti- war song, in light of everything that has gone on in the last few years. Regardless of anything it may or may not be implying, it's a beautiful way to close out the album.  <br />  <br />   Final thoughts? Not every song is going to be memorable. This is to be expected with an artist who has been around for 15 years, and who has released so many great songs and albums. This project makes it apparent that Miss Mariah/Mimi/MC is still relevant, still has the same classic voice, and is not going anywhere for a very long time. And we're all so fortunate for that.
0440213525|5.0|This gripping story is a page turner largely because of the street smarts of its main character, eleven-year-old Mark Sway.  Stumbling upon a suicide attempt, Mark accidentally acquires information about a mob murder of a U.S. senator.  This unwanted knowledge makes Mark of keen interest to both the FBI and the New Orleans crime syndicate.  The young man soon realizes that his survival may depend on every ounce of his young wit and intelligence.  Mark enlists the support of attorney Reggie Love, and she quickly becomes his sturdy protector, partner, and grandmother figure.  These two staunch allies then work to elude the mob, avoid the FBI, and even promote justice in their own way.  I particularly liked how Mark's maturity and skepticism guide his every action.  Author John Grisham isn't Shakespeare, but he's written a remarkably charming thriller.   <br />  <br />
B00005JNEW|4.0|My perspective of this movie is probably different from the average viewer; I have played, coached, refereed, and watched a lot of high school football, almost all in Texas and most in West Texas. I've also spent a summer working broken oil rigs at Stanton, TX (not too far from Odessa), and have lived, coached, and taught in west Texas for more than half my life.    First, let me pick at the few negatives I saw.     Odessa is NOT a small town, but rather a medium-sized city of approximately 100,000, with two high schools, Permian and Odessa High, each with an enrollment of approximately 4000 students, which puts them both in 5A, the largest classification in Texas.    2nd, Berg should have stuck with the schedule and scores of the games that Permian actually played that year. The district record was right, but the order of opponents and the scores were not. Also, Permian met Carter in the semi-finals at the University of Texas' Memorial Stadium, not in the state finals in the Astrodome. Too, the Permian - Carter game was a low-scoring affair won by Carter, 13-9.    On the other hand, the movie gave a very accurate picture of the pressure Permian puts on its coaches to \\"win state;\\" almost anything else is considered a losing season.     Also, Billy Bob Thornton caught Coach Gary Gaines' demeanor very well; Gaines is a soft-spoken, religious man, and I thought that came through.    The frenzy that is Texas high school playoff football was demonstrated very well, as was the immense physical size and talent advantage that Carter had over Permian. Carter, after all, had NINE players who were offered Division I scholarship, whereas Permian had only 3 players play any college ball at all, and all were at D-2 or lower, and one of those was only in junior college.    Probably the best points the movie made were the \\"teamwork,\\" \\"hard work,\\" and \\"preparation\\"  aspects of the game. Permian, on paper, had absolutely no business being on the field with Carter and its collection of college-quality players. (Carter, in fact, was a near-30 point favorite) However, Permian gave an almost perfect demonstration of \\"overachieving,\\" and nearly pulled off the upset. The fact that most of these young men have achieved at least moderate success in life also reflects favorably  on `Mojo' football; they appear to have transferred the hard lessons of football to their lives. Contrary to popular opinion, Brian Chazez (lawyer) is not the only \\"real life\\" success from this team. Those young men became independent businessmen, teachers and coaches, oil-field supervisors (and oil company management), and one is a geologist specializing in oil exploration.    On the other hand, the movie did NOT mention the facts that 5 of Carter's players (all of them from the 9 with scholarships) served time in jail for armed robbery and that Carter was stripped of the state championship (over San Antonio Converse-Judson) for academic irregularitites. These are in stark contrast to the post-Mojo success of most of the Permian players.    I thought I was too jaded, having \\"been there, done that,\\" to get very excited at a mere movie of my game, but was completely caught up in the action, even as I was noticing the errors.     Not quite a tour de force, but an excellent and accurate movie, showing Texas football, warts & all.    Addendum: I've noticed several reviews that ask what happened to \\"Boobie\\" Miles. He lives in Monahans, TX (w of Odessa) with his kids, and runs his own yard service. Not a top-drawer job, but he IS self-employed and supporting his family!    Addendum 2: BTW, folks, you don't HAVE to \\"just watch\\" the game after you graduate; every SW Football Officials' Assn chapter I'm aware of is SCREAMING for young guys who love the game to become referees. I did it for several years, and highly recommend it; you'll help the kids and the game itself and give yourself a different perspective on each game. It's a very worthy activity.
B000002N1E|5.0|Hey Prince could still be brilliant. This album is proof. Hard edged genius funk rock and ballads with amazing production, melodies, harmonies, playing etc. A MUST HAVE. Hard to find but worth it.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I'm gonna quote what people have been stating, that this is NOT their complete greatest hits, now my question is, what would be their greatest hits then? I am a massive Pink Floyd fan and the first record I got from them is, believe it or not, this greatest hits album. Indeed you can not make a greatest hits by this band since there wouldn't be enough space on the album to put all their greatests, unless ofcourse you make a second volume, but that won't do since you already have 2 cd's in one here. Now what people have to do in order to feed that hunger for more Pink Floyd music is definitely getting all their studio albums. Indeed not all my favorites are here but then again alot of great ones are, which made me forced in purchasing all their records like I mentioned, excluding Syd Barret's era which I'm not to fond upon that. Pink Floyd is by far the greatest band to walk on the face of the earth, creating dstinctive sounds, powerful lyrics and making records people still hale to til this date. This album is still a must to own, simply cos it's from the one and only, Pink Floyd.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is a current day Masterpiece.  Klaus Badelt can be seen using Zimmer's work (if you compare the Gladiator Soundtrack, certain tracks have similair or exact same tones and music that this track has), but that just makes this soundtrack better.  if you loved the movie, you should love this.
0375703764|1.0|The only thing I liked was the stripper with a Thumper tattoo.  That was cute.
B000002KY8|5.0|Prince really goes nuts with the one man band style on this album. To the point of insanity. He layers synths after synths after synths after synths to create a masterpiece. Sometimes Prince goes for lush: other times he goes for rocking, and funky. One thing is for certain however: he really plays little guitar on the album. Oh the guitar is there. He has pushed it to the background though, for the sake of the layers of synths. It is, honestly, like an orchestral arrangment sometimes, the way they instruments work together. <br />It's a double album wiht lots of longer songs, so it can be hard to listen to in one sitting. Plus, the songs are generally sort of repetitive. But even then, that's the point: the repetivness makes them immenitly danceable, and the themes being repeated are brilliant so it hardly matters. Plus, Prince makes sure to throw in different things to make it interesting. A short guitar solo, a new synth texture, a counterpoint, slight synocopation. He takes repetitive music, like the song 1999, and makes it 6 minutes long and it's not a second too long. That alone is genius.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I was so excited to listen to this CD he was excellent, of course it wasn't like Emotions but time has changed and music has taken many turns since the 90's.  If you are a true Mariah Carey fan and the last two albums has left you wondering what she was saying (she whispered) the voice is back and strong as ever.  You can actually sing along.  I Mariah the best of luck in the future and I hope that \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" makes her true fans forget the fail attempt \\"Glitter\\".  The music industry was missing a voice, someone who could just stand center stage at the mic stand and blow us away by the voice not the butt shaking.  All we need know is for Whitney to get her self together (W.H. you are in my prayers).  <br />  <br />Mariah thank you, thank you, thank you for return to you soulful self.  <br />  <br />
B0001FAEBO|5.0|Another re-release? <br /> <br />Yes, yes, 'S.F. Sorrow' has been re-released time and time again, all with very little difference in between.  <br /> <br />And yes, die-hard collectors like myself have them all for some reason... <br /> <br />Call us perfectionists. <br /> <br />But here, from our friends in Japan, we actually find some not-so-heard and downright hard-to-find tracks added on as bonuses. <br /> <br />Cuts of 'She Says Good Morning' and 'Alexander' live from 1969 speak for themselves. <br /> <br />I sat slack jawed for days. <br /> <br />The B-Sides are hot numbers, too, if you got the bread to spread. <br /> <br />It is a wise investment for the true fan or even for the avid psych collector. But if you could care less about the extra frills and spills and just dig the original 13 tracks, then stick with the cheaper Snapper label versions floating around out there. <br /> <br />So, yet again, \\"S.F. Sorrow is born...\\"
076790592X|5.0|This book is about a wonderful man's positive attitude towards life, even when according to our conventional wisdom, there is absolutely nothing to feel positive about. It teaches the rest of us how to appreciate what we have and how to value what is really important. It's like 'the Alchemist' but far more beautifully written. There are times when you just want to cry while reading this book, but ultimately you feel empowered with what you learn about how to be truly 'alive' by living life to the fullest. I borrowed it from the Library but it's the type of book I guess everybody should own.
067144901X|5.0|This is an amazing selection.  This has brought excitement towards my son's interest to books.  After a couple of reading, I noticed that he has been imitating the sounds I make as I read along the different animal sounds.  This usually happen after I read the book.  He'd get the book from me and flip through the pages.  As he flips, he makes the different sound each animal on that page makes.  Most endearing is his moo sound and the hush at the last page...complete with action.  Although he can't make all the sounds yet, at least he could match up the sounds with the animals.  That's a great start for a 20 month old toddler, who hasn't began talking.  I used not to be fond of Boynton's Book, but with the development I see, I'm gonna have to add more of her selections in our children's home library.  I would highly recommend this particular selection.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Move over Beyonce and J-lo Mimi is back! I listened to the whole album and did not skip one track. I love it. Her voice is better than ever. My favorite songs are: We belong Together, Mine Again, Stay The Night, and One and Only. If you have'nt bought this cd yet,what are you waiting for?
B0001CCY7E|5.0|John Barry's score for Dances with Wolves is some of the best music I have ever heard. I don't know alot about John Barry, but this score is the work of a master. The music works well in the film, as well as on its own. Mr. Barry uses the whole orchestra in a very moving and powerful way. He wrote many themes that give the film more depth and feeling.  <br /> <br />For me(and I hope many others), this score is the most relaxing and peaceful I have ever heard. I have never heard the orchestra played in such a smooth and almost quiet way. Even the action and suspense themes are magnifcantly beautiful.  <br /> <br />Dances With Wolves is one of the best soundtracks ever. I recommend this album to any one who seeks peaceful music. Just listen to the sheer beauty.
B0000024ZC|4.0|This was my first gentle giant album, and i bought it on lp at a garage sale.  Now i gotta tell you, you may think that Yes is progressive and musical and all that, but compared to this band, Yes is the backstreet boys. Gentle Giant's arangements for thier songs are very complex, and they play about a billion different instruments (theres even a xylaphone solo on schooldays that is really good). I'd have to say the reason i didnt give this 5 stars is because the opening and closing songs have very little to them and seem like just a long riff repeated over and over.  Apart from that, the rest of the album is very complex and entertaining for a fan of progressive music.(wich you should be!)
B0007TKH66|5.0|I wish people would stop to think about the \\"greatest\\" Star Trek show ever... especially about how it took 3 season's before The Next Generation really got good.  Enterprise was pretty good all along and the fourth (and sadly last) season is by far one of the best season's of Star Trek ever created.  I only hope we fans won't have to wait too long for Star Trek's comeback from UPN/Paramount's mistake.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|'In a silent way' has the most relaxed and beautiful feel about it.  The record itself just seems to amble along, with each musician subtly weaving their solos into the background of this album; creating something inexplicably warm and welcoming.  It's like musical meditation.  As other reviewers have mentioned, 'In a Silent Way' would be perfect for those late hours at night when the listener needs something subdued and soothing.  That doesn't mean that this record is boring, however.  There's an understated, unassuming brilliance about this record that makes it subtle and the height of cool.  Deliciously hypnotic! <br /> <br />Miles' playing is beautiful and effortless, which makes it the perfect backdrop for this chilled out masterpiece.  It's the spaces he leaves between the notes that makes every note he actually plays all the more significant. <br /> <br />This is an absolutely beautiful piece of music.
0553274503|4.0|I'm a high school student and I read this book for a 'choose a novel'-project. I really liked it, because the perspective is very interesting. It is written like a diary by Charlie, who had an operation to become smart. This is very original, because you can read between the lines, since everything is happening to the writer. Moreover it brings up some interesting questions about who we are. I think it shows that, after all, intelligence is not everything, yet it influences our relationships and our whole life in a variety of ways. The only thing that I thought made this book a little hard to read is the way it is written in the beginning. Charlie is retarded and thus cannot read or write very well. That makes it hard to read, because it takes some time to figure out what some words are supposed to be.  <br />All in all I really liked the book and I think you should read it.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|This could have easily been a biography on Lars.  God knows, he wanted to dominate every aspect of this film.  With an ego the size of the entire United States, he shows us what we already knew: a little man who has no regard, compassion or sensitivity to other people's feelings.  His bluntness and insensitivity towards James alone during the therapy session when he repeatedly cursed at him, and the initial St. Anger recording sessions at the Presidio made me want to sock him.<br /><br />It is a miracle that this band has stayed together for over 20 years when a tyrant like Lars is running the show and wants to control every aspect of the band, but instantly goes into a tizzy if he can't have control or loses control over a situation.  I'd only wish that James came to the conclusion of leaving the band when his rehabilitative sabbatical came to an end, because no amount of money in the world is worth the amount of abuse he takes from Lars.  He could have done what Jason is doing now, started his own band and controlled it as he saw fit.<br /><br />I love Kirk, but he needs to grow a few and fight for the right to express his talent in the band.  Who ever heard of a 8-minute song (a rock song at that) with no guitar solos?  What a waste.  Kirk could have simply phoned in his contribution to the St. Anger album without having the need to have left his ranch.<br /><br />While I enjoyed seeing the Dave Mustaine session with Lars (though Lars contributed very little to the session), I would have like to have seen a session with Jason and the boys.  While Jason felt that the band seeking therapy was `weak', I'm sure he would have wanted to express some feelings of what it was like being in the shadow of Cliff for all those years, and not feeling like he was truly a member of the band.<br /><br />I would have given this film all five stars, but certain parts that included Lars at his worst caused the film to lose a star. I would recommend this film to fans as well as others who don't know Metallica from a metallic ore on the ground.s well as others who don't know Metallica from a metallic ore on the ground. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000027RL|5.0|This is an amazing CD. I'm listening to it again today in 2005 since I first heard it in 1993. Much of what I listen to now is still the same stuff that was out during the early 90's! I feel the memories, the anger, the passion, the sadness of being a teenager all over again.<br /><br />This CD was a huge part of the \\"grunge\\" scene...but that's not what defines it. You can NOT compare this CD to Nirvana, puh-lease! Same time period, but very different styles.<br /><br />\\"ten\\" is so very experimental. You hear classic sounding riffs mixed with new off-key sounds and drum machines. You hear mellow sounds mixed with shrill cries. Like life itself, this CD goes through highs and lows, mellow times and rushes. I feel like each track on this CD has it's own little nucleus which ends up in an emotional rollercoaster that is \\"ten\\". Plus, each song has meaning. You can listen to it for Vedder's genius lyrics, or you can listen for rhythm, guitar and bass. I believe the guys that made up the band at this time was an absolutely perfect mixture.<br /><br />There are the jams which you still have to shake your head to: \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Porch\\" and \\"Alive\\".<br /><br />You've got the deep, dark rockin' songs that convey the teenage angst of the times: \\"Once\\", \\"Why Go\\",\\"Garden\\", \\"Deep\\".<br /><br />You've got the mellow songs of heartache and regret and love: \\"Black\\", \\"Oceans\\" and \\"Release\\".<br /><br />If you haven't listened to the CD in a while, I suggest that you break it out, turn down the lights and turn up your good sound system. Listen to the ups and downs, the complicated mixtures of rhythms and sounds. Close your eyes and take in this brilliant, amazing CD.
B00000FCBC|3.0|Has anyone else really took a look at the cover of the Garage, Inc.'s CD?  It tells a foreboding forecast of what was to come with Metallica.  James, Kirk and Lars are in the background while Jason is in the front, appearing to be leaving them.  How eerie and sad that egos, personal problems and creative differences can cause relationships that existed for nearly 15 years to end like this.
B00004RJ74|1.0|I bought this movie because all the reviews said it was exellent and before the vampires came in it was. George Cloony and Quinton terrintino were great but once this so called vampires came in it sucked. For instance one of the vampires faces became scaley and lizard like, and arent vampires supposed to be like bats? They did turn into bats later. If you sre looking for a really food vampire flick get Interview With The Vampire, Underworld, or The Lost Boys.
B000002H97|5.0|While I understand the old-school fans of Metallica's past who yearn for the band to get back to their speed/heavy metal roots, I can also understand the band's feeling of not wanting to be so speedy or heavy at this stage in the game.  The Metallica members are in their 40s - 50s.  They have wives and kids who rely on them, so maybe it would be in their best interests if they don't relive their wild and crazy years at this point.<br /><br />Post-The Black Album, I can pick a handful of songs from the Load/ReLoad/S&M/Garage, Inc. CDs that I truly enjoy, but it is a drag not having the opportunity to download specific songs for purchase without being forced to either download the entire album or purchasing the album outright.<br /><br />All I can say to the old-school fans is to cherish the first three albums in good health, and for the rest of us to hope that the next album is better than St. Anger.
B00004RFFS|5.0|this movie was awesome i loved it. The acting was awesome, espicially Kirsten Dunst. It was pretty faithful to the book and i was happy to see Ann Rice had a lot to do with this movie. All i can say is that this movie rocks and the acting rocks, it is definatly one of my favorites i am constontly watching it.
B00078XKDE|4.0|All the songs on this CD are minimal, rythmic, and dark. Most songs consist of the interweaving of vocal melody and guitar counterpoint to the eerie hollow beat of a supposedly haunted drum machine. The lyric structure is folksy, but lyric content centers around dark topics like murder and hatred. It makes an interesting contrast, and reminds me a bit of early 20th century country blues songs (many made popular by Leadbelly) about murder and rape sung to a chilling cheery guitar accompaniment.<br /><br />I think the best songs on this album are \\"I hate the way you love\\", \\"The good ones\\", and \\"Sweet cloud\\". These songs are very catchy,have excellent drum machine beats, and you really get to hear Alison Mosshart belt it out. On other songs I get the feeling she's trying to sing more stylistically, but risks sounding self-conscious. She should really just belt it out all the time.<br /><br />And finally, I must stress that whether or not you buy this CD you really should try to catch The Kills live. They put on a hypnotic, powerful, and at times menacing show. They manage to twitch and dance in response to each other, as if they were hitting or kissing each other from across the stage. The whole show felt like a personal and dark serenade. During the show I kept getting the feeling that I was witnessing something intensely personal, that perhaps I shouldn't have been able to see.

0345347951|4.0|Childhood's End written by Arthur C. Clarke is such a unique book which completely draws and engages the reader. This science fiction novel describes how earth is transformed when it is taken over by some supreme power. Individuals' lives change as this superior power enforces a Utopia on earth. Arthur C. Clark's use of suspense, evidednt throughout the book keeps readers on their toes. The different scenes and environments are described brilliantly and give the reader a sense of being in the same setting. The book goes at a steady and regular pace making it easy to for the reader to follow without confusion. However, the only majoe set back in the novel is the ending which is too abrupt and whose main ideas are not consistent with those of the previous chapters. Nevertheless, on the whole, Childhood's End is a good book with a fascinating story. It would not only be advisable for science fiction fans to read it, but it would be quite suitable for other readers as it demonstrates human and societies emotion perfectly.
0345347951|3.0|Book review: <br /> <br />The book Childhood's End is highly innovative and well written. From the beginning we're introduced to a setting of mystery and drawn into a plot that captivates the reader. Indeed, Earth as we know it has been invaded by an alien race which no one has ever seen: the Overlords. Their intentions all seemed benign as they sought to \\"unify earth, eliminate poverty and end war\\". From then, the story takes an unexpected turn as we discover more about the Overlords' motives. <br />Unfortunately, Arthur C. Clarke significantly increased the pace of the story during the last section. In contrast with the first one which is clearly detailed and understandable, the last section seems rushed. Key events happen suddenly without the author taking the time to clearly inform the reader about what's happening. Personally, I thought this section was as equally as confusing as interesting.  I found it quite disappointing given the promising beginning of the story. <br />Nevertheless, Childhood's end is a very interesting book and I would recommend reading it despite its flaws. No matter what the reaction is, the reader won't remain indifferent, and this is in my eyes, distinguishes worthy books from others. Arthur C. Clarke should be rewarded for his incredible foresight and his exact description of society given the book was written in 1953. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Forget about the ridiculous title. Focus on the content. <br /> <br />The music is surprisingly subtle and warm and free of vocal acrobatics, which is a good thing, since we're all tired of her old formula. She finally realized that less is more. Bless her.  <br /> <br />The album contains a lot of uptempo tracks, and good ones at that. Carey has recorded several memorable collaborations with rappers over the years, but here she succumbs definitively to the power of amazing beats. Say Something and Stay the Night are priceless, as well as the lead single It's Like That. But watch out for We Belong Together because it'll explode!  <br /> <br />Over-all, it's a very satisfying album, worth purchasing and it's like da da da da da dat y'all!!!  <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Well, nothing really needs to be said about Live Aid, it was quite literally the event of a lifetime, never equalled, and probably never will be. What most people tend to forget in our nicely cushioned and pampered lives, is the fact that technologically this event was the equivalent of David slaying Goliath. Arranging two massive concerts accross two continents in an age where there were no mobiles, no emails, international calls had to be made through an exchange, and BOOKED anywhere up to a day in advance, and digital tv was still over a decade away, it is quite literally staggering how Geldof, Midge and everyone involved from the ground up brought it all together.  <br /> <br />Anyone who remembers it will love this DVD set, it's a brilliantly put together 4 disc collection encompassing pretty much all of the acts from the two gigs, as well as a lot of bonus performances (Judas Priest, INXS, Run DMC etc) that were never seen on the day. Yes, there are missing acts and songs (mainly from the US gig), but if people actually take the time to read the accompanying literature, you'll discover that this is down to the original film no longer existing, and is NOT deliberate. In fact, it is purely by luck that the DVD ever made it out, with virtually the whole american concert missing until by luck tapes were turned up at MTV.  <br /> <br />It's so ironic that people complaining about this set. 'Oh the quality isn't very good in places...' - what do you expect??! Any idea what happens with analogue recording when you place a camera next to a stack of marshall amps booming out at God knows how many decibels? Come on! As it happens the vision has been sorted as much as it could be (no digital remember), and the sound has a great 5.1 mix. But what the heck does that matter anyway, what exactly was this day about? Was it about you and me? A huge number of international stars to play the world's biggest rock concert all for our entertainment? Of course not. Just watch that opening section, which plays the entire BBC broadcast from Ethiopia, and whatever degree of greedy obsession you might have over owning the perfect complete set, with perfect sound, and perfect remastered vision will fly right out the window. Instead, you'll get swept up in the spirit of what was without a doubt the day that music really did change the world, and we all made a difference - the essence of the entire event is encompassed in this set through the music, interviews, documentaries and accompanying book. If you, like me, were there when it happened, it will be an almost unrivalled journey into one of the most memorable events of the 80s - so do something useful, and buy it!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Pop singers adapt or find themselves on the nostalgia circuit, and at 35, Ms. Carey would rather play a club-hopping vamp than look back. By reining herself in and shrinking to fit the structures of R&B, she makes herself a 21st-century pop contender.  <br /> <br />A must-have for 2005.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Preliminarily, I had mixed feelings about this movie. First of all, I was skeptical about watching a movie (especially a comedy) with a \\"PG\\" rating; this rating struck me as representative of a \\"children's comedy\\" which, if anybody agree's, are typically underachieving, and undisputedly appropriate for the audience which the rating merits. Myself knowing a few of the \\"nerds\\" during high school, this movie acts as a magnification of reality, but in a way that doesn't seem too overbearing. I would like to go over a few of the elements which I thought maximized the overall motif that the movie was aiming to create: that theme being, perhaps, a mixture of \\"nice guys finish last\\" and \\"save the world, lose the girl\\" (Napolean saves his metaphorical world without actually losing his flame \\"deb\\")<br /><br />First of all, the perpetuation of Napolean as a stereotypical nerd is a reoccuring element throughout the course of the film. Everybody remembers their high school years with the \\"nerds\\"; the implicit construction of Napolean Dynamite as a nerd is by no means conventional. Napolean doesn't need a keyboard and a computer screen to be a nerd. So, if you are expecting a reincarnation of \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\", don't be too surprised when viewing \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" when quite the opposite is true.<br /><br />Second of all, the Characters surrounding Napolean Dynamite are all basically characterized in the same way that Napolean is. This is what perhaps adds a little more humor to the movie. Some of the other \\"Peeps\\" (not a term actually used in the movie, but somewhat relevant to Napolean's colloquial context) that add the most humor to the film are: Napolean's \\"sidekick\\" Pedro, Napolean's unconscious crush Deb, and his (much) older brother Kip. All of these characters have their own little quirks that just seem to place them apart from the crowed and label them as \\"nerds\\". My personal favorites were Kip and Pedro. Pedro is so monotanous that he almost begs to audience to put words in his mouth. What was somewhat ironic to me was that he was initially built up as a character who doesn't seem to have very many interests and who appears to be a recluse. However, he quickly turns around and wants to become the class president by the middle of the movie. Kind of a bizarre twist of events and mentalities if you ask me. But then again, this movie didn't make the kind of money it did for it's lack of plot. Which leads me to my next point.<br /><br />This movie has little to no plot. Don't get too excited Seinfeld fans; this movie has a somewhat weakened plot which is organized just enough so that the viewer doesn't feel the need to turn it off about 5 minutes into it. When I was watching the DVD's extra features, there were a few scenes that were deleted and the express reason (at least what the director's commentary stipulated) was that some of the more descriptive scenes \\"didn't fit\\". This leads me to believe that the director(s) didn't really want a plot because a plot, in my opinon at least, would have made this movie too boring. Besides, I think that the monotony and spontaneity from which the \\"events\\" transpire is somewhat hilarious in and of itself.<br /><br />One more thing worth mentioning.... The Music. Simply hilarious, is all I can say. I liked it so much, I downloaded the album from the Itunes store. The best thing about the music is that it is so tacky, and deviant that it contextualizes the movie in a manner that could not be achieved with \\"conventional\\" music. The only song that I caught that was conventional was the White Stripe's song that is played at the beginning of the movie. The music almost sounds like something you would hear in a cartoon or videogame from the 80's (I'm assuming that in order to create the ultimate setting, the directors chose this type of music, especially the song that's played during the school dance) The music is corny; but then again, what would you expect from a movie about a bespectacled nerdwho draws \\"Liger's\\" and fights imaginary metaphysical creatures?<br /><br />So (in the spirit of Hollywood) here are the overall ratings for the movie (out of 4 stars):<br /><br />Comedy: ****<br />Characters: ***<br />Plot: **<br />Music: ***<br />Overall: ***<br /><br />Yeah, I thought this was a kid's movie at first and that's what initially turned me away from watching it. True, it's not the crude nerd movie that was \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" but I think this is a more scaled down (albeit more exagerated) contextualization of what it's like to not be \\"popular\\" at High School. Agreeing with some of the other reviewers, I think that Napolean is the type of nerd other nerd's look down on. Maybe you can look down on him laugh at him too. I and everybody else I know sure got a kick out of the movie.maginary metaphysical creatures?    So (in the spirit of Hollywood) here are the overall ratings for the movie (out of 4 stars):    Comedy: ****  Characters: ***  Plot: **  Music: ***  Overall: ***    Yeah, I thought this was a kid's movie at first and that's what initially turned me away from watching it. True, it's not the crude nerd movie that was \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" but I think this is a more scaled down (albeit more exagerated) contextualization of what it's like to not be \\"popular\\" at High School.

B00005M91K|5.0|No words can sum up this flick. It has to be experienced. I guess it can be called, our story. A true story of our lives, all of us on this planet.  Brought to us in a visual collage set to perfectly chosen music.  At the very least go rent it because this movie might just change the way you live your life.  It did mine.
B00006879E|5.0|This is 1 of the BEST rock/pop/soul infused CD's out to date.  Their songs have reached a TON of people and that is what counts.  I hope that they aren't going to be a one hit album wonder like some bands that have come out in the past 10 years.   The best songs on the CD are \\"Tangled\\", \\"Must Get Out\\", and \\"This Love\\".  Although these are the best songs on the CD, I would higly recommend listening to the entire CD b/c I know once you do, it will become a favorite for you.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, first of all, I love this album and it's definitely Radiohead's best ever.  Easily five stars. <br />     I've been reading the reviews, and I'm shocked at the lack of talk and respect for Subterranean Homesick Alien.  I LOVE this song.  It's easily my favorite on the album, and probably my favorite song ever.  It is beautiful.  I'm surprised that there's been this much talk about Let Down, and Paranoid Android, and virtually nothing on Subterranean.  I do like every song on this album except for Fitter Happier, but I'm just surprised Subterranean isn't getting as much credit as it deserves. <br />     Other than that, my favorite tracks are Paranoid Android, Karma Police, and Airbag.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but with such a big cast I really could not refuse the temptation to see why so many big names would sign on. The movie opened simply, but I know from minute one that it was going to be a blast. The violence was so intense, but somehow not overpowering, at least not most of it. There were a few scenes that made me cringe; however, these were necessary to the power of the film. Having never read the books (although I hear that the movie is a mirror copy) I was a little shocked. I have seen worse, but this was coming from a \\"Comic book...\\" oh well. I loved the cast. Willis, Rourke, Alba, Dawson, Owen, and even Hartnett, Murphy, and Wood played it cool. I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time! These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_  Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_  Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute. <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant; it accentuates the drama and gore to an extreme - bringing the characters to life. And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness. It takes formidable jabs at the hypocrisy that plagues the Church and the police, while glorifying the everyday, flawed, hero. It applauds loyalty and loathes treachery - important in a workable society. The more I think about this film, the more I think it may be - dare I say - Inspirational.
B000002UDB|5.0|The wonderful thing about the 'Magical Mystery Tour' album is that it's track listing not only reads like a greatest hits but that the Fab Four managed to be both highly psychedelic<br /><br />and experimental whilst maintaining such a high quality level of songwriting.'Sgt.Pepper' tried but often got so indulgant because it was they're first outing of the sort.But this album is alot catchier and more fun.Musicians such as Haryy Nillson,Badfinger and even early Bowie would make their first killings from territory first explored by the Beatles here.Since the only way to take this in is song by song that is what I'll do:<br /><br />1.Magical Mystery Tour-GREAT echoplexed rocker,uptempo and bouncy.<br /><br />2.Fool On The Hill-A McCartney piano ballad with an excellent surrealist lyric and one his prettiest melodies.Great use of horns too.<br /><br />3.Flying-The only released Beatle instrumental.A moody piece using the melletron and oddball humming for ther melody.<br /><br />4.Blue Jay Way-A brooding Harrison number with a dark,trance-like feel that seems a little out of place but is compelling regardless.I wonder if this chant was a mantra of some kind.<br /><br />5.I Am The Walrus-Lennon's most un ususual but accessible piece of psychedelia.The lyrics are completely inpenetrable but the constant melodic changes,steady beat and song build up will hold one's attention.<br /><br />6.Your Mother Should Know-A bouncy,music hall-like McCartney number.Very much a nice sing-a-long type pop tune.<br /><br />7.Strawberry Fields Forever-Lennon and the Beatles first delve into full blown psychedelic rock.Pulsing melletrons,sitars and horns work their way out of this quircky hook.<br /><br />8.Penny Lane-A great bouncy pop number-bright and sunny as ever.<br /><br />9.Hello Goodbye-One of the Beatles best songs as I see it from the 1967 era.Very clever in every way.<br /><br />10.Baby Your A Rich Man-The Beatles catchiest tune using a backwards tape loop.Lennon sings in his high falsetto.<br /><br />11.All You Need Is Love-The Beatles simple but effective answer to their generations call.Great way to end this album.<br /><br />  As one can see this album (albeit their are so many others) would make a better then average introduction to The Beatles music for those who oddly don't have at least one of their CD's.All the best qualities they have-clever lyrics,steady instrumentation,clever musical ideas and their own personal charm would be more then enough to carry this if they hadn't created eleven little anthems for this CD.A must have for any fan of modern music!atles simple but effective answer to their generations call.Great way to end this album. <br />           As one can see this album (albeit their are so many others) would make a better then average introduction to The Beatles music for those who oddly don't have at least one of their CD's.All the best qualities they have-clever lyrics,steady instrumentation,clever musical ideas and their own personal charm would be more then enough to carry this if they hadn't created eleven little anthems for this CD.A must have for any fan of modern music!
B000002J6H|5.0|I do believe that Stephen Stills is the most talented musician <br />in Buffalo Springfield, CSN, CSNY, Manassas, etc. etc. <br />Sure he's released some clinkers, who hasn't?But, when Stills is on, he's hot. His voice, his guitar, his songs, his production, his arranging, his ATTITUDE. Stephen Stills is a rocker, and his first solo album backs up that statement very well, as do the 3 Buffalo Springfield albums, and anything and everything CSNY have done.Think of it this way..do you honestly think Crosby <br />or Nash would have had a solo career without CSN? I do not think so. But Stills and Young would have. In fact, Neil Young had a very good beginning to a solo career before he was invited to join CSN. I have no doubt that Stills would have been close behind had CSN not happened. All you naysayers leave Stills alone. Stephen Stills is one hell of a fine artist.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Its back, although it never left! This is a great album even for nonfans.  It's Like That, Say Something,Stay the night, To the Floor, Shake it off, and Get your number all excellent groovy R&B songs. The ballads, oh the ballads, Circles, Fly like a Bird, mine again and the epic We belong Together.  This is an album is for anyone who loves R&B, smooth and silky tones, and phat beats.  If you wasted your money on JLo's \\"Afterbirth\\" you can feel confident that you won't be wasting your money on this one.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey returns strong, proud and super confident with her brand new release The Emancipation of Mimi! Mariah considers Mimi to be another name symbolizing her true inner self-so even the title of the CD proudly and forcefully announces that she is trying new, fresh things on this CD. Mariah explains it herself in the liner notes for her new CD: her \\"emancipation\\" is \\"to free from restraint, control, oppression, or the power of another\\" or \\"to free from any controlling influence\\" or \\"to free somebody from restrictions or conventions.\\" You know what? Mariah is a strong creative force and we all are better off for it! The Emancipation of Mimi really highlights how well Mariah can write and co-produce with other incredible talents such as the Neptunes, Kanye West, and R. Kelly. Mariah's new CD is full of songs featuring very personal lyrics-she is brave enough to share her real emotions with us here!  The CD also proves even once again that Mariah's dazzling voice has not diminished with time!  The album overflows with super creative lyrics and her exceptionally versatile voice makes it very special and a great addition to your collection!<br /><br />The CD starts off strong with the song entitled \\"It's Like That.\\" Not only is this a beautiful song, the musical arrangement is strong, aggressive and awesome! Mariah simply sounds great; her voice is perfect here! Then comes the song \\"We Belong Together\\"--thoughtful, beautiful, with a great beat!  With \\"We Belong Together\\" Mariah sings about a love that is no longer.<br /><br />Mariah also stays in the hip hop scene with songs like \\"Shake It Off\\" and the street jam \\"One and Only.\\"  And, if you like THAT, try also the Neptunes-produced \\"Say Somethin'\\" which she performs with Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams. Excellent! Mariah also does \\"Mine Again\\" with James Poyser on keyboards and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" really shows off what Mariah can do!<br /><br />Mariah works well with the other greats that I mentioned above; but there are even more talents on this awesome CD! Another Island Def Jam artist who you just might have heard of once or twice-a guy called Kanye West-collaborates with Mariah on \\"Stay the Night.\\" What's more, three of the \\"Emancipation\\" songs are both co-written and co-produced by Mariah and James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright:  \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" \\"Circles,\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" Trey Lorenz, Fatman Scoop, and Jermaine Dupri also provide vocals on this CD. The track \\"To The Floor\\" features Nelly.<br /><br />One critic from Vibe magazine wrote that \\"Mariah gets back to her winning formula with Mimi.\\" This almost seems like an understatement; the CD is really that good! Do yourself a major favor and get this-enjoy it today!but there are even more talents on this awesome CD!

B00005JN4H|1.0|A genre bridging feature (comedy-action-sexploitation) where a hapless NYC cop teams with a fast-driving mouthy cabbie to chase four leggy foreign supermodels robbing banks. Very little of the comedy works, the action sequences would have been great in 1970 but the advent of digital effects takes most of the thrill out of this kind of stuff (if they are totally fake who cares), and the sexploitation is a teasing afterthought.    The failure to deliver on the sexploitation part is especially curious because it would have been the easiest of the three to get right.  They certainly promoted that angle but the models are only on the screen for about 4% of the running time and even then are mostly in nonflattering disquises (the second unit probably shot all their stuff in one weekend before INS deported them).  The brainlessness of the producers in this regard rivals Pamela Anderson's awful \\"Barbwire\\" where she was dressed in sexy black outfits only to be filmed entirely in shadows.  And they wonder why their films lose money.    \\"Taxi\\" wastes no time losing its wheels, they fall off with the  opening scene of an \\"svelt\\" bike messenger (obviously not Latifah) racing through the city, finally stopping to remove his helmet to reveal Latifah herself. Insulting your intelligence at the beginning at least lowers your expectations for the rest of the film.     Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am not really a Mariah Carey fan like that, and I thought she was going to be done after the mediocre \\"Charmbracelet\\" not to mention the horrible \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Rainbow\\" I started not to purchase \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" but I'm glad I did. This CD can be compared to her 1997 masterpiece \\"Butterfly\\" on Mimi Mariah showcases her vocal ability she had back in the 90's and superb songwriting and hip-hop style the album really surprised me here's an overview of the songs. <br /> <br />01. It's Like That (4/5)- The 1st single we all heard it, nice J.Dupri produced dance track <br />02. We Belong Together (5/5)- The 2nd single nice slow song a lot of people can relate too, I love her vocals on this track especially at the end. <br />03. Shake it Off (3/5)- Prolly one of my most unfavorite songs, mid-tempo Dupri produced track her vocals don't really shine on this one. <br />04. Mine Again (5/5)- I love this track her vocals are wonderful on here reminds me of the old Mariah back in the day this needs to be the 3rd single <br />05. Say Something (4.5/5)- Neptunes produced this one her vocals are ok on here but I like the song. <br />06. Stay the Night (5/5)- The beat is so hot to this one and she uses a lot of falsetto in this song this one is hot. <br />07. Get Your Number (2.5/5)- Another wack Dupri produced song worst song to me on the album i hate the hook and her vocals but it's still ok. <br />08. One & Only (5/5)- This song is a lot different than any other song more hip-hop im definetely feeling this one and Twista's rap sounds Kanye production. Sort of reminds me of the song \\"Breakdown\\" <br />09. Circles (5/5)- I really like this slow track it's about still being in love with someone even though there gone a lot can relate to her vocals are great anotha classic Mariah song. <br />10. Your Girl (4/5)- I like this one too her vocals are really good I just don't like the hook and the song is pretty short. <br />11. I Wish You Knew (5/5)- I LOVE THIS ONE!! It hasthe live type  feel like the song \\"I'll Be There\\" her vocals are superb and the lyrics are outstanding. <br />12. To The Floor (3.5/5)- Another Neptunes produced track this song is out of place and Nelly makes the song worse Mariah's vocals doesn't really shine on this one but the song keeps your head bopping. <br />13. Joy Ride (5/5)- THIS SONG IS CLASSIC!! This is probably my favorite song. I LOVE THE LYRICS this song can fit in with Daydream or the Butterfly album this needs to be a single. <br />14. Fly Like a Bird (5/5)- A great way to close the album very soulful gospel song I'm most def feeling this track. <br /> <br />So overall The Emancipation of Mimi is a very good album that everyone that loves R&B should have Mariah has stepped her game up she's back!!!!!!!!
0780021967|5.0|Quite simply this is my all time favorite Hitchcock movie and except for the dated style/technique of the action scenes, it could be the best movie ever.     Most people associate Hitchcock with suspense but he was also a master of dark comedy. \\"The 39 Steps\\" illustrates his ability to blend the two genres into a movie that works well on both levels. If he had turned up the comedy a tiny bit it would be just as hilarious as the best 1930's screwball comedies like \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" and \\"The Awful Truth\\". Imagine Katherine Hepburn handcuffed to Robert Donat as they wander the Scottish moors. But the chemistry between Madeleine Carroll and Donat is too good to replace her.     Hitchcock cast a great ensemble for \\"The 39 Steps\\". Lucie Mannheim, Godfrey Teale and John Laurie are outstanding. The supporting cast are all excellent. Yet in the midst of all this it is Peggy Ashcroft who absolutely shines.    Donat's misadventures while \\"on-the-run\\" from the law are the original \\"series of unfortunate events\\". It seems that he just can't go anywhere without being identified and chased. Hitchcock's technique is to lull you into thinking it will be an ordinary scene and then to casually throw something menacing into the scene, so the viewer can never relax. These are like getting a slap in the face before you have a chance to set yourself up for the blow. By comparison with the sinister delicacy and urbane understatement of \\"The Thirty-nine Steps,\\" modern melodramas are obvious and crude.     There are many cool things to watch for:     CAMEO-As Donat and Mannheim board a bus early in the film, director Hitchcock makes his customary cameo appearance as a passer-by who tosses litter onto the sidewalk.    MATCH CUT-One of the most revolutionary edits in cinema history is in here; after the maid finds Lucie's body her scream dissolves into the hissing of a train whistle.     MISE EN SCENE-If you ever wandered what this was (\\"putting-in-the-scene\\" is a single shot sequence withoutcuts to another camera or transition to another scene), Hitchcock's closing shot is probably the all-time best example. As Donat, Carroll, and the police gather backstage around the dying Mr. Memory, on-stage behind them (visible from the wings) and performing for the Palladium audience is a chorus-line of girls high-kicking to the tune of Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle from the film Evergreen (1934). After Mr. Memory confirms the espionage plot, the camera angle changes slightly and Donat and Carroll fill the frame facing away from the camera. Donat still has the handcuffs dangling from his wrist. They spontaneously join hands - this time of their own free will.. The film fades to black.     Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
6304698623|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful movie.  Anyone who enjoyed the direction in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban should revisit this magical film from ten years ago.  <br /> <br />I was ten when I first saw this movie, and I really enjoyed it.  I'm nineteen now, and I recently came across it playing on tv...and I'm convinced it's one of the finest children's films ever made.  Very few films nowadays are of such quality--there is no stupid humor or gimmicky (not to mention annoying) animal characters, and there is no decline in artistry because this film is aimed at a younger audience.  <br /> <br />I believe this is a film families can enjoy together.  It is full of imagination and is visually and musically stunning.  It is also moving...I found myself in tears of joy at the end (I do not cry often in movies, and only a few times in my life have I cried tears of joy).  I believe that this movie can reach both children and adults. <br /> <br />This movie, though perhaps unloyal to the book, is still a classic.  It is full of wonderful messages (for anyone looking to enrich as well as entertain the minds of youngsters--you don't often find films that do both).  It is sweet, hopeful, and fun.  I highly recommend it.
B00005JMUL|5.0|This was a fantastically thrilling and innovative movie.  I was on the roller coaster ride and caught up by the story through the whole movie as well as facinated by the realism of the characters.  I'm waiting to see the next movie using this character technique.  This movie (director and actors) should have won lots of oscars.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|normaly I'll hear a song buy the CD and figure that's the only hit, not with this CD.  Every single song (like Micheal Jackson's Thriller) is a HIT in my opinion.  It's just a matter of time before the rest of the world finds out what I know after returning from a trip to Italy.  This CD is only availabe as an Import to the USA.  If your going to Europe soon, snag yourself one.  I wish James would tour near Lexington KY USA soon.  This will be the best LP I buy this year. What is strange about this LP is it's a little depressing and normaly I wouldn't like that, but much like the Moody Blues music of old, It has great hooks in each song that pulls you in.  Also they don't overdue the music just for the sake of filling up the song.  I first thought it was a girl singing and then I saw the video and saw where he just has an unusual voice, kinda reminds me of Frankie Valley of the Four Seasons fame's voice. As you can see none of these CDs are selling for under $15.  Does that tell you anything?
B0002ZDVFE|5.0|First of all I have to say that I am a HUGE fan of Robert Ludlam and had a secret \\"crush\\" on Bourne many years ago!!  Second I am a fan of this movie franchise so far.  Sort of an anti-Bond.  (I always wondered what Bond's American contacts were up to when not helping MI-6.)  That said my only disappointment with the movies are that they bear little if any resemblance to the novels!!  My shock at the departures the first movie took were quadrupled with the second!!!  My solace is in having read the Ian Fleming novels and then seeing them churned into the Bond movies.  The references in the novels are from another time....Bourne himself was in Vietnam during the bloodiest times....To pay proper homage to Ludlam's character Bourne needed to be placed into these times with current references.  The movies pay this homage and more to a tremendous character and take nothing away from the novels!!  You can either watch a very exciting movie or read a truly amazing novel without one giving away the ending of the other!!
B00000IMTH|5.0|DIO defined what Dragon rock became to be. In turn he defined the sounds of certain bands at different periods. The one contiguous  thread, is that DIO's voice is there, and wow is it there in a Big way. <br />I first heard this remaster in a German import, where it seemed to have been done originally in the pressing. <br />I have a tape of a Munich concert done 1-2 months before the release of  this album. The performance of LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL is absolutely note perfect in a live, late night concert. What you get in this album is the way the band performed live at the time( with the obvious benefit now of crystal clear sound). Dio's attire has improved with time, and improved with budget ( I guess :-), and this album is still a great album, from the rock of the key songs like LONG LIVE, and LADY OF THE LAKE, to the Ethereal Beauty of RAINBOW  EYES, where DIO shows just how tonally amazing his work  can be. <br />About the only thing that has gone down-hill is Ritchie who basically lost the plot somewhere in the 90's. Anyways, as they say, Genius and madness are separated by a thin line, and thankfully from 1970 to the 80s, Ritchie was in fine form, and has left a brilliant legacy. <br />ENJOY
0316921173|5.0|I have just finished (today) my third complete read of David Foster Wallace's mammoth, extradordinary 1996 novel \\"Infinite Jest\\", and I am every bit as amazed and puzzled as the first time I waded through.  It's not to say I'm a glutton for punishment, I have simply enjoyed this book more completely than anything else I have ever read.  It is an ambitious work that is staggeringly complex and, very frequently, as magnificent as anything written in a very long time.  I won't even try to summarize the labyrinthine plot, I'll just say if you haven't read it, and are not intimidated by the length, or of Wallace's penchance for using $65 dollar words, you will be rewarded with a literary experience unlike any other.  This book will make you laugh, cry and most importantly, it will make you think.  Wallace may seem cruel in that he offers no easy answers for his tale's meaning, he draws his story in oblique and roundabout lines, and leaves it up to the reader to discern for himself what the connections are and fill in the blanks with the clues he's given.  I know, I know, that is one of the biggest complaints of the book, that and after nearly 1000 pages of story and nearly another 200 pages of footnotes, there's no real conclusion to all the myriad plotlines.  I for one like the fact that he doesn't feel the need to spell everything out for the reader, and makes one mull over his story, and possibly even go back and piece together little fragments of seemingly inconsequential lines of dialogue and ambiguous scenes.  But most people have far more important things to do, I'm sure, than wrap their heads around a magnificent work of an acrobat of the English language.  Hey, I hear John Grisham has a new book out (or coming out, who can remember?)and the new season of Survivor is sure kicking into high gear.  I  for one like things that remind me that I have a brain and force me to exercise this wonderful organ.  Infinite Jest is quite a workout for the brain indeed.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is probably one of the best Debut albums. This and Kill Em' All, but anyway it is awesome. Its probably gnr's heavyest albums and it is really good. Slash is awesome and axl's vioce is good. I dont really know wut else to say. Overall its an awesome album and i recommend you buy it.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I'm very surprised about Mariah with this album - Mariah is Back!!!!  Great new songs with a touch of Mariah during her butterfly album.  No more words to say.  This is a must have album....
0441172717|5.0|The book Dune, by Frank Herbert kept my interest throughout the 489 pages.  Although the book was in times very confusing to me mainly because of all of the new words and things that Herbert created.  I did though like the story and enjoyed reading the book.  I got attached to many characters but mostly enjoyed reading about Paul; the main character, which is expected, but I also loathed more than I liked.  I thought that the bad guy Baron Harkonnen was a very evil, somewhat pathetic man in some ways but I also did not like some of the good characters.  I did not like Paul's mother Jessica mainly because I disliked the Bene Gesserit who are a group of women that think that they control everything.  When I read a book I do not like certain people or groups of people that try to control everything.  Even with these things that bother me I thought that the book was very entertaining and well written.  How Frank Herbert thought of this incredible world amazes me.  He created many characters with different personalities and goals.  The world of Dune is very well thought up and I got a very clear picture of it, going beyond seeing a giant desert.  The fact that Herbert can think of a series of planets that have very detailed descriptions, and then create a whole new civilization on each one, especially one as complex as the Fremen, is incredible.  The others are made to seem as a futuristic us, but the Fremen are completely different.  They are what we would become if we were trapped in the desert, and I think they are really cool.  Since most events in this novel are somewhat difficult to comprehend, I would say this is not a book for children under thirteen.  For everyone else who has an imagination and enjoys reading a good science fiction, I would definitely recommend this book, it was one of the better books I have read.
B00026WU82|5.0|Just go out and buy this album. It is one of the most important albums in the history of popular music. Just put the money down and plop it on your CD player. Still as relevant now as it was in 1965. The guy is timeless; he was ahead of his time and into the future.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Gerard Butler is also great in Dear Frankie.  He is in a few movies, but I wish he had bigger parts.  Please take the time to see the trailer for Dear Frankie at rottentomatos.com.  The people that were marketing the movie knew exactly how to showcase it- listen to the way the music changes and your interest peaks the moment this guy enters the ad, AMAZING.  So if you're a fan of POTO, take a minute to check it out.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Singing in a voice significanlty less veklempt than she has on her most recent albums, Mariah delivers an album that's got just enough of an R&B influence to be worthy to be released on the Def Jam label. <br /> <br />As an album in and of itself, it's more than satisfactory.  The entire album plays as potential hit after potential hit, which unfortunately, in this day and age, translates to slightly generic song after slightly generic song.  Which is nothing to scoff at.  Who wouldn't want an album that practically lacks anything that's skipworthy?  The problem here is that it's a Mariah album and though the general public has certainly lowered its expectations in the past few years, we've all undoubtedly been holding out for Miss Carey to 'Wow' us in a way she hasn't been able to do since Butterfly. <br /> <br />Another problem is the ridiculous amount of talent she's procured to help her produce the album.  As a result, the songs lack any true identity.  Songs produced by Pharell Williams sound like a Neptunes song; songs produced by Jermaine Dupri sound like JD songs.  Where's Mariah? <br /> <br />In the end, the alubm is a solid mix of pop/R&B that will satisfy a wide range of listeners.  The songs are perfect to sing-a-long to while cruising with friends.  Considering more often than not it's her voice, and not her songwriting, that's impressed fans, I have to say, Mariah hasn't sound this good in years.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Gotta love this cheesy 80's flick. I would buy it in a heartbeat if it were on DVD!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Its nothing like sitting in Best Buy parking lot unwrapping a new cd. After smashing Mariah into my cd player and taking off Its Like That begin to blast out of my speaker bring me an ear to ear grin. We Belong Together becomes the next powerful ballet by Mariah that I love. Shake It Off is another great song to vibe to . I had to stop my car and listen to Mine Again (thats how powerful that song is )to be honest this is the most powerful song that I have ever heard from Mariah. I spent so much time listen to Mine Again I noticed that I was over my lunch break so I had to skip around the rest of the CD but from my mini browse I can say I love this Cd. BTW I did stop at Joy Ride and I know that is going to be one of my favorite track. I highly recommend Mariah latest work . She has added another Charmbracelet to her career.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|I was in the store this afternoon, and after a long cd buying binge, I was burned out and bored with the whole record rack presentation. and man, I buy it all.  But finally.... after drifting the cd lanes like a shop lifter or wandering weirdo, I saw that girl with the candle jar in hand, and man, I picked it up, I heard the single a few weeks ago, enough said...except now I am stuck with an incredible cd that i just can't stop playing tonight. Good artwork inside, I got what I was lookin for...lyrics are not all inside, but that is good, Ya gotta listen.   woooof!

B0007Y4USW|5.0|Mariah proves on \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" that her voice hasn't went anywhere at all. Mariah still proves that there will always be only one powerful singer and that is her. All of these tracks showcase Mariah's voical range and help us remember why she's the #1 female vocalist of all time. No one can hit high notes like Mariah and her time to shine has once again come. This album contains the ballads that we all come to love from Mariah as well as some club tracks. In \\"We Belong Together\\" Mariah admits that she made a mistake and wants the one she's with back. On \\"Say Somethin\\" Mariah takes us to a club scene where she's very straight-forward in the fact that she is making the first move and is not playing the shy girl role. <br /> <br />One theme that Mariah does make clear on this album is cheating/unfaithful men. The other theme is about finding love again and what's it's like to fall in love again. Personally I don't mind hearing about either theme since I'm a female also and can relate to a lot of these songs that are on Mariah's album. Just like Mariah, this album has moved me to become emancipated in my own way from things in life that has held me down and held me back. This album is truly inspirational and a must have for any fan of Mariah's music. <br /> <br />Other tracks that are a must listen include: Secret Love and Sprung
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is a very talented and gifted singer. I did not like the POP songs she did when she started out because I knew she was a great singer with a golden voice. But when she came out with the second album I was amazed at her vocal and her range. Her strip album is far better than the first and its the CD I would have for a long time. She is one of the greatest singer of this generation and I see her as a legendary figure in the future. God has bless Christina with a rare gift to sing as similar to Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Michael Jackson and others etc. to entertain and to sing their hearts out. I am a christina aguilera fan.
006054094X|3.0|The Chinese navy of the early Ming Dynasty was something to behold. With such a navy, they could have easily turn this world into a Sino-centric planet instead of Euro-centric one. Gavin Menzies' book does credit to giving light to one of the greatest navies ever created by a nation who had the power to extend their power on the global scale but in the end, choose not to. I am not surprised to learned how the Ming fleets expanded all over the Asian continental coast lines, even to Africa. Did Chinese fleet reached the new world, I don't doubt it.<br /><br />If the author kept the subject of the book to a level of realism, this would have been a great book. But unfortunately, this book become highly speculative as it seem like the Chinese were everywhere on the planet. Considering the scrope of the author's premise, I was wondering why the Chinese didn't reached Europe and made \\"first contact\\" (Star Trek term there) with the European governments. After all, if the Chinese can plant folks in the New England area, they can easily plant folks along the shores of Kent.<br /><br />I don't hold the author against any form of comparison like some of the reviewers did between the rising power of the Ming Dynasty against the European powers of that period. Ming Dynasty ruled a huge nation and they were on the rise. European nations at that time was small kingdoms and ducal states in a state of stagnation, its only logical that Chinese can do thing better and bigger. Situation got reversed 400 years later though and unlike the Mings, European powers were not afraid to insert their will and power over the Chinese.<br /><br />The author's premise that Chinese have been here and done that already may sound bit patronizing. Discovery is worthless unless its share with the world. The Vikings may have reached North America hundreds of years before Columbus but it was Columbus who made it public knowledge. Chinese may have discovered Australia or went through the Straits of Magellan first, but it was the European explorers who put it on the maps for all to see, published books on it and its upon them that we as the people of this world, relied upon to show us the way today. Chinese achievements may be totally awesome but equally, totally useless if no one benefits from it. It may be possible that some John Doe first created the light bulb but it was Thomas Edison who show it to the world.<br /><br />Overall a pretty entertaining book while it stay within the realm of history. But once the book began to stray off the charts of history and into the realms of speculative history, reading material regress into a lot of \\"what if\\" and \\"so what\\".ellan first, but it was the European explorers who put it on the maps for all to see, published books on it and its upon them that we as the people of this world, relied upon to show us the way today.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Ahhhh. This may be a biased review, being that Green Day is my favorite band, but then again, they are my favorite band for a reason.  <br /> <br />Now, if you expect to hear something like Dookie, Insomniac, Warning, 1039/smoothed out Slappy hours, or Kerplunk, then you will be surprised. This album is most similar to Nimrod, But not very. <br />each track has the same amazing feel, like this is part of something huge. With great 4 bar guitar solo's, amazing Billie Joe vocals, steady heavy bass from Mike, and great drum solos and beats from Tre', this album will have you stunned. Every time i listen to whatshername, the last track on the album, i can't help but thinking, wow, that was amazing. <br /> <br />at first it will seem like the story is simple. boy meets girl. <br />but after listening for about 4 or five more time's, you see a story about pain, love, confusion, and conflict. and the more you listen to it, the more levels you see. I have listened to the full album over 20 times, and just the other day, i found something in the story that i had never thought of before. and the two 9 minute opperettas are spectacular, with smooth transitions and cool backround vocals. <br /> <br /> <br />GET THIS ALBUM NOW. DON'T BE A NIMROD. OR AN IDIOT.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Is this the comeback album that everyone thought Charmbracelet would be? No, because in order to have a comeback, you actually have to go somewhere first. The tagline of this album is \\"The Return of the Voice\\" Where did the voice go, as far as I am concerned, the Voice never left!!! Critics panned Glitter when it was by far some of Mariah's best work. Charmbracelet didn't sell as well as previous albums, but it debuted at number 3 on Billboard. The Emancipation of Mimi will more than like debut at number 1, what excuses will people come up with then? Mariah is back on top and is where she belongs. This album showcases her vocal skills as well as her songwriting abilities, which she is very rarely given credit for. The Emancipation of Mimi has 14 awesome songs on it. Congratulations Mariah, you are back on top where you belong!!!!!
B0000057C5|5.0|\\"du hast\\" is their most popular song, but it isn't even the best one on this incredibly strong cd.  All of the tracks are really good, and even if you don't know german it is easy to dig what these guys do.  They are kind of insane, sort of, and they really attract attention this way.  It is easy to see why they got such big popularity in the states.  If you have heard \\"Du Hast\\" and liked it, you should get this cd.  Also, get Mutter and Reise, Reise which are both very strong efforts by this band also.  Their music is consistently good on all their albums.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Though I Believe the voice never left it was just her trying to try new things. Mariah needs to cut it out with all of these hip hop collabos. Her voice can carry a song alone and I don't know why she continues to bring in rap artists. She sees that everyone yes wnats  to dance but when she first appeared in 90's dance music was very popular and she drooped with a soulful ballad that took her to extreme places. Why is she bringing out whatis hot at this very moment. She needs to be original again and show the world what singer they have been missing. We need to connect to her music again but she needs to give u sthat emotion that vision of love had as well as love takes time. I love her and always will but i want to know what the nex t albums looks like. I really do liek this album though. Highligths are Mine Again, We Belong together, It's Like That(Club Only)Stay The NIght, I Wish You Knew,Circles(My favorite other than WBT)Joyride,Fly Like a Bird and Your Girl basically all of teh Ballads and Say Something which is very different from anything she's ever done. Love you MIMI
B0000062FJ|5.0|this cd and Abraxas are the best of Santana's career, including his new stuff like Supernatural (which I actually enjoy a lot, just for different reasons).  classic songs like \\"soul sacrifice\\" and \\"jingo\\" are on here, and the whole album is chock full of the latin flavored, jam oriented rock music that Santana is known for.  The remastered version (the sole version now available) boasts 3 new live tracks taken from Woodstock, which rounds out the cd quite well.  Abraxas also has 3 live tracks.  If you are new to the band, get this classic album along with Abraxas, and be swept away by the fire of the band.
0792846443|5.0|I've watched this movie atleast 5 times since its release,  it's great! Kathy Bates, plays a convinsing obsessed, psychotic  fan. James Caan is also great. You'll never forget what happens  when he spends time at Kathys house! This is a creepy movie,  you won't want to watch alone. You'll love it!
B0000062FL|5.0|this is the peak of Santana's prowess, and furthered their reputation as one of the greatest bands of the 60's with the likes of The Who and The Grateful Dead.  If you get any Santana album, you should get this (though I highly recommend their self titled first cd in addition to this one).  a great deal of accomplishment is present, one of my favorite songs being \\"incident at Neshabur,\\" a fun guitar song that I am learning to play.  Carlos is a very celebrated guitarist, and the rest of the band has great players like Gregg Rolie and the like.  Santana was an important part of the 60's, and there is no better evidence for that than on this album.  it is highly recommended.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I really hate it!!Her first album was good and i recommend,but this album Under My Skin is awful,he just know talk about love,hate,love...nothing interesting!Don't bought it!
B000002MFE|5.0|this is easily my favorite EC album; I see that many people share my fascination with it.  Clapton was very good at crafting great blues songs on acoustic guitar,  and I like these songs much better than his electric guitar music (though Cream of Clapton is a strong hits collection).  with great songs like \\"layla\\" crafted to absolute acoustic perfection, I knew I absolutely had to have this music on cd  (I was introduced to it from an old tape my parents had).  One song I love learning to play is \\"layla,\\" it is so good and so improved from the original on here.  Other songs like \\"tears in heaven\\" and \\"alberta\\" are real gems also, and there is not a single weak track on here, which encourages repeat listenings.  My respect for Clapton was immeasurable when I first heard this cd.  If you don't have it, you need it.  no questions.
B000002B1M|5.0|Could not have have said it better myself.  This is Nas's best cuz of the beatz, his raps are usually tops, but never underestimate the power of some true blue east coast production, meaning intelligent, crisp, and concrete beats. This album reflects why many around 96 were sick of the west coast(much like dirty south) cheap plastic production and turned to Nas, Biggie, and Wu-Tang. Too bad even the east would mostly sell out as well in the near future. Anyways, if you want to hear true Nas dig this or Illmatic.
B0007GAERG|5.0|CD Review: <br />Mariah Carey's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" <br /> <br />The title may throw you off but the vocals are better than ever. This has to be one of her best albums to date. Her new album has everything: from r&b grooves to hip hop tracks that are re-invent herself to match today's popular music. This album is both enjoyable musically and lyrically. Here is a track by track run-down of the album. <br /> <br />1.\\"It's Like That\\" featuring JD and Fatman Scoop - Just one of the laid down dance tracks off the cd. This has so much appeal because its rhythmic bass thumping beats are sure to cause anyone to dance. Mariah's voice flourishes while singing and mixing some whispers over a mumur of the backing track. Overall, a great dance track that fits today's music scene... <br />Grade:A <br />2.\\"We Belong Together\\" - One of the best tracks off the album by far. Very reminiscent to Usher's beat for \\"Lovers and Friends\\"(but this is better lyrically and melodically). The song is very solemn yet her voice shines like a breath of fresh air. This R&B groove is reminscient of One Sweet Day (lyrically anyway). Perfect choice for 2nd single and she sounds amazing on the record - especially with the last note. Very pleasant to hear her singing with less whispers. <br />Grade:A <br />3.\\"Shake It Off\\" - Don't be fooled by the title it's not a hard dance club track. Very reminiscent of R.Kelly's \\"Ignition.\\" Especially the way she sings in a rapid way on words like \\"bacardi and rum\\". The beat is something you would bop your head to. A smooth club ridden beat where a lot of Mariah is singing with the \\"ooh ooh\\". A great track nonetheless. <br />Grade:A <br />4.\\"Mine Again\\" - Seriously hands down on of the best tracks on the cd (vocally). Her range from low notes, whispers, to long flourished solos makes this song her staple of why she is one of the best singers in the business. Her control over her voice is a joy to hear because she does it so well. A very slow R&B groove that brings you back to 70's old-school soul. Her heart and voice soars with the track leaving nothing hanging down. Flawless. <br />Grade:A+ <br />5.\\"Say Somethin'\\" featuring Pharrell and Snoop Dogg - One of the best dance tracks. With the Neptunes production of hard drum beats and keyboard syncopation the song is like it was recorded with a live band in a neighbor's garage. The rap of Snoop Dogg is alright but its Mariah who is the real star in the song. With her singing and control of \\"again\\" whispers, She comes out looking like a pro when it comes to singing with hip-hop royalty. She did start out with O.D.B. - hip-pop. Genius. <br />Grade:A <br />6.\\"Stay the Night\\" - Kanye West (who is not featured on vocals but on production) creates a great atmosphere for Mariah to shine on the chorus of the song. Very street oriented beats that does remind you of Kanye's music (well his beats anyway). The production does make you wanna bop your head and throw your hands up in the air. Her airy backing vocals and High notes during the song makes her showcase how diverse she is with her range. A delight. <br />Grade:A+ <br />7.\\"Can I Get Your Number\\" featuring Nelly and JD - Probably one of the most uninspired tracks on the album. Reminds me of just a filler song that connects to this generation of hip-hop radio airplay followers. Mariah also makes references to Capri and having a Hot Tub. This is really lacking in the concept of soul that Mariah plays so well. Plus, Nelly's rap is the weakest out of all the rap collaborations. Mariah could do so much better and play on the realness, rather than mentioning material things. Although, Mariah sounds great on anything. She could read the phone book and it would be a hit.  <br />Grade:B- <br />8.\\"One and Only\\" featuring Twista - One of the best hip-hop tracks with Mariah showing her range once again. She sings over a mumur and does her trademark: the whistle note. Twista's rap also gives the song a great feel to the R&B silken smooth hip-hop jam. This song reminds me of people cruising in their car looking for some fun with the one they love. The showcase of Mariah's range is probably what makes this album a treat. Great. <br />Grade:A <br />9.\\"Circles\\" - Mariah said in lieu of the release of the album it will have a \\"Gladys Knight\\" type of sound. This song is very retro and showcases Mariah is a great light. A 70's soul silken R&B groove (most of the album plays upon an R&B sound) has Mariah singing and whispering. The sound is very Gladys Knight (who has been around since the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s). I think Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced the song (who also contributed to the \\"Glitter\\" soundtrack) tapping into her R&B soul type of vibe she plays well on. I love it. <br />Grade: A <br />10.\\"Your Girl\\" - Another retro 70s soul track that leads Mariah to another vocal exercise. Not much you can say about this track (being at length under 3 minutes). It has Mariah singing with a background much like a choir that plays upon the R&B side of her again. But nonetheless, its still memorable because her range is full-out. <br />Grade: A <br />11.\\"I Wish You Knew\\" - An unbelievable track almost to the end worth hearing. With Mariah doing her best Alicia Keys impersonation (where she is talking to an audience about love). The audience of clappers is intro and outro in the song. The song is very retro also (can I keep saying retro?). The piano R&B groove is something that shows her high and low notes. Again, with the range. Highlight of the song: Alicia Keys impersonation. But I still loved it. <br />Grade: A <br />12.\\"To the Floor\\" featuring Nelly - This song also featuring Nelly is better than \\"Can I Get Your Number.\\" Why? Because Mariah sounds good in her vocals and Nelly matches Mariah when it comes to singing the chorus. It is a great dance track but seems just seems too simple in lyric factor and soundwise. Something that you would play on the radio to get with this generation of rhythmic tracks. <br />Grade: B+ <br />13.\\"Joyride\\" - Probably the most surprising hits on the album. This is a potential single choice for Mariah. She sounds great with the range of high notes, low notes, whisper notes, and whistle notes. Mariah is a note singing machine. I love this song so much - no words to express. She brings a tinge of soul, r&b, and a touch of something new that could be nonetheless experimental. She's just a delight to hear especially going to the end of the song with a whistle note, a growl (which by the way is a first) and long note to end. One of the best tracks on the cd by far. <br />Grade:A+ <br />14.\\"Fly Like a Bird\\" - Saving the best for last, this is the way to end it. With Mariah's pastor speaking in the intro and breakdown of the song, Mariah flourishingly sings on the track. It's no wonder Mariah's voice is characterized as \\"a voice from God\\". Her gospel roots also show in this song - you can imagine her singing in front of the church singing to the people with a choir backing her up. Very inspirational - like all her gospel-like tracks. This one is also done lyrically with a line saying, \\"Don't let the world break me down tonight.\\" This is the perfect way to end a R&B feel of a cd - with a gospel inspired song. <br />Grade:A+ <br /> <br />Overall I give this cd an \\"A\\". It's definately worthy of being called her comeback album. Definately, one of the most anticipated albums of the year. I can say the album is mostly very R&B mellow with a few hard dance and midtempo tracks that will get you shaking. But what makes this album one of the best she's ever put out is her range of singing is being showcased in 95% of the album. She is singing again but still mixing it up. Mariah said recently, \\"She does not want to hear someone scream at her all the time\\"(referring to her diverse choice of not doing so many vocal acrobatics). The album definately balances the high and low notes. Definately a CD to pick up - if you are a fan of pop, r&b, or both. Welcomeback Mariah - you're definately a voice that should not be overseen. <br />Final Note: Probably, going to be one of the best albums in this year vocally, musically, and commercially
B00003CXTG|4.0|As Big budget movies go, this isn't even close to being a great epic movie.  But what it does do is give us a 3 hour entertainment movie that plays on what happened 60 years ago.  A great time for those who want to watch an action film.  However, if you want a great WWII film then I suggest SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
B00005UW9T|5.0|When I was little this was my favorite movie I had the Anatasia Barbies, C.D., saw the ice show, had a stuffed Pooka and computer games. Now even as a teen I still get a kick out of watching this flick.<br /><br />Taking place after the Russian Revolution in St. Petersberg Dimitri a street rat trys to pull off the biggest scam in history by hiring an imposter to claim that she is the long lost Czarress Anatasia of Russia. Well, this is when young Anya comes into play being an orphan who was recently released with no recolection of her family-she's on a search to find them. When, she accidently bumps into Dimitri. Dimitri sees a resemblance to the long lost Anatasia and decides to use Anya(Anya dosn't know his plan). Well, only 2 problems an evil Rasputin is following Anya trying to make certain she dosn't succeed by putting curses and demons in her way and she is falling in love with Dimitri. When, Dimitri and Anya finally arrive in Paris to pull of the scheme- Dimitri realizes that Anya really is Anatasia and that he must never see her again.<br /><br />This movie may not be historical accurate but what do expect when you watch an animated movie??? With an all-star voice over cast and done in the time of classic animation this movie will never go out of style. I still enjoy watching it and I find myself missing the days of the less high-tech animation style. The music in this is also touching, I own the soundtrack and I love the song \\"Once Upon A December.\\" With a great cast, good script, and great animation(even if it's not Disney) One of the greatest animated movies ever made-this is not a movie that should be missed on family movie night- Rent or buy this one and go on a journey to the past!
6305603847|5.0|if ur a big fan of Pink Floyd than i definetly suggest buying this dvd. this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen and of course the best rock movie. the commentary by roger is pretty good too... <br /> <br />HOWEVER there is one downside. i f***in paid $30 for this dvd a year ago cause i couldnt find it anywhere. now they have put it out in f***in wal-mart. now i feel like a complete dumbass. that is the only thing bad about it was that they ripped me off. but it doesnt change how much i really like the movie.
B00005JLR8|5.0|What can I say??? Lately I have been disappointed with the movies hollywood puts forth the ones that are made for the sole purpose of money- not actually wanting to make you think or feel anything special. After, seeing \\"In America\\" I was moved. Breath-taking or heart-breaking are not the words that I would use to describe this rare movie.<br /><br />After I finished watching it I felt deeply touched by the story of the Irish family who finds peace in the States. This movie has stuck to me since, I've seen it and I guarntee it will with you too. Jim Sheridan has written and directed a master-piece that we rarely see these days- even more impressive on a low-budget.<br /><br />But, what made this film special is despite the tragic loss of the son the family seems to move on through their circumstances and struggles in America becoming a stronger family unit. While their daughter Christy seems to mature and thrive in the country. It was nice to see a movie that wasn't fluffed- that showed real emotions from death, to poverty, to AIDs, to being un-employed, and to re-birth. This movie touches everyone on some level and I suppose it being seen through the eyes of a young Christy makes it even more special and precious.<br /><br />The young girls are really make this movie shine. The girl that plays Christy acts with her whole face making the movie darker than it is while the little girl that plays Ariel adds nothing but, sunshine to the screen. Great performances in the entire cast Samantha Morton got a well-deserved Academy nomination for her performance.<br /><br />This movie will never age or lose it's wonder that's why you should definately click the buy now button on your screen now!
B00013RC9I|1.0|...it's kind of sweet, but has absolutely no substance whatsoever.  This reminds me of early 80's avant garde electronica, with muzak-sounding instrumentals and ridiculously repetitive lyrics.  Additionally, the vocals are irritating and show absolutely no depth at all.  I'm astounded that so many other reviewers have given this four or five stars, all I can compare this to is annoying elevator fare.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is so special in its ability to uplift. It is the best movie to watch if you happen to be feeling down--or like life is not treating you fairly. This is the movie I watch when I feel things aren't going my way. It's the kind of movie that re-charges you and makes you feel lucky to just be alive. <br /> <br />Forrest Gump shows us how \\"life is like a box of chocolates\\" and does it better than anyone and in the most simplest form. The cast is incredibly well suited for the characters in the story. Cinematography is superb in every way. It delivers its message with a conbination of tragedy, humor and drama. Very deserving of all the awards is recieved.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Robert De Niro's Oscar winning performance is only one of the many highlights of Raging Bull: Martin Scorsese's classic portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta.  When he's not accusing his young, stunning wife (Cathy Moriarty) of infidelity, he is, as the title implies, a rampaging animal in the ring: looking to claim the middleweight title.  De Niro's transformation into LaMotta is still one of the greatest things to be seen in cinematic history, and 25 years later, the only performance to come close to the visceral ferocity of De Niro's is Charlize Theron in Monster.  The fight scenes are incredibly re-produced, and incredibly violent.  Only Scorsese could make such bloody carnage look flowing and beautiful, and the black and white color of the film makes it feel like you are watching history.  It's hard to believe that Raging Bull is 25 years old, and if you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to give it a look.  No other movie that deals with boxing, the Hurricane, Ali, whatever else, can hold a candle to this strangely poetic portrait.  MGM's Special Edition DVD is a labor of love, including a horde of extras and commentaries (featuring LaMotta himself), and while one may wish that De Niro and Joe Pesci would have offered some input, this is still how DVD's should be.
B0006399FS|5.0|An amazing follow up to the equally brilliant ATYCLB. <br /> <br />Terrific tracks from start to finish, there are no bad songs on this album. Please do not listen to the ludicrous multiple-posted bad reviews by some spammers on here who seem to be jealous of U2's well deserved success. <br /> <br />However, some people have posted bad reviews which they genuinely believe to be true and I thank them for their honesty, <br />But I strongly disagree with them. <br /> <br />If you like U2, buy this album. You will not be disappointed. <br />As a huge U2 fan myself, It's true to say I expect a lot of the band. My expectations have been met and exceeded with HTDAAB. <br /> <br />Well worth waiting four years for, and can't wait for the Vertigo Tour!!
B00005NTJK|5.0|This is my favorite straight forward bluesy, rock, trippy Tull album. I listened to Benefit the most probably in the 70's (my teenage years), although I loved Stand Up, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Minstrel in the Gallery And Songs from the Wood about as much. Tull was one of my top bands then (and now) and I really feel that these albums are some of the best Rock has to offer.  Benefit, as the best song-oriented album from the blues/rock stretch in my opinion, really stands out as the gelling of the Tull sound.  Martin Barre found his confidence and ran with it while Ian Anderson really picked up the complexity level of his many contributions.  Glenn Cornick's bass playing is outstanding and represents some of the best of the era, although this was his last gig with Tull.  John Evan joins the band here and adds to the more layered quality and strangely seems to be the glue that binds that classic Tull sound.  Other members seem to feed off of the new energy!  Benefit feels to me very brooding and powerful...the psychedelic atmoshere is at a peak here as well.  I am trying to describe why this album is one of the greats of all time to me, but words do little to describe the powerful emotional impact I feel for this one, for whatever reason...crank it up and feel for yourself!  The Extra tracks are a great addition (Teacher was on the original American album) and the sound quality is at a new high. This is an essential recording of the era and a truly great bargain, although lyrics should have been included as well as better track notes (I like it better than Aqualung - newbies could begin here with confidence).  Enjoy!!!
B000002U9Y|4.0|A Saucerful Of Secrets (1968.), Pink Floyd's second studio album<br /><br />'A Saucerful of Secrets', Pink Floyd's second studio album, released in 1968 is a capture of the band in its transitional period. Pink Floyd came onto the scene in 1967 with their weird and wonderful experimental psychedelic style in toe. Their first release, 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' is one of the strangest, wacky but definitely thoughtful albums out there and was definitely an excellent if unorthodox album from the band. Buoyed by pretty good sales from their debut album and their two early singles ('See Emily Play' and 'Arnold Layne'), Pink Floyd returned to the recording studio to cut this album and in my opinion, proved to be an excellent, if sadly criminally underrated effort by Pink Floyd.<br /><br />There are many, many people who try to put Pink Floyd and their albums down, sadly many of these people just do not give their music a chance. 'A Saucerful of Secrets' is no exception to this problem and gets an unfair share of criticism. DO NOT LISTEN to 1/2* reviews who give an unjustified criticism of Pink Floyd - this band are true music geniuses and have pioneered so much in alternative music with their unique experimental style. This album is not like their later 70's stuff, with the classic sound we hear on 'Dark Side of the Moon' but rather is more psychedelic, with plenty of experimentation which was well ahead of its time, just like 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn', even if this album is a little less off the wall! During the time of this album's recording, Pink Floyd were going through a transitional period. Syd Barratt, the band's vocalist, guitarist and chief songwriter was quite literally losing it. An uncontrollable LSD addiction led to him becoming increasingly incomprehensible and unpredicitable. During this time therefore, guitarist David Gilmour was added to the line up and thus this is the only Floyd album to feature 5 members! Still though, Syd's weird, creative and great influence is all too plain on the album, even if he only did pen the last track. He was reluctantly thrown out the band by the time of the album release but his influence lived on and he was the real pioneer behind the greatness of Pink Floyd.<br /><br />'A Saucerful of Secrets' has a moody and in parts dreamy approach. 'Let There Be More Light' is a great opener. Theres some pretty dramatic sounding vocals and the track finishes with some excellent guitar playing from David Gilmour. 'Remember a Day' is a stroke of creative genius from Rick Wright (in my opinion the underrated songwriter in the group) - the keyboard presence and gentle drumming makes this a really captivating track. 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun' is, in my opinion, the crowning glory of the album. Theres plenty of effects (listen out for the bird sounds blending in at the end) to go with a great bass line and whispery vocals. 'Corporal Clegg' is more brighter sounding with pipes even being incorporated in parts, some experimental guitar riffs over lyrics about a war veteran (war issues were a major theme in Roger Waters' songwriting). 'A Saucerful of Secrets', the title track is a 12 minute serving of pure experimentation - you can see the Floyd building towards their Echoes epic with this track. Its the least accessible track on the album but after a number of listens I began to enjoy it much more for what it is. 'See'Saw' is another great song from Rick Wright, again very dreamy in style with lots of innovative stuff on the keyboards. 'Jugband Blues' is a powerful statement to finish the album. This song belongs to Barratt and when you listen to it you cant help but feel sad about how things went dramatically downhill in his life. His final line 'And what exactly is a joke?' is one of the most revealing finishes you could have on an album.<br /><br />So, even before they reached their heights with 'Dark Side of the Moon', Pink Floyd were making excellent, if alternative and experimental music. 'A Saucerful of Secrets' is an unfairly criticised second album from Pink Floyd and is definitely one of their more overlooked music works. I wouldn't recommend this to any Pink Floyd newbie, stuff like Dark Side or the Wall is much more appropriate (or the 'Echoes best of' compiliation). However, any Pink Floyd fan will love this album and enjoy another work of genius from the band.crets' is an unfairly criticised second album from Pink Floyd and is definitely one of their more overlooked music works.

B0007Y4USW|5.0|I lllloooovvvveeee this girl-excuse me-woman! She is my idol 4 life. I love her vocals, her appearance, her music. I don't even have any favorites on this album, it's so good!!!! Now Charmbraclet was not all that, but The Voice is Back!!!! with more hits. This and Rainbow would have to be my most favorite Mariah albums. You gotta love her!!!!
B000002MUW|4.0|Bedtime stories is my fav. madonna cd, basiclly because of Bedtime Story, written and aranged by Bjork. So This cd even more so the bedtime story single is a must for any bjork fan, or any cool madonna fan, a good cd to have!
B000023VR6|5.0|lets put it into math...90s hip hop = brilliance. modern hip hop = crap. with that said, i can say that not only is this the best modern hip hop album to ever exist, but it is truly one of the best hip hop albums ever produced. it features the best duo of rap (dre and snoop) and it features eminem (back when he was cool)..those are only a few of the spotlights on this album.. <br /> <br />it opens up with what i think the best use of an introduction ive heard so far...and when i heard it i thought to myself...\\"this is a true west coast soulja. this isnt the wanna be's everywhere else\\" ...no this isnt the chronic.. this IS modern hip hop.. but its is rap at its finest.. not as classic as the chronic, but it is most definately comparable to it. it is something for dre to be proud of... so what if this album isnt old school..its still west coast, dre hasn't turned pop, and he still a thug. this music throws out complex bass lines, intriguing beats, and awesome lyrics to create a modern masterpiece.  <br /> <br />if you like modern rap but hate all that crunk.... buy this... <br />2001 is worth the money...
0881032646|3.0|Childhood's End is a compelling science fiction novel about human life being controlled by superior beings who influence humans to create what they think is a better Earth in their eyes.  But how much influence is too much influence?   <br />As the story unfolds you find yourself confused at some points, but anxious to find out how the story will play out in the end.  The author Arthur C. Clarke show's his imaginative intellect in this space adventure by testing your brain power.  The book does drag on sometimes but can peak the readers interest at other points.  I would most likely recommend this book to older more advanced readers, due to the difficult vocabulary, and confusing text.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has truly emancipated and has evolved from a beautiful butterfly, to a beautiful soul and talent. <br /> <br />This album showcases some of the best ballads of her career including \\"We Belong Together\\", the second single, and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\", a return to her gospel roots.  <br /> <br />She also has toned down the rap collaborations to smooth R&B joints with future hit songs \\"Say Something\\" feat. Snoop Dogg, and \\"Stay The Night\\", produced by Kanye West. <br /> <br />It's Like That has already had a successful launch on the Billboard Singles charts, and a new video for We Belong Together was just released!  <br /> <br />Buy this album, you won't regret it. Also add to your collection, Michael Jackson Number Ones. <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought this CD yesterday and I can't get it off my ears. I've played it over and over and I still can't get enough of it. <br /> <br />The tracks are hot and fresh, especially the Kanye/Mariah penned Stay the Night and the Neptunes/Mariah penned Say Something. Dope beats, great vocals, and sassy lyrics, all combined to create the best grooves for this summer. <br /> <br />However, as in all Mariah albums, there are ballads. But don't worry (for those who hate ballads) because the ballads in this album are not the sappy ones she used to do in the Music Box era. The ballads here are ballads with beats! Circles, We Belong Together, and Mine Again are bad-ass R&B ballads that will get you groovin' and movin without over-sentimentality. <br /> <br />The closing Fly Like A Bird is actually what emancipates this album. The music is Glorious, beffiting the songs theme. And when the background gospel choir sings \\"Higher\\" and \\"Higher,\\" combined with Mariah's angelic voice, you will finally experience heaven. Mariah belts, \\"Fly like a bird, take to the sky!\\" Upon hearing this album, so will you.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is honestly the BEST ALBUM of 2005! Every song in the album is unique, fresh, and inspiring. If you are a fan of hip hop, pop, R&B this is the CD for you. With incredible amounts of hits..hit after hit, Mariah shows off that she is still the diva that everyone tries to emulate from American Idol to Christina's, Alicia's and Beyonce's. She is the PIONEER! <br /> <br />It's Like That-- 5/5 best urban club song in the album. Truly a  <br />                 club banger! A feel good song. <br />We Belong Together--- 5/5 I think this is everyone's favourite!  <br />                      An amazing ballad! <br />Shake It Off--- 4/5  Reminiscent of 'Breakdown' and it's catchy. <br />Mine Again---5/5 SONG FOR ALL AGES! <br />Say Something---3.5/5 A very unique song. It grows on you.  <br />Stay The Night--- 5/5 Great Old school hip hop <br />Get Your Number--- 3/5 A feel good song. Not my favourite. <br />One And Only---4/5 Great R&B record. Mariah shows off her urban  <br />               roots but a little too breathy. <br />Circles---5/5 Awesome live instruments. One of my favourites.  <br />          Great ballad. <br />Your Girl-- 5/5 SUPER FRESH. A very unique and amazing song.  <br />             This is the street record. <br />I Wish You Knew--- 4/5 Good ballad. Very Adult Contemporary-ish. <br />To The Floor--- 3/5 Good song. I dont like it that much. haha <br />Joy Ride---- 5/5 The most beautiful song in the record. Just  <br />             plain AMAZING. <br />Fly Like A Bird--- 5/5 Definitely the BEST and MOST INSPIRING  <br />                 track. Brace yourself for some goosebumps. haha <br /> <br />LOOOVE THIS ALBUM. GO GRAB IT. YOU WON'T REGRET THIS PURCHASE!
B000001GQY|5.0|Believe all the 5 star reviews. This set by Gilels, Jochum and the Berliner Philharmoniker, belongs in every classical music library. The performances of both concertos are benchmarks. A serendipitous confluence of composer, pianist, conductor, orchestra, sound engineers, and technology.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is GREAT!!! Way better than I expect it would be....Mariah Carey is one of the best singer ever!!!!
B00079FUI6|5.0|i know i probably shouldn't be watching this, because the stereotypical guy should not be watching this. for some reason. but whatever, i like it and i cant wait for it to come out on dvd.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey never ceases to amaze me!! Charmbracelet may not have been her best album vocally but what amazed me by that album was that it didn't sound like any other of her other albums and it was like that \\"My Saving Grace\\" song was made for me because since I am a Christian, I feel exactly the same, Lord Jesus is my saving grace. After just one listen to The Emancipation Of Mimi, it amazes me how Mariah is not afraid to take chances, she doesn't have to have every single album sound exactly alike, she does what she wants and doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. NO album is exactly alike. There's always progression. I am, always have been, and always will be Mariah's true and hugest fan!! It's like Mariah writes these songs for me, I mean that I can totally relate, I'm a girl so it's not literally for me but hopefully people will know what I mean!!! I totally love The Emancipation Of Mimi. As I am writing this review I am listening to it, my 30th time in a row!!!<br /><br />The song It's Like That is so awesome to dance and sing along to. I love the music, the lyrics, and especially Mariah's powerful vocals! My all time favorite song is really hard to pick because there are two songs that I love and really can't decide between the two. We Belong Together is such a wonderful, beautiful slow ballad that should reach number 1 on Billboard, it's so powerful musically, vocally and lyrically and Mariah's voice is so amazing and everyone who thinks Mariah can't sing anymore, don't know what they're talking about because Mariah's voice is so incredible, especially on the end of this song!!! I totally love it!!!! The song Fly Like A Bird is such a spiritually, powerful song and it's amazing that Mariah wrote these words that I've been wanting to say, well I've been searching for the right words and it's Mariah who knew exactly what I was feeling toward the Lord. Mariah's church Minister or Pastor speaks throughout the song and \\"His Love Will Never Forsake You Or Leave You Alone, Trust Him\\" is forever in my soul. Words like \\"Carry Me Home, Higher Jesus, Carry Me Higher Lord\\" and \\"I Need You Now Lord, Carry Me High, I Need The Strength Of You By My Side\\" and \\"Keep Your Head To The Sky, With God's Love You'll Survive.\\" There is also a Choir singing. This song tells exactly how I feel toward the Lord Jesus and what I want to say to him. There's nothing better than my favorite singer of all time singing about my saviour, Lord Jesus!!! Another favorite of mine is Joy Ride. Not because my name is in the title, because it's such a cool pop song that you can sing along to and Mariah's vocals are over the top, especially at the very end of the song. I love the music during the chorus of Joy Ride with drum and bass beats, it's awesome!!! Shake It Off is a really cool R&B upbeat song. Mine Again is another slow ballad that Mariah belts on. Mariah just about belts on every single song, especially on We Belong Together, Mine Again, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird. Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg is a really cool dance R&B song with a really cool beat to dance to and I find myself singing along to this song too. Stay The Night is a very soulful and unique song, the music reminds me of something from the 50's or 60's and I love the way Mariah sings and belts. I love It!! Get Your Number with Jermaine Dupri is a cool upbeat R&B song that I also like. One And Only with Twista is a cool mid-tempo song that I like a lot. Circles is another slow ballad that I love and love the way Mariah sings!! Your Girl is a really cool upbeat song and I love the way Mariah sings in the chorus, it's a really cool song to sing along to!!! In I Wish You Knew, Mariah speaks a few times during the song and you hear an audience, a very beautiful slow ballad, I especially love the end when Mariah hits that high note!!! To The Floor with Nelly could be the next club song, it's a really cool upbeat R&B/Hip-Hop song.<br /><br />When I hear the song Fly Like A Bird, I picture just soaring way up high in the clouds because the song just makes me think of being up there in the clouds, being free, and on Joy Ride, I picture being up in the stars because the whole song makes me picture being up there high and flying through the stars. If Mariah was to make a music video for Fly Like A Bird, I picture her just soaring through the clouds on an Eagles' wing or something and for Joy Ride, I picture Mariah soaring through the stars. Mariah sings with so much emotion, soul, and power on these songs, all 14 of them, using all 7 of her octaves, hitting that really high note a lot!!! There is all sorts of elements, Pop, Hip-Hop, Soul, Gospel, and R&B. Mariah's new CD, The Emancipation Of Mimi is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes any of those elements I listed above and especially Mariah fans!! Mariah is the BEST!!!ure just soaring way up high in the clouds because the song just makes me think of being up there in the clouds, being free, and on Joy Ride, I picture being up in the stars because the whole song makes me picture being up there high and flying through the stars.

B00068IOWM|4.0|It took me awhile to get around to picking this one up. I kept trying to erase the tune Vertigo from my memory banks, but to no avail. I finally succumbed and slapped down my plastic. After the blandness of POP and the clever-cleverness of Everything You Can't Leave Behind, I was expecting a couple singles and a bunch of basic under-produced downers. I was happily surprised. Bono has re-taken control over the better part of the lyrics to great effect. Listen to Larry's wonderful drumming on \\"Miracle Drug,\\" and Adam's bass on \\"City of Blinding Lights\\"...Smashing! The Edge usually delivers brilliance, but the riffs for \\"Yahweh\\" are exquisite, and move me more than any playing I've heard for quite some time. Although this album revisits some of the sonic landscapes u2 have taken us to before, they painted those landscapes in the first place, and Im happy to see them again...

0805211063|5.0|A text, not so much a critque of religious institutions, as an analysis of the telescopic nature of human perception. Given the magnitude of importance assigned to each event by individuals within the novel, we are painted a magnificant portrait of perception. From the chamber maid who's life is given new hope by the arrival of the \\"land survayor\\" to K himself.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|After watching this film, I found myself thinking, all that for something not much? It really is a film that is much to do about nothing.    This movie excels in storytelling. It presents the story in a very exciting and thrilling manner, and the viewer is constantly trying to piece things together, and figure out who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. The viewer gets a good idea how life was in the West back then. There are some beautiful scenic shots of Western landscape and the cinematography is impeccable. The writing is also superb. I liked the characters' dialogue and the little subtleties that carry the plot forward.    Enjoyable to watch, but it could have used more meat on the plot.
B0007GAERG|5.0|She did it again!!! Ain't nothin' wrong about this cd! I love all of Mariah's albums and this one DEFINITELY comes out on top, 4 sho-ure! Even though I had to rate it 5 stars, she gets 10 stars in my book! And she deserves it truly for hooking up this album! And for those who don't know what being \\"emancipated\\" means, check out this cd! It says it all! The ones that's hot are \\"It's Like That\\" (of course!), \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Mine Again\\" (sooo romantic ballad), \\"Say Somethin'\\", \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", \\"One and Only\\", \\"Your Girl\\", \\"To The Floor\\", \\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\"!!!!! I'm tellin' yall, this is a magnif album for all those who needs to be \\"emancipated\\"! And that's real!!!

I mean, gosh! <br />Thank God for Morgan Freeman, a light of wisdom and experience, who saved the little drummer boy!  <br />I didn't really notice Ethan Hawke anywhere. Was he playing a Confederate? <br />This movie will show everyone that Slavery has no place in L.A.!
0808580019|4.0|This story has such a strange place in my life. Not from the novel initially but from the film starring Mary Pickford (and for the dismissive reviewer comparing Pollyanna to Rebecca and Anne - it's maybe worth noting that Mary Pickford acted in all three stories - I wonder what her view was?). The movie appears to have had great influence in my life - it must have reached me at such a vulnerable moment. Looking back I have no doubt that I have always played the 'glad' game - although I didn't call it that. Did I already have a predisposition for that? Who can say. My life is also littered with so many Annas - Annes, Roseannes, Dianas, Mariannas, Annas ......<br /><br />Of course all this is about me. When I decided to read the book as a bedtime story to my boys I was dealing with other people's reactions. Perhaps they would find it unengaging, perhaps it would be too dated for them (especially the preachy parts), perhaps they would not be able to identify with the little girl or the different social customs of the days of the novel. But it just wasn't so. They were interested in the novel. Each night when we left off reading they would speculate on what would come next, what we could intimate from the next chapter title. Whether they will take up playing the glad game themselves I couldn't say. Perhaps my reading will be less impressive than Mary Pickford's acting!<br /><br />Pollyanna was named after her mother(Jenny)'s two sisters Polly and Anna. When Jenny's husband dies and Jenny is already dead Pollyanna has to live with her aunt Polly. Perhaps I missed it but I am really puzzled. What happened to aunt Anna?
B0007GAERG|4.0|Ok. This is a good solid effort from Mariah. Not her best (like her Butterfly cd), but certainly not her worst. Honestly the thing that makes this cd good is the same thing that makes it a bit problematic. Sounds complicated, but basically Mariah is trying so hard to prove to us that she can still sing, that she sings soooooo hard on almost all the tracks. So your left feeling like \\"dag Mariah did her thing\\", but you almost feel like she could have tamed it down on the volume and power levels a bit and still have gotten the same effect. All in all she has definitely improved from her Through the Rain whispery voice days. In comparision to the other long awaited female releases this month, Tweet and Faith, Mariah definitely has beaten both of these ladies. That's not saying much in Tweet's case because her cd is pretty bad. Anyway, the songs I'm really liking so far are: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It Off, Mine Again, Stay the Night, Get Your Number (I'm surprised by how much I liked this one), Circles, and Fly Like A Bird. Others I'm still deciding on, but I can definitely say that her collaborations with both Nelly and Snoop leave a bit to be desired. So this is basically a pretty good cd and I'd say it's worth the $(...)!
B00005JM1F|4.0|The humor here was not to be believed. It was so funny I nearly fell off my chair while watching it. Luke Wilson is fast approaching his brother Owen as a great comic actor.     Will Farrell is brilliant as well. The movie flew by and I didn't check my watch even once. Always a good thing.
B0000027F3|5.0|Priest pulled out all the stops for this album.  Hard to believe that such a metal gem could be released in 1990.  Probably my favorite Priest album, due to the consistency of material throughout the album, plus its being friggin' heavy as hell!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I can barely find the words to review this cd... IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL! The instrumentation is spectacular and the vocals are akin to listening to angels sing. I have an extensive cd collection, and I must tell you that this cd will rank among my favorites. These young ladies are so talented. The fiddle playing is pure magic!  <br /> <br />Even though I love all of the songs on this cd, there are 3 songs that just blow me away: <br />Send Me A Song <br />Someday <br />The Soft Goodbye <br />Upon my first listen of the song \\"Send Me A Song,\\" I was reduced to tears. It is a moving request to one who has passed to send the remaining loved one a song. WOW! My eyes are welling with tears as I think about the song and write this review. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you love celtic music, this cd would be a wonderful addition to your cd collection.  <br />
B000002A3T|4.0|The music is as tight as ever, and thematically, Gilmour manages to come close to Roger Waters' brilliance in the seventies.  THE DIVISION BELL, however, feels like a band saying \\"We're finished.\\"  And it would seem so.  It's been 11 years, and Gilmour has been quoted as saying \\"the tank is empty.\\"  Now he and Waters are working through intermediaries to manage the band's huge library. <br /> <br />But let us talk of THE DIVISION BELL and Pink Floyd's swan song.  Here, the band sounds more like a whole unit than it did on MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON.  Credit Richard Wright, who does more of the writing and takes a few turns on vocals.  Whereas MOMENTARY had Gilmour's fingerprints all over it, you hear all three members this time, with Mason's flare for sound effects more thoughtful.  (Stephen Hawking doing a spoken intro?  How Floyd is that?)  Thematically, the songs seem to tie together.  One song, \\"Take It Back,\\" though, seems a better fit for MOMENTARY or even THE WALL.  Still a welcome addition. <br /> <br />The band, however, sounds tired.  How can I tell?  Try singing \\"Have a Cigar\\" over \\"What Do You Want From Me?\\"  Think they're trying to tell us something.  Also, Gilmour's vocals sound a little flat in places, like he's not as into this as he once was. <br /> <br />It's the inspired final song, however, that tells you the sun is setting on Pink Floyd.  \\"High Hopes\\" is a sad tune with a tolling bell in the background and poignant piano and guitar work throughout.  Listening to it, you get the impression that the credits are rolling on a movie that ends on a down note.  A terrific song, possibly the best of the post-Waters era, but also one that seems to say goodbye.
0345347951|3.0|Childhood's End is a science fiction book written by Arthur Clarke. It is set on Earth and describes a world of the future where the human race is no longer alone.A great deal of changes started to occur and eventually the people on earth are not in control of their basic lives. The author describes a perfect society \\"Utopia\\" where by things like war,hunger and poverty have been eliminated completely. The creatures have done so much good for earth but people are still puzzled about what their real mission is. Exciting events occur in this novel that lead the reader to become anxious yet confused at the same time. The most interesting part is when all is revealed and the biggest question that the humans have is answered.The story is so interesting at the beginning. The author manages to capture his readers because of his well developed ideas. He often puts in little clues that may be confusing at the beginning but towards the end become apparent. The only disturbing thing is that at the very end things turn out to be very different and not like you would have suspected. Personally I think that the end wasn't as well developed as it could have been. Things changed so drastically and It didn't give me a sense of satisfaction because I felt that I was left hanging. However if you are a great fan of Science fiction, Childhood's End is a good book to read it broadens your imagination and keeps you guessing until the very end.
B000002C1W|5.0|THE WALL was a masterpiece on a par with DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  But lose Wright and you get THE FINAL CUT, the album Roger Waters has been making over and over again for 22 years now.  It's bloated, pompous, and waaay too self-indulgent.  And on the actual FINAL CUT itself, Waters seems to forget Pink Floyd is a BAND. <br /> <br />A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON returns Floyd to what they did best, which is work as a unit.  True, Gilmour never does attain Waters' mastery of concept and lyric, but he, Wright, and Mason lead a host of session players in everything else that makes Pink Floyd great, namely musicianship. <br /> <br />And you can tell the band is a whole without Waters from the first notes.  SIGNS OF LIFE is all Richard Wright in the beginning and all Gilmour in the end, with Mason's babbling voices dubbed in for effect.  You know this album will do something THE FINAL CUT is completely incapable of...  Sounding like a Pink Floyd album. <br /> <br />Some say there's filler on this album.  I wish someone would point it out to me, because I haven't heard it in 18 years.  \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" make the album, and \\"The Turning Away\\" puts Gilmour's creative stamp on it.  \\"Dogs of War,\\" though, would do Waters proud with it's murderous rage against the global machine. <br /> <br />No, it's not DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or THE WALL.  But it's right up there with WISH YOU WERE HERE and ANIMALS, and much more coherent and polished than MEDDLE.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray Lamontagne's album is so good, I had to \\"hunt-n-peck\\" a review for it....my first one ever. <br /> <br />Here is the thing....listen to the song \\"Trouble,\\" and if it grabs you, buy the album.  The first time I heard \\"Trouble,\\" I thought two things (1)What a good song, and (2) This dude sounds a lot like Tracy Chapman, who is not a dude.  Since then I have become absolutely entranced by the album.  Now \\"Trouble\\" is my second least favorite song on the album, and I still like it a lot. <br /> <br />The song \\"Jolene\\" is gut-wrenching and fantastic.  The line \\"Man needs something he can hold on to....A nine-pound hammer or a woman like you\\" knocks me to the floor every time. <br /> <br />I hope that you buy this album, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I dont give a damn if these guys r playing punk/ska or not. They r simply creating excellent music man!! In fact I dont even think they were/are punk by nature (happens wid mostof us). This is real Green Day and this is one prodigal album!
B0007GAERG|1.0|In the Emancipation of Mimi, Mariah voice alternates between boring and overbearing...either come hither whispers, out right screaming, or eardrum shattering high notes.  Mariah never has been a true soul singer and this album confirms it.  She goes through the motions but never connects with the emotions.  The songwriting is derivative and unimaginative....copying either current trends or old standards.  The last song,  cringe-worthy.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This album brings together the best of Williams' film music written in and before 1999... The first disc is classic with themes from such blockbusters as \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial\\". It also includes some other works that are simply gorgeous, but not well known (i.e.- \\"Cadillac of The Skies\\" from \\"Empire of The Sun\\", etc.). The second disc brings us closer to this century with memorable themes from many films including \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"The Phantom Menace\\". This two disc set is an absolute must for all Williams fans!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is too beautiful for words. Harper Lee showed how racism is something that not only affects the minorities of the world. The reasoning behind why people are the way they are are amazingly portrayed. Finally a book that show the beauty of people and the digust in the world. The characters are simple yet powerful. They are the type of people one strives to become. Atticus , a man, willing to go againist the crowd and still love those who hate him. Boo Radley a man with a mind of his own, seperates from the sinful world, yet is there to him his fellow man. Tom Robinson helping a woman to be nice and earnest was killed for his goodness. Jem a boy who was a protector and smart. Scout a independent girl with a spunking attitude and an all around Americn feel. I admire to be like some of the character in the novel. Mostly I say quit the book you are reading and pick up this amazing book that is in a league of it's own.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I feel as if I'm the only one saying this but it has to be said. Queens was better with Nick. Lullabies has great moments such as  Medication,  Everybody Knows That You Are Insane (I find it funny though I cant tell if this is about Nick or Brodie),  I Never Came (something new and inventive by Josh as always), Skin on Skin (J. Devil with Josh), and Burn the Witch. Great songs! Queens quality, but i dont know, I remember them making albums and enviroments not moments and rooms. Lullabies to Paralyze (a line for Mosquito Song on Songs for Deaf) is a perfect mix of rated R and Songs for deaf, but without any of the excitment of either. Nick sang and made You think I Ain't Worth A Dollar But I Feel Like (well not wrote but it sucked without him), Six Shooter, Gonna Leave You,Another Love Song (all songs for deaf), Auto Pilot,  Quick and to the Pointless, Tension Head  (all rated R) which are those 'other' songs that arent singles but make a record a record. Can you have the Beatles without Mr. Harrison. (While my guitar gently weeps was not a single, yet a song that has gone down in history). Is the album good? Yes! Can Josh drag on with his I'm a guitar god who can fake singing? Yes! This album gets boring with out bass lines like In The Fade (rated R) and without vocal like You think I Ain't Worth A Dollar But I Feel Like. Josh did what a great musician such as himself should never do. He limited himself. It's medicore, such a dirty word for him. I heard jokes before it being released of it being call \\"queens light\\", and it should have been (there not that much lighter just that much less to them). Riffs feel old for some reason, and alot of times cheap. Theres less variation. Not a album but a few good songs, not what Quuens should be to me. If your the kinda of listener that wants some fun buzz for the ear, will keep steady, not change your view, and do COLOR BY F*^%ING NUMBERS. Yes, this is great. But if you want a painting so real you can swim in its streams and eat the apples growing on the trees, No. Just wait, Josh and Nick have grow apart before and come back together, I can tell by how much Josh has to defend this album in interviews he know Nick was the perfect individual for any artist who needed a beat, needed a riff, needed a new sound, needed a different direction for a song, or needed a finishing touch. (who thought?) P.S. New Nick album is a bit better than this but suffers from Nick kinda lossing it a few times, or probley a lack of ANY controll. So for both Nick and Josh Mondo Generator ROCKS, Dessert Session ROCKS, but Queens is just not the same without the two intertwined in sweet love. (so stop playing with yourself)eat the apples growing on the trees, No. Just wait, Josh and Nick have grow apart before and come back together, I can tell by how much Josh has to defend this album in interviews he know Nick was the perfect individual for any artist who needed a beat, needed a riff, needed a new sound, needed a different direction for a song, or needed a finishing touch.

B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is practically flawless! I and all the other Mariah lambs have been waiting for this album for quiet sometime, especially after the stellar performances Ms. Carey gave on the Charmbracelet Tour. For some reason this is billed as a comeback album and a return to form after her last two CDs. Glitter was vastly underrated and was never supposed to be a \\"Mariah Carey Album\\". It features some great songs and some of Mariah's strongest vocals. Charmbracelet was hindered by the whispery vocals and some not-to-strong songs but it was still a good CD. <br /> <br />Fans will be pleased to know that Mariah is singing in full voice for every song, as shown in the hot first single \\"It's Like That\\" and the excellent second single, the ballad with a beat, \\"We Belong Together\\". Other highlights for this album are the ballads \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\" (which is sung as if in front of a live audience and features Mariah speaking to the audience), and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\". \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" just struck me suddenly in a way that no Mariah song has. The song is very uplifting and every part of the song is just perfect. The subtle vocals in the beginning to the full on belting with the choir at the end. The song has brought tears to my eyes and is my favorite track!! The good thing about alot of the ballads is that they are sung live with a band and it just adds a more organic, original, 70's soul feel. <br /> <br />The hip-hop-pop songs are also great (my favorite is One And Only  with Twista) but its all about the ballads and Mariah's AMAZING AMAZING VOICE!!!! Go buy the CD, you will definately not be disapointed! Also check out Sprung and Secret Love, the bonus tracks on the international edition of this CD. I am a lamb for life and I think Mariah Carey is a goddess!
B000002LQR|5.0|Before I start going into the best album of all time, let say a little something about the best band of all time.  They had the idea in the first three albums, they may not be masterpieces but no less essential.  Then came Mother's Milk, the unbelievable work of art that is only matched in greatness by that of the next release (and possibly Californication).  Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the most phenominal human achievment in the history of man kind's existance.  And who better to deliver this masterpiece than John Frusciente, Michael Balzary, Chad Smith, and Antwon the Swan.  Please tell me if there is or has ever been a better line-up in the history of music because I dont think there could ever be one better.  Now I will divert my attention to the album.  Blood Sugar is good, very good, very very good.  I cant say that I have a favorite song on the album even though Sir Psycho really stands out.  But how can one deny Apache Rose or My Lovely Man or Funky Monks or Melloship Slinkey or the rest of the entire album.  I have possibly listened to this album more than any album ever.  It might be second the self titled Rage Against The Machine or Pearl Jam Ten though.  That has nothing to do with the genous of the album though.  The Good Time Boys are at their peak on this album and they couldnt sound better. Listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and love the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Move over bacon - now there's something meatier! <br /> <br />I don't know what the @#*! the title of this album means - neither does Mariah probably - but the diva of bland pop music is back with more pop music that's as forgettable and bland as ever!  You go girl! <br /> <br />I don't care if nobody would have heard of her, but for her relationship turned marriage turned sour (can you say DIVORCE?!?) with Sony music exec, Tommy Mottola - the girlz got game.  In fact, she gets jiggy with it - and NOBODY knows what the means! <br /> <br />I realize she's had a real run of bad albums lately - so bad in fact, you'd think SHE had the runs.  But this album is puts her over the top and back in my personal good graces again. <br /> <br />Ok, so there are a slew of gratuitous guest appearances from Nelly and Snoop and others here to help boost album sales and make her appear \\"legit.\\"  Ok, so she provides us with another prominant sexually-provocative, soft-core portrait of herself on the cover to help market the album, rather than rely on her talent alone.  Still, from beginning to end, the emancipation of mimi showcases the talent (= high-pitched notes and really loud singing) of Mariah.   <br /> <br />5 stars
B0007GAERG|4.0|Although I enjoyed Charmbracelet more, The Emancipation of Mimi is still a great album.  There are a few worthy ballads, including my favourites \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"I Wish I Knew\\" and \\"Circles.\\" <br /> <br />The tracks that feature hip-hop artists aren't the best tracks.  I much prefer her ballads than some of these ventures into urban music.  Had there not been so many of these tracks on this album, I would have graciously given five stars. <br /> <br />This is still a wonderful album and I would advise any fans of great Pop music to consider purchasing it.  I hope in future albums, that Mariah returns to her \\"roots\\" and records the types of songs that made her famous.
B000002H2H|5.0|If Metallica's 1983 \\"Kill 'Em All\\" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release \\"Ride The Lightning\\" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since \\"Kill 'Em All\\", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from \\"Kill 'Em All\\" out of the water. Tracks such as \\"Fade To Black\\" and \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on \\"Ride The Lightning\\", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include \\"Fight Fire with Fire,\\" and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". This album rocks in epic proportions.<br /><br />Overall, Metallica ruled the world at this point in time. There was no limits to their re-invention of raw, hardcore thrash metal. I was a huge Metallica fan growing up, and this one got spun the most. This is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a Metallica fan.
B00003CXCT|4.0|First, let me say that I love all three original movies... <br />I still have my Kenner Millennium Falcon (and not broken, either, <br />thank you very much). <br /> <br />I don't even care about the cheezy CGI additions to the movies, <br />or other minor changes. <br /> <br />I DO care about the whole Han/Greedo thing - this completely changes <br />the entire persona of a MAJOR character.  Han Solo is no longer <br />the rogue-ish space captain, he's just another goody goody <br />rebellion guy. <br /> <br />It's just... wrong. <br /> <br />I've watched the new editions at a friend's, but I just can't bring myself <br />to buy them. <br /> <br />It's just... wrong. <br /> <br />Someday - the heir's of Lucas will release the originals to get more <br />money.  Maybe I'll be alive then...
B000001EAQ|5.0|Oh my gosh........this blows \\"How to disamntle your interest in U2\\" 10,000 kms away, this is U2s most rocking and alternative album.....in fact its more of an alternative rock album unlike their other albums which are a bit more less wacky and experimental compared with this. <br /> <br />Great album, some incerible sounds and great guitar noises. <br /> <br />One of U2s best, if not the best......it probably is.] <br />The video clip versins of the songs are evn better.
B0007GAERG|5.0|simply a good feeling cd - powerhouse vocals, fun vocals... they're all here and the songwriting is fresh. not a bad track - what no filler?? excellent work by MARIAH AND HER NEW TEAM! your back girl - now stay put MIMI!  :)
B000001ES9|4.0|I agree with some of the other reviews in regard to lyrically they were obviously leagues beyond this with Pert on drums.  Ignoring that, this album is a solid rocker with no dependence on keyboards.  Sure they got slagged, Geddy Lee was compared by one critic as Robert Plant huffing helium, and the first track starts off very zeppelinesque with the caterwauling, but this is definitely worth your time nonetheless, it has balls and at this price is more than reasonable
0385513755|5.0|Bravo!!<br /><br />What a remarkable read. I devoured this book inside of three days.  I couldn't put it down and my heart didn't stop pounding for three days.  What a thrill ride from the opening line to the last line of the book, as soon as you have one thing figured out the book takes a 90 degree turn and your off runing again.<br /><br />As for the historical nature of this book I say bravo to Dan Brown for having the guts to stand in the face of so called organized religion and tell the truth.  It isn't easy to go against the mainstream and I salute a man who is willing to tell the truth no matter what the personal cost to him.<br /><br />This book is a work of fiction but if it like anything else that comes along your path of life if it causes you to pause and evaluate your own beliefs and values then it has done it's job.  As I have been taught take this in evaluate it and if it speaks to you then use what it has taught you. If this book doesn't speak to your higher self then be on your merry way no harm done.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion and this is mine.<br /><br />Have fun with this book, enjoy it but by all means get the illustrated version it makes it so much easier when you are trying to figure out what is going on where, espeically if you have never been to Paris or the Louvre.<br /><br />HAPPY READING!!!
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Rented this the other day and loved it.  Two couples, deception and paranoia you could almost count as an extra character, and brilliant dialogue.  Buy it now, you will not be disappointed.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I purchased this CD without ever hearing this band. I just kept hearing good things about Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  What an incredible surprise this is, what a breathtaking original sound.  It's \\"out-there\\" but it's approachable. Lots of good catchy pop-hooks interwoven with sonic weirdness.  I hear they lost their record deal with a major label over this session.  Thank God Tweady and co had the guts to stick with their convictions.  As I said, the music on this CD is stunningly original and sounds like nothing I've ever heard... Well, Pot Kettle Black's main progression is very much like The Cure's \\"In Between Days\\"... Ok, so if I tried to make comparisons to other artists I would suggest trying to imagine what Elliott Smith, Bob Dylan, Robert Smith (The Cure), and Brian Eno might sound like all rolled together!<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Poor Places\\".  How can a tune be poignantly beautiful, oddly bizarre, and wrap up with a guitar spewing out wild, noisy tension that sounds rather like the centerfuge of a 747 aircraft engine revving up and down, while a British female eerily repeats \\"Yankee... Hotel... Foxtrot\\" over and over in the background?  Intrigued?  You should be!  Amazing imagination at work here folks!<br /><br />YHF is Wonderfully Wonderfully Weird!<br /><br />If you like great, original music, you will like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot a lot.<br /><br />Postscript I: I noticed one reviewer called 'em \\"wusses...\\" I'm surprised as that reviewer rated King Crimson's \\"Discipline\\" very highly.  This music is made in the same spirit of creativity.  I suggest that reviewer give this CD several repeated spins.  YHF really is a great work of art.<br /><br />Postscript II:  THREE MONTHS LATER...  The acid-test... The test of time...  This CD is still ranks (along side Elliot Smith's X/O) as the most played CD in my collection.  Fantastic!  It never gets old, I hear something new with each listen.<br /><br />Elliott Smith fans, Cure fans, Shins fans will love this CD. A brilliant masterpiece.
0345347951|4.0|Arthur. C. Clark has one of the most intriguing visions of the future. In his novel `Childhood's End' the human race is no longer alone, alien like creatures, the Overlords have come down to earth to guide this humanity. The sudden arrival of the Overlords changes the day to day life of every human being. The  new way of life is for some time considered `splendid'. For many chapters Clark keeps the reader in suspense,which sometimes alters the reader's view on the rest of th e story. Nevertheless, shortly he reveals the secret side of the Overlords. After this part, the book's pace is accelerated rapidly often leaving the reader puzzled but free to interpret the scenes the way they want. Despite the ending Arthur C Clark can easily be credited for one of the most remarkable science fiction book, he has a very original way of portraying characters and their contribution towards the plot.
B000001DV2|4.0|How could I give my favorite album only four stars?  Well, I'm a Def Leppard fanatic, but I have to bow to the fact that the general population probably wouldn't list Def Leppard as the most talented band of all time. <br /> <br />This album is actually a change from the early Def Leppard rock vein.  For this reason, however, I feel that this album can easily appeal to listeners outside of the Def Leppard fan base.  Songs like \\"Tonight\\", \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" could easily find appreciation in the soft rock crowd.  Moreover, they are some of the first songs Def Leppard did (besides maybe \\"Hysteria\\") that actually deal with love and romance, and not just lust and sex.   <br /> <br />But for the Def Leppard fans, there's plenty to rock out to here as well, with tracks like \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", \\"Heaven Is\\", \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", and \\"Personal Property\\". <br /> <br />The last two tracks (especially track 10) are a little weak, but I feel that the quality of the first 8 more than makes up for that.  I would have loved it if the CD had more than 10 tracks, but what's there is good, and the price (this CD will probably cost you less than $3) is right. <br /> <br />If you're just dabbling in rock and roll and aren't ready for the hard stuff yet, Adrenalize is a great place to start. <br />
0345410025|5.0|So it's senior year of High School, and we have a vocab test for 20 words. The bell has rung, which means you have five minutes to get from one class to the next. I arrive in class, unprepared for the quiz. But then I read the words, apply the mnemonic methods suggested in this book, and I ace it.<br /><br />This episode repeats itself every week for thirty weeks, and I have the highest scores on these vocab tests.<br /><br />The book works.
0451191153|1.0|This book, while being celebrated as a philosophy and a story, is nothing more than a lot of excess words on paper.  Ayn Rand's so-called epic is a childish rant of sorts that calls to mind the selfishness of Holden Caulfield while not being nearly as compellingly written.  I won't say much of the life she led and that it's odd that she is one whose ideas seem to all too frequently be adpoted.   <br /> <br />In reality, I must say that she writes a monolgue like no one else, but I cannot forgive the implications or content of a book so obviously self-involved.
0671027387|3.0|I loved the DaVinci Code and this book is pretty good if you can get past some of the things that just don't seem possible.  At one point a character gets into NASA's headquarters without any credentials & I can't see that happening except in a movie.  There were also other incidents that just didn't seem plausible.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Omg I love Mariah's new cd The Emancipation of Mimi it is truely amazing. The ballads are beautiful and inspirational especially \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\". Say something produced by the Neptune's is my favorite song. I have to say that I'm very happy with Mariah's new cd and its good to see her back in the spotlight where she belongs! Them chickens are ash and I'm lotion!!!!
1401300901|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It was an easy and fun read.  I thought the storyline was good and I enjoyed how she showed how life must go on even after a tragedy such as the death of a loved one.  Although some of the emotions seemed overly dramatic for simple situations or conversations and some of the actions seemed seemed childish for women their age, this book was a very enjoyable read.
B0007GAERG|2.0|This album sure does not live up to all of the hype that surrounded it before it came out.  Her promo posters said \\"The Voice Is Back\\" and that may be true, but the good songs are not.  The Emancipation of Mimi is better than Glitter or Charmbracelet, but not by much.  If you've heard the first single \\"It's like That\\", then you've heard the best song album.  When I heard that song, I was so excited because I thought that this meant Mariah was finally going to come out with her first good album in years.  Well, unfortunately, this is 3/4 filler.  As always, she has once again continued with her rent-a-rapper formula, which got old about 8 years ago.  The majority of the lyrics are really childish and sound like a 20 year old should be singing them.  And many of the songs are really bland and sound really dated, as if she's desperate for the 70's to come back.  Also, the song Fly Like Bird, which was hyped up as being a beautiful ballad is actually a plain boring song.  I would suggest you listen to the album first before you buy it.  The only good songs if you ask me are It's Like That, We Belong Together, and Get Your Number.  The rest is junk.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought  the cd today and was very impressed. Wow mariah sounds better than ever with her beautiful ballads and all her hip hop/r&b tracks. I don't have a favorite song cause i love them all. To all the Mariah haters with the negative reviews get a life! Go pick up the album its hella good.
0375507256|5.0|Get ready to dive into an absorbing, smart and excellently written book. There is even a message and a call to action at the end. I was enchanted by Mitchell's writing--some sentences begged to be read aloud--and how well he created several voices. This book has meat; it challenges the reader to trust the author and that all will become clear; it demands your full attention; and most exciting of all, it makes you think. Most books are popcorn for the mind--Cloud Atlas is protein.
B0006399FS|4.0|I have to be honest.  I am a U2 fan in that I own most of their albums and have seen them live in concert.  But other than knowing the band members names and a shaky understanding of their history, I am still relatively a U2 novice.  What I can tell you, however, is that this album grows on you.  I picked it up knowing I would see them in concert and was first attracted to \\"Vertigo\\" (thanks iPod).  I moved on to \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and was captured!  What a beautiful song.  I fell in love with \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"All because of you\\", and \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\".  The latter particularily struck a chord with me.  I've had the album for some time now and I have truly enjoyed it.  I gave the album four stars out of five only because I have a personal tendoncy to rate all of U2's albums against Joshua Tree.  I know I should treat them as complete and seperate entities, but still--The Joshua Tree represents the \\"I-Ching\\" of rock for me.  But \\"How to Dismantle...\\"  really is good/quality stuff.  Please don't let the negative reviews keep you away.  You don't have to be a \\"live and breath for U2\\" fan to truly enjoy this!  Hey!  It's GOOD!!!  :-)

0345347951|1.0|The novel \\"Childhood's End\\" has been a disappointment to read. I say this because the novel starts off strong and exciting and finishes off weak and boring. In the beginning of the novel, the author kept me wondering what would happen next. Towards the end of the middle section of the book, I perhaps became tired, which explains why it seemed to me, the story began to lose its mood and started to make me not want to read anymore. This only got worse as the book came to an end. The story started to drift away from the human race and more into the Overlords, and eventually into a whole new character called the Overmind. In my opinion the adding of a new character, a couple of pages before the end of the book was not a very good idea. I don't recommend this book to a reader who has not read many science fiction books, because the book is a bit difficult to engage in, while it is very easy to disengage and stop reading the book.
B0002X314C|5.0|First lemme just say that I love this brother's music! I really hope he cleans up at the Grammys next year cause he's that damn good. I listen to this cd all the damn time! Just outstanding production and beats from Kanye West and John can really blow baby...one of the best R&B debut albums that I've heard in a looooooong time. DO NOT...and I repeat DO NOT sleep on this cd!
0316172324|4.0|it's not the deepest thing and it feels more like a compilation of other people's ideas... but is that bad? it's a very interesting read. and quick. I recommend it, but it won't change your life forever, I suspect.
0743454537|5.0|I loved reading this book!  I actually cried tears.  This book will really make you question your views on some pretty heavy topics and you may be surprised at your own reactions.  <BR>Beyond that, the book is clever and written beautifully.  I couldn't put it down.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|a MUST-HAVE for blue/jazz standards lovers!!!
014028009X|4.0|If you like romantic love stories with comedy then you should read this book. Bridget Jones is a very funny young women who thinks she has all the answers.I recomend this book to young women who are determined to change there self image ,change bad habbits , and find a functional relationship . As you learn about bridget jones and her hilarious ways you will find your self having alot in common with her.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is an awesome record.  I never expected anything THIS good.  It is scheduled to ARIIVE at #1 on Billboard album chars, pushing over 300k!!!! <br /> <br />My favourites are: <br /> <br />Say Somethin' <br /> <br />One and Only <br /> <br />Get your Number <br /> <br />Joyride <br /> <br />We belong together <br /> <br />To the Floor <br /> <br />This is good!
B0007GAERG|5.0|How is it possible to give this album below a 5 star rating....especially 1 star ratings. <br /> <br />I know exactly who these people are. These people come from the Janet Jackson fan club. They have been in a bitter battle with MC fans...and we all know that Janet can not sing for beans. Mariah and Michael are geniuses. <br /> <br />Anyways...this CD is like Mariah's debut...flawless...with perfect vocal cuts. <br /> <br />My personal favorite song is \\"One and Only\\". \\"Joy Ride\\" is a classic R&B ballad and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" shows Mariah still has her vocal strength. Check this out.
0446310786|5.0|I read this when it first was published and many times since.  The story is timeless.  The themes are as current as the day they were written.<br /><br />Three scenes stand out:  Atticus shooting the rabid dog, Scout being told to rise by the black people in the balcony of the courtroom because her father is \\"passin'\\", and Boo Radley standing in the bedroom after Jem and Scout were attacked on the way home from the school paegent.<br /><br />If this is not \\"the great American novel\\" it is certainly a contender.  Of the ton of books I have read in the last 50 years, this is the best.
B00003CY5J|4.0|Nick Wells (Robert DeNiro) is an aging thief that is looking to retire. He has enough money, owns a nice jazz club in Toronto and just wants to settle back. His occasional girlfriend, a flight attendant, (Angela Bassett), is thrilled to hear the news and offers to get her route transferred to Toronto. Nick's longtime fence, Max (Marlon Brando), comes to him with a proposition. There is an item in Toronto's Custom House that a customer will pay very handsomely for. Nick is initially reluctant. He never does a job in his hometown. It is too risky. But Brian (Edward Norton) has an inside connection.<br /><br />\\"The Score\\", directed by Frank Oz, is the type of summer film that adults crave, yearn and salivate for. An intelligent film, with good to great performances, an involving story and great technical work. If you were brought up on MTV-style editing, forget about it. 'The Score' unfolds at a very deliberate pace, which some people have already commented is too slow. I disagree. The story unfolds slowly, in the first act, to incorporate a way of life that Nick is used to. As things gear up, so does the action. Oz has crafted a film that looks great, but doesn't push the style envelope too much.<br /><br />DeNiro is, as usual, great. Nick Wells is tired and desperate to retire, but he wants to live a certain lifestyle and the lure of a sizable score brings him back into the fold. His character's relationship with Bassett's character is also good, but Bassett's character has about 15 minutes of screen time, if that. I found it interesting and fascinating to watch this character work and to get to know his life, likes and habits.<br /><br />Norton creates a very unique and interesting character. To reveal too much about the character would reveal secrets about the film. Secrets that, unfortunately, the trailers and commercials reveal. Jackie is an interesting character, a novice thief who seems to bristle at the direction of the more experienced Nick. Norton is a great actor and he more than holds his own against DeNiro and Brando.<br /><br />Brando is also very good. After a series of bizarre roles, he has toned down the theatrics quite a bit. Max Baron is a man afraid of losing his lifestyle as well. Since his lifestyle largely hinges on the work of Nick, he is hesitant to let Nick give up the work. Brando plays the role fairly simply. Occasionally, he does a bit of theatrical business but thankfully, no more wine buckets on his head.<br /><br />I love caper and heist films. I love trying to figure out what is going to happen and to find out how the people carry the heist off. 'The Score' leads to a climatic robbery which is plotted extremely well. We follow Nick as he prepares for the heist, never revealing all of the plan, so that when the heist actually happens, there are still some surprises. This reminded me of a French film, from the 50s, called 'Riffifi'. Both films spend a lot of time detailing the preparations for the heist. Both films are very good and worth watching.<br /><br />\\"The Score\\" is a handsome film, filled with interesting performances and an engaging story. Go see it. Go.

B0007GAERG|2.0|Alright, I was SO excited about this album. I even counted down the days till its release, but I must say...after hearing the entire album, I'm not impressed at all. A lot of fans are saying that it's her best album vocally...haha. What a joke! Yes, it's a big improvement from Charmbracelet, but even Glitter's vocals are better than those on this album. Mariah uses NO vibrato on this album at all. Instead, she screams the notes that should be calm, and whispers the other words that u can barely understand what she's saying. The songs could've been good, but once again it was her poor vocals that make this album bad.    It's Like That -- She doesn't sing on this song, she's pretty much talking the verses. And her fans get excited when she shouts at the end...Well that's all it is. It's SHOUTING. There's no singing at all. Vocally, its one of the worst on the album. But it does have a catchy chorus.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 2/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- .5/5    We Belong Together -- At first, I hated this song. I thought it was boring, but it became my favorite after over 70 listens in my iPod! There's not much singing here either, but I still like the song.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 5/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 3/5    Shake It Off -- This song is horrendous. The vocals are worse than Charmbracelet. Thats all I have to say for this piece of garbage.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 1/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 0/5    Mine Again -- I was really excited when this song was described as a \\"POWER BALLAD\\", but let me tell you, its more like a screaming ballad. SHE DOESNT SING. She screams the word \\"mine\\" with no vibrato, and it gets very annoying. I dont know anyone can even compare this song with Hero or Vision of Love.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 3.5/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 2/5    Say Somethin' -- This was supposed to be her first single at the beginning, and I hated it of course. There wasnt much singing here, but the beat is cool. Actually, the beats on every song are cool, its just her vocals that ruin them. Why cant she sing like she did in the 90s????  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 4/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 2.5/5    Stay The Night -- This would be one of my favorites. It's one of the only songs where she actually sings, but what ruins the song is the chorus. She screams the word \\"night\\" rather than singing it, and it gets very annoying after a while.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 3/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 2/5    Get Your Number -- This song is good. I thought at first I would hate it, but it's cool. It's probbaly my third or fourth favorite.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 4/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 2.5/5    One and Only -- Blah. The lyrics are ridiculous. I dont like the whole R&Bish beat. Once again, she's whispering the words! :/  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 2/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- .5/5    Circles -- I really was looking forward to this song. She probably sings the best on this song, but its very boringggg. There's nothing catchy about it.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 3/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 2/5    Your Girl -- Ew. She sings the word \\"mine\\" horrendously. I couldnt believe what I was hearing.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 1.5/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 1/5    I Wish You Knew -- I like this song. I dont know why peopel call it cheesy. Maybe its becasue people dont like to hear singing and prefer shouting and whipsering???  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 4/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 3.5/5    To The Floor -- Ahh. Worst song on the album after Shake it Off.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 1/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 0.5/5    Joy Ride -- Very boring. She doesnt sing...  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 2/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 1/5    Fly Like a Bird --When I first heard this song, I was soo happy. I was like...yay she's back. But then again, when u really listen to it...her vocals aren't as spectacular as people are making them out to be. She squeaks way too much, and the whiserping in the beginning is annoying. However...it is one of my favorites.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 4.5/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 3.5/5    Sprung -- WOW!! I love it. I may have lied earlier when I said WBT was my favorite, cuz I forgot about this one. She doesnt sing all that great, but its one of the only pop songs on this album, and its  completely new sound. It shoul'dve replaced that horror known as Shake it Off.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 5/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 3.5/5    Secret Love -- When I first heard the 30 sec clip of this, I thought...ew..more rappers. But no...it's very cool. I like it almost as much as Sprung. This couldve replaced To The Floor.  Compared to the other TEOM songs -- 5/5  Compared to all of Mariah's songs -- 3/5    Well, pretty much another disspointment. I think it's fair to say that Mariah WILL NEVER sing as good as she did in the 90's...of course...if she wanted to prove me wrong, she should just come out and sing Without You. That will never happen. She'd either be lipsyncing or sounding horrendous. I duno what happened to her though. She used to be the best singer in the wrold, but after her divorce, she began to whisper her songs. I thought the whispering was bad...but when u listen to this album, she now sounds like a two-year old in some of the parts. Even in ILT, she makes some weird noises and its hideous. I still love Mariah Carey tho...I jsut preferred her when she was controlled by Tommy Motalla and in a mentally abusive marriage. Thats when she actually can sing.      In Order (starting with my favorite)    1.We Belong Together  2.Sprung  3.Secret Love  4.Fly Like a Bird  5.I Wish You Knew  6.Get Your Number  7.Say Somethin'  8.It's Like That  9.Circles  10.Mine Again  11.Stay The Night  12.Joy Ride  13.Your Girl  14.One And Only  15.To The Floor  16.Shake It Off
B00005JKBC|3.0|Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), a CIA operative about to retire, receives a phone call from Hong Kong on the morning of his retirement. Hurry to the office and read the cable. At CIA Headquarters, Muir learns that Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been taken prisoner by the Chinese government for trying to help a prisoner escape. Muir's supervisors want to hear all about Tom, an operative trained by Muir. Muir quickly learns that Tom may be sacrificed and sets about saving his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<br /><br />\\"Spy Game\\", the new film directed by Tony Scott and starring Redford and Pitt, is a satisfyingly good film. Almost surprisingly so. Scott is a good director, but he edits his films very fast, almost as though he is catering to the MTV Generation. He may very well be doing that, but if so, the film has a lot of story, seasoned actors, and a complicated story, elements not usually associated with an MTV Generation film.<br /><br />Redford is very good cast as the aging CIA operative. Much of the film is told in flashback as he recounts the training of Tom Bishop. These scenes are actually the best because they allow the actors to create a relationship, a bond between the characters which is interesting to watch. Redford conveys an authority that Bishop picks up on and almost embraces. He becomes the father figure that Pitt's character needs. He also manages to convey emotion when his character isn't supposed to convey any. It is interesting to watch Redford play against Pitt; I can see the similarities between Redford at Pitt's age and Pitt's acting now. If Pitt manages to create half the library that Redford has, his career will be well-remembered.<br /><br />A significant portion of the film is set in 1991, present day in the film's timeline. These scenes focus on Muir trying to learn about Bishop's situation and smack of an artificial air. These scenes are interesting but Muir learns way too many things by catching glimpses of things out of the corner of his eye, or holding fake conversations during the middle of an interrogation. All of these scenes are set in CIA Headquarters. They make the rest of the staff working at the CIA appear to be buffoons.<br /><br />As the story careens back and forth, in both time and between places, I became increasingly involved in the story and was able to overlook the excessive editing. The flashbacks, ranging from the Vietnam War to the conflict in Lebanon, show Bishop as he matures and the relationship with Muir deepens. As they are both spies, outward emotion is frowned upon, so it is interesting to watch Pitt and Redford display what emotions they can and to make these characters empathetic.<br /><br />The editing is still on my mind. At times, this works. For instance, there will be a master shot, establishing a town square for instance. Then the camera will find an element, move quickly towards it and turn slightly, showing us where Muir is, in a landscape. This seems successfully evocative of an actual spy mission. But this type of effect is carried to extremes and over-done, making it difficult to concentrate on things for very long.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about the film is the pacing. Most of the flashback sequences are exciting and fast-paced. The scenes set in 1991 are much, much slower.I don't mind this, but it is another inconsistency, especially as the film appears to be geared towards the MTV crowd.<br /><br />Despite the over-editing and the ease with which Muir finds out confidential information, I recommend \\"Spy Game\\" for the engaging characters created by Redford and Pitt.holding fake conversations during the middle of an interrogation.

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This is pure Queens beauty at it's best. Josh Homme proves once again that he is a musical genius. GENIUS. I was worried that this album without nick would be lacking, however it seems to have gained appeal. Some songs are catchy (little sister, medication) others brim with musical mastery (everybody knows you're insane and skin on skin) and some are just plain great tunes! (long slow goodbye) I just love this album and would recommend anyone to pick it up! Whether you like hard rock, alternative, pop and even country, this album will appeal to all types of genres! <br />You rules QOTSA!!!!!!!!! Josh, you're the man.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The horrors of war are nothing compared to the horrors of a broken heart.<br /><br />May 25, 2001, a day that will forever live in infamy. A day on which director Michael Bay released his latest assault on the senses. A day in which producer Jerry Bruckheimer makes yet another calculated attempt to release the blockbuster of the summer.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Harbor\\" begins in 1923, in rural Tennessee. We meet Rafe and Danny, two great friends who have dreams of fighting in the war. Flash forward to early 1941. Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are training with Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) at an airfield on Long Island. Rafe and Danny should be about 30 at this point, but Rafe comments that he is 25. During a physical, Rafe falls in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), a nurse. Naturally, Evelyn falls for Rafe. He is, after all, a dyslexic fighter pilot who folds origami swans. I'm not kidding. Rafe accepts a position with an elite flyer squadron in England and leaves Danny and Evelyn together. They are soon transferred to Hawaii. Flash forward to December 5, 1941, Rafe...<br /><br />Oh, enough of the ludicrous love story Bay, Bruckheimer and writer Randall Wallace have perpetrated on the public. Be warned. They make you, me, us, sit through 90 minutes of the melodrama before the actual attack. Throughout the film, we are occasionally `treated' to voiceovers by Evelyn and Rafe reading their letters to each other. Fingernails on a chalkboard.<br /><br />Memo to Ben Affleck: Take your copy of the book \\"Facial Expressions for Every Occasion for Every Actor\\" with you to the next film. The audience should not laugh when you are trying to convey that your character is hurt.<br /><br />Each of the characters is surrounded by a group of stereotypes. Unfortunately, they each have one or two moments, not nearly enough to help them become memorable. The stuttering fighter pilot has a moment of comedy. The young nurse with the big glasses is just amazed at the size of the world. The pretty nurse is a tramp. And so on.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr., Colm Feore, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and others pop up in what amount to extended cameos. Gooding Jr. thrusts his chin out. Feore is wasted. Voight and Baldwin make the most impact. What a waste.<br /><br />These fine actors are wasted because the entire film, all three hours of it, is about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn. Remarkably, Bay makes even the Pearl Harbor attack about them. The attack takes place and we watch planes attack ships, airfields, people. We watch ships sink. We watch torpedoes do their job. Throughout, Rafe and Danny are racing to an airfield, to find a plane to use. They manage to get into the air and shoot down seven planes. Evelyn rushes to the hospital and has to decide who gets help. After the battle is over, Evelyn and Rafe have `the talk' which you have been expecting for some time. Evelyn says that she didn't know Rafe would come back. \\"Then you came back on the 5th and all of this happened.\\" The `this' she is referring to is the attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack when much of the Pacific fleet was disabled. The attack when many people died. But it sure inconvenienced her love life.<br /><br />The attack sequence has some impressive shots, but ultimately it fails to conjure any emotion. Because we know so little about any of the characters, we don't really feel a lot of emotion for them. A couple of things are mentioned, rather than shown, robbing the film of some heart-wrenching sequences. Film is a visual medium. Don't describe an action.<br /><br />There is one thing I am thankful to Michael Bay for. He has slowed down the editing a bit. \\"Armageddon\\" was a collection of five second shots, strung together to form a narrative. In \\"Pearl Harbor\\", he slows the editing down, but he still edits far too much. As soon as he shows someone, he gives us only a few moments to get used to them, before cutting to another angle of the same person. Let us live with the character fora few moments, Michael. Give us a chance.<br /><br />Also, we have no sense of place in the film. Where did the planes come from? How did everything happen?<br /><br />This film is already being compared to and critiqued against \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Titanic\\". It wants so bad to be both films. The comparison to \\"Ryan\\" is evoked by the Pearl Harbor attack. As I mentioned, it has some impressive moments, but it is nowhere near as memorable as the opening of \\"Ryan\\". \\"Ryan\\" was rated `R' and stained our memories with blood and gore. \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is rated PG-13 and has to show restrained images. The difference between the two? One battle looks real. One battle looks like a film. \\"Titanic\\" was an epic film, using a romance as a door into a historical event. The two central characters are real, alive and we care for them. None of the characters in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" appears this real and therefore we don't care about the romance. It is merely filler.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Harbor\\" is just not very good. Judging by the reaction of the audience I saw the film with, I am not alone in my opinion. People actually booed at the end. People laughed when Rafe realizes the truth about Evelyn. Many people didn't like this film. If you are looking for a good film, go to \\"Shrek\\", \\"Moulin Rouge\\" or \\"Memento\\" instead.ive with the character for a few moments, Michael.

B000002J09|5.0|This Led Zeppelin album is one of those albums that's a little hard to classify since virtually every style they've been known for is represented.  It's also the beginning of unconventional artsy album covers as there are no pictures of the band, nor does the name Led Zeppelin appear.  In the days of LP records, only the lyrics of \\"Starway to Heaven\\" could be found in the inner sleeve and the 4 individal symbols for each band member.  Technically, there's no official name for the album, though fans have called it \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" or \\"Zoso\\" or \\"Runes\\" or even \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" <br /> <br />The hard rockin' \\"Black Dog\\" starts out this album.  Guitarist Jimmy Page hits the E chord several times and then Robert Plant sings \\"Hey, hey, mama, say the way you move, gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.\\"  Page, bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham answer furiously.  All of the members shine on here. <br /> <br />\\"Rock and Roll\\" follows, a 1950's Chuck Berry style rocker.  Bonham (aka Bonzo) hits the snare drum for the intro and Page lets loose with a killer riff. Jonesy adds some Jerry Lee Lewis style piano.  I'll bet you won't be able to just stand still and listen to this song! <br /> <br />The English folk piece \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" helps mellow the mood.  Page plays an acoustic guitar here, Jonesy plays mandolin and Plant shares lead with Sandy Denny.  The lyrics speak of Tolkien influence. <br /> <br />\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" needs no introduction.  What could I tell you that you haven't read on this page already?  If you've ever had the dial on FM somewhere, you're quite familiar with this close-to-8 minute epic.  In fact, I'll bet even some of your parents listened in bewilderment even in 1971.  Folk and hard rock are combined in this song.  The song's lyrics have been interpreted on many levels. <br /> <br />\\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" sounds enigmatic in the verses, both melodically and lyrically.  Jonesy starts it off with an electric piano riff (A, G, E) with Page answering the riff on guitar, with Bonzo adding in a fill on drums.  Plant multitracks his voice. <br /> <br />\\"Four Sticks\\" is an Eastern sounding rocker, heavier than \\"Friends\\" and perhaps a precursor to \\"Kashmir.\\" <br /> <br />The 1960's style folk ditty \\"Going to California\\" mellows the mood again, with an acoustic guitar from Page and Plant singing in an uncharacteristic baritone.  The lyrics seem to speak of hoping to find happiness out in California. <br /> <br />\\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is the only blues song on the album.  It is also the only song where Plant plays harmonica.  The song is based off an old Memphis Minnie blues standard and for 7 minutes Led Zeppelin plays raunchy blues, ending with an unusual coda, which sounds almost like an abrupt earthquake (I don't know for sure but it sounds like Page is playing a banjo through an amplifier). <br /> <br />If you're interested in the music of Led Zeppelin, this album is probably the most appropiate place to start.
B00005JKED|4.0|\\"Training Day\\" marks another great performance by Denzel Washington, easily one of the most consistent actors working in Hollywood. Reviewing his career for a moment, there are many, many outstanding performances. Everything from Easy Rawlins in \\"Devil In A Blue Dress\\" to \\"The Hurricane, \\"Malcolm X' to \\"Philadelphia\\".<br /><br />Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is joining the Narcotics Force of the LAPD. The unit's leader is Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Alonzo gives Jake one day to prove himself worthy of a position on Alonzo's team. Jake is anxious to make Detective and Alonzo promises that after working with him for 18 months, he will become a detective. The day doesn't start well for Jake as Alonzo immediately sets the tone for the whole day and their relationship, defining who is in charge. As the training progresses, Alonzo shows Jake the routine he has set-up and the host of activities he is involved in. Alonzo doesn't walk the straight and narrow and Jake frequently has to come to terms with his own ethics and morals. Jake and Alonzo meet with drug dealers, Alonzo's El Salvadoran mistress, gang members and more, illustrating the fine balance that a detective has to walk. However, the balance has shifted as Alonzo demonstrates to everyone around him who is in charge.<br /><br />\\"Training Day\\" written by David Ayer, and directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a powerful film. The film presents an unflinching portrait of life in the LAPD for two cops who are out of the normal routine. I think this is largely the point that Alonzo is trying to get across to Jake. They are not a part of the normal police force and should be allowed to take certain licenses. The conflict arises as Jake holds true to his ethics and morals.<br /><br />Denzel Washington walks a fine line with his portrayal. Alonzo Harris is an unlikable, powerful force unto himself, but he has to be likable, to a certain degree. Washington manages to pull this off by revealing a certain amount of laid back attitude. He jokes with Jake and manages to help alleviate the pressure, at times. Flipping the coin, he also keeps Jake on his feet by immediately creating an air of hostility and uncomfort by bringing him back into Alonzo's reality. The story also sets up a conflict between Alonzo and another group, providing an ongoing level of hostility. As the day progresses, Alonzo becomes more desperate and unhinged as he has to deal with the impending deadline. A very, very good performance by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is also very good. Primarily the straight man to Washington's comic, Hawke reacts to most everything that Washington does. He brings a sense of naivete and innocence to the role balancing that with his previous work as a cop and the fact that he is an adult. It is a good performance that reveals a lot more depth than a superficial `buddy'. As Alonzo continues to throw things at Jake, we see Hawke constantly working through the problems and the situations, quickly, before he makes decisions.<br /><br />As the film depicts two cops working in a rough and violent terrain, the film contains a few scenes of concentrated violence. Their language is also very coarse. As both are used to tell the story, these elements don't bother me, but you should be aware that they are present.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Training Day\\" is a very good film, but the conclusion is not as effective as the rest of the film. In a final showdown, Alonzo is confronted with many of the people he previously battled, a sort of showdown. The most obvious person to end the situation walks away leaving Alonzo to confront a group of gang members. The gang members pose a credible threat, with guns at their sides. Who exactly are we supposed to root for in this confrontation? Harris is crooked and dirty, the gang members aren't little angels of virtue either. In a way, this conclusion would present an ironic twist to one of Alonzo's previous statements about the street taking care of the street,but that doesn't happen either. Instead, we have what seems to be a tacked on ending, neatly tying everything up. Personally, I would've preferred an ending that didn't necessarily tie everything up. The cops don't have everything tied up at the end of the day, why should the film?<br /><br />\\"Training Day\\" is a very good, very adult entertainment, featuring another great performance by Denzel Washington.re of the street, but that doesn't happen either.

B000005IU1|5.0|I was 15 when I put this record. I recall everything about that day and how I thought the record was on the wrong speed because the punk I was listening to back in the early 80s only came on vinyl. It seemed so slow for the father of punk. I am so glad that I took the time to fully love the Stooges and started with this particular album. I think music would sound much different today if Electra didn't sign MC5's little brother band. Music doesn't die and is free of time. One person grabs it and manipulates it and passes it along. Iggy's raw power sparked the by the turmoil of his time passed this this like a kidney stone to the late 70s punks and beyond. I don't know how well this album would be received to someone who isn't looking for just this thing but if you are into this then you will consider is a must I know I do. I also very much enjoy his later stuff with the deep bass drum. If you like to play garage rock then you should know how to play this entire album forward and backwards.   <br /> <br />Thanks for listening <br />
078322947X|4.0|A group of four desperate men, from all corners of the Earth, escape to a decrepit South American oil mining village. A fire breaks out at the company's new oil well, burning out of control. The only option to get production back on track is to blow the fire out, using dynamite. The only dynamite available is highly unstable and the only means of transportation is by truck, 200 miles through the jungle. The oil company offers a large reward, enough for each of the four men to escape the living hell.<br /><br />\\"Sorcerer\\", produced in 1977, and directed by William Friedkin, is a remake of the French classic \\"Wages of Fear\\". Usually, I can't stand remakes, but in the case of \\"Sorcerer\\", Friedkin reinterprets parts of the film, while retaining the white-knuckle suspense sequences. He doesn't create a new film, but when compared to \\"Wages of Fear\\", really one of the best films ever made, \\"Sorcerer\\" is really very good.<br /><br />\\"Sorcerer\\" was one of the many International productions studios created in the 70s. These films were filled with international casts in an attempt to secure an audience in the various countries. Now, American movie stars are so big oversees, they really don't have to worry about it.<br /><br />\\"Sorcerer\\" begins with the story of why each of these men found it necessary to live in this South American hell hole. I am not certain, but I think that \\"Sorcerer\\" did not make a lot of money. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that each and every character has many, many faults. Personally, I like this. No one is perfect and these characters are more interesting to me. Roy Scheider plays Scanlon, a New Jersey hood who participates in the wrong job. Bruno Cremer plays Serrano, a French investment banker. Francisco Rabal plays Nilo, a South American hitman. Amidou plays Kassem, a bomber on the run from Tel Aviv. Each of these characters makes a decision to escape to the little South American town, but then desperately wants to escape. The town is in the Rain Forest and they quickly become tired of the poverty, disease, mud and rain surrounding them. Their willingness to accept such a high risk mission is very believable.<br /><br />The cinematography is lush and waterlogged, adding to the realism of the film. Once they begin their journey, they traverse land in just about every climate and the viewer feels as though he is along for the ride.<br /><br />Scheider has never been one of my favorite actors, but in this film, he is very believable. He and the other three members of the team all seem very desperate to escape, very determined to make it through the obstacle course they have embarked upon, and very determined to make it home.<br /><br />Much like \\"Wages of Fear\\", the first half of the film sets up the circumstances of the four characters and then life in the village. This is a very necessary part of the process. They hate living there and we, the viewer, have to see why. The second half involves the trek to get the dynamite to the oil drilling site. It is a harrowing journey, one that had me on the edge of my seat, even though I watched the journey in `Wages of Fear\\" a few months ago.<br /><br />There are two problems with \\"Sorcerer\\". The first is the score by Tangerine Dream. I didn't think it added anything to the suspense scenes and would have preferred to watch the scenes with no score. To me, this is so much more effective. Let us determine when we should get excited. If you don't cue us, we will be that much more excited when something happens.<br /><br />The second is Roy Scheider's performance is ruined in the last few moments. Cheesy graphics and voice overs are used to tell us the state of his character. Again, unneeded and it simply provides an opportunity for Scheider to chew the scenery.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Sorcerer\\" is a very good film and a really good example of superb action filmmaking.

B00080ZG10|4.0|Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) spent most of his adult life channeling his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder into one pursuit after another. A deeply phobic man, with too much money, Hughes left Houston, Texas, his birthplace because of a fear of disease. Landing in Hollywood, he immediately began to use his money to make a film. `The Aviator' opens with Hughes in the middle of filming his World War I epic `Hells Angels'. He has the largest army of airplanes in the United States for the filming. Louis B. Mayer laughs at him when he tries to borrow another camera, because he needs 24 to capture every airplane on film during an aerial flight. He soon realizes that the planes need to have a backdrop in order to create a sense of speed. This means clouds. He needs clouds. In California, clouds are difficult to find. The filming stretches on far longer than a normal studio film and the money flies out of his pockets. Just as he is about to finish the film, sound is introduced through Warner Bros. `The Jazz Singer'. Immediately realizing that this is the wave of the future, he reshoots the entire film in sound. It becomes a huge hit and cements Hughes place in Hollywood. During this time, he also fuels his love of aircraft supervising the building of the fastest airplane. He runs his hand over the fusilage of the latest model and says `No, it won't work. The rivets have to be countersunk. Start again.' He can say those things because he has OCD and he has a lot of money.<br /><br />Another of Hughes passions was women and in Hollywood, there were no shortage of beautiful women. Jean Harlow (singer Gwen Stefani in a very brief, unspectacular turn), Ava Gardner (played by Kate Beckinsale, who I still consider a vacuum on the screen, sucking all of the life force from a film). Thankfully, Ava Gardner only makes a few appearances during the film. The bulk of his romantic interests lie in Kate Hepburn, played By Cate Blanchett. They are fellow adventurers and Hughes is no doubt drawn to Hepburn's less glamorous, more masculine air.<br /><br />Scorcese's `Gangs of New York', his last collaboration with DiCaprio was a huge disappointment. The film's best performance, by Daniel Day Lewis, so overwhelmed the rest of the film, that it became a chore to sit through the long, overblown, confusing story. `The Aviator' is a lot better, so much better that it restores my faith in Scorcese, a faith that waned a bit.<br /><br />The look of `The Aviator' is fantastic. Much of the film is made to look like a film shot in early two-strip Technicolor. Many people probably don't realize that color was used in films a lot earlier than the late 40s. Two-strip Technicolor was used in the early 30s by people like King Vidor. It has a distinctive look. In `The Aviator' it immediately adds a level to the film and helps it recreate Hollywood in the 30s. For instance, in one scene, Hughes and Hepburn are out playing golf. The green of the golf course is slightly blue, almost an aqua, which in turn is very close to the color of Blanchett's and DiCaprio's eyes. Throughout these scenes, the three primary colors are predominate and the shading comes in the dark tones throughout. As Hughes story progresses through the 40s, the colors become richer and more defined, as Technicolor became more advanced.<br /><br />The performances, overall, are fine. DiCaprio brings a youthful enthusiasm that seems to fit with Hughes OCD and drive. What he isn't great at is getting to the heart of Hughes' character. We don't ever really learn what lies beneath, beyond the drive and OCD. Yes, he is a man with a lot of lovers, but we don't really learn why. During the last act of the film, Hughes basically goes crazy and locks himself away in a screening room, naked, peeing into milk bottles, unshaven. Scorcese treats us to many scenes of DiCaprio talking to himself, in an effort to prove that he is going mad. One shot of a man peeing into a milk bottle would pretty much do that for me. Unfortunately, this type of scene, with an actor talking to himself throughout, would be difficult for a great actor to pull off, say DeNiro, but DiCraprio isn't a good enough actor to make this believable. These scenes reek of Acting 101 classes.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is fantastic as Kate Hepburn. She isn't doing an imitation, per se, as she is using the familiar mannerisms and speech of Hepburn as she plays a character. It is a fine line to walk but Cate Blanchette walks it beautifully. Kate Beckinsale is on screen briefly, thankfully. I think the last film I remember seeing her in was `Pearl Harbor'. I feel the same way now that I did then. She is a vacuum that seems to suck the life out of every frame of the film. Yes, she's pretty, but she can't act her way out a paper bag. Gwen Stefani's role is so brief and she doesn't have much to do. This leads anyone who knows who she is to say `Oh, that's Gwen' when she pops up on screen. Not `Oh, that's Jean Harlow.'<br /><br />The standouts in the male supporting cast are Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda. Baldwin plays Juan Trippe, the owner of Pan Am. Hughes bought TWA. Naturally, Trippe wasn't happy when TWA decided to start flying to Europe, so he did everything he could to shut TWA down. Alda plays Senator Brewster, the head of a Senate Committee that oversees aviation in this country. He is also in Trippe's pocket. Together, the two of them prove to be worthy foes of Hughes. Each assays their role in all of it's inherent slimy details.<br /><br />Scorcese has created a long, well crafted, interesting film about a man few know little about.

B000002KKD|5.0|Even in the weird, quirky world of new wave and post-punk in the late '70s, the B-52's' eponymous debut stood out as an original. Unabashed kitsch mavens at a time when their peers were either vulgar or stylish, the Athens quintet celebrated all the silliest aspects of pre-Beatles pop culture -- bad hairdos, sci-fi nightmares, dance crazes, pastels, and anything else that sprung into their minds -- to a skewed fusion of pop, surf, avant-garde, amateurish punk, and white funk. On paper, it sounds like a cerebral exercise, but it played like a party. The jerky, angular funk was irresistibly danceable, winning over listeners dubious of Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson's high-pitched, shrill close harmonies and Fred Schneider's campy, flamboyant vocalizing, pitched halfway between singing and speaking. It's all great fun, but it wouldn't have resonated throughout the years if the group hadn't written such incredibly infectious, memorable tunes as \\"Planet Claire,\\" \\"Dance This Mess Around,\\" and, of course, their signature tune, \\"Rock Lobster.\\" These songs illustrated that the B-52's' adoration of camp culture wasn't simply affectation -- it was a world view capable of turning out brilliant pop singles and, in turn, influencing mainstream pop culture. It's difficult to imagine the endless kitschy retro fads of the '80s and '90s without the B-52's pointing the way, but The B-52's isn't simply an historic artifact -- it's a hell of a good time.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Warner Bros. has just released a great, new DVD edition of 'Superman: The Movie', starring Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty and Marlon Brando. Directed by Richard Donner, the film has always been a standard for all of the superhero comic book films. However, the DVD edition is simply luminous. The print is beautiful, the sound great. Donner has also added footage to the film which only serves to make the experience even better. A great movie to watch at home.<br /><br />Just before his planet blows up, a young boy is sent to Earth by his father, Jor-El (Marlon Brando). On Earth, he is adopted by an older Kansas couple. He realizes that he has strange powers and shortly after his father's death, sets off to the North Pole. There, he creates the Fortress of Solitude and learns about his past and how he can affect the future. Finally, the adult Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) sets off to Metropolis and gets a job at the Daily Planet. He is attracted to the brash city beat reporter, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Soon enough, the citizens of Metropolis need the help of Superman and Lane sets out to get an interview. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is also closely watching the developments and formulating a plan.<br /><br />'Superman' is a remarkably accomplished film. It is a film about a superhero, based on a comic book, in which the story is given more priority. Imagine that. In the new DVD edition, Donner has added some significant scenes set on Krypton and also enhanced the scenes set in Kansas. Watching the film again, I was struck by how realistic the scenes set on Krypton were. As CGI was not in use at the time the film was made, the filmmakers had to create worlds and special effects the old fashioned way. After Jor-El finishes his interrogation, the roof of the building moves away to allow for the convicts to be taken away. How was this done? With miniatures. And it is completely believable.<br /><br />When Clark arrives in Kansas, he lives with an elderly couple on their farm. Donner and company perfectly capture the sun dappled brilliance of the countryside. Set in the 50s, everything is completely believable. Donner has added some scenes to further enhance the relationship between Clark and his mother. The landscapes are really beautiful and give the film an epic quality.<br /><br />When Clark arrives in Metropolis, the city scape is jarring. From a life of relative quiet and solitude, he is thrust into a large, loud, huge city. It is also a great reflection on how the times have changed.<br /><br />Upon his arrival in Metropolis, the entire film gets a little surreal, also reflecting life in the big city. Things get a little more cartoonish, but when someone is plotting to blow up California, things are expected to get a little broad.<br /><br />The actors in each of the segments also reflect the type of life in each. Brando brings a quiet authority to the role of Jor-El. He is a larger than life figure, played by a cinematic icon.<br /><br />Glenn Ford plays Clark's dad in Kansas. Could they have picked a better actor? As he walks around the farm, he just looks as though he belongs.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve is really perfect as Clark Kent/ Superman. He brings a gangly, goofy sort of nerdish quality to Kent and a matinee idol quality to Superman. He is also remarkably restrained, making the roles all that more believable, a quality that he was able to retain for 'II', but lost, in a big way for 'III' and 'IV'.<br /><br />Margot Kidder is the embodiment of Lois Lane. She is perfect in the role, brash and confident.<br /><br />Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is also a standard that is perhaps only rivaled by Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in 'Batman'. Super intelligent, yet homicidal, Hackman makes the character believable, again without the histrionics so often involved with this sort of character.<br /><br />'Superman' is not a perfect film. The 'I Can Fly' segment still induces groans to this day. Itbrings the film to a dead stop. Also, some of the flying sequences, while great for the time they were produced, are a little dated today.<br /><br />'Superman' is the type of film that parents could take their kids to and enjoy with them.groans to this day.

B000002LGQ|5.0|Out of all of Madonna's albums, Like a Prayer is her most explicit attempt at a major artistic statement. Even though it is apparent that she is trying to make a \\"serious\\" album, the kaleidoscopic variety of pop styles on Like a Prayer is quite dazzling. Ranging from the deep funk of \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" to the haunting \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Like a Prayer,\\" Madonna displays a commanding sense of songcraft, making this her best and most consistent album.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey is back and she is my American Idol!!! <br />Way to go Mariah!  Nice comeback sweetie!
B0007GAERG|4.0|Being one of the very few who actually enjoyed both GLITTER and CHARMBRACELET, it was still a little disheartening to see Mariah Carey over-utilizing the little \\"whisper\\" technique that seemed to crop up around the time of the BUTTERFLY cd.  Many theorized that Carey's voice was in fact shot and that she could no longer wield her vocal range with the ease she did on her first several records.  Well, contrary to those theories, Carey's voice is far from shot, a fact she re-affirms on THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI, which shows her in fine voice--though admittedly sounding strained at times--and showcasing her strongest vocal work in at least a decade(1995's DAYDREAM to be exact).  As is typical of her last few records, Carey manages to mix equal parts slow jams with more uptempo dance tracks--the upshot here is that the return of her full voice just adds weight to the tracks.  Among the uptempo tracks, first single \\"It's Like That\\" is strangely not one of the stronger tracks on the album--the minimalist production is highly reminiscent of Kelis'\\"Milkshake\\", only without the savvy hooks.  And speaking of Kelis, her primary collaborators the Neptunes show up for a couple of tracks, the makes-far-more-sense-single choice \\"Say Somethin\\"(very good) and \\"To The Floor\\"(not so much).  Oddly enough, the real draw here are the ballads, in which she's forsaken her trademark adult contemporary sound for a decidedly retro feel(witness album standouts \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Circles\\" and \\"Your Girl\\") that Carey has used sparingly before with great results(the DAYDREAM standout \\"Underneath The Stars\\" springs immediately to mind).  While many will accuse Carey of bandwagon jumping--some of the tracks sound very Keys-like, not to mention Carey being airbrushed to within an inch of her Beyonce-wannabe life on the cover--this is overall her most engaging album since DAYDREAM.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is back giving us what we want... a little bit of EVERYTHING and a whole lot of SINGING.  Mariah has always been a versatile artist, but never has crafted an R&B album with the versatility as 'Mimi' did... My personal faves are \\"Joy Ride,\\" \\"Stay The Night,\\" and \\"Circles.\\"  Support good music before there is none left!
B0007GAERG|4.0|Besides Faith Evans, Mariah Carey has put out one of the best R&B/Pop Albums of the year! Mariah shines on every track and like the majority of the reviews indicate, the voice is back! My favorite songs on this album are: \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", \\"One & Only\\", and \\"Joyride\\".
0312995423|4.0|In typical Dan Brown style, \\"Digital Fortress\\" deals with unusual schemes, underground ideas, insightful twists and repetitive action.  \\"Digital Fortress\\" is the second of Dan Brown's four books in print and is a prime example of the high brown writing style that has become his trademark.  Although the book contains enough facts to spawn numerous History and Discovery Channel documentaries, the book is surprisingly easy to read.  In a \\"Bill Nye the Science Guy\\" fashion, the book is enlightening and still entertaining.   <br />Though the book came before the creation of the now famous Robert Langdon and his daring exploits in \\"Demons & Angels\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" Brown consistently stays with the amazingly brilliant and yet amazingly beautiful main character.  In this case, Brown provides feminists everywhere with a reason to rejoice.  Enter Susan Fletcher a prodigy code-breaker with the stunning good looks that can only be created in fiction.  Fletcher is head cryptologist working for the National Security Agency, a top-secret organization of which only three percent of Americans are aware.   <br />The rising action occurs when something goes terribly wrong at the NSA and Susan is called into fix the problem.  It seems the impossible has happened: an outside force has created an unbreakable code.  The code is so tough that it has stumped TRANSLTR, the government's most powerful computer that was specifically designed for code breaking.   The novel becomes a duel tale when Fletcher's boyfriend, an amazing amateur squash player and professor at the local university, is sent to Spain to retrieve a missing code key.   <br />In Brown tradition, this novel employs conspiracy themed information as pure fact and integrates the tidbits with verifiable facts to create a muck of information overload that makes the fact and the fiction almost impossible to segregate.  Unfortunately, as was the case with other Brown novels, this give the common reader a misinformed perception of some very important issues in pop culture.  The audience should read this novel at their own risk, with an open mind and a critical eye.   <br />Brown keeps the action intense from the first page to the last and incorporates enough twists to shame M. Night Shamalan.  The novel ends in typical Brown style, which is a happy ending insinuating some PG-13 material.  Though \\"Digital Fortress\\" may not be the best book written by Brown, it is still a great starting point for the reader new to the Brown universe and an under hyped bestseller to boot. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have finally sat down to listen to this album and i was literally emancipated.  I think the moral of this album is to state that there will always be changes and restraints. Mariah kicked it up with this album though it wasn't as great as Musicbox.  I was really happy with the outcome and the meaning I got from this album.

Read it because you need something to read in bed before sleep time. Read it because you are at the doctor's office and the wait is gonna be a while. Read it on the plane. Just don't read it if you are looking for anything resembling truth, plausability, or originality. One reader who compared it to a Bruce Willis or a Vin Diesel movie; I couldn't agree more.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Yeah above in my title I mention my theory's name. Ever watched a house fly at work? It keeps bashing on its own head with its legs. And thats pretty much all it does except when its dead. The nerd soul that resides in Napoleon Dynamite is something similar. He has a few chosen interests and his life activities revolve around absolutely nothing. He seems like a new born with his \\"I do not gain anything from what happens around me \\" self.<br /><br />When the movie started , It was difficult to believe such a character. For some reason I wanted him to change and be a little *  * i dont have the word here.<br /><br />Anyhow,overall this movie can be exhaustive for some. There was no scene I found funny and I'm not a serious guy really. It's just kind of sad,especially. It started at around 5AM in the morning.<br /><br />What I liked about the film was the sincere effort in portraying the lives of a nerd and the lack of activity. Pedro's good. I think the dance (solo) was quite interesting. It makes me want to be a dancer. Many reviews back on amazon I'd read this movie is nothing like ever shown. I thought it actually must be something that nooone has ever made.Now that I've seen this film , its just there looking me in the face with its \\"burn into obscurity\\" effect.<br /><br />Too bad , I can't find a valid comment to sum it up.Watch it,if you think beyond numbers and alphabets.
0375422307|5.0|A first glance at this book brings to our eyes the simplicity and stylization of the drawings, but don't misjudge this work: from the first page you perceive something magical that will get you word after word until the end.  <br />Marjane Satrapi is a talented storyteller who knows how to guide the reader through her life as an iranian child, showing not only her fears and hopes, her anger and anguish, but the whole meaning of living a life in a cage. <br />Sometimes humourous, sometimes very intense and touching, Persepolis helps opening our eyes on a world many of us have only heard about from media. <br />Definitely a must-have.
B000060MMI|4.0|Flogging Molly's second album, it is just as good.  Granted, there are a few songs I usually skip over, but when they're good, they're great. <br /> <br />My only complaints about this record are with the songs Rebels of the Sacred Heart, The Rare Ould Times, and The Son Never Shines.    These songs seem to be lacking something. <br /> <br />That said, the rest of the album is well worth the price.  I particularly like Drunken Lullabies, What's Left of the Flag, If I Ever Leave this world Alive, Cruel Mistress, and Another Bag of Bricks.   <br /> <br />I highly reccomd this album to anyone who hates punk music as much as I do.  It bands like this that go and make everything difficult and prevent me from tossing out blanket statement and stereotypes like, \\"punk music blows.\\"  Lousy Irish...   <br /> <br />So yeah, get this album whether or not you like punk music.
B000002L9J|5.0|Best tracks are: \\"I Know It's Over,\\" \\"Cemetry Gates,\\" \\"There is a Light That Never Goes Out,\\" and \\"Some Girls...\\"  All the tracks are interesting.  The Smiths had a knack for creating a pop melody that also poured out existential angst.  This angst was something I could relate to in my early 20's, when \\"The Smiths\\" were big.   As evidenced in Morrisey's recording in 2004, he still carries much of that existential questioning attitude with him in his 40's.  Maybe this questioning attitude should never stop.   A quote I liked from another recent review of \\"The Queen is Dead,\\"  'The chemistry between Morrissey and Marr was at its' zenith during the recording of this album. Their songwriting collaborations were the most poignant of their career; songs like 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out,' 'Bigmouth Strikes Again' and 'The Boy with a Thorn in His Side' are among the most well written songs of the entire decade.'
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I should start by saying that apparently, I am an unusual Iron Maiden fan.  Let me offer some examples: I really like the album Fear of the Dark.  I think the band's first two albums were not very good, at least compared to their work for the next several years (but those early albums showed a lot of promise in hindsight).  I don't think the \\"Progressive\\" or \\"Rejuvenation\\" era of Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son was all that good.  And I think \\"Blaze\\" Bayley Cook (his real name, just to prove to you I'm no wanker, and I know what I'm talking about) was pretty good (granted, not as good as Bruce, but those are gigantic shoes to fill).   <br /> <br />There seem to be mixed feelings on Dance of Death.  I like it. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't have it's low points, but truthfully, can you name any albums that are completely excellent all the way through? <br /> <br />The low points to me are Wildest Dreams, Dance of Death,  and Gates of Tomorrow.  The rest of the album is pretty good by my standards. <br /> <br />I really like Rainmaker.  It's really good instrumentally (Thanks Dave).  I like No More Lies because of its buildup, and I also like the three guitarists' back-to-back solos--you can hear the differences in their styles if you pay attention.  Montsegur is delightfully heavy, and it has an interesting topic.  A lot of Maiden's best work is in songs with unusual subjects.  New Frontier gets credit for being Nicko's first real song.  No matter who wrote it, I think the bass and chorus are pretty catchy.  Paschendale is a good war song.  It also has the buildup style that I'm so partial to, and back and forth dynamics  with the loud-quiet deal going on there.  Face in the Sand is one of my favorites on the album.  It's got real good lyrics and some nice synths in the intro.  Age of Innocence is about crime in the East End of London, or so I hear.  Either way, I like the chorus.  And finally Journeyman, while possibly a bit longer than it needed to be, is an interesting part of the album.  No electric guitars, but good music is good music, regardless of what instrument makes it. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this album is really good.  If you're a pretentious, \\"I only like their old stuff before they got popular, because God forbid I like something someone else also likes\\" don't bother buying this.  Just go waste your money on some crappy underground emo band before they get too popular.  Otherwise, if you're a fan of Iron Maiden ranging anywhere from lukewarm to diehard, I'd say shell out the cash and get Dance of Death.
B000008COG|4.0|I've read some scathing reviews for this album, but I don't get it. I always thought if you meshed Back In Black with Let There Be Rock, you might get the vibe of Blow Up Your Video IMO...loud, heavy, and butt-shakin'. How can any self-respecting AC/DC fan NOT feel like strutting around the house when \\"Meanstreak\\" blares through the speakers? I might earn a negative rating for saying this, but IMO \\"Meanstreak\\" is one of AC/DC's most criminally underrated songs. The band picks up the pace on quite a few tracks (\\"Heatseeker\\", \\"That's The Way I Wanna Rock & Roll\\", \\"Nick Of Time\\", \\"This Means War\\"), which was something that was lacking on their previous album, the decent but somewhat lethargic Fly On The Wall. Strangely, the song from BUYV that DID get most of the attention (\\"Heatseeker\\") arguably has aged less gracefully than the others. In a nutshell, I'll say this about the album: none of my Top 10 AC/DC songs come from Blow Up Your Video, but none of my bottom 10 either...it IS one of the band's more consistent efforts, however, and little filler is to be found IMO. If you dismissed this album years ago, do yourself a favor and give it another listen...
B0007GAERG|3.0|Its needless to say that I'm not the biggest Mariah Carey fan. Something about her personality and post-divorce carrer moves has really turned me away from the diva with the seven octavie pipes. But people can change, and though I never thought I would be saying this, Mariah maybe giving me a reason to get rid of my biased distaste for one of music's most recognizable stars. The Emancipation of Mimi is what a Mariah should be like. Mariah's highly publicized rut began after the release of 1997's Butterfly, an album of Carey's finest gems to date. Everyone knew that the follow-up was never going to be able to be as good, and we were right. 1999's Rainbow was disappointing, and this record was followed by three huge bombs, complete flops that were doomed from the day of release; 2001's Glitter Soundtrack, 2002's Greatest Hits & 2003's atrocious Charmbracelet. But it's 2005 now and Carey has re-established her ground and position in the industry with her most consistent release since 97.<br /><br />It's on MiMi that she finally hits the hip-hop/RnB mix perfectly, something that shes been attempting to do for so long. We suffered through \\"Loverboy\\" & \\"Boy (I Need You)\\" (arguably her weakest moment), but the album's first single \\"It's Like That\\" more than makes up for it. With a catchy hook & an infectious chant by the industry's number one hype man Fatman Scoop it's safe to say she has redeemed herself. She gets it right again on \\"Shake it Off\\" & \\"Get Your Number\\", both produced by former flame & collaborator Jermaine Dupri. Though she hasn't perfected it (thanks largely in part to \\"One and Only\\" featuring Twista), its a definte and promising beginning.<br /><br />Ballad-wise MiMi shows growth also. Instead of her hushed, airy vocals on ballads like \\"Bringin' on the Heartache\\" & \\"Through the Rain\\", she lets her powerhouse pipes shine on \\"We Belong Together\\" & the album's elite vocal display \\"Stay the Night\\". She has proven that while many where questioning it, that her voice is still not only fully intact, but just as good as it ever was. To see a 35 year old industry vet be able to reinvent themselves and really stand firmly planted on the ground after such overwhelming negative energy is both remarkable and admirable.<br /><br />The album is certainly no Butterfly, but it shows that Mariah is indeed headed back into that direction. A great deal of this album is single potential material that may or may not dominate radio airwaves straight through next year. We are going to need the diva to get the press back on her side before that can happen; but lets be optomistic, she made me form a second opinion and thats almost impossible. Heads up to you Mimi.her voice is still not only fully intact, but just as good as it ever was.

B00007G1ZM|5.0|This film, without a doubt, is the penultimate Joan Crawford movie.  This is Crawford at her best, with a sharp, vicious script that only could have been conceived in Film Noir heaven.  The story is told in flashback, with the movie beginning with a murder - - we will shortly know who the victim is but the murderer will only be revealed at the conclusion.  Crawford plays the title character, a thirty-something woman who married her husband Bert at 18, had daughters Veda and Kay and seems to \\"always have been in the kitchen\\".  Unemployed Bert has been seeing Mrs. Biederhof and so Mildred throws him out.  In order to bring money into the household, Mildred gets a job waiting tables, which within several months leads to her starting her own restaurant.  With the help of realtor Wally Fay, played with shifty aplomb by Jack Carson, and former rich boy Monte Baragon, played sleekly by Zachary Scott, who is having a closeout sale on his family's various properties, Mildred becomes the Martha Stewart businesswoman of her day.  However, none of it is good enough to win the approval of her spoiled, selfish daughter Veda.  In an effort to provide Veda with the lifestyle to which she so earnestly desires, Mildred, now divorced from Bert, marries Monte, whom she doesn't love but who has the family name and pedigree to give Veda status.  However, money (and pedigree) does not buy happiness and instead of the happy family portrait, there is a murder.    Crawford won a richly deserved Oscar for her turn here and no matter how many times you watch this film, you are bound to be impressed by her.  Her acting is subtle, superb and her emotions seem genuine and heartfelt.  Angelic looking Ann Blyth as the bitchy daughter Veda makes you think, as Eve Arden's Ida quotes, \\"alligators have the right idea, they eat their young.\\"  Eve Arden gives comic relief with her witty repartee and Michael Curtiz gets the best performances out of each and every member of the cast.    Watch this film andyou will wonder how Crawford was considered Box Office Poison just a few short years earlier and how the Academy overlooked her.  Two thumbs WAY up!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash is a legend.  I don't think there will be many arguments about that.  What's amazing about him and, perhaps, what solidifies his legend, is the fact that his last four albums were probably his greatest work ever.  He left this world on top, which is something few recording artists can say.<br /><br />\\"The Man Comes Around\\" is as haunting as it is beautiful.  It is an album full of love, hate, depression, and perserverance.  It can be scary or it can be uplifting.  It's a masterpiece.<br /><br />I know I'm gloating over this album, but few recordings, even Christian ones, have moved me like this album.  What's even more amazing is that Cash covers songs by unique artists such as Trent Reznor, Don Henley and Glenn Frey, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and Sting.  You wouldn't think a simple \\"Country\\" singer would have the guts to tackle songs by such varied artists, but Cash did, and he made each song his own.  As a matter of fact, he has elevated his status well above those covered on this album.<br /><br />The album starts off with Johnny Cash quoting the book of Revelations.  I don't care if you are a Christian, Athiest, Buddhist, etc., if you have read any part of Revelations, you know that it is one of the scariest things you can read.  It sets the eerie, prophetic tone of the entire album.  The reading blurs into the title track and poses the question, \\"Will you be ready when the man comes around?\\"  From that, we go into the darkest recesses of depression with songs like \\"Hurt,\\" \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\\" and \\"I Hung My Head.\\"  Scattered between are bits like \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Danny Boy,\\" songs that shouldn't be on the same album but work here due to Cash's mastery of his art.<br /><br />Johnny Cash isn't the greatest vocalist around, but his voice speaks volumes and is ten times as good as any cookie-cutter country artist these days.  He's real, and that's as honest as you can get.<br /><br />Buy this album.  Don't ask questions, just buy it.ust buy it.
B00003CXCW|5.0|There are moments in life when, however briefly, everything just seems to come together perfectly and this film is one of those moments.  The genius writing team of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett have penned a story dripping in Hollywood goth, excess and venom.  As most film noirs do, the story is told in flashback, with the William Holden character as narrator.  Holden plays Joe Gillis, a down-on-his-luck writer who is waiting for the next big break while avoiding the repo men.  While attempting to outrun these men, a tire blows out and lands him smack in the middle of Hollywood's forgotten time and its biggest star, Norma Desmond.  Norma lives in a big, gaudy mansion that was fashionable back in the '20s, with her servant, Max (played by real silent film director Erich von Stroheim) and if ever there was a place time forgot, Norma's residence is it!  Joe turns a bit of bad luck (blowout) into quite a scheme for himself (rewriting loony Norma's horrendous screenplay).  However, little does Joe realize that once Norma gets her cat-like claws into him and draws blood, she is not one to let go. <br />Wilder does an incredible job directing his stellar screenplay and gets the performance of a lifetime out of Swanson.  Swanson, with her over-the-top theatrics as Norma, and her little girl type of innocence giving way to delusion and dimentia, stereotypes herself somewhat in the Desmond-esque mold but also assures that no other actress, however great, could do the same justice to the role.  William Holden, as the jaded Joe Gillis, makes you feel sympathy for his down-on-his-luck scripter, even while he is exploiting Norma for his own gain.  It's hard to believe that Holden was not only the second choice for Joe Gillis (behind Montgomery Clift) but also more of a character actor before this film.  Erich von Stroheim, as Norma's servant Max, is a creepy cross between Lurch and Uncle Fester in the Addams Family.  He seems intent on protecting Norma from the harshness ofthe passing of time and also on keeping her mentally locked up in the past.  Nancy Oleson is the sweet Betty Schaefer, who wins Joe's heart, even as Norma has his body. <br />Look for Cecil B. DeMille in a cameo, playing himself, and for silent film actors Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson playing \\"The Waxworks\\" who play cards with Norma.  Also, in cameo, is Hedda Hopper, playing herself and covering the story of Norma Desmond at the conclusion of the film. <br />This is truly one of those films that simply cannot be missed.  It's a cinematic masterpiece and a taste of what old Hollywood (in the 1920s and 1950s) must have been like.  Brilliance, at its very wicked best.
B000001C6M|4.0|Back in 1983, Slayer had melody. That isn't to say that they got worse, per-se, but they definitely had more of a heavy metal feel rather than a strictly trash basis. On \\"Show No Mercy\\", Slayer perform perhaps their most complex songs, albeit their immaturity, chiefly attributed to Tom's voice at this time. The memorable tracks/riffs are everywhere, from the chorus of \\"Evil Has no Boundaries\\", the riffs in \\"Black Magic\\", the entire melody in \\"Metal Storm/Face the Slayer\\" and of course, the Maiden-ish \\"Cronics\\".  <br /> <br />A negative aspect of this record is its length. Just barely hitting 30 minutes, \\"Show No Mercy\\" may not appear to be much, but it's longer and more full than their acclaimed \\"Reign in Blood\\". In my opinion, this is the 3rd best Slayer record, after \\"Haunting the Chapel\\" and \\"Hell Awaits\\", but certainly tops almost all others in the aggressiveness of the production. Highly recommended for all thrash fans, \\"Show No Mercy\\" easily destroys Metallica's debut, the frequently cited \\"Kill 'Em All\\".
0553103547|2.0|- First of all, make no mistake, this is NO fantasy, but a rather a grim and depressing pseudo-historical novel in slightly unusual decorations. Rare attempts to make it different from the real dark ages look awkward more often than not. There seem to be no message, except that the world is a cruel place and it will only get worse;<br /><br />- It's hard to sympathize with the characters, since most of them are either children or teenagers with unstable psyche, plus the author enjoys killing those few that are likely to be considered positive figures (and he does it in a way to tease the reader the most);<br /><br />- Sex and violence descriptions are abundant and gratuitous, and often feel totally unnecessary
B000001Y5J|3.0|While 1992's \\"Broken\\" is easily the most aggressive NIN album to date (that being early-mid 2005), it lacks the presence and structure that really carry the full lengths, namely \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\". However, this is not to say that \\"Broken\\" is a poor album, but in comparison to its predecessor (the synth-pop-rock opus \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and its successor (\\"The Downward Spiral\\"), \\"Broken\\" seems to fall on its face a bit. <br /> <br />Pinion opens the album with a decent buildup, consisting of about 40 second of one guitar riff getting louder. Not bad, keep in mind though, of the 8 tracks on this EP, this is one of them. Wish is much better, with Reznor's advanced lyrics shining through, easily surpassing those of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" (who else cringes every time he daintily sings \\"rain rain, go away\\" on Down in It?). Some decent guitar work here, nice to see that Reznor notices that the addition of a guitar makes an album somewhat more aggressive ;-). Last is a much stronger piece, commanding the listener's attention with a powerful lead in riff,  followed by other powerful guitar parts, namely the post-chorus single string blitz. <br /> <br />Here, things go downhill for a bit. There is Help Me I am In Hell, which is basically another throw away track (not bad, but not really enjoyable) and Happiness in Slavery, the ultimate gothic-industrial anthem. Ugly and commanding, this track doesn't really do it for me, especially with the power of Last and Wish still ringing in my ears. Luckily, the album picks up with its best track, the enormous Gave Up. Depressing lyrics abound, the track is carried by an incredible chorus riff after some electronic drums steady the verse into it. A real headbanger and also a sing-along, Gave Up takes the cake. <br /> <br />After about 92 tracks of silence, Physical and Suck come in, one being a cover, and nothing special or memorable at all. Suck is a bit better, but more stuck in the \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" era, and not really fitting well on the album, albeit it is a good track. <br /> <br />\\"Broken\\" is a good album, but if you're new to NIN, do yourself a favour and check out \\"The Downward Spiral\\" first. If tracks like  March of the Pigs, Heresy and Big Man with a Gun appeal to you, this just might be your calling.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Finally, a new album by an artist who can actually sing (and writes their own material too). I love this cd. It's definitely my favorite Mariah album since Butterfly. Here's my take on each track: <br />It's Like That: ***  stars <br />Hard to review this now, having played it out...but it was definitely <br />the right choice as the lead off single. <br /> <br />We Belong Together: **** <br />This, in my opinion, is one of Mariah's best songs in a long time. The <br />beat, the melody, the lyrics, and her voice are all right on point. <br />Her emotion is believable and the song is easy to relate to. I really <br />think this will be a top 10 single. <br /> <br />Shake it Off: **** <br />My favorite track on the album so far. Some people have said that <br />Mariah is \\"trying to be current\\" on this track...but I have to disagree. <br />From the second the beat drops and mariah's silky voice coos <br />effortlessly with the opening \\"ooo's\\", it's clear that <br />she is owning this track with a confidence that does not come from <br />\\"trying\\" to be anything...this is Mariah creating music that is true to <br />who she is as a person and an artist. Not only do I love the beat and <br />her voice, but I love the attitude and the flow of the track. THIS IS <br />MY JAM, YALL!!! <br /> <br />Mine Again: ***  <br />First of all let me say that I think James Poyser did a great job with <br />the production on this track. Like Mariah has said in interviews, it <br />is not overproduced and really lets her voice shine through. It has an <br />old school vibe that works well in complimenting Mariah's delivery. My <br />only criticism of this song is that while her voice sounds miles <br />better than anything on Charmbracelet, I feel like she's trying just a <br />little too hard. She is belting so loud and so high for so much of the <br />song, that it's hard for me to listen to. I've been skipping over it <br />lately... <br /> <br />Say Something: **  <br />Ok...beforeI write anything, I'm going to listen to it one more time. <br />:listening: Alright, I'll admit that this is a groovy laid back jam <br />that is something different for Mariah. I always have to applaud when <br />she stretches herself musically. This, however, is not a stretch that <br />I think would do well if released to radio. I don't like the <br />background elevator music, and I think Mariah's vocals and the hook <br />are boooring. Luckily, Snoop comes around near the end to liven things <br />up a little bit. <br /> <br />Stay the Night: ***  <br />I think the hype surrounding this song after the leak kind of altered <br />my first reaction, but if I were too ignore my initial disappointment, <br />this song is still pretty good. It's just not nearly as good as <br />everyone was making it out to be. Her vocals at the end of the song <br />are definitely not reminiscent of the Daydream era...where everything <br />sounded very effortless. I think the song would have been much better <br />in a lower key, and then maybe Mariah's belts would have sounded less <br />like screaming. Nonetheless, it has a great summery feel and it is <br />VERY well produced. <br /> <br />Get Your Number: ***  <br />Mariah and JD really worked it out on MIMI...every song they did is hot, <br />fresh, and completely infectious. I definitely understand why LA <br />wanted her to go back into the studio with him after hearing SIO and <br />this song. Mariah's vocals on GYN are perfect, including her spoken <br />parts leading into the chorus. I'm not the biggest fan of JD as a <br />rapper, but this track is fun and his voice isn't too irritating. <br /> <br />One and Only: **** <br />Another one of my favorite songs off this album. I definitely feel <br />like this is one of the best songs lyrically, as Mariah is honest and <br />tells it like it is. She really gets me when she sings, \\"It's been <br />such a sad and winding road for me\\"...I feel her. Anyway, Twista's rap <br/>really flows well with the song. Some of Mariah's rap collabos have <br />sounded a little unnatural in the past, but OAO, in my opinion, ranks <br />right up there with Breakdown as far as MC achieving a true hip hop <br />sound. (4 stars) <br /> <br />Circles: **** <br />I can't say that this is the best ballad on the album because WBT and <br />Joyride are so amazing...but it is pretty close. Once I get past the <br />opening seconds which sound like something my Hispanic neighbors would <br />blast in the middle of the night, CIRCLES just gets better and better. <br />Her vocals are so strong but not forced and the background vocals are <br />awesome as well. Not much else to say accept that it's a GREAT song <br />which makes me believe that this really is \\"The Return of the Voice\\" <br /> <br />Your Girl: ** <br />The most disappointing track on the album. This song has a lot of <br />potential, but just doesn't work. It's very catchy and cute and I <br />agree that it has a Jackson 5 feel, but it's missing something....like <br />um...verses maybe? The \\"I aint' wasting no more\\" part should be the <br />pre-chorus and should follow an actual verse. Worst of all, Mariah <br />really forces the vocals on this track. The \\"I used to be afraid\\" line <br />is so shrill and awful to listen to....I really wanted to love this <br />track, but I can barely listen to it all the way through without <br />cringing. I think N.O.R.E's rap might have helped a bit, but I'm not <br />sure...(2 stars) <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew: ***  <br />The fake audience is a little cheesy, but I think it works with this <br />song. This is just a great ballad complete with live instrumentation <br />and intricate backing vocals. Mariah really breaks it down at the end, <br />and I find myself cheering along with all of the fake people. <br /> <br />To the Floor: *** <br />Ok, so everybody hates this track...but is it really so bad? The drums <br />are hot and the production is great. It's definitely not Mariah at her <br />best, but I think a lot of people will dig it. <br /> <br />Joy Ride: **** <br />There is something magical about this song...I just love it! While there <br />are similarities, I wouldn't lump this in with UTS, FOJ, or YOURS... I <br />think it is unique and just perfect from all aspects. The key change <br />in the bridge is genius and ends so beautifully when she sings <br />\\"replace you in my eyes\\"....She brings it home at the end...I think this <br />track really illustrates Mariah's evolution as a songwriter from great <br />to amazing. <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird: **** <br />This song wasn't immediate for me, but I love it now. I love the <br />message in the lyrics, and I love the backing vocals at the end. <br />There's nobody else that can sing \\"Higher Jesus\\" like Mariah <br />does...great, great, song and an awesome way to end an awesome album
B0007GAERG|5.0|Yeah...everyone's all geared up for her latest album..and in the end u'll either find people hating it or loving it.It's as if u have to either be a mariah carey fan or not one. <br /> <br />There's no way a reviewer with half a brain could possibly give her 1 star for this album. Sadly, there were a few dopes who did. If anything it should be given at least 3 stars, she definitely makes a comeback in this album. I'm not just saying it just cause i'm a mariah carey fan but i'm basing it on the production and her vocal talents alone. <br /> <br />Obviously you can't expect every song on the album to be your favorite, but i can honestly say that every track is at the very least good....a few of them are definitely addictive. Her voice soars in this album like you won't believe... <br /> <br />Try listening to \\"Mine Again\\",\\"Stay The Night\\",\\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"Your Girl\\", and you'll breathe a sigh of relief..finally convinced that Mariah Carey IS indeed the voice. <br /> <br />
B000255LIY|3.0|The story unfolds a few years before the Third Crusade a.k.a. the Kings' Crusade (1189-1192).  It is 1183; France is split between the kings of England and France respectively.  While the English crown is in the hands of Henry II, he grows old and his three surviving sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John) grow restless and eager for the throne. Things get a bit more complicated when their mother Eleanor of Aquitaine also gets involved in the schemes of succession.  <br />On the positive side: a) it is a good plot and the acting is above average, b) the setting and costumes are excellent, and c) there is a wonderful feel of History; the clash between the English and the French is fascinating and very well presented throughout the film, as is the clash within the royal family. <br />On the negative side: a) one could say it is way too \\"theatrical,\\" even for a film that it is based on a play, b) it does get to be very slow at times, c) everyone within the family seems to be overly self-centered and selfish; there are no \\"good guys,\\" none whatsoever... <br />In short, though not a masterpiece, The Lion in Winter is a movie worth watching! <br />History, Intrigue, and Drama are all about.   <br />Strongly recommended to those who love History and Western European History in particular. 3 Stars <br />
0345475674|3.0|If you're looking for a quick read while traveling, then this would be a good selection.  I took a third year Greek and Roman Studies course on the archaeology of Pompeii and Herculaneum and can say that Harris did his research.  He uses all the famous names, buildings and graffiti that archaeologists have recovered even down to the lonely gladiator that was found amongst other bodies in the building next to the amphitheatre.  Harris even provides accurate detail of Herculaneum which was also buried by Vesuvius half of which has been recovered by archaeologists while the other half remains buried underneath the new town.      I appreciated the amount of detail and research that went into this book, but I did not care for the story or the characters themselves.  The story surrounding the characters was as predictable as Vesuvius blowing its top and the characters were one dimensional.  Harris even goes so far as to rip-off the banquet scene in Petronius' Satyricon where he satirizes Trimalchio's feast which, as another reviewer pointed out, is lazy writing.  However, if you do have even the slightest interest in this area and time period, in archaeology or volcanology give it a read, because the work is in the details.
0385512058|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone at any age. I told my teen aged sons that they should read the book. It offers practical tips as well. - Paul Bai (Georgia)
B00005ASHM|5.0|There's a reason this is often called one of the best albums ever - it really IS one of the best albums ever.<br /><br />It's virtually flawless. The music, lyrics, and fantastic harmonious vocals make this an incredible listening experience.<br /><br />Mostly everyone knows the big hits on here like \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows.\\" I held off on getting \\"Pet Sounds\\" for years because I already had those and a few of the other songs on other Beach Boys' compilations. BIG mistake on my part!<br /><br />One of the great things about \\"Pet Sounds\\" is hearing it in it's entirety. The songs flow together perfectly. Also, there are some great songs on here like \\"That's Not Me\\" and \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" that weren't popular radio tunes and don't turn up on the countless Beach Boys \\"best of\\" compilations that are out there. The songs are totally worth hearing and there's no better place to get them than right here!<br /><br />Believe all the hype you've heard - \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a fantastic album. If you love great music (and who doesn't?) then you'll love this album.
B00005LAIB|5.0|The same guy that gave this album 1 star and called it horrible also gave Godsmack a 5 star rating! That is hilarious...enjoy your Godsmack moshermaniac...If that makes you happy, then enjoy, but it's too bad, because you're missing out...I don't believe that Tool takes an &quot;open-mind&quot; or special brain power of any sort...it is harder listening, for sure, and if you can understand what they're doing technically, well I guess it helps in some ways and hurts in others...a lot of times music is more mesmerizing when you're blissfully unaware of what the musicians are doing technicaly...it adds so magic... and sometimes knowing what they're doing can let you into the fantastic world of creative and artistic music and that's satisfying in itself...Lateralus is much more complicated than most music, but in the end it all comes down to taste...if you don't like it you don't like it, but this is LIGHT YEARS ahead of a group like Godsmack in every respect...that's not really an opinion, that's definately a fact<br />I just think there is so much to get from this album...it really is an experience and you can take a lot from it and use it to do some good...I don't think it's dark at all, but that's just me
0312932081|5.0|I have read this book about 3 times, and each time I noticed or thought about something I hadn't before.  This book is not just a good book, it leads to a great series of other books, including the Shadow series about Bean that follow Ender's series.  Orson Scott Card is an incredible writer - some of the things that came out in the third and even fourth novels were STARTED in the first... ingenius!  Even if you don't really like reading, you will like this book... it is written in plain speech, and the story is amazing.  The movie is coming out soon (next year?) so read the book FIRST!!!!!
B00006SFLV|5.0|Almost everyone who has bought this or who wants to buy this has a problem with the price, including me. But I know that it feels so great after you have a collection like this in your hands, this is one of the best shows ever created. <br /> <br />It has high school problems, peer pressure, stress, and anything else you can imagine. This is the show you can turn to when YOU are going through a hard time, even for adults out of high school. The incredible experiences on the show are beautiful and fun to watch, it's absolutely amazing. The show includes characters that are one of a kind, characters that you'll never forget. This show can get you through just about anything and some episodes are surprisingly emotional! <br /> <br />The show is about a girl in high school, Angela Chase. She has always been a good girl but now she's ready to change. She dyes her hair Crimson Glow and starts her fun and exciting, incredible and sad, journey through high school. I admire this show, and anyone in high school can love it too. Anyone who is past high school, this show can take you back. From the first episode right to the powerful last scene ever created in My So-Called Life, this show takes you to a wonderful and exciting world of Angela Chase.
B0000029GA|5.0|Argued to be one of the best albums in hip hop Nas' Illmatic sets the standard for other rappers.  Amazingly enough this record was his debut album.  It seems almost unfair to categorize this album as rap, by doing so many people are instantly put away.  However, Illmatic is for any fan of music who can appreciate true lyrical wizardry.  Nas' style of polysyllabic rhyme schemes is a true art form, combining a number of smaller words to achieve a distinct smooth flow.  Coining a style all his own the lyrics of Illmatic are clearly ahead of their time and still stand up strong against the attempts of rappers today.  While equally impressive the beats are slightly rough, seeming almost intentional as not to draw away from the lyrics.  While maybe not the greatest album released Illmatic is a classic.  An album that helped pave the way for modern hip hop.  Any true fan of Nas, Hip-Hop, or even music in general should definitely have this album as a part of their collection.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Im from Sweden so I have had this cd for a week now, and let me tell you. It only gets better and better, it grows. It has a great mix of songs for everyone to enjoy. Stay the night, we belong together and fly like a bird are amazing and so are the rest of the songs. I just love it and I play it at least once a day. Im really happy that she is using her voice like it is meant to be used.  <br />Mariah is the best singers of all time and this cd proves it. <br />I would give it ten stars if I could. <br />WOW. Radio, Mtv and Ztv are playing her all the time up here. <br />Well done Mariah!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Although there are a lot of people who thinks that popstars are nothing but a pretty face, Christina Aguilera is not the case.  In this album one can definitely see her as who she really is.  Whatever sckeptism you may have of Christina, she will prove you wrong once you hear her powerful and beautiful voice.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Wow, after reading the reviews, I didn't realize that the anime community was full of such shallow whiners who are focused more on style than substance. Yeah, yeah, the translation to DVD is rather poor. Still, its easy enough to adapt to the subtitles. But, I think this largely comes from a generation that dislikes reading in general and gets easily distracted...  <br />Innocence is a smart movie where every scene, every image reflects a depth waiting for further exploration. Did any of you catch the name of that one character, Haraway? Hey, illiterate punks, look that name up and you'll find an inside joke. Sociology, philosophy, cyberpunk, and the future of ethics--its got it all...The movie is full of wonderful references that only increase the enjoyment of its viewing.   <br />For those that described this movie as shallow and full of references to literature and academic works, go back to your shallow comic books.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I've never heard anything like them! They're so good! If you're considering buying this album, don't think twice! <br /> <br />My favorites are: <br />You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison <br />Give 'Em Hell Kid <br />To The End <br />Helena <br />Thankyou For the Venom <br />Cemetery Drive <br />I Never Told You What I Do for a Living <br /> <br />Actually they're all amazing!

B00005RYKU|5.0|This is a great movie to watch any time. It gets you into it and keeps your attention1
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is the only album that could actually rival the quality and production of her debut. In my opinion, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" really surpasses all of her others. Like I said, the only real competition is from her debut. You can hear all of the time and effort that Mariah really put into this one. Vocally, this is one of her best. She absolutely outdoes herself on this one. This collection is more mature and more polished. It's really quite spectacular. This CD should be up for Album of the Year at the Grammys. Very few people could have \\"comeback\\" and delivered on this level. Mariah is truly one of kind, one in a million. Don't miss this album. People will be talking about this one. If you weren't impressed before, it's hard to imagine that you won't be this time.
0345363132|5.0|I found this book in a thrift store, and made a very wise decision to judge a book by its cover.  <br /> <br />It was one of the best purchases I've ever made. All I can say is that it's one of the few books that made me weep. God bless and keep you, King Richard!
B000068TPN|5.0|I have read Col. Moore's book, \\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\".  The movie, \\"We Were Soldiers\\", is so true to the story it is heart wrenching. Mel Gibson and  Randall Wallace  have made a movie that vividly reminds us of  the courage and bravery of the men who fought in that terrible battle in November 1965 in Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam. The actors are among the best in Hollywood and do a magnificent job. The music by Nick Glennie-Smith is  beautiful, and the words written by Randall Wallace for the end song, The Mansions Of The Lord, are truly a moving tribute to fallen soldiers. This was so beautifully sung by United States Military Academy Glee Club as the processional during President Reagan's funeral.   Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace are great Americans.
B00006879E|5.0|Okay, I don't normally write reviews but I love this album. And so does my husband, and we don't usually agree on music. He got this album from our local Top 40 station for free when 'This Love' was huge. I loved the song and it put me in a mood that he likes so he got me the album. We did not know that we would end up loving it so much. <br /> <br />At first I didn't care for every song but now I love them all. They all tell a story. And the story is told in the order of the songs on the CD. My husband thinks that Jane is either married or in a very commited relationship and that Adam had a very hard time with that and that they carried on an affair. Jane is very real and Adam doesn't like to talk about her. The album is like therapy to him. The relationship is a very angry but very sexual relationship, that's way every song is about sex. It makes sense if you listen to the album as telling the story. <br /> <br />My two personal favorites are We Must Get Out and The Sweetest Goodbye. My husband will play Sunday Morning all day, every day if I let him. <br /> <br />No, they are not your typical rock band, yes, they are unique and I love them.

B00005JNRB|5.0|Action-packed adventure from beginning to end  ... includes the swash-buckling modern super hero, Dirk Pitt, played by Matthew McConnaughy, his side kick, partner and friend from childhood, Al Giordino, and the intelligent and alluring, Dr. Eva Rojas, played by Penelope Cruz. They meet in Lagos, Nigeria and travel together to the Saharan desert country of Mali to solve a couple of mysteries: the disappearance of an iron ship from the Civil War and a mysterious plague which is killing many African citizens.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt had received a gold coin from an African antique collector which dates back to the Civil War leading him to negotiate to use a power boat for exactly 72 hours. It is owned by his boss who is head of an underwater search team,, NUMA, that looks for \\"lost treasure\\". He is alloted exactly 72 hours to use the boat. His goal is to discover the origin of the gold coin. Instead he finds himself in the midst of a major civil conflict in Mali ... where a local warlord Kazim, is allowing waste to be dumped into the Niger River which has underground tributaries. The contaminated river water seeps underground ... becomes available as drinking water in wells. One must view the film to discover how Dr. Eva Rojas and Dirk Pitt become partners in solving two separate mysteries ... and how they become romantic partners as well.<br /><br />This film captured my imagination from the start ... first, by showing a Civil War scene where the Iron ship is docked and makes its escape into the Atlantic Ocean in April 1865 ... never to be seen, heard from or discovered. And second, by the opening scenes where a camera scans the office of Dirk Pitt ... showing photos, newspaper clippings, and model ships from the past. This introduction was only the foretaste of the great cinematography which was so evident throughtout this film. The film lasted 2 and 1/2 hours and I loved every minute of it! The Sahara scenes of Dirk Pitt and Eva Rojas riding on camel's backs ... with the sun setting behind them ... the camels undulating as they walked on sand dunes ... superb creative photography. The scene where Dirk, Al, and Eva reach a mountain pass ... stop their jeep ... drop all their weapons one by one ... raise their hands ... in anticipation of being captured by desert tribes is very powerful and effective, again, among the best scenes in the film. When they arrive at the mountain village, where the homes are carved on the side of the mountain, like old style condominiums, unbelievably beautiful. The monumental discovery by Al in the cave ... The adventure/escape fighting scenes on the Niger River, as Kazim's soldiers try to stop Dirk and his pals ... hair raising, seat of the edge tense moments, took my breath away. Most appealing is the train-ride in the desert to get to Yves Mossard's waste factory in the desert ... the cinematography was over-whelmingly superb. Building a wind-driven dune buggy out of a downed airplane (hahaha, loved it!). There are other great scenes throughout the film but to describe them would ruin the plot ...<br /><br />This is the first Clive Cussler novel I have viewed with the action-hero Dirk Pitt on film. Matthew McConnaughy lives and breathes the part, his personality fits perfectly into the character. Penelope Cruz was another perfect cast for the role of Dr. Eva Rojas. My prediction is: this may be the first in a series of multi-million dollar making films, similar to the Indian Jones series. Make another film from a Clive Cussler book: I promise! I will be there! This is among the best (likley THE BEST) action/adventure/mystery film I have seen in recent memory (past 5 years).

B000005JAK|5.0|Candy Apple Grey has always been a strange album in the Husker catalog because of several reasons.1-It has 3 ballads in it;2-It only has 10 songs and 3-it's the only of all their albums in which Grant Hart's songs are actually better than the ones composed by Bob Mould.<br /><br />Granted the Mould made the poignant\\"Hardly Getting over it\\"and the rocking\\"Eiffel Tower High\\"but the brightest moments of the record come with Hart's\\"Don't Want to Know...\\"(his best song ever),his straight edge rocker\\"Dead Set on Destruction\\"and the pretty piano ballad\\"No Promise have I made\\" .<br /><br />Not the most consistent of their albums but one that makes for a highly rewarding and intriguing listening experience.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I love this CD.  Finally, classic Mariah with a flair, smooth old school sound. My favorite is Mine Again.   Her voice is much better than it has been in her last several releases.  Welcome back!
B000002AS3|5.0|In their debut Oasis created an awesome rock n'rollin'album that shouldn't be looked down upon just because of their recent miserable album record or because of the motormouth brothers that lead the band.<br /><br />Tunes like \\"Supersonic\\",\\"Live Forever\\",\\"Married with Children\\"or \\"Digsy's Diner\\" are among last decade's best and although Oasis fire seemed to only have lastewd for a couple of albums it sure was fun while it burned.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I am 12 years old and his is the best movie I have ever seen!!! It ROCKS!!!!! I am gonna be in the store buying it as soon as it comes out. It is a must see!!! It is also appropiate for kids, I think it was overated, it is no PG-13 movie! It is depressing, sad and luvvy-duvvey in some parts but it was SWEET anyway. Ages 10+ must see it, it will be one thing you will NOT regret!!! Hats off to Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber!!! All the actors are great singers, great actors, and seem like they were born to play these parts. I get excited just thinking about it, it's that great!!! <br />                      Thanks, Davis
B000003TA4|5.0|Even though I consider myself more of a fan of similar bands that didn't achieve half of Nirvana's fame(Husker Du,Replacements,Pixies,Faith No More)it's impossible to deny the immense power Nirvana managed to marshal for their sophomore effort culminating in an album that not only hasn't got any filler in it but in which every song climbs to scintillating heights.<br /><br />Nirvana's Nevermind is then a culmination and a refining of 10 years of simmering underground as it's better produced than anything by Husker Du(thanks to Butch Vig's typical big sound),less sloppy than the Replacements,more structured than the Pixies and more genre respecting than Faith No More.And all this in a good way making for a remarkably punchy record and one of the 90's very best.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Well I am not a big Mariah Carey fan but I most say that these Mimi girl its pretty good LOL! seriously her new CD The Emancipation of Mimi  its Excellent  and probably one of her best work ever skip forward the Staying Young and Urban I look as good as any Music Video Chick radio pleaser silly but yet fun \\"Its like that\\" the 1st song and release on the CD and Mariah will Blows you away and keep you on your feet's at the same time, the perfect combination of R&B, Hip Hop, Getho Fab , Beauty, Glamour and all out Talent  \\"We belong together\\" the second song and \\"most\\" second release its a warm up of the truthfulness of the content of the CD it just gets better and better as the CD plays along Mariah like the Trojan horse has us all fool whit \\"Mimi\\" she may look like a Sex Symbol but she has more talent than any musician ever, her voice its better stronger and crystal clear and her writing skills are poetic and real (she co-wrote and co-pruduce all the songs) <br />I am now a new fan.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm so glad Mariah is back with her new album The Emancipation Of Mimi. It's off the hook I love it. To all the haters and their negative reviews why dont you go hate on j-lo's cd!
B000024ZLX|2.0|While there are a few scattered good songs on this album, it has too little involvement by other members of the band. While I agree that Roger Waters was clearly the stronger lyricist (vs Gilmour), the band performs the best when all members are involved in the writing. In addition, I think the musical quality is better when Gilmour writes solo as opposed to Waters. Waters never got over the death of his father in WWII, and this album simply describes his feelings and the war itself. He puts emotion into it, but the writing quality itself is weak. He focuses too much on himself and not the band.
B00003CX5A|5.0|The only beef I had with this movie is that Christopher Walken had such a brief part, that and we didn't get the opportunity to hear him speak. Other than that short complaint, the movie was superb. After watching Tim Burton's the nightmare before christmas and Monkey bones, I had expected a rather lighthearted jaunt through the dark and musty woods of Tim Burton's imagination. What I recieved was a thrill ride down a very spooky trail of terror, Not to mention humor. Johnny Depp made a very good wuss. Hah.<br /><br />I'm not picking on him, he's cool its just he wasn't quite what I expected. Someone more along the lines of Jack Sparrow I suppose. Come to think of it, I guess he really was like Jack Sparrow......<br /><br />Anyhow, back to the film at hand. The movie starts off with a bang, ending with just as much energy and gore that threaded its way throughout the movie. Not for the weak stomached as Johnny Depp made quite clear as the movie advanced. It grew rather difficult to pick out where the diabolical left off and the realism began, Tim Burton made them so much of the same that one would almost believe we truly live in a world infested with enraged Hessian's and bleeding trees. That was nice touch. Hmmm.
B000002A3T|5.0|I don't understand why this album has been panned so much by critics.  I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, appreciating their music from Piper at the Gates of Dawn up to The Division Bell. I also happened to enjoy Momentary Lapse of Reason, although I may be in a minority there. The Division Bell doesn't suffer from Roger Waters's absense; in fact, I think it is strengthened by it. Towards the end of his career with the band, he became too controlling (The Final Cut consisted entirely of songs written by him, and not very good ones at that). I think the band sounds the best when all members write, but in terms of solo writing, I personally think Gilmour sounds the best musically (although Waters was the better lyricist).  This album sounds more like older Floyd, with an ethereal, mildly psychedelic quality to it. To some degree it builds on the strengths of Momentary Lapse (flowing, ethereal sounds) without its weaknesses (too little involvement by Nick Mason and Richard Wright). Just because it is not as hard rocking as the Wall or as psychedelic as Piper at the Gates or Atom Heart Mother does not justify the criticism against it. Anyone who appreciates Floyd should enjoy this album.
B0002234LS|5.0|This was the first film that I had ever watched of Steven King, and was not quite prepared for the twisted macabre mind of his. Johnny Depp was really good as the demented writer who was still yearning over the loss of his wife, and reliazed to late that it was he in fact who was commiting the atrocious crimes to compensate for her leaving. This is a movie that makes you believe one thing, and then turns right around midstream and throws the right answer at you. Its gripping, frightful and full of insanity. The perfect movie for a dark and stormy night.
B0007GADZO|2.0|Man I love Steve Vai, and I know he's one of if not the best technically greatest guitar players ever. He also knows more about music theory than I will ever in my lifetime.  But there comes a point when the knowledge hinders usefulness.  Yes, he is playing like a spider on crack, yes, he's using unique scales and patterns, but it all sounds so useless!  I'd rather hear him sweep for 30 minutes and sit there and marvel than here a bunch of guitar synth noise backed by other tracks that make the whole thing chaotic.  Steve Vai did a lot of the guitar work for the movie Crossroads.  That's the type of music I wanna hear from him.  Music that's catchy and at the same time, intuitive, creative and ridiculously hard to put your finger on.  He needs to go back to the basics, he's too out there for me right now.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|...and I hate that I love everything about this movie that hurts. Dan (Jude Law) who is an obituary and untalented writer, meets Alice Ayers (Natalie Portman), an american stripper, when she gets hit by a car looking the wrong way while crossing the street. Love at first sight? So they thought. Then Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts)who photographs him for a book he wrote about Alice. He obsesses about Anna while still believing he loves Alice. Then comes Larry (Clive Owen) who meets Anna in the most comical way unbeknownst to, and all because of Dan... <br /> This movie is not about unrealistic happy love wrapped in romantic idealism. This movie is about deceit, lies, lust, inconsideration, uncontrollable urge to satisfy without consequence, and absent of love.  <br />Clive Owen and Natalie Portman  were spectacular in their roles. Even though you know deep down they do not deserve your sympathy, you want to give it anyway, because they make you re-live what it is like to have someone rip your heart out. Jude Law and Julia Roberts were effective as well, and you either dislike their characters for who they are, or feel a little tinge of guilt because you can relate even if you do not want to admit it.  <br />The reason why someone might not like this movie is because of its honest potrayal of untrustworthy characters who uses love as a reason for their betrayal without redeeming purpose. This movie is not about love. And perhaps, the purpose of this movie is to open your eyes and see what is possible in the absence of real love; not the kind that comes and fades when someone else strikes your fancy.  <br />Mike Nichols directed this film in a clever and insightful way, getting to know the characters well without any dragging scenes. There was grit from the opening  scene to the last. The dialogues; harsh, unbashful, sometimes cruel, very witty, dirty, disturbing,... real.  <br />If you are the kind of person who want to watch an optimistic love story and do not believethat there are people like Anna, Daniel, Larry and Alice walking around in the world, then look closer.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This cd is ab fab compared to charmbraclet.  I love it the voice is finally back with something real.  I love the flow of it and lyrics and kanyes song on the cd.  Get it U wont regret It ....xxoo MS MIMI
B00005JT6F|5.0|Three sons of American servicemen based in Britain formed this group in 1969 (reduced to a duo in 1977) so perhaps that explains the rather grand group name that they chose. Given all the great music that is recorded in the United States, any group that choose the name America has a lot to live up to.<br /><br />In the event, America did well in America, with two number one hits (A horse with no name, Sister golden hair) and several top ten hits including I need you, Ventura highway, Tin man, Lonely people and You can do magic - this last song was their only significant success after Dan Peek left in 1977. America were less successful in Britain, where they had only three hits, two of which were minor although they made the top three with A horse with no name. Their other notable songs include Muskrat love (also recorded by Captain and Tennille) and Sandman.<br /><br />Overall, America's style of soft-rock harmony music owed a lot to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young although they were more successful on the singles chart than that illustrious group (with or without Neil Young).<br /><br />For most people, this is the definitive collection of their music, containing all the tracks that they are famous for and some other great songs that might encourage some to explore their music in greater depth. If you only ever buy one collection of America's music, this is a good one to choose.
B0007OCG56|1.0|In a nutshell, this is a movie that aspires to something special, but ultimately falls flat in its attempt. I hesitate giving it just 1 star, seeing as it had some potential, but overall the film was a failure for too many reasons to list here. <br /> <br />First of the culprits is the running length: 131 minutes is bearable, even preferred, for a large scale war movie, a sweeping historic epic, or even a grand ole western, but for a quaint little semi-comedy/drama, this bulk is too cumbersome and excruciating.  <br /> <br />The awkward script only adds to the excessive length. It gets particularly painful during some of the clunky bedroom conversations between Sandler and his over-the-top (and annoying) wife, portrayed by Leoni. One can't help but wonder if the editing team took some time off right before the film's release, and neglected to finish the clean up job. At times I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering when the plot was going to progress, listening to the characters utter more dialogue that was completely useless and seemingly thrown in... arghhh. <br /> <br />As alluded to before, there's also an excess share of melodrama. I think this is due more to the lack of editing than to a slipshod job by the actors. Do we really need ANOTHER drawn-out scene with Flor over-reacting to favors towards her daughter? Or Deb reacting to her husband? Or Deb's Mom to Deb? You get the point, and it continues ad nauseum. Again... arghhh. <br /> <br />To top it off, you have an ending that is without resolution for half of the characters (the Clasky family), and a bizarre conclusion for the main character. Let me get this right: Flor pulls her daughter out of an elite, private school (depriving her of an excellent education) because she doesn't want her to end up becoming something culturally different from herself, yet the entire movie is a narrative by this same daughter trying to get into the elite, private Princeton a few years down the road. I guess we can only visualize Flor behind the scenes, dissuading her daughter from doing that as well, seeing as her daughter never quite lost that desire to leave the almost sequestered, provincial life of her mother to engage once again in worldly learning amongst the upper class. <br /> <br />In the end I regret having seen this movie, and can't really recommend it to anyone. One might be quick to say that I couldn't relate to it's \\"unique\\" plot. But then again, my wife didn't like it either, yet she's Hispanic and the daughter of a Mexican immigrant.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000JSPE|5.0|By the time this group started on their successful career, I had given up on music radio, but there is some music that you can't avoid hearing, even if you want to. So it was that I eventually realized that Take That made some great music. They never made it in America, though they might have done had they stayed together a bit longer. Gary Barlow was the lead singer and primary songwriter but his subsequent solo career has been much less successful - unlike Robbie Williams, one of the other group members, who has become a hugely popular solo singer.<br /><br />Take That had eight British number one hits including Back for good, which gave them an American top ten hit a few months before they disbanded. Their other UK number ones were Pray, Relight my fire (a cover of a Dan Hartman song featuring Lulu as guest vocalist), Babe, Everything changes, Sure, Never forget and How deep is your love (a Bee Gees cover). They had several other UK top ten hits including covers of Could it be magic (Barry Manilow) and It only takes a minute (Tavares) with the former featuring Robbie Williams as lead singer - a rarity on Take That recordings.<br /><br />If you buy this because Robbie Williams was a group member, you may be disappointed since he rarely sings lead. If, on the other hand, you are looking for simple, mainstream pop music, superbly performed, you might enjoy the music of Take That.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah gives us another album full of amazing tracks. I've been following her since the debut cd in 1990 and this latest one definitely ranks up there as one of her best. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks from my first listen would be: Its Like That, We Belong Together, Say Somethin, Get Your Number, Circles, I wish I Knew and Fly Like A Bird. <br /> <br />If you've ever liked a Mariah album or track, 'The Emancipation of Mimi' will fit right in with your old favorites. It's really THAT good.
B000007WQB|5.0|In the sixties, Dionne Warwick was much more successful in her native America than she was in Britain, but this was mainly because so many of her American hits were covered by British artists and became hits for them instead. As time progressed, this practice died out and Dionne gained the recognition she deserved in Britain too. This compilation focuses on her sixties music, specifically the songs that Bacharach and David wrote.<br /><br />Bacharach and David were prolific songwriters in the sixties and Dionne relied heavily on their songs at that time. Do you know the way to San Jose and Walk on by were the only songs here to provide Dionne with significant British hits. Many of the other songs provided Dionne with American hits, but even in America, some songs were given to others to have hits with.<br /><br />Among the songs here that were hits for other singers in Britain, America or both are Anyone who had a heart (Cilla Black), Raindrops keep falling on my head (B J Thomas). I just don't know what to do with myself (Dusty Springfield), Always something there to remind me (Sandie Shaw), I'll never fall in love again (Bobbie Gentry), I say a little prayer (Aretha Franklin), Make it easy on yourself (Walker brothers), What the world needs now is love (Jackie De Shannon), Alfie (Cilla Black), You'll never get to heaven (Stylistics), The look of love (Dusty Springfield) and Only love can break a heart (Gene Pitney). Indeed, there are very few songs on this CD that will be unfamiliar to fans of sixties music.<br /><br />Notable omissions are Close to you (later made famous by the Carpenters), Don't make me over, and This girl's in love with you, all of which qualified for inclusion here. Still, the quality of the songs here is excellent and, for the price, this is wonderful value.<br /><br />If you are looking for a collection of Dionne's sixties music, you'll find it difficult to improve on this one.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Artistically this is Mariah at her best.  A great CD to play from beginning to end.  I'm glad she's back.  I'm also glad she got back with Jermaine and other hot producers.    My song picks from the album    We Belong Together  Mine Again  Say Something  Circles  Your Girl  I Wish You knew  To the Floor  Fly like a bird (my favorite)
B00000I5MH|5.0|None of the ex-Beatles achieved the same level of success as solo singers that they had achieved while together but Paul's solo career was very successful by any other standards. Paul recorded mostly ballads but he could rock too, as he showed bwith songs like Jet and Band on the run.<br /><br />It is not possible to include all of Paul's hits on a single CD but all the tracks here were British top ten hits. Eleven of them made the UK top three including three number ones (Mull of Kintyre, Pipes of Peace, Ebony and ivory),while others peaked at number two. Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey topped the American chart but, like Maybe I'm amazed, didn't chart in Britain so isn't included here.<br /><br />Some UK top ten hits were left out for lack of space, including Mary had a little lamb, With a little luck (a top five UK hit and an American chart-topper), Goodnight tonight, Wonderful Christmastime, Waterfalls and The girl is mine (with Michael Jackson). Also missing are Paul's top twenty UK hits including Give Ireland back to the Irish, Helen wheels, Junior's farm and Take it away.<br /><br />So it would have been easy to fill a double CD with Paul's hits but his more recent compilation, Wingspan (a double CD) missed that opportunity, instead containing one hits CD and one CD of mostly album tracks with a few hits. Nevertheless, the hits selection on Wingspan is different and the most obvious omissions from this set can be found there.<br /><br />Of the tracks that are here, my favourites are Mull of Kintyre (complete with bagpipes), No more lonely nights (a superb ballad), Let `em in, Pipes of peace, My love, Another day and his duet with Stevie Wonder, Ebony and ivory. Also worthy of note are Say say say (with Michael Jackson), Silly love songs (possibly an attack on those who criticize Paul for doing mostly ballads?), Band on the run and the James Bond theme, Live and let die.<br /><br />Considering the many great tracks that have been omitted, some people will be disappointed at the inclusion of We all stand together (complete with frog chorus) but although it's not one of my favourites here, its place is justified - it was a British top three hit, after all, so a lot of people DO like it - and it's not meant to be taken seriously anyway.<br /><br />Originally released in 1987, this compilation provides an excellent overview of Paul's solo music. Although he has made some interesting music since 1987 (even including classical music), it is the music he made prior to 1987 (especially with the Beatles) that ensures his place in history.ple will be disappointed at the inclusion of We all stand together (complete with frog chorus) but although it's not one of my favourites here, its place is justified - it was a British top three hit, after all, so a lot of people DO like it - and it's not meant to be taken seriously anyway.  <br /> <br />Originally released in 1987, this compilation provides an excellent overview of Paul's solo music.

0684833395|5.0|'Catch-22' is an excellent novel, a true masterpiece of the 20th century. Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy. <br /> <br />Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all. <br /> <br />Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way. <br /> <br />For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel. <br /> <br />One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar. <br /> <br />It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption.  <br /> <br />Timeless & flawless - you must read this book
B000058DFO|5.0|Syreeta was once married to Stevie Wonder though the marriage only lasted a couple of years. The business relationship was more successful, with Syreeta sometimes singing backup on Stevie's records while Stevie helped Syreeta's career in other ways. Furthermore, they often wrote songs together, their most successful collaboration perhaps being Signed sealed delivered, an international hit for Stevie. As far as I know, they didn't record any duets together.<br /><br />Syreeta recorded a single in 1968 using the name Rita Wright, the A-side being I can't give back the love I feel for you. The two sides of that single are the final two tracks on this album. Following the failure of that single (despite being well-promoted and getting plenty of American airplay), Syreeta abandoned the Rita abbreviation and reverted to her own first name, dropping her surname in the process.<br /><br />Syreeta's biggest UK hit (and only American hit) was her duet with Billy Preston, With you I'm born again, which peaked at number two in the UK. It is extraordinary that Syreeta missed the American pop charts completely with her solo recordings. Four of them made the UK charts, the most successful being the number twelve hit, Your kiss is sweet. Spinning and spinning, Harmour love and It will come in time were only minor UK hits.<br /><br />This collection includes all the aforementioned songs including her own version of Signed sealed delivered as well as a duet with Smokey Robinson (First time on a ferris wheel), a duet with G C Cameron (Let's make a deal) and several excellent solo tracks.<br /><br />If you enjoy seventies Motown music, give Syreeta a listen.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Okay, so I'm a Mariah fan, so maybe I'm biased. But hear me out: Mariah Carey, we all know, has an amazing talent - over 5 octaves (some say 6 octaves) of strong voice.  What is amazing about her is that she sounds even stronger live than on her albums.  Thats why L.A. Reid decided to promote this album with the tagline \\"the Return of the VOICE.\\" Its an obvious swipe at lesser singers who the public favored more in recent years (read: Britney).  But as more people are 'over' stars like Britney, there should be a marked return to the actual singing talent of singers like Mariah.   <br />I took a friend last weekend to see Mariah tape a VH1 segment in NYC.  He was admittedly not a Mariah fan but after seeing and hearing her live, he had nothing but good things to say to all of our other Mariah-hatin' friends.  And, after hearing \\"We belong together\\" from this album, he bought the album on itunes.  Which brings me to the album... <br />The uptempos (\\"It's Like That,\\" \\"Shake it Off,\\" \\"Say Somethin',\\" \\"Get Your Number,\\" and \\"To the Floor\\") are all really well- produced and almost all of them could be singles.  A few of them are rap collaborations, but not overdone. In the past, I've had a problem with Mariah letting random rappers take over on a track (see \\"Loverboy\\" from Glitter), but in all of these tracks, Mariah is still clearly the star.   <br />The Ballads (particularly \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"Mine Again,\\" and \\"I Wish you Knew\\") are gorgeous. Her voice hasn't sounded this strong since \\"Hero,\\" as she channels a little old-school Gladys Knight, Minnie Riperton, a young Diana Ross when she was with the Supremes, and most surprisingly, a younger Mariah Carey. It's a return to form. <br />For me, though, the stand-out track is \\"Stay the Night,\\" produced by Kanye West.  Not only is the melody infectious, but it has the feeling of an old song made new.  Being in such a high key, this is one of those songs only Mariah could tackle.  I just can't say enough good things aboutthis album.  Give it a shot, and you'll be glad you did.
B000006YXV|5.0|You cannot fit all of Marvin's hits on a single CD but this collection has most of the essentials from a British perspective. One advantage that this has over the double CD (Very best of, which was compiled in America but released in both the UK and USA) is that it includes three UK top ten hits that are not on the double CD, these being Onion song (supposedly with Tammi Terrell, though Tammi was too ill to record the song and a sound-alike substituted), You are everything (with Diana Ross) and Abraham Martin and John (which was an American hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, not Marvin Gaye).<br /><br />There is no room on this CD to explore Marvin's career in depth or to explore the many American hits that didn't chart in Britain, but it does contain all his important British hits (some minor hits have been omitted) and on that basis, it provides an excellent overview of Marvin's career. Nevertheless, before buying this, you may wish to compare it with the double CD, Very best of (now re-issued as Gold).
B0002S947K|4.0|The first time heard the title song, \\"trouble\\" I thought, man, they dont make beautiful soulful music like this anymore. Then I found out that this was an emerging artist, and went out the next day and bought the album. LaMontagne's pure, emotionally charged voice is an absolute rarity these days, its like listening to music within a temple.  I'll be rooting for his sure success in the coming years.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Its tough to review something you know you like. Its hard to be objective. On the other hand there are very good reasons to investigate this record should you not be familiar with it. Its a great collection of sounds and vibes which combine to make some engaging songs. The sequence of songs (just 6) is great. You don't get worn out with too much of anything and each track is different but not so much so to make you think you've got some patched together release.  <br /> <br />From a musical standpoint you've got some stellar playing here - Carlos Alomar is very tasty (Wild Is The Wind, Golden Years) and Earl Slick lays it on (but not too much) making the title track and \\"Stay\\" such a great melange of rock and funk. You've got your obvious single here \\"Golden Years\\" which should have charted higher and longer than it did originally though everyone knows its a great song. George Murray was an awesome bassist and be sure to check out his work on \\"Stage\\". <br /> <br />Every Bowie fan needs to acknowledge that the man has benefitted greatly from having solid musicianship behind him and STS is one particular case where everyone earned their keep and then some. While Bowie gets the songs going his band took them to another plane altogther so he owes them for this especially given how wild his life was at the time of the recording of this album. At first I wasn't sold on \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" since it takes some major cajones to take this on when you know how well Nina Simone did it though I quickly realized that Bowie wasn't trying to take her on choosing rather to do it his way. For Bowie fans you probably realize that his vocal style had changed from the Ziggy/Alladin Sane days into this neo baritone/Scott Walker kinda thing that he tried to make work on \\"David Live\\" (with some degree of success) though later perfected here on STS.  Bowie is always moving in different directions and I think this album captures him at a great time - somewhere between R&B and rock with an eyetowards musical textures available with synthesizers.

1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween is a fantastic graphic novel which follows Batman, Harvey Dent, and Comissioner Gordon as they pursue the serial killer known as Holiday. It features all of the Dark Knight's villains (Joker, Riddler, etc.) in some way shape or form. But what I really liked about Long Halloween was that it showed Batman doing his detective thing. My impression of Batman has been that the citizens of Gotham regard him as like an urban legend, so it makes sense he takes the role of an investigator working in the shadows over a hard-knocking vigilante (although there are plenty of good beat downs throughout the novel...he IS Batman after all!). Excellent artwork, intriguing story, very satisfying repersentation of the Dark Knight.
0872860175|5.0|And as one of the most memorable poems of the 20th century began...  \\"I saw the best minds of my generation  destroyed by madness,   while starving hysterically naked,  and roaming the streets with an angry fix...\\"    Allen Ginsberg, poet and storyteller of the Beat Generation, became the driving force of the newly formed Beat movement that, through insanity, madness, and periods of solitude, rose from the depths -- specifically the woefully sexy city of Berkeley, CA, to the cumulative vortex that remained in pieces on the seductive streets of NYC's Lower East Side community.     \\"Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in houses, we'll both be lonely.\\"    The book, \\"Howl & Other Poems\\" not only includes both parts of \\"Howl\\" but includes other works such as \\"A Supermarket in California.\\"    \\"The madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time, coming after death.\\"    Overall this book is the equivalent of a historical document, in terms of the Beat Generation's poetry. It also contains several short poems that were written under the influence of... certain substances and poems related to Ginsberg's sexual experiences, as well.     This book, short as it is, is well worth owning. Another Amazon quick pick I'd like to recommend is \\"THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition\\" by Richard Perez, about a poet who can't get published -- amazing book, referencing the beats and Bukowski. Not only is it entertaining and funny, but ultimately profound.    (...)

In the past few years, we all knew MARIAH could do better.     I think she's learned, \\"Being You Is Cool\\", but not at the expense of losing everyones \\"Intrest\\"!    Stay the Night Rocks
1593072937|5.0|I saw the movie on opening day, and I just read the book today (a couple of weeks later).  This book goes over the Marv story, and I was amazed at how closely the movie followed the book.  The dialog is almost identical.  Most of the scenes were identical.  The couple of parts that were different were very good, like with Marv's mother--they just cut them out so they didn't have too many characters.<br /><br />But, even though it's very similar, it's worth reading even if you've seen the movie already.<br /><br />This first book is totally black and white, but just like the BW scenes in movie, I never noticed that it was a black and white comic while I was reading it.  I think I heard that later comics have more color in them.<br /><br />And, I have to say that I enjoyed the Marv story the best in the movie, so I'm glad it's the first one in the series.  I'm definately going to buy the rest of the Sin City books now that I've read this one.
B0002X314C|2.0|When I heard \\"Ordinary People\\" I thought this was going to be a great album. I don't generally listen to R&B all that much so I gave it a chance. The nice piano only accompanied by Legend's voice made it sound more natural and acoustic than anything I've heard that has been considered R&B. Unfortunately, the music, except for  a few songs, sounds like almost all the other R&B I've heard; Hip-hop beats and rappers being in the songs. Even these great songs can't change the fact that this album was tarnished by popular crap that people tend to like in all cds. This cd had so much potential.
B00009RAJI|5.0|\\"Rumours\\" sorely needed a remastering after the initial CD's issued in the 1980's suffered from compression and hiss. The remastering of this classic sounds flawless and the addition of a second disc of bonus material is a plus. The rough takes of \\"Planets of the Universe,\\" \\"Think About It,\\" and \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" are great and \\"Oh Daddy\\" benefits from the addition of Stevie Nicks' sweet backing vocals. My biggest gripe here is the position of \\"Silver Springs\\" on disc one: it is placed between \\"Songbird\\" and \\"The Chain\\" and it does'nt work as well as it does on the DVD 5.1 version, where it is after \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and before \\"The Chain.\\" \\"Songbird\\" closes the album on that version. In addition, the band's comments on the \\"Extras\\" section on the DVD 5:1 are a bigger asset than the bonus material on the 2 disc remaster.  You won't go wrong with either choice, but for my money I'd go with the DVD.
B00005MEPV|5.0|Okay, first of all. I thought, this was a fantastic movie!!! I also think, this movie wasn't given a fair chance and the critics were too rough on this film. Now, this story isn't about Luke, Leia or Han even. This was about how the whole thing began. Even Lucas said it himself, &quot;Don't bother looking for Luke, Leia, Han and Chewey. Cause, they won't be there&quot;. This was about Ankin and how he began his journey. Which would lead him to becoming to Darth Vader. So, enjoy this film for what it is. One great adventure!!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is one of this year's best already! This is miles away from Plastic sound of the moment J.Lo's and Ciara's. Im glad Mariah returned to her roots with a retro feel album that is an instant classic :) <br /> <br />Its Like That - Everyone knows this song. This brought Mariah Carey back to radio'attention with its catchy beat, fabolous hooks and in your face vocals. 8/10 <br /> <br />We Belong Together - I cried when I first heard this song! Its not like the generic love songs at the moment. Mariah makes the track something really personal to her and thats why she sings it with so much sorrow. One of the best songs on the album, and her best single in the past 7 years. 10/10 <br /> <br />Shake it Off - A bumping, bouncing, laid back summer track with lyrics that the youth will enjoy. The background vocals are the best since Daydream. <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />Mine Again - The track with the really in your face vocals with jazzy horns in the background. One of my early favorites, but after awhile I usually skip it, just like those \\"Music Box\\" Ballads. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Say Something - A track with a dreamy creamy quality. I still listen to it 6 months after it leaked. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />Stay the Night - Easily the best song on the album. Mariah's fantastic voice, Amazing background vocals, great lyrics, Phenomenal Production. This track would just make you want to dance with your love <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Get Your Number - One listen to this and you are hooked! Its like a more confident version of Emotions or Fantasy. Mariah makes a new trend when she let JD sing the hook. Definately single material <br />10/10 <br /> <br />One and Only - This track has to grow on you. Didnt like it at first but now I lurrve it! Mariah sounds really sorrowful. she even outspeeds the worlds Fastest rapper lol. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />Circles - This ballad takes you back to Vision of Love/Vanishing! Really beautiful raw vocals and amazing production. Grammy Worthy! <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Your Girl - The Only track that Im not feeling that much. It has the quality of classic Mariah tracks that would make you happy in a sad mood though. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />I wish You Knew - This ballad is cheesy hahaha! The vocals are great though plus a live audience and a spoken verse to add in even more cheesiness! You gotta love it for its cheesiness! <br />8.5/10 <br /> <br />To The Floor - This track is pure sexiness! Makes you want to shake your booty! Nelly takes away the excitement of the song with his monotone rapping. <br />7.5/10 <br /> <br />Joy Ride - A weaker version of \\"bliss\\" but the bridge is really beautiful though <br />7/10 <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird - Forget Hero otr Make it Happen! This track is the best inspirational Mariah track ever. Her child like vocals at the start progresses to a beautiful explosion that will send chills down your spine. Favorite song on the album <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Get this album with Faith Evan's The First Lady and Brian McKnight's \\"Gemini\\" and youll realize that R&B still has hope.
0316172324|1.0|Malcom Gladwell is really eating his own dog food.  In Tipping Point he discussed how you create buzz and get your ideas into the mass market and market acceptance.  He has executed this plan with Blink -- a book that basically reviews psych studies conducted by others in the 80's and 90's into an interested but uninspiring tale.<br /><br />Gladwell is pushing the book in every avenue possible -- inclduing a segement on CNN entitled \\"are you a racist?\\"  A piece of jaundiced journalism if I have ever seen one.  Generating buzz by this means is low and beneath any credible author.  I stopped reading the book and decided to write this reveiw after seeing the piece on 4/12/05<br /><br />The material in Blink is mildly interesting, but its not Gladwell's work.  He is at best an editor putting interesting ideas and stories together to tell a story, not provide soemthing to help you improve your business.<br /><br />The Tipping point brought you ideas from the 1970's and this book does much the same.  I am not smarter nor more aware after reading this book. It is shameless commerce and promotion for Gladwell's brand that I would rather not participate in.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I've never given MCR much though because the truth is I wasn't impressed at all by the songs from their earlier effort. I bought this CD because everyone was gushing abt it & was all hyped up about it. I've heard Helena, I'm Not Okay & Thank You for the venom from the MCR site & loved the video for the former 2. So wth, it's probabaly good. <br /> <br />Hmmm, the thing is, the cd took quite a while for me to enjoy it in its entirety. Sometimes I'd just skip to the tracks (1,4,5,7,9) Some CDs just jump out at you & it'll be your all time faves from the start. For me, not this CD. It took me quite a while to listen to it properly & savour it.  <br />Now after listening to it for a while, I think it's started to grow on me. I have other favourites but I can see why this is an outstanding CD
B0002MB7QW|5.0|Out of the many movies I have seen throughout my lifetime, this is one of the best.  I don't think it was because of the plot, but instead for its mind-blowing special effects and its interesting take on the last day or \\"apocalypse.\\"  I am not a very religious person, but after watching this film, I was starting to think maybe I should take it up...or make a note never to live in New York.   <br /> <br />The film is about a climatologist named Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid, Flight of the Phoenix) who predicts that Global Warming (the Greenhouse Effect) is going to trigger a new Ice Age.  Everyone refuses to believe him until its too late.  Now Jack, his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, October Sky), and a small band of survivors must ride out this super-storm and survive the wrath of Mother Nature.   <br /> <br /> The number one reason why everyone should go see this film is because the visual effects are phenomenal!  They are more detailed and meticulously played out than in any other film to this day.  The makers of this film took a sequence of events that could quite possibly have happened within thousands of years and tried to figure out what would happen if the process was sped up to fit in a two hour time slot.  I also think that the visual effects are even better than those in Lord of the Rings (like the huge computerized battle scenes).  To get the maximum effect of these ingenious visual effects, watch the film with the surround sound blasting and with widescreen if your TV can handle it. <br /> <br /> The plot for this movie is average.  It is basically about Jack going to rescue his son Sam who is caught in the super-storm in New York and with his girlfriend Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum, The Phantom of the Opera), which is very sweet of Jack...if it were possible to travel on foot against Mother Nature's wrath...but then again if everybody died in the movie, it would only be a half hour film.  By keeping a few main characters alive, it helped the audience to see what itwould be like to have no choice but to live and coup under such extreme conditions.  Aside from the plot, the actors' speaking parts are pretty limited and underdeveloped as well.  Perhaps because everyone's either: screaming, dying, or too shocked to say anything throughout the film.  I think the main reason why the plot and speaking parts were so underdeveloped was because too much time was spent on perfecting the special effects that not enough time was left to spend on making a better and more detailed plot for the accomplished actors/actresses in the film.  Maybe someday a movie will be made that has both breathtaking special effects AND an equally extraordinary plot.   <br /> <br /> I loved this movie's take on a second Ice Age, or mini \\"apocalypse,\\" as well.  For instance, it talked about how an enormous hurricane/tornado, whose eye covered the entire U.S., was so powerful that it sucked in air from outer space and dumped it onto the states, instantly freezing everything.  This and the other types of natural destruction were displayed throughout the movie. They all got me thinking about how much damage Americans cause towards our ozone every day.  I think it is highly probable that global warming will occur in the near future if we continue to abuse our privileges here on Earth.  It's pretty scary stuff when you think about it, so if you're looking for a good conversation starter, watch this movie and fear Mother Nature!  <br /> <br /> In other words, The Day After Tomorrow is a technological masterpiece that really delivers.  It was directed by Roland Emmerich (creator of the hit movie: Independence Day) and made over $900 million worldwide!  So why not watch this excellent big-budget film and see the new face on entertainment for yourself? <br />

B0007GAERG|5.0|I've been sooooo anticipated for this album to get released. I bought it at 12:01am at Wal-Mart on April 12th.  <br />Ok this morning I was watching Good Morning America and Mariahs voice sounded great. She hit all the high notes just fine. Her mic went out a couple of times but that was ok. She still sounded fine. Now.. for my early review. I will have another review later on cuz Im sure my opinions will change but heres my review for now.. <br /> <br />It's Like That-10/10 perfect first single. The beat is jumpy. I loved it ever since day one. <br /> <br />We Belong Together-10/10 great choice for a second single. The remix with Bone Thugs and Harmony is good too. I saw the video today. She looks like herself from 1997. <br /> <br />Shake It Off-10/10 one of my faves. This is Mariahs choice for the third single. I really hope it will be too.  <br /> <br />Mine Again-9/10 good vocals. <br /> <br />Say Somethin'-10/10 this was supposed to be the first single but was cancelled due to the song leaking. I think its a good choice for maybe a 3rd or 4th single. I heard from Def Jam it might be the next single. <br /> <br />Stay The Night-9/10 this is one of the better Kanye produced song. This was also picked as a first single and also got cancelled. <br /> <br />Get Your Number-10/10 definetly one of the best songs. This should be a single. JD is singing on this one.  <br /> <br />One and Only-9/10 good song. Mariah cusses on this song. She shouldn't have bleeped it. It would have made it more meaningfull. <br /> <br />Circles-7/10 I haven't got into this song that much yet but will over time. <br /> <br />Your Girl-9.5/10 again this is one of the best songs of the  <br />album. <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew-7/10 I haven't got into this song that much yet either. <br /> <br />To The Floor-10/10 great song. Very jumpy, dancy type song. <br /> <br />Joy Ride-8/10 haven't got into this song that much yet either. Its pretty good though. <br /> <br />Fly Like A Bird-10/10 seems like this was taken from the Music Box album. Her voice is awesome on this one. The ending is awesome. <br /> <br />This album is worth about 6 singles. I hope they will atleast make 5. My choice would be It's Like That, We Belong Together, Get Your Number, One and Only and Fly Like a Bird. <br />I hope this album goes atleast 5X Platinum. <br /> <br />Overall Rating 9.5
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I saw \\"the Phantom of the Opera\\" on stage in London when I was 12 and fell in love with the music and story right away. Since then I have read Gaston Leroux's novel which the musical is based off of and seen the show twice on Broadway. Once I heard about the theatrical release of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera I was excited and could not wait to see the movie. <br /> Before entering the movie I wondered how Joel Schumacher would decide to portray the famous tale on the big screen. I was pleasantly surprised to see how wonderful a job Schumacher did combining aspects of the show and novel to create, what I think, was an amazing movie. From the first black and white scene of Paris in 1917, through the ending credits, you could see how much detail was put into every aspect of the movie's creation. <br /> The sets were extravagant and beautiful, throughout the movie I felt like I was actually inside the opera house, witnessing the events of the story. The costumes also fit the time period, 1870, perfectly. Everything on the screen looked and felt like it belonged there. From Lady Carlotta's over-the-top costumes to match her personality, to the dark yet elegant clothes the Phantom wears, I feel like the costuming and set design enhanced the story far beyond what I have seen in other recent movies. <br /> There was also an amazing job done with the casting of the film. Emmy Rossum, only 16 years old at the start of filming, does an amazing job playing Christine. Rossum has a beautiful voice, and her portrayal of emotions helps understand what she is going through with her twisted love of the Phantom. Patrick Wilson also gives a strong performance as Raoul. I felt that Wilson had the best voice in the film, and also did a tremendous job acting the part of a daring hero. Minnie Driver also did a noticeably splendid job playing the part of Carlotta, a stereotypical diva, and provided a few laughs throughout an otherwise dark story. My two favorite performances however came from Simon Callow, Andre, and Murray Melvin, the conductor of the opera's orchestra. After working in the scrap metal industry, Andre and his partner Firmin learn to run an opera house. I feel however Callow fit the part of an old French theater owner to a \\"t.\\" Melvin, while having only a small part, did more than I thought could be done with the role. You can see the pain on his face as Carlotta acts up and throws temper tantrums, to his calm and peaceful state as the orchestra is following his lead. The only role I think that could have been noticably improved was Gerard Butler's performance of the Phantom. While Butler's acting was probably the best throughout the movie, showing the pain and torment of a tourchered individual, I felt that Butler's vocal performance was sub par, especially when compared to all the solid preformance's given by the rest of the cast. <br /> I also fell Schumacher did a great job with filming. As opposed to focusing on the actor or actress singing on stage, he utilizes the ability of film to portray the background and backstage happenings of the opera house. There were many scenes where shots of drunks backstage, or bored actors helped furthrt build the aurora of realism that was successfully achieved throughout the movie.  <br /> Overall, while not the greatest movie I have ever seen, I enjoyed watching the Phantom of the Opera more than most movies in recent history. The friends who I saw this movie where really diverse. There were people who didn't know the story, people who hated musicals, and people who were in love with the Phantom, like me. While not everyone loved the movie as much as I did, we all walked out smiling because we enjoyed the 2 hours and 15 minutes we spent in the theater. I would truly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, likes the story, and/or appreciates a good all around film.
B0000028RR|5.0|I bought this album after listeneing (and purchasing) their live release.  After listening to the songs I hadn't heard before (and some of the one's I had) I couldn't take it out of my changer.  It insane, exactly what everyone should be looking for in an album
B0007GAERG|5.0|I really didn't like her debut song on this album but when I heard \\"We Belong Together\\", I was curious about this album.  This album's much more soulful & better then her other albums in recent years.  I hope she goes on tour b/c I went to her last concert & she sounds amazing since she's one of the few artists that actually sound like their recorded albums.  The only thing I didn't like about this album was that in the cd case (The limited edition version), there's a pic of her w/nothing on but a sheer cloth material of some sort.  Great for me since I'm old enough to view things such as that however IMO it's not good for the younger audience to see images such as that.
B0002OERI0|2.0|while this album is \\"harder\\" someof their past releases, it reminds me more of good charlotte than Green Days' older releases. Some have called this a (Punk) rock opera,and green day's best release yet or even comparing this album to The Who's Tommy. this is just not right, this album does not even touch the rock opera greatness of tommy. if you want to hear a real punk rock opera listen to the decline by Nofx. that album has the smooth transitions and melodic sounds that Green Day must have been going for.  <br /> <br />For other Rock Operas check out Tommy, The Decline, Or even Pink Floyd's the Wall. <br /> <br />I have been listening to greenay since kerplunk was released and i must say that this album, just like shenanigans and warning, is a dissapointment. this ilbum is not nearly as hard, or as good, as insomniac, or as melodic as dookie. while the music isn't terrible, it makes me wonder if they wanted to make a good album or just one that would sell millionsbecause of catchy hooks and made for Mtv singles.  <br /> <br />As stated before this ablbum is a dissapointment. if you want an original sounding album that is hard melodic and will make you think pick up the Mars Volta's new album Frances The Mute. if you are new to gree day you should pick up insomniac and kerplunk. if you want a true Punk rock opera pick up the decline.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It is hard to find an artist who is willing to experiment with their music so openly. A lot are cautious in regards of the fact that they do not want to mess with an already successful formula. What makes Mariah Carey unique is the fact that she is willing to creatively expand, and venture off into other genres with her music. On The Emancipation of Mimi, Mariah hits you with some real R&B music. It is not R&B that is hidden beneath a thick layer of pop, but the real deal. \\"Mine Again,\\" co-produced by James Poyser impressed me, and completely blew me away. It is not a Mariah that we've heard before, and though some might classify the song as a ballad, it is more of an R&B joint. Jermaine has a heavy preseance on the album, actually producing some of the more stand out tracks. One being \\"Get Your Number.\\" Her second single \\"We Belong Together,\\" gives you a good mix of the old and new Mariah. It is a great choice for a second single. Her writing ability is unparralleled, and her voice will never be duplicated, and to be honest, can't even be imitated. \\"Joy Ride\\" proves just that...only she can sing the way she does. Though the high whistle has a bit of an absance on the album, you can still catch it there. I am most surprised at the length of the songs. I am not used to a simple three minute song from Mariah, but I take what is given to me. The album as a whole fits in very well, there is not a song that you feel is very misplaced, or a song that you simply want to skip. It is very organized, fitting, and well put together. Her ability to work with so many producers shows her star power, and how broad of an artist she is. \\"One and Only,\\" is probably the most catchy song on the album, and Twista splashes a bit of his speed rhyming in there to give it that hip hop touch. The Emancipation of Mimi is some of her best work in years, and to deny her of \\"The Voice\\" would simply be ignorant of you. Love Mariah, Listen to Mariah, Enjoy Mariah...she's back, well She never left!
B00005K3OT|4.0|I agree with other reviewers who believe this film is filled with cliches and is predictable in its progression.  But, in my opinion, that's the whole point!  When we watch a movie like \\"Chocolat\\",we do so for a bit of escapism and comfort-and comfort is ultimately what the characters in this film find.  Vianne and Anouk find the comfort and familiarity of a permanent home.  The mayor begins to be comfortable with the fact that his wife has left him.  Townspeople become comfortable with their various relationships and the young priest begins to become comfortable in his role as the town's spiritual advisor. We see these changes develop against a backdrop of the ultimate comfort food---chocolate!  I believe that watching \\"Chocolat\\" leaves one nearly as satisfied as consuming chocolate.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Green Day is suffering from the U2 virus. Release the same album every couple of years but with diffrent lyrics. If you love Green Day to the point of crazyness then this album is for you, but if your looking for something new or diffrent, go try something else. <br /> <br />Also some have said this album is \\"political\\" its not at all.
B00080EU58|5.0|I've had this record for quite some time now.  I know it from top to bottom pretty well.  I must say that it is Slipknot's most impressive effort.  When you look at their self titled debut, you have a hardcore masterpiece, and Iowa took that up to another knotch.  What's next?  Vol. 3, is a showcase as to what Slipknot can accomplish as a band.  The drumming seems to be showcased the most, as Joey Jordinson is a great skinsman.  This record also proves that Mick and Jim are quite the guitarists, as this record is chock full of fast Kerry King like solos.  Corey continues to amaze by hitting notes I'd never be able to hit in a life time.  Everyone plays their part on this record.  What I like best about this record is the fact that's it's so creepy.  The samples are absolutely perfect for this record, they provide a dark and dreary atmosphere.  This has to be one of the darkest records ever made. <br /> <br />Since I am reviewing the special edition, I'll also go over the material on the bonus disc.  The disk starts out with two b-sides, both are great songs, and should belong right with the rest of the songs on the album.  You also get a remix of Vermillion, but it's not too different from the original version.  Also included is the full version of the album's very creepy outro Danger-Keep Away.  The full version is much longer than the original with many more added parts.  After that you get four live tracks.  Slipknot live is always a good thing.   <br /> <br />All in all, a great release.  Highly recommended.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I have to say people stop dissing this cd and give it more of a listen. If you say this cd is repetitive your missing the point of daft punk, the music is to dance to, and some people like me can sit and a room and groove to it. Human After All is a departure from Discovery and Homework, but that being said I'm glad they are keeping the music fresh and different by changing it up in their style of play, I mean Indo Silver Club from Homework, is diffrent from aerodynamic from Discovery right? Alot of the songs on the cd are great I love Robot Rock, the guitar riffs are great, technologic, this song kinda makes think of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger that being said its great, Prime Time of Your Life is really good but I really don't care for about halfway through it, and its name sake Human After All is great. Thats just a sample of the songs the rest are awesome. If you love daft punk, or just want something different and creative, give this one a try anddon't forget to try their old stuff as well such as Discovery and Homework!!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is probably Mariah Carey's best album ever. After listening to her on \\"Charmbracelet\\" I believed that her voice was seriously in decline. It's refreshing to know that she never lost it. In fact, with this album, it seems like she is singing better than ever! The strict focus on R&B results in an amazing album, and proves that Mariah doesn't need producers like Walter Afanasieff to conduct beautiful songs for her. My only complaint about this album has more to do with her as an artist than with the music: The album art is a misrepresentation of her. Although the pictures are beautiful, it is clear from her live performaces that it isn't her real body in the pictures. Mariah is heavier, more Botticellian than the stick-figure princess in the fantasy artwork. I'm more of a realist, and because her voice is presented so strong and real, I think her image should have the same reality check. But with a voice like that, she could put her face on the body of a camel and I'd still be plugged in.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|Bottom line... if you enjoyed the original cut of \\"Daredevil\\", you'll enjoy this longer cut, too, and probably a little more.  But if you didn't like the movie before, the extra scenes here likely won't make you change your opinion.  The new scenes are interesting and fun, but certainly aren't integral to the story in the way that, say, finally getting to see Saruman's final fate in the extended cut of \\"Return of the King\\" was integral to that film.  However, if you haven't seen the film before, this is probably the version to check out.  It sacrifices some of the fast pacing, but in return delivers a more novelistic, introspective, and thoughtful story, nicely appropriate for one of Marvel's more introspective, thoughtful heroes.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Very powerful delivery from Mariah. I liked Charmbracelet though too. Great cd!
B00030590I|4.0|As entertainment and spectacle, this film shines.  I loved the powerful soundtrack and beautiful visuals.<br /><br />Also as a work of art, \\"Hero\\" rises much above most visually impressive movies of this genre---the plot does require a fair amount of concentration and thought to really understand, and during the last 30 minutes or so a strong Buddhist subtext arises unexpectedly.  This was a pleasant and remarkable surprise.<br /><br />The subtext is Buddhist, but also very nationalistic and politically convenient from the Chinese perspective---I'm sure that the still-totalitarian Chinese government must've been very happy to see this one come out!<br /><br />The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt that many of the fight scenes were a bit overboard, and things got a little melodramatic towards the end between the main characters.<br /><br />But it was a very fun way to spend 2 hours!
B0007Q6QVO|5.0|All tracks are great and very energetic album. she has done the best. you have to buy this album and put it in your archives. This album is rocking and you have to listen you'll get yours. HER OWN RECORD LABEL, HER OWN MUSIC,HER OWN LYRICS... wHEN YOU BUY This ALBUM, you understand how ý feeling...
0385486804|1.0|I, for one, did not find Krakauer's personal insights into Christopher McCandless's life interesting or necessary.  <br /> <br /> This book deceived me.  For the first half, I was intrigued with Chris and his fearless wanderlust that took him all over the southwest.  As the account wore on, however, I found myself almost skimming through the passages about similar explorers and their unfortunate ends.  \\"Get back to Chris!\\"  I thought.  Most painful of all though, was Krakauer's confessional about his dysfunctional and distant relationship with his father, intertwined with an account of him climbing the Devil's Thumb.  The climbing story was okay, but I felt cheated.  I didn't buy a book to read about the author; in fact, why should care about the author?  Good biographers let you see the person they are describing, and recede into the background.  Jon lets us know early on that he feels he has an understanding of Chris's emotions, and over the latter half of the book he freely shares his personal opinions and then some with the reader.   <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the book is about the triumphs and losses of brave, foolhardy young men.  By the end, I gave up trying to analyze Chris's motivations and feelings for myself, because the author had already conveniently made up my mind for me.  I could barely stand the drawn out analysis of what actually killed Chris (we know it was starvation, but why did he starve?  The author spends copious pages explaining the evils of potato seeds).  The author acknowledges that Chris was a terse writer and had very short journal entries describing his Alaskan adventure, which leads me to believe that the book didn't have all that much material for a story in the first place.  Maybe this is why Krakauer fills over half the book with idle ruminations and reflections on his and others' lives.   <br /> <br /> One last note; Athabascans continue to survive in Alaska's harsh interior, and Krakauer gives little credit to their survival skills and ingenuity.  He instead focuses on Europeans who have managed to forage in the great wilderness.  He mentions the indigenous people of Alaska scant few times, and always in a seemingly negative light. <br /> <br /> Overall, the first part of Into the Wild proves Krakauer has the capability of writing a thrilling and intriguing adventure story, but unfortunately he also gets bogged down by his own emotional baggage and opinions.  Too bad the story of Christopher McCandless fell flat on its face; it could have been fascinating.  <br />
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|This is a great album which spans Donna's entire career and showcases all the great songs from the 70s, 80s, 90s up to today. I don't think there is a single song on here which isn't fantastic and it was interesting to hear some her non-dance tracks from the early 80s when she was re-inventing her sound.<br />If you're a true Donna Summer fan, you must go out and get this.
B00000I07P|2.0|There's one thing I really dislike, people dive-bombing on a band that everyone says is \\"trying to be real.. (genre insert here), but isn't and is just a bunch of posers.\\" Then they will go on to list a whole tonne of artists that are apparently what the genre is actually supposed to be, without actually explaining why the band they are dissing sucks. Who cares if it's not real metal / punk / indie / whatever, yes, we know that there are legions of idiots who sit there with a Poison record on thinking they're listening to heavy metal, but stop for a moment and disregard what everyone else thinks. Lets just, view this music by itself.. and stop worrying about what it's not, and what it's trying to be but failing.    Bon Jovi suck, no doubt about it. They have ridden the cheese-wagon of bad music all the way to the bank and also forfilled the desires of morons who are looking for a \\"dangerous alternative\\" in music. Whatever Bon Jovi is supposed to be, or at least want to be, they're not. Hair-metal is the ultimate cheese of all music, filled with sickly sweet over the top 'ironic' bombastic ballads (the joke got old A LONG TIME AGO) with crappy melodies and an orchestral backdrop that would make the London Symphony seem weak. Then there's the edgier 'party time' rockers that have been done before and with actual character and worth by artists like AC/DC & Led Zeppelin-- all of the 80s hair metal is just lame imitations of the artists who did it right and did it originally. Add in some Bruce Springsteen blue-collar tales and you've pretty much got Bon Jovi. This trash is the kind of stuff that noone around today actually remembers. The music sucks-- 1). To all of you out there who think they've got real metal with a posion record-- you're wrong, this is not real metal, this is soppy watered down metal.. and 3) just because it's not real metal isn't an intelligent point to put across as to why this band sucks-- judge their music (see point 1).
B00005B36H|5.0|What can I say? I really do not know how to desribe this album. It has so many different levels and parts I can't even begin to desiphre it. I will say that it is an extremely good album. I have this and Aenima and have heard undertow once or twice. And I can say that this is most likely the best Tool album so far. I really enjoy falling asleep to this album because it gives you a whole new perspective on the songs and they're different parts. It's a cd you have to listen to as a whole to enjoy fully so don't skip any tracks. I suggest, no, I'm TELLING you to get this cd, unless there is something wrong with you, you will enjoy this cd.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Face it...there's always going to be someone bound to end up hatin Mariah Carey for god knows what reason...giving a 1 star review...(what the heck?)...obviously this people have something against her...and aren't able to give an appropriate NON-BIASED review for her album. <br /> <br />anyone and everyone who knows music can assure you that every track on this album does do \\"mariah's comeback\\" justice. whether or not u're into hip hop or ballads, this album have a nice mix and match...and will leave u dumbfounded after listening to every track on her album..especially after the last track \\"Fly Like A Bird\\". <br /> <br />What proper reasoning can reviewers who rated her album just 1 star give? On what grounds? That they're disappointed? Let's see..the production's amazing...her vocals are mind blowing...she produced and co-wrote the songs...the album has a knack to appeal everyone regardless of their age or whatever..it's easy to listen to...and all the songs grow on you.  <br /> <br />My point being...it's a great album overall, certainly not at all close to being rated for anything less than 3 stars...Anyone who rated that are totally off-course and obviously are bored enough to let their biased opinions get a hold of them. <br /> <br />If you're truly a music fan...tossin all biases aside, u have to get the album...sit back and let it blow you away.  <br /> <br />Love her or hate her, you'll be convinced that she's no doubt...legendary.  <br /> <br />P.S Her marketing tag isn't marketed as \\"the return of the voice\\" for no reason. <br />
0446677450|3.0|I read this book in a half of a morning as was surprised to see how common sense Kyosaki's method is.  I am actually surprised that a book based solidly upon assets and liabilities can do so well when it is such common business practice. Beyond that Kyosaki's suggestion that becoming rich through trading stocks it misguidance to a readership looking optimistically towards riches that could yield potentially horrible results. To be perfectly honest about this book: if you couldn't come up with the concepts inside this work by the time you finished middle school you are way behind the eight ball.  That being said if you haven't had any financial training or just haven't pondered solid methodology toward building capital this book is an excellent point of departure.  The writing style makes grasping concepts simple yet it is a little bit patronizing to the reader and feels often like a script of an infomercial.   But this book is filled with sound and solid advice for the most part.  But rather than telling average American people they should be buying stocks and 1031's etc the emphasis should be left on saving more and investing with guaranteed returns and spending less money.   Of setting your life up for the best possible financial outcomes is important and needs to be ingrained in the mind of anyone who wants to be financially responsible. <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you feel you are lacking understanding in these areas read this book.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Ted Murena  <br />
044024157X|2.0|I've read most of John Grisham's books and have always enjoyed his storyteller voice and style.  This book carries a very different tone and style -- it's much more cliched and predictable, and much less of a page-turner (in fact, many times it borders on boring).  My biggest complaint is that he is sloppy in his storytelling, and inconsistencies, contradictions, and loose ends abound.  It's nothing like his early legal thrillers, and is not even as good as his recent books like Bleachers and The Broker.  If you plan to skip a Grisham book, this should be the one.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I really don't get what all the fuss is about concerning Lucas's additions to the DVD release! Everybody seems to hate them! Personally I think they add a whole new (better dimension) to the movies and make them more of a joy to watch. They can help you connect more between the prequel trilogy and the original which simply wasn't happening with the original theatrical version. I especially like the scene from The Empire Strikes Back which they've touched up. Instead of having some other actor playing The Emperor as it was originally they have the proper Emperor (Ian Mcdiarmid). This scene was only short and the Emperor was a hologram speaking to Darth Vader but none the less, the scene is much much better now! There're many other scene's like this as well which really makes these DVD's a thrill to watch for the first time. And as for you people criticising George Lucas? If it wasn't for him you wouldn't even have the theatrical versions alright? Just you try coming up with a multi-million dollar film franchise! And anyway, they are his films to change if he wants to change them. His! <br />But for those of you seeking to perhaps buy a copy, please (if you've got the cash) just go out and get the bloody things! They are three fantastic films which can be enjoyed over and over again and the special features are really interesting to watch (sneak preview of EPISODE 3!). They come in a great looking presentation box and are a must for any film buff (not to mention star wars buffs) FOR GOD'S SAKE GET THEM!!!
0783114222|3.0|You know those TV shows that say 'based on actual events' - but not really the facts? This is one of those. Tom Hanks brings his over the top acting style to directing giving us a very soapy version on NASA history. The first DVD gives 10 minutes to Shepard's flight and a brief mention of space walking and docking - docking being one of the MOST important achievements. The remaining hour + is about the Apollo fire, showing supposed 'behind the scenes' arguments about safety vs staying on schedule, the publics right to know vs NASA keeping their game face. The show spend a disproportionate amount of time on what in reality was a small setback in the space race and it tells us nothing about the science and enginering that went into getting to the moon.
B0002PZVHK|5.0|Brian Eno is the greatest of the unsung musical geniuses of the 20th Century. Eno's audioscapes fall somewhere between soft wind and the rarest cognac. A treat for the ears and the soul. This album should be part of any serious audiophile's record collection.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is WITHOUT A DOUBT the \\"Return of the Voice.\\" This is definitely not a Mariah album to simply ponder over getting - this is a must-have for sure... I can't even emphasize any standout tracks b/c they're all so perfect - you can really tell she spent so much time making this album (she spent more time on this collection than any other of her past albums, w/ the exception of her debut of course).<br /><br />Don't even hisitate to get this CD! If you like MC in the slightest, you'll appreciate this - it's got every side of her unique musical tastes and powerful, intricate vocals.<br /><br />BTW, there are some dumb@$$ people writing some of these reviews - LOL - one of them even called her a \\"one-hit wonder\\"... Ohhh maaan. If they only knew. *cough* More #1's than ANY other female artist in history. ;-)<br /><br />It's Like That was a top 10 hit, WBT is still #1 for how many weeks now(?), Shake It Off will be a hit (as the 3rd single), and I'm sure Say Somethin will be another hit - it'll definitely be a single at some point. If you look through all the nice *EDUCATED/UN-IGNORANT* reviews, you'll notice a recurring agreement: This is an album you can listen to start-to-finish. ALL the songs are THAT good.<br /><br />If you haven't gotten this, get it! I liked the kid's review that said they had no idea of Mariah's music and got this CD... You don't need to know any of her past music to love this! :-)
0312995423|5.0|I have to say the author uses an style of writing that keeps alert throughout all the book. The book has a very good storyline that keeps you wanting to know more about it. <br /> <br />It has 400+ pages and I read it on 2 school days because I just couldnt put it apart, very great book dan brown.
B00005JNRB|4.0|I was really excited to see this movie because I had such a fun time seeing National Treasure, another good action/adventure type flick. This one isn't quite as good as National Treasure (so what if I like Nick Cage better??!!) but I still had a great time-- the action, the stupid sidekick, the foreign chick, this movie has it all. <br /> <br />Dirk (McConaughey) works for NUMA (I forget what that stands for). Basically, he's a treaure hunter. His best friend is played by Steve Zahn-- these two have great chemistry. Dirk has been searching for a long lost ship, supposedly stranded somewhere in Africa. A girl is tossed into the mix, a worker for the World Health Organization played by Penelope Cruz. She's looking into some kind of outbreak that is killing hundreds. The three get tangled up together, Dirk still seeking his treasure while helping the girl figure out the source of this disease. It gets more complicated, though nothing that will hurt your brain, but it's all good fun. <br /> <br />All in all, a pretty fun movie. Awesome on the big screen, one of the great reasons to see it at the theater. I love how everything is connected and is wrapped up in the end, even if it is a bit extreme and far-fetched. That's what movies are, after all. If you don't like action, see this movie for McConaughey's tan, buff body. Or Zahn's comic zaniness, which is just fantastic (he loses his hat three times in this movie, all of which are big deals, to him at least!!). RECOMMENDED!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|When Jimi \\"The master of rock\\" Hendrix moves his graceful fingers over the strings in the first notes of the first song, \\"Purple Haze,\\" something will say to you, \\"Man, that's cool!\\" Maybe there is a reason we're still talking about him so long after his death.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Wow this album is amazzzzzzzzzzzzzing....Mariah's voice resonates and in songs like \\"Mine Again\\" \\"We belong together\\" \\"Stay the Night\\" you know why she's the #1 best selling female artist in HISTORY!  <br /> <br />great upbeat album with a great chance to hit #1.  The VOICE is definitely back!
0452282152|4.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring <br /> <br />Set in Holland in the 1660's \\" Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" is a novel by Tracy Chevalier.  This book comes alive when telling a story of the artist Vermeer's most celebrated paintings. <br /> Griet is a 17-year-old girl who gets sent to work as a servant when her father loses his job because he is blind.  The house she is sent to work at belongs to the famous painter Johannes Vermeer.  Vermeer chooses to have Griet be his assistant and clean his art studio.  The man, who pays Vermeer to paint, makes Vermeer paint a portrait of Griet, because he likes her.  This results in the famous painting known as \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\".  When Vermeer's wife finds about the painting of Griet to goes into a rage and Griet is asked to discontinue her work as a maid in their house.  During the story Griet also has relations with the families butcher's son, Pieter, and later Griet must make a life changing choice.  <br /> When Griet first begins to work in Vermeer's house and clean his studio, she is very reserved and careful in what she says and does.  When cleaning the studio she had to make sure everything looked as though it had not been moved.  Griet's special way of making sure of this was she would measure each object, in the room or on a table, in relation to the objects around it.  \\"... The small things on the table were easy, the furniture harder- I used my feet, knees, sometimes my shoulders and chin with the chairs.\\" Careful not to disrupt a thing in the house Griet uses her intelligence and unique touch to make sure everything goes right in the house of the famous painter. <br /> This book tells a story of a young girl from a poor family who gets to work in the wealthy home a famous artist. The book has parts you can relate to, and you feel as if you are part of the story.  With its suspense and excitement the book \\" Girl With a Pearl Earring tells a great story about 17th century Holland. <br />
0375422307|5.0|I enjoyed Persepolis and learned a great deal about events that happened when I was but a child myself. Marjane manages to capture the humanity of her friends and family in the middle of chaotic times. While the subject matter and presentation are very similar to the Maus books by Spiegelman, I think that Persepolis is more effective in its story telling because the people are left people for the good and the bad.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This album is one that no true fan of great music or The Man in Black can not appreciate.  The tracks on this album are as timeless as the legend and musical legacy of Johnny Cash himself.  These songs trace a winding path through his life; pain, frustration, joy, true love, addiction, sorrow, lonlieness, and death.  This album is not only a distinctive first-hand look into the life of Johnny Cash, but also a look into his soul.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I am a pretty big fan of Maideb, I don't have all of thier cd's but I have the one's that count like Killers, Number of the Beast, Peace of Mind, and of course The Dance of the Dead. Frankly I love this album. The songs are ALL catchy and a great fun to listen to. Some of them even bring me back to the quality of Number of the Beast, which just freaking rocks. Fans can never really make up their minds about what they want. They get mad when a band like let's say Metallica completly changes thier style like in St.l Anger, (btw I am with those people that are pissed off) or they get mad that is sounds like they usually do. You people have to make up your minds. This album was great. <br /> <br />A song that people seem to forget that really stands out at me on the album is the Title Track, Dance of Death. This is in my top three favorite songs of all time, tied with Hallowed be Thy Name. If Iron Maiden should be thought of for anything it is thier amazing abilitly to write epics that are extremly memorable and juat playing kick butt. <br /> <br />The first track is also a great one, sure it sounds a little familia, but hey, it is fun to listen to and pumps me up in the morning, so good job there.  <br /> <br />And I can't believe that people are knocking this album because the cover doesn't look too good. AND YOU CALL YOURSELF METAL FANS. That is the most ignorant thing that sombody can complain about when it comes to insulting music. I can understand, maybe the MUSIC didn't suite your fancy, if you want to knock an album for that I will understand, even if I don't agree with oyu in this case, but to say that it sucks because the artwork aint pretty, c'mon, its supposed to be about the music, good artwokr is just an added bonus. Thats like saying that you don't like a band because their hair style aint up to your liking. Its supposed to be about the music, not the look of the band. <br /> <br />THE GREAT ETNEBOB HAS SPOKEN
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland is a wonderful film with great performances.  But like so many film biographies the screenplay does not compare well to the real events concerning J. M. Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies boys (actually 5 instead of 4 and Barrie not only knew their father but was not liked by him).  Film, being vastly different than writing a full-length biography, has to take liberties to be  coherrant and tell a story. In creating the world of J. M. Barrie, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a great success and is an  unforgetable movie.    Johnny Depp is always fascinating to watch and here he makes J. M. Barrie into a genius searching for a direction in his life having had a play fail and a wife (Radha Mitchell) that treats their relationship coldly.  His inspiration comes from the recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons, with whom he builds the close relationship that is lacking in his life.   Through the many hours he spends with the boys, pretending to be pirates and Indians, the story of Peter Pan takes shape.   However, even as Barrie has found a semblance of family with the Llewelyn Davies' he is challenged by Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie) who finds the relationship inappropriate.  Coupled with this are the signs of illness Sylvia exhibits (and tries to hide) which makes this a sad and poignant story.      The performances by Depp, Winslet and Christie save the film from an overly sweet tear-jerker.  The performance of Freddie Highmore as Peter is superb, and his character meshes perfectly with Johnny Depp's J.M. Barrie that one forgets the three other boys.  The production is also outstanding with excellent costumes and all of the details that help re-create Edwardian England.   The cinematography is beautiful but, indeed, it is the performances that make this a great film.
B00005JGAB|5.0|hey !!!!!!! this is one of the greatest cd ever and the best punk cd,it has a lot of great songs it's so much better than blink 182 ,good charlote or stupid music like that,the ramones can be described in one word :punk , buy it,is a great cd the blitzkrieg bop is a classic but there is so much more classics in this cd
0446677450|1.0|First of all, if you read Disney comics as a kid you'll be able to recognize since the start of the imaginary story that Mr. Kiyosaki is influenced by characters like Scrooge McDuck and his secretary Miss Quackfaster who represent the rich dad and the rich dad's secretary, and actually you can pick more wisdom from Scrooge than from this book on how to exploit your employees the best you can. <br /> <br />If you paid a visit to the website (I did today, April 13, 2005) for the book ([...]) the first thing you'll see is a provoking picture of the author, and the co-author Sharon whom I can't find a role for in the parts I read in the book except the useless introduction she made about her oh-so-smart child who knows more than his age and a third woman - I don't know who -, all three well dressed and looking rich and smiling at whoever bought the book (thank God I didn't buy it) and thanking them for making them richer. The funny thing also about the website is that you'll find that there are Rich Dad Games, Rich Dad Seminars, Rich Dad BlaBlaBla... etc. The Rich Dad IQ test on the website is not an IQ test Mr. Kiyosaki, it's more like a school test!! Oh Please, IQ tests are made to test the intelligence and not to recite certain knowledge!!!!!! <br /> <br />The book offers nothing but logical thinking that you can make on your own if you sit and think of your spendings and decide to put your money where it belongs. <br /> <br />Don't even think of buying this book. If you want it to tickle your thinking then read it at the public library or borrow it for free from a friend who's $16.95 poorer.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|A DVD release of this movie was long overdue. Having seen it again today on TMC, I decided to look for it on here one more time.  This movie is phenomenal! Anyone who considers themselves a true fan of music will love this movie. It has such a fine selection of music that it won't matter if you consider yourself to be a true fan of the blues or not. There's enough reviews on here to know the basic premise of the film so I won't get carried away with the details, but it simply explores the legend of the Crossroads and blues great Robert Johnson.  I remember it being shown in my 8th grade music class because it's such an entertaining history lesson of american music. To have a movie about one genre of music captivate an entire room of diverse teenagers amazes me still. Especially in a public school like the one I went to (movie time meant nap time or screw-off time). One just needs to look at how many of today's major acts list Robert Johnson as one of their main influences to understand the significance of the music, and this movie explores the legends and the music with equal vigor, succeeding handily on both ends.  While Macchio isn't always 100% believable as 'Lightning' (mostly due to his Karate Kid fame), he puts on a fair performance overall. I disagree with most critics who say he ruins the film however. Joe Seneca puts on a stellar performance as Willie Brown. While he is hard-nosed, he is also a teacher of sorts, and a very talented harmonica player. This movie can create a tough choice of what to pick up first, the guitar or the harmonica.  To end, this is simply one of 'those' movies. The kind that never received critical acclaim, yet achieved cult status because of the depth and quality it truly contains. It's amazing how many people don't 'get' this movie. Like I said before though, any true fan of music would love this movie.minating the name of this movie with her waste of film that showcased her overall lack of talent (she can dance, but that's about it).
B00070DK5K|4.0|When I first bought this collection on 8-track in '74 I was shocked: gone were the glam trappings and slick production of his studio efforts. Kudos to Bowie then and now for pushing the envelope with regard to his image and musical direction. Sure there are a few missteps, but what you gain in return is a sweaty, live, r & b fueled gig with jazz overtones. Worth the price of admission just to hear David Sanborn's sax riffing and session legend Herbie Flower's amazing bass-lines which evoke aural visions of Jamerson and Jemmott.
B0007GAERG|3.0|... and tell her that she has and has always had a fabulous voice, that she is and has always been gorgeous, and thus she doesn't have to try SO very hard to be everything to everybody just to be successful again. She doesn't know if she wants to be a hip-hop artist, a dance artist or an adult-contemporary artist, and on this album she tries to be all of them and more. The last Mariah album I bought was \\"Music Box\\", and I hoped that \\"The Voice Is Back\\" meant she was returning to those halcyon days, but I guess not quite. Still, this album has a few excellent songs on it; my favorite is \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" where Mariah sings her heart out and infuses every note with meaning. I wish she would do more songs like this and dump Nelly, Jermaine Dupri and Snoop Dogg!!
B000000I02|3.0|I bought this based on my appreciation of Sinclair's work with Caravan and Camel but also due to someone describing the album as the one he'd take to a desert island.  Not me.  The songs here are sloppy compared to Sinclair's work with the other bands.  No doubt in those situations the other musicians held him to higher standards than when he was calling the shots himself.
0767836286|4.0|I generally don't like thriller or mystery movies.  Too much blood and guns and not enough story.  But this one was quite good.  Tim Robbins is unusually good in his bad-guy roll (better than in Antitrust, but similar roles).  Jeff Bridges is great as the main character.  It will keep you on your toes and guessing as to how it all goes down.  It kind of makes you wonder about the Oklahoma City bombing and how many people were really involved in it.  Good recommend for people who don't mind scary/tense movies.
B000267JQK|2.0|the song broken was a good song but then amy lee had to join the  <br />song and i don't like it as much any more and most of the cd was  <br />ok but there are only about 4 songs good on this cd <br />sorry seeter but it could have been way better
B0007GAERG|5.0|I ran out and got this album as soon as the store opened.  I was eagerly anticipating her return.  With all the \\"divas\\" out today, Mariah is truly a breath of fresh air.  Not only does she look fabulous on the cover but the album is amazing.  She's back to \\"singing\\" and the beats are crazy.  This album is well-done and deserves some attention.  Every song is excellent and once you get to know the words the songs all make that much more sense.  Great buy, you won't be disappointed.
1577311523|3.0|In all of my 62 years, I have read numerous works on the topic of spirituality. Mr. Tolle's book follows many classics of which I so enjoyed-works by Ram Dass, Deepak Chopra, Andrew Harvey, Matthew Fox, Marianne Williamson, Alan Watts, Krishnamurti, Cayce ..ad infinitum. And though I enjoyed much of Tolle's book when it first appeared five years ago, when I look at it now(couldn't help but comment here on the author's vain and frighteningly egotistical preface to the new paperback edition), I am really wondering just who this teacher is.      I had the misfortune of hearing him speak when I was traveling in England last year, and the pomposity of which he came off -really appalled me. I never saw such an egotist in all my life. (in a so-called spiritual teacher-this is a bit off-putting) Tolle resonated with such vanity-that the spiritual \\"truths\\" he was attempting to make rang hollow. To me, those who remain modest and sincere and generous toward others are the real teachers. (Deepak Chopra, to me, is always so gracious and humble when he speaks; I also like Carolyn Myss and Andrew Weil-actually-- many spiritual communicators who come from a medical background-seem to walk their talk).     I can only say to those readers out there: \\"yes this is a good book-but pay attention to what may lie beneath the surface \\". To me, the real spiritual teachers are always humble and helpful toward others. Tolle -in person- is very different from what he appears in his DVDs and books-I have heard he is cut-throat and very competitive when it comes to others' works (unfortunately, a good source of mine knows he has hurt others.) Bottom line? Everything must serve him. And that always says it all. Just be aware and go within and listen to your own inner communication to the divine. Forget this guy.     As one luminous Galilean soul once said: \\"By their deeds you shall know them\\".
B000006SGT|5.0|The original Animals were my favorate band as a teenager, and this collection captures the band at its early, bluesy best.  Unlike many of the other Animals CDs which focus mainly in the group's well-known singles, this collection includes all of the material from their early albums along with a few \\"never before released\\" items.   <br /> <br />Songs such as \\"Bright Lights, Big City,\\" \\"I'm Mad Again,\\" \\"Hallelujah, I Love Her So,\\" \\"Worried Life Blues,\\" and \\"Blue Feeling\\" are among The Animals' best, yet are often omitted from CD collections.   <br /> <br />For serious Animals aficianados, this CD also includes  different versions of \\"Dimples\\" and \\"Talkin' Bout You\\" than were released on the original American albums.  (On the down side - and it is the ONLY down side - this CD has the British version of \\"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place,\\" which I regard as inferior to the American release;  others will disagree about this, and still others won't be able to tell the difference between the two.)  The previously unreleased material is also pretty good, unlike a lot of the previously unreleased material found on CDs of other bands.  <br /> <br />Most of this material has stood the test of time, so younger listeners may enjoy it as much as those of us who first heard it 40 years ago.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I have not stopped listening to this since I bought it!!! They have great lyrics and great sounds too!!! BUY IT!
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures was the first RUSH cd that I ever purchased. It's tied for #1 as my favorite with Permanent Waves and 2112. The one drawback about this remastered cd, is that when I play this remaster with my original issue, the remastered cd sounds about the same. I don't understand why they remaster cd's if there is no improvement in the sound quality.The remaster is not bad sounding it just isn't any better. As for the quality of the tracks of Moving Pictures every song is a 10 on a scale of 1-10. Even though TOM SAWYER is a great song, I've heard it one too many times on the radio. YYZ is one of the great instrumentals in rock history. I absolutely love THE CAMERA EYE. I love their really long song's like that.I think VITAL SIGNS should have been put out as a single, it's really cool. Of course last but not least RED BARCHETTA, and LIMELIGHT are absolute classics. If your not sure which RUSH cd to start with, I would suggest &quot;MOVING PICTURES&quot;, &quot;PERMANENT WAVES&quot;, or &quot;2112&quot;.
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell, who is one of my favorite nonfiction authors and New Yorker writers, walks over a dangerous line with his latest book.  As always, his book is full of interesting anecdotes which support his primary premise.  But in Blink, unlike his terrific earlier book, The Tipping Point, Gladwell moves from reporting journalist to corporate keynote speaker wannabe.  He's got a central idea and he's going to prove it.  In Tipping Point, he moved from the other direction... he gathered a series of seemingly unrelated incidents and events and brought fascinating clarity to the reader.  It was excellent writing, research, and journalism.  But in Blink, I couldn't help but feel I was simply being sold a clever idea, something that seems terrifically obvious with a catchy name given to it.  I suppose it's somewhat like when Dylan went electric.  Some will like it.  Some will think he sold out.  But I have no doubt, he'll be extremely successful on his dinner circuit.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|***Great Item to Own for Mariah Fans*** <br />Mariah's new CD is out with a bang. There is something for everyone on this CD. Mariah's sounds great and hits all the notes with perfection. One of the only singers these days who sounds as good live as she does on the CD. PLUS she writes most of her songs. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - The first single of the CD, that's hot and fresh with a great video. \\"It's a special occasion, Mimi's emancipation....\\" lyrics prove why this is the first single. The REMIX of this is HOT with Fat Joe, done with a \\"Lean Back\\" edge to it. <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - Second single and one of the most beautiful ballads Mariah has ever made.  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off - A very hip cut, similar to Breakdown with Mariah singing in a uptempo beat. Very catchy hook \\"...shake shake shake it off\\" will make you want to Shake it. <br />        <br />4. Mine Again - Another ballad, very soulful. Great vocals, in a style of My All. <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg - Great song, fantastic beats. Snoop is ever-so cool sounding. Should be a single. <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - A cool, jazzy type of song. Great music, and beutiful words. <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupri - One of the hottest songs on the CD. Uptempo, great to dance to. Nelly delivers some great lines from the hook. <br /> <br />8. One And Only featuring Twista - Hot, Hot, Hot. Mariah and Twista make a great duet in this one. Tounge Twistin Mariah. <br /> <br />9. Circles - Very classic Mariah. Beautiful song where Mariah shows off her range. Nice steppin' tempo. <br /> <br />10. Your Girl - Somewhat similar to Boy from Charmbracelet, but also classis Mariah. <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew - An uptempo ballad. Mariah sings in a soft but powerful way. Great beat. Classic Mariah.  <br /> <br />12. To The Floor featuring Nelly - Produced by the Neptunes. Cool hip beat. Definitely will bring the crowd down at the clubs. <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride - A soft ballad very reminiscent of her Butterfly days. <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - Similar to Subtle Invitation. Beautiful song. The percussion and the chorus, give it a gospel edge. Mariah hits those wonderful high notes. <br /> <br /> <br />***Check out Mariah's beautiful vocals on VH1 at the Save the Music Concert.*** <br />
B00005LMBK|5.0|I'm leaning against the wall of the bathroom wondering if I'm gonna throw up.<br /><br />It's too much.<br /><br />In order to write this little review I tried to grapple with this album, I tried to swallow it whole. I tried to digest it and I hurt myself. This album is too rich and too multidepthed to allow a simple synopsis. It's too complex to digest quickly. There are too many styles and too many layers. This is a dizzying collection of endless experimentation and surgically brilliant production. And it won't stop.<br /><br />It's sheik and smooth like the models on the covers of magazines you don't buy but can't help staring at. It's funny too. It's funny in a covert coy way. Like a kid's tv show that secretly pokes fun at adult themes like sex and politics. It's funny enough to make you laugh. But just as your chest swells for a little cute giggle you catch the charred death scent of a cigarette and you can almost taste the burn of cheap whisky in the back of your throat: That's the dark brooding shadows this album casts as you spin it so idly.<br /><br />And that's why my stomach and mind threaten to rebel (and expel.) How can you devour something with such a range of tastes? You can't eat something salty and sour, spicy and sweat, hot and cold... Maybe a few of these combinations are delectable but the whole array? It'd kill you... you'd choke...<br /><br />Thank god the album doesn't force its schizophrenic characteristics on you all at once.<br /><br />Instead the Gorillaz deliver these tastes in subtle sly hints and nudges. And most people would be utterly ignorant of the Band's brilliance if they did not provide the LP with multiple listens. It requires slow and careful consumption. Take your time. Don't try to stuff your face. You'll hardly know what your eating and surely be left uneasy.<br /><br />Let your mind nibble on the acoustic guitars driving delicately before you tackle the pounding funky bass lines. And only then try to sample the electronic pops and pings.

B0007M22TI|5.0|I first saw Celtic woman on PBS during their pledge. I was blown away by these talented woman who gave wonderful performances throughout the show. I was really touched by Chloe Agnews' performances as she is only 15! The orchestra was completely marvelous with the great arrangments by David Downes. I immediately ordered the DVD and have watched it everyday since I recieved it! I brought it home for my parents to watch and they loved it and are going to purchase some for their friends. If their was such a rating as 20 stars , I would give it to this!!!!1 I'm definately going to see it live this summer in Boston. I can't reccomend it highly enough!!
B00006JDVV|4.0|This is the type of film I take out of my DVD library to watch whenever I'm bored and don't want to watch a movie that requires too much thinking. I do prefer smart movies over mindless action with no plot, but \\"Reign of Fire\\" is an exception to that rule. The story is pretty cool (writing could be better though) and the acting is above average thanks to Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey (I thought he was wildly entertaining here). The best thing about this film is of course the look of the dragons themselves. The CGI creatures are up there with anything ILM has done of late, with the only downside being that they are not shown on screen as often as one might think. So ignore the plot holes (if dragons feed on tons of ash, why chase and eat a few pesky humans running around?) and just enjoy this one for what it is, brainless fun that will achieve what movies are suppose to do...entertain.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah's new CD is out with a bang. There is something for everyone on this CD. Mariah's sounds great and hits all the notes with perfection. One of the only singers these days who sounds as good live as she does on the CD. PLUS she writes most of her songs.  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - The first single of the CD, that's hot and fresh with a great video. \\"It's a special occasion, Mimi's emancipation....\\" lyrics prove why this is the first single. The REMIX of this is HOT with Fat Joe, done with a \\"Lean Back\\" edge to it.  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - Second single and one of the most beautiful ballads Mariah has ever made.  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off - A very hip cut, similar to Breakdown with Mariah singing in a uptempo beat. Very catchy hook \\"...shake shake shake it off\\" will make you want to Shake it.  <br /> <br />4. Mine Again - Another ballad, very soulful. Great vocals, in a style of My All.  <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg - Great song, fantastic beats. Snoop is ever-so cool sounding. Should be a single.  <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - A cool, jazzy type of song. Great music, and beutiful words.  <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupri - One of the hottest songs on the CD. Uptempo, great to dance to. Nelly delivers some great lines from the hook.  <br /> <br />8. One And Only featuring Twista - Hot, Hot, Hot. Mariah and Twista make a great duet in this one. Tounge Twistin Mariah.  <br /> <br />9. Circles - Very classic Mariah. Beautiful song where Mariah shows off her range. Nice steppin' tempo.  <br /> <br />10. Your Girl - Somewhat similar to Boy from Charmbracelet, but also classis Mariah.  <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew - An uptempo ballad. Mariah sings in a soft but powerful way. Great beat. Classic Mariah.  <br /> <br />12. To The Floor featuring Nelly - Produced by the Neptunes. Cool hip beat. Definitely will bring the crowd down at the clubs.  <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride - A soft ballad very reminiscent of her Butterfly days.  <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - Similar to Subtle Invitation. Beautiful song. The percussion and the chorus, give it a gospel edge. Mariah hits those wonderful high notes.  <br /> <br /> <br />***Check out Mariah's beautiful vocals on VH1 at the Save the Music Concert.***
B0007GAERG|5.0|<br />I really must say, this album, though has a different vibe to it, is one of the Best Mariah Carey Albums ever. It's not like her usual in regards to it's style, but the voice has always been there.   <br /> <br />Now i know what all the hype is about.  <br /> <br />5 stars easily <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Well, I don't know who \\"Mimi\\" is, but Mariah's definitely back to show these American Idol hopefuls a few new tricks. I have been a fan of Mariah Carey since the first time I heard Vision of Love and thought it was Whitney Houston. While I didn't like the movie Glitter, I remember spending 20 euros on the soundtrack when I was studying abroad my senior year in college and thinking to myself, \\"What a fun album with some of the best vocal performances I have heard from Mariah!\\" Charmbracelet had a few hidden gems on it but the charms diminish with time, so I am really excited for Mariah this time around, to silence the critics and the haters who obviously don't know what good music should sound like. Here is my track-by-track assessment: <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - in my opinion, this is one of the weaker songs on the CD but a perfect first single for obvious reasons, plus it has good energy and is fun to hear at clubs. <br />2. We Belong Together - I have such a strong personal attachment to this song, so I am really glad it is the 2nd single and I love the way she brings it all home at the end. Very heartfelt. <br />3. Shake It Off - Yes, her cadence is very Usheresque but that's mostly due to JD's involvement. It's a fun song. <br />4. Mine Again - Vocally overpowering, Mariah made this song to prove she can still hold those notes. Very nice to listen to and ponder any lost love. <br />5. Say Somethin' - Since this is the first song I heard from the album, I still love it - the whole futuristic, spacey vibe is cool. Sounds perfect for a Manhattan lounge. <br />6. Stay the Night - The last minute or so of this song sells it completely. Perfect production, perfect vocals, adlibs at the end remind me of a struggling young singer who is trying to get signed. Pure Kanye/Mariah magic. <br />7. Get Your Number - Fun!Fun!Fun! The boasts she throws in are classic Mariah, not some vain attempt at trying to be urban, as stupid critics are saying. <br />8. One and Only -this song had to grow on me but once it did, oh boy. One of her best rap collabos with edgy lyrics. <br />9. Circles - one of the highlights of the album. Another song where the end sells the song completely. She lets you know the voice never left. <br />10. Your Girl - another fun song, short, but sweet. I believe the screaming vocals reflect the earnestness of the lyrics. <br />11. I Wish You Knew - very Alicia Keys, but at the same time, very Mariah. The \\"audience\\" and \\"talking\\" make it more fun. <br />12. To The Floor - the 2nd song I heard so I also have a special place in my heart for it. It's very chill, again, very Manhattan. <br />13. Joy Ride - reminds me of \\"Bliss\\" and \\"Yours\\" but more calming. This song grows on me the more I listen to it.  <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - words can't really describe how I feel about this song. Mariah lets loose at the end and I can hear the conviction in her voice, the pleading, the urgency. This is my favorite song on the cd by far. <br />I think everyone should have this CD in their collection, even if you are not the biggest Mariah fan. It's just good music, period.
B0007GAERG|3.0|This album is above average, but I can't see myself coming back to it a month from now.  This is still considered a comeback album when compared to anything after Butterfly (maybe even Rainbow). <br /> <br />One thing for sure is that this is not the old Mariah.  Just like everything else these days, half of this album is hip hop influenced.  I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, but it would be nice to listen to an album for once these days that wasn't hiphop influenced.  I don't know about you, but I dreadfully miss the type of music made in the 90's.  The Boyz II Men, Whitney, Mariah, etc. of the 90's just sounded so smooth and you could always go back and listen to a good portion of what was made back then.  I still go back to those old albums when the dissapointment of todays music is too much to handle.  We are already halfway into the first decade of 2000, and nothing has stuck out like how it was in the 90's.  When I heard that this was Mariah's comeback album, for a second, I almost thought that this album would have that 90's R&B feel, but no.  This is merely just an improvement over her past couple albums (which shouldn't have been too hard).  Mariah didn't go back to her old style, she merely just improved upon her 2000 style.  So for anyone saying that this is the old Mariah, go listen to Daydream, then listen to Emacipation. <br /> <br />This album is great compared to anything that came out in the R&B world in the past 5 years.  First, it is nice to \\"hear\\" Mariah again.  There are a few ballads that are nice to listen to, nothing that really sticks in my head though.  The uptempo music isn't horrendous, but they can get annoying, It's Like That (being the best of the uptempo songs) has a pretty catchy chorus.  Mine Again is overrated, written to just show that she can still produce her voice. Circles sounds like a remake of a song I can't recall, it's listenable. I Wish You Knew is well written, a filler though. Fly Like a Bird is the best written, creative song on the album. <br /> <br />In order for Mariah to have a TRUE comeback album, she needs to bring back producer Walter Afanaseiff, and work with him on a few songs.  She also has to realize that she is 35, and her roots come from R&B, she does not have to resort to hiphop to sell, she doesn't have to be Beyonce, she should just be the diva she is.   <br /> <br />Buy this album if you're looking for an improvement over Glitter and Charmbracelet.  Don't buy it if you're looking for the 90's Mariah. <br /> <br /> <br />3 stars. <br />Maybe one day she really will have a TRUE comeback album.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|One night when I was about 14, I was staying up late watching HBO as I often did, when a movie came on that captured my imagination, Warriors of the Wind.  At the time, I was not an animation fan outside of the cartoons like The Transformers I stopped watching at around 12, OK 13. <br /> <br />Anyway, at 2 a.m., sitting alone in a dark room, I was drawn into the mind of Master Miyazaki and his amazing vision.  I was completely amazed by the alternate world this story took place in and the characters involved.   <br /> <br />After the movie was over I tried desperatly to find the name of the movie, since I had picked it up after about 15-minutes.  I found it in the HBO guide and proceeded to tell all my friends about the movie.  None of them had ever heard of it. <br /> <br />Up to just a few months ago I continued to mention it whenever the topic of animation came up.  I could never find a copy of the movie and few spoke to had heard of it.  The film always represented this phantom thing that I could share with no one or find out more about.  Until just a few months ago a co-worker, and real anima fan, told me how this movie was a bad redoing of an original creation by Master Miyazaki.  She told me the original name and mentioned it was supposed to be released in its original form.  When it came out, I rushed for my copy.   <br /> <br />Needless to say at 31 I still find the concepts and images of the movie amazing and I can't wait to share it with my young daughter when she is old enough to watch. <br /> <br />Now the movie I always tried to find out more about has a name and sits in its proper place in my video collection.
B000683VI4|5.0|\\"The best love story I have seen in years\\" - Larry King, Larry King Live <br /> <br /> Based on the book by Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook is a compelling love story.  <br />Nick Cassavetes directed the film and the cast includes Gena Rowlands, Sam Shepard, Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, and Meredith Zealy. The story starts out with an older gentleman, Duke (Garner), visiting an older, confused woman (Rowlands) to read a particularly meaningful story. As Duke reads the book, the audience watches the story in a flashback-like manner. Two teenagers, Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams), meet through mutual friends and Noah falls in love instantly. After a little persuasion from Noah and the help of their friends, the two hit it off and fall deeply in love. However, there were many things in the way of their happily ever after ending. Noah worked at the lumber yard at minimum wage while Allie was from an extremely wealthy family. The class difference was noted and not approved of by Allie's parents. In addition, this was Allie's summer home and she was to leave upon fall. Allie was being tutored and expected to attend college. The two were forced to separate at the end of the wonderful summer they spent together. The parents called it a \\"summer romance\\" but the couple knew that it was so much more. Noah wrote to Allie everyday after the family left. Upon hearing no response from Allie after a year of writing, 365 letters, he wrote his last letter, saying goodbye. The two led separate lives for years, during which Allie got engaged to a rich man with whom her parents approve. When a twist in fate brought them into each others lives again, their love is rekindled. This makes Allie have to choose between must true love and status. Through the cinematography and emotions of the actors, the audience is compelled to make a strong emotional attachment to the characters. <br /> <br />I met my boyfriend in high school and we're been together for a few years. We didn'thave the difference in class issue or the parents' disapproval, but we did, and still do, have to deal with college and separation. We are going to different colleges in different states. To deal with the seven to eight hour distance between us, we have had to really work on communication and trust. Therefore, I was able to fully understand the bond that these two characters made and the heartbreak of saying goodbye. It's hard to communicate enough and have enough trust to know that the distance is not going to affect the bond. Like the rekindling of Allie and Noah's love, we try to come home every so often to see each other. The love that the characters found in the movie touches me in a way that makes me understand how and why they did what they did and said what they said. I understand only too much the excitement, the joy, the jealousy, the gut-wrenching pain that they experience. <br /> <br />Allie's in an extremely hard situation when she had to choose between her fianc and Noah. All her life she had worked to please her parents and did everything that they had wanted. But her heart wanted something different. How was she to pick? Her love vs her lifelong \\"norm\\". I felt like I too faced this decision. All my life I was the studious girl that was always made sure that her school work was done and that she made honor roll. So when it came time to go to a college, I could either go to a college that I liked or go to a different college that I didn't feel as great about but my boyfriend applied there, so we would be together. I chose the first option, making the commitment to the academics of the first college and at the same time making a commitment to a long-distance relationship. In some ways, I feel that I still make that decision now when I ponder whether or not to transfer to his school. It's hard and the heart doesn't make it any easier.  <br /> <br />The gripping real-life emotion in The Notebook makes me agree with the positive reviews that it gets. Itis a romantic movie that touches the heart in a manner that no other movie ever has. <br /> <br />WARNING: Make sure plenty of tissues standing nearby. <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|It is unbelievable as to how true this movie is.  Jude Law's character is a depiction of a man's jealousy while Clive Owen's illustrates a man at his breaking point and ability to manipulate.  Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman give exceptional performances as well, showing off the female perspective in a way where they too are viable for everything that occurs in the film.  All in all, the performances are spectacular and the movie draws you in and shows you just how cruel and truthful relationships really are.
B0007GAERG|4.0|There is no doubt that Mariah Carey has one of the most powerful and unique voices in R&B/pop music today. With songs like \\"Hero\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"Vision of Love\\" - she has achieved heights of success that most singers only dream of. But somewhere along the way, something went horribly wrong. Mariah suddenly started wearing daisy dukes, washing cars and getting into cat fights in her videos. Her image suddenly seemed to take a left turn - somewhat reminiscent of an extra in a Dr. Dre video. But what remained is incredible talent in the form of her songwriting abilities and beautiful vocals, both showcased nicely in \\"Emancipation..\\" The lead single \\"It's Like That\\" isn't bad at all, it's catchy, got a great hook and very danceable. It's surprising that this track did not rise in to the Top 10 charts. Perhaps the post-Glitter backlash is not yet over. But it's really in track 2 - \\"We Belong Together\\" that Mariah really shines, and this trend continues in \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Stay the Night,\\" \\"Circles,\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" These songs highlight this woman's raw voice and ability to soar with the right song. Although the hip hop collaborations aren't bad - especially \\"To The Floor\\" with Nelly and \\"Say Somethin'\\" feat. Snoop Dogg, nonetheless, Mariah and her team of producers, image consultants and managers, should be reminded that her true success was always in the power ballad area, and that's where music buyers will always see her roots being. Yes, hip hop has commercial appeal right now, and positioning Mariah for the urban music buyer may not be a bad move. But for this to truly work, Mariah Carey may need to get more \\"crunked\\" (take a few tips from Ciara), and put the frilly dresses away, until she is ready to claim her place as one of the most powerful singers of our time.
0446677450|4.0|This book is indeed very good and useful one. Investments principles of rich people are very good described for anyone to understand. What bothers me is confusing description of average rich man asset investments - as source of his/her income. Mr. Kyosaki for example advices reader to invest in stocks, luring him/her into thinking that this is path to secure gains. Truth is (I am long term trader/instructor) that only tiny percentage of traders earn money by trading stocks. So this is bad (if not dissastrous) advice for 95% of readers population. Another, same goes for company ownership. Over 95% of new companies face bankruptcy. Conclusion is, while his core principes are valid, Mr. Kyosaki advices re. investment vehicles (as foundations of person's future wealth) are elusive and pretty unreal.
B000025XKM|5.0|I'd really love to give a different rating, for Nick you can't. So few bands or musicians or artists of any description can maintain a consistency throughout a career, and though it's doubtful Nick would have never set a foot wrong were he alive today, what he would have done following this masterpiece is fascinating. For me this is his peak, though it is very hard to compare any album with another since they sound as though they were done by three very different versions of Nick. Recurring themes of seasons, time and nature link them, as do the mellow introspection that brings you back and back, but it sounds sometimes that they should have been reversed. This is the sparse one, the low-fi one, the one that launched a thousand bedroom troubadours to write painfully intense and obtuse songs for themselves. An utter classic that seems never to age.
B0007GAERG|5.0|MC, so proud of her, she's bringing back the class again!!  Nobody can sing like Mariah--vocals, instrumentals--it's all in the package, this is her comeback CD no doubt, cop it like it's hot!  Personal faves: We belong together, Stay the Night.
B0000640VN|4.0|\\"Kate and Leopold\\" is everything it tries to be: that is, a romantic comedy cum fantasy rolled  into one. Anyone expecting deep exploration of the time-space continuum or an extended \\"fish out of water\\" story may be disappointed. As other reviewers have noted, this film is a vehicle for Hugh Jackman to shine.  Meg Ryan, I hate to say it, is the movie's only weak link.  Yes, Ryan's character, i.e., a straight-talking 21st century woman in trousers, is much preferred to the dull society ladies in Leopold's 1876, but that is still no reason for him to fall for her. In fact, there is so little chemistry between them that its painful to watch them kiss on screen (the few kisses we do see look like two actors kissing in a movie).  <br /> <br />And who cares that Leopold is an expert on opera that had yet to debut (\\"Penzance\\") or even be written (\\"La Bohme\\")? And who cares that the mode of time travel, i.e., jumping through a rift in the fabric of time that exists somewhere between the girders of the Brooklyn Bridge and the East River below, is laughable? I don't. This movie is as charming as Hugh Jackman's character and the story that writer/director James Mangold deftly weaves together. Liev Schreiber and Breckin Meyer are great in this film as well.    <br />
B000000OU6|5.0|To my opinion, this album is actually better then anything Guns N' Roses has ever done.  I am a true Guns N' Roses fan to my own belief, as I own every single album and appreciate each song entirely.  However, to my opinion Eric Dover is as good, if not better, then Axl Rose at singing.  Unlike in Velvet Revolver (another great band, just not as good) Slash's Snakepit incorporates blues into hard rock, something that Guns N' Roses was the last band to do.  When my father heard this album he thought it sounded like Aerosmith.  That was exactly what Slash was going for.  In this Album Slash is as great as ever, as proven in the blues ballad \\"Niether Can I\\".  In this song as well as \\"Dime Store Rock\\" he incorporates spanish/indian styles in his lead which blew me away when I heard it.  Another great aspect of this album is that Slash proves he can play slide in \\"Beggars and Hangers-On\\".   <br /> <br />A great album, much better then Ain't Life Grant.  I'm sure if they had kept Eric Dover, I would be ranting on and on about that one too.  I don't see why Slash didn't stick with these guys, or at least add more blues into Velvet Revolver.  Buy this album, it is very worth it to listen to Slash's amazing music and guitar style, and Eric Dover's soulful perfectly bluesy voice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Over 1200 reviews, most with positive feedback. Joss Whedon. And the fact that the film, Serenity, will be out in November this year.    This is evidence that this show is so damn good. I'm such a fan of it!    No, it's not like Buffy. I'm glad for this-it would've paled in comparison. This is a show that can't be compared. It's a different kettle of fish. The only comparison buffy shares with firefly is creator, Joss Whedon's notion of the importance of the created family. And that's a good theme to run with.    Being a buffy fan I bought the dvds on a risk. I'd only read one review (which gave it three stars because it \\"isn't enough like Buffy\\"). The show didn't air in australia until months after the dvds were released (and it was treated as badly as Fox here too - with timeslots ranging from 11.30pm-1.30am at night once every three weeks with inconsistent changes) so I bought em as soon as I could. I'm so glad I did. I lent the dvds to a friend and one disc came back cracked so I bought it again and it's a good thing I did cause I still watch the episodes a lot.    When I first sat down to Firefly I liked it but wasn't sure if I'd love it. It was quite fast and I missed a lot of dialogue. But by the end of the pilot I was hooked and watched the entire season in one sitting (missing all my classes I had at uni that day).    The fans seem few and far between but this show has a strong cult following. There's more of us around that I thought. One day I was talking to a friend about firefly and a complete stranger from Canada overheard me and told us she thought the show was excellent.    I'm excited to see the film. The official release date is September 29th but you can probably catch an advanced screening, if it's not sold out.    It's not necessary but worth checking out the series first. So make sure you persist through the speedy start cause it's very rewarding. You won't be disappointed and you can join the masses in protesting the cancelling of the show, eagerly awaiting the film and the possible re-establishment of the show on a better network.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Wow!  I found this cd to be one of Mariah's best since Emotions...She really has rediscovered her vocal power and certainly lets us know it.  Of course any of us who have remained fans since butterfly came out will certainly love this album but also those of you who have kinda turned away from the songbird would really find great joy on returning to her latest work....I promise that this cd will not disappoint even the most distant mariah fans.....Her voice is back and she is freed from the whispering types of songs from recent years and takes us back to why we all fell for her songs long ago.......
B000000OYQ|3.0|\\"Prison Blues\\": Absolute blooooze; very slow, great singing by Chris Farlow with Page doing his usual Page-esque, dirty bends and cramming fills. And the great song \\"The Only One\\", featuring Jason Bonham and Robert Plant on drums and vocals, respectively. <br /> <br />Some can take or leave the other cuts on the album, but bear in mind this 1988 effort featured a theretofore unheard-of collaboration between Page and Plant, and excellent drumming by Bonham's son. Some of you might remember: In the late 80s, this was incredible--nobody thought there'd be a coming-together of these talents again after Zeppelin disbanded.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Great documentary. It shows what we already knew in the rest of the world, but only half of Americans knew (and know) - that Bush has played half of Americans for a fool, and that the war in Iraq was always about oil (not \\"WOMD\\") and taking out the man that made daddy look like fool. Bush's close ties with the Bin Ladens was an eyeopener though. One politician I feel a bit sorry for, who was portrayed as one of Bush's corrupt elite henchmen (ie Dick, Donald, etc), is Colin Powell - he's already expressed regrets over his part in the war, something that Bush and his posse will never do. Also, seeing who the \\"American Soldiers\\" were fighting over in Iraq (young kids/adults similar if not a bit younger than me) put a new perspective on reports of them being killed or injured (this was the first time I've seen footage of injured soldiers out of Iraq). And of course one has to feel sympathy for the innocent Iraqies killed and injured by the military action, and those that have been and are being taken away for no just reason. I would've liked to have seen something on the Gwantanomo (?) Bay prison though.
B000060P79|1.0|...there should be a picture of these guys inthe dictionaary next to GAY.....if i hear perfect or addicted on the radio one more time or if i hear my 11 year old sister sing them ever again i may jsut lose it and shoot up the place. Anyway, this band has nothing. their music has no depth no meaning, just a bunch of annoying pop hooks in order to cash in from the TRL crowd. There is no way these guys actually like the music they make or they may not have dicks. Bands like Simple PLan and rappers like chingy  represent everything that is wrong w/ MTV and mainstream music these days. Anyone that thinks this band has musical talent obviously knows nothing about music and needs to expand their horizon.
B0006J28BO|2.0|I've greatly enjoyed all of the other Ghibli features released by Disney, and am easily persuaded by the name Miyazaki on anything! So, even though Miyazaki was only credited with the &quot;project concept&quot;, I was eager to get this DVD.<br />Well, I don't regret the purchase or the viewing, but I have to say it's much the weakest of the bunch I've viewed. The story line is like a highly simplified and weaker version of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; in several respects, the animation and imagination are not the equal of any of the other features in the group, and character development is not near as deep.<br />Even so, there are some good points. Muta and the Baron are amusing, and actually hint at more depth than does the heroine. Bits of the animation and colors in the picture are pretty good.<br />Overall, not a good introduction to the worlds of Miyazaki. If you want an introduction to his great talent, stick with any one of the other features. If you have seen all of the other available features, and want more, you might find this one worth the price.
B0001Z363W|5.0|If you have never heard Book Of Shadows by Zakk Wylde, then you may be suprised by this album. The two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar, and although I'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion, HM VI contains more. <br /> <br />For example, take 'She Deserves a free ride' and the ballad 'Fear'. The piano on this album is superb, haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another. However, there is just enough of past 'metal' BLS in this album - 'Crazy or High' and 'House Of Doom'. Personal favourites are 'Damage is Done', 'Layne' and 'Queen Of Sorrow'. There is something more in the solo's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out 'Stepping Stone' for an example. The musicianship has got even better on this album, with the dodgy drums on 1919 Eternal Gone, and the bass that was pushed to the background in The Blessed Hellride is up there with Zakk's playing. <br /> <br />This album is deep, moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering Blessed Hellride. Can't wait for the new Mafia CD to be released.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|I just wanted to say that i used to own the original Warriors of the wind and that the new voice actors in \\"Nausicca of the valley of the wind\\" are terrible compaired to the original. There was nothing wrong whatsoever with the original voice actors in \\"Warriors of the wind\\" and now here they go and change them for the worse.I was very upset that I had lost the original to a theft in my home so i ordered \\"Nausicca of the valley of the wind\\" because Amazon.com reffered me to it seeing as how i cant find one with the original \\"Warriors of the wind\\" title. When i recived it and watched it... my jaw dropped at how terrible the new voice acting was , i almost started crying.Despite the terrible actors i think the storyline is still damn good even if the voices over do it every chance they have.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought the CD right after it was released and played it many, many times. Almost drive my wifey nuts ! Let it rest for a while until I saw the most recent Eric Clapton Crossroads DVD, the two DVD set. Young John does a spectacular set with \\"City Love\\".  I quickly found the CD and gained additional respect for this young musical genius. Do yourself a favor, buy it.  And if you like great guitar work, be sure to check out the afore mentioned Eric Clapton Crossroads DVD.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Having a teenaged son, my house is usually full of male teens and all kinds of music. There are times when they play something so repetitely, it soaks through my harried brain and I finally really hear it. So it was with I Remember, Amie, and The Blower's Daughter. The whole cd is wonderful, and addicting. Let's hope Damien Rice sticks around for a long time, and gives us tons more music to enjoy!
B00000IP2L|4.0|I cannot understand why people think that 1919 Eternal is superior to Sonic Brew - this album features all the best riffs, singing and solo's. For example, the epic remake of 'Peddlers Of Death', which starts softly then explodes, or 'The Rose Petalled Garden' with a wailing lead guitar over haunting chords, the catchy 'Batch of Lies'. The rythm on 'Born To Lose' and the lead on 'Low Down' even sounds slightly funky! 'Beneath the Tree' is one of my all time favourite BLS songs - it combines heavy with melody - something not many heavy bands can achieve. Wylde shows off his skills in 'T.A.Z' - proving he is one of the cleanest pickers ever - not a note is out of place, and he's on an acoustic! <br /> <br />The strange, synthed 'Black Pearl' is haunting - and like many of the songs on here just explodes into the trademark riffery and pinched harmonics. 'World Of Trouble' has to be one of Wyldes most catchy choruses and one of his best solo's ever. 'Spoke In The Wheel' is kind of reminiscent of Book Of Shadows and lets the ears recover after the blistering World Of Trouble. The only downside, in my opinion, is the mushy cover of No More Tears - you just cannot touch that classic, but when I have 12 others to listen to who cares? <br /> <br />Some people may find the lyrics questionable on some of the songs (\\"Hey, Hey, You, What You Gonna Do?\\") and the bass on 'Bored To Tears' is slightly annoying after a while - but hey, then you listen to Spoke In The Wheel and Peddlers Of Death and the doubts disappear. The riffs on this album are more catchy, Zakks voice is better and the songs don't sound hastily rushed. Buy it now!
B0007GAERG|5.0|1. It's Like That-When the song begins you hear a clapping and then Jermaine Dupri opening the song. It is hot! The beat is like, WHAT?! I love it! You HAVE to dance to this song. (even though Mariah never even tries to dance in this video!!!) Her vocals are all tooooo amazing!!! This girl is gifted!!! 5/5 <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together-When I first heard this song I didn't like it for some reason, now I love it! The beat is nice and slow and sexy. The lyrics are BEAUtiful!!! Mariah also sings some old songs in this too. She talks about when she is listening to the radio and she sings some heart break songs. The chorus is catchy! I kind of wish it was longer than 3 and a half minutes. The best love song! 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off-It is kind of a bouncing song. You just kind of nod your head to it. Mariah sings fast which is really cool and it sounds great! The chorus again is catchy but I don't know if I can learn the lyrics as fast as I want to. The onlt thing is that it is slightly boring to say the least. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />4. Mine Again-This slow song reminds me of old 90's jams about love. Mariah shows her vocal range very well here. The beat is ok, I was hoping that it was going to be more of a hip hop slow beat but it is more of an old love jam kind of beat. This song will make you go to sleep in a good way. The chorus is soothing due to Mariah blowing the hell out of her vocals, in a good way. Very nice song but again can get boring... 4.5/5 <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg-Why is it that all song that are featuring Snoop are bad but songs that star Snoop are off the chain! This song was obviously produced by The Neptunes. I hate them!!! They always use drums and it is stupid, it isn't what Mariah or anyone else is about nowadays! Then again if she wanted Snoop, she was going to get his record label along with it. Poor Mariah feel into the trap of hiring The Neptunes. Ok the positives are, duh, Mariah's voice and the chorus. Snoop's rap is nice. I like it! Just the production...grrrr. 3/5 <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night-You would think this song would be slow because it is more or less about sex. This song's production was probably by The Neptunes again. It doesn't have drums but it is boring. I love when Mariah say \\"Just let me rock you til the morning liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight!!!\\" That is beautiful. This is one of those songs to tak a joy ride in your car. Mariah's voice saves this song from a bad grade. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupri-This song nice!!! Jermaine's voice is funny though. I haven't heard him on a song in awhile so this is all new to me. Mariah starts strong on this one and it is lovely. I can't tell who produced it though. Sounds like Neptunes but it could be Dupri. Who knows. Another bouncing song but just a little faster than the first bounce song. 4/5 <br /> <br />8. One And Only featuring Twista-The beat on this song reminds me of MANY off her last few albums. This is another song to fall asleep to. Twista's rap is really nice!!! I love him!!! Mariah blows again! Go ahead girl! Twista is the best person she featured on this album. Boring though! 3/5 <br /> <br />9. Circles-Sounds just like Mine Again!!! Which isn't completely a problem with me but it is kind of a disappointment of the production part. Mariah kills it again!!! I could see this song played at a formal or a dance. Very emotional song. 4/5 <br /> <br />10. Your Girl-First lets point out the biggest disappointment on this song. IT IS LESS THAN 3 MINUTES LONG!!! I HATE that! Tracks under 3 minutes should be interludes or skits! This song is 2:46. It's ok though, this song isn't good enough to sit through for any long than 3 minutes. The harmonies are great!!! Mariah might sing her hardest on this one. Another joy ride song. 3/5 <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew-WHAT IS WITH THE OLDIES VIBE?! I don't understand Mariah's obsession with making all of her slow songs, beatless and with a synth. I see somebody listening to this in the bathtub with suds. Then again, that somebody will not be me. She breaks in the middle of to talk....but she talks about good stuff. About wanting somebody so bad and wishing they knew! Good lord there need to be more songs about that! I could dedicate this song to soooo many people. i can sit through this so...3.5/5 <br /> <br />12. To The Floor featuing Nelly-Yes! Back to the faster songs! I like this song. It is a \\"2-Step jam\\" Even though Nelly doesn't rap....he sings...it is still good. Mariah serenades you with high yet sweet vocals towards the end. Nelly is good or this song too. \\"Cuz you and me have bidness we goin' handle herre tonight!\\" See what I mean. Again, another Neptunes production. Drums! It's nice though. 4/5 <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride-Now you know why I was calling alot of those songs, joy ride songs. Lol she actually has a song called Joy Ride. Though it isn't a joy ride song. I see two kinds of scenery to this song. One person is driving slowly through Jersey at 1 in the morning, just jamming. Another is well....having sex. Yep this sounds like a sex song. I mean look at the title, Joy Ride. Sounds like a Joe song though. So hit the sack and bumb to this. 5/5 <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird-Guess what...we are back to the old school jams! Sounds exactly like i Wish you Knew. Exactly! Though it isn't bad. The song subject is just about needing someone to be with as you live life. Not bad. A good album ender. 4/5 <br /> <br />Ok so now is the big part, where we find the grade for Ms. Carey. 82.8! A grade of B-!!! I might just buy this with my own money! Awesome! So I also want to try something new with album rating.  <br />~Want This Doesn't Need  ~What It Does Need <br />1. All of the old 90's type slow songs 1.

B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is just wonderfull ! <br />I love the music ! <br />The voice of John Legend is something else ! <br />The lyrics are just great, with real life aspects, and respect. <br /> <br />Don't hesitate to buy this CD, you won't regret it !!!! <br /> <br />
