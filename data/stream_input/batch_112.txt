B003SU0WE8|5|Been using it for a while and just love it... It holds up well in all weather and doesn't show wear at all..
B00N5PCG4K|5|OMG - we have a fireman in our family and he swears by these!!!!!
B002M4GAP6|5|fit perfectly, look beautiful!
B003UM7B98|4|This thing is nice. Heavy duty. Does what its supposed to do. Only draw back for me, it probably was heavier than I &#34;thought&#34; it would be.
B00SSMHOMY|5|Works as stated, don't understand the cutout for the mirror, seems a little too large
B001AY2WLU|5|perfect
B00DUFC8ZM|4|Works great, a little too big for my 1988 Mercedes 560SEL, but it is made out of quality material. Sheds water very well compared to my expensive Noah Covercraft custom car cover.
B00E1SKWZU|1|The pads and sensor are fine.  The rotors, while they fit on my 2009 BMW 528i, they rub against the dust shields causing an loud annoying noise while driving.  I had to remove them and put the old rotors back on.  The problem is a groove on the back side of the rotors that match a ridge around the dust shield.  The groove on the old rotors is over 1/4 inch wide and allows close tolerance between the rotor and dust shield without touching.  The &#34;Callahan&#34; replacement rotors have a groove on the back side, but it is much narrower causing the rotor to ride against the ridge on the dust shield.  Without removing the dust shields, there is no other corrective action that can be taken to stop the rubbing and noise.  Sent a message to the company yesterday, but haven't heard back yet.
B0024ECD2I|1|Did not fit my unit
B0031I1ZUW|5|Fits over my riding mower--although its a bit large. The fabric is thick enough to last. Has weathered three wind/rain storms with no problems Camo fits in environment where I store the mower
B0091IEVG6|1|I have owned three of these lights and they all have problems' The first one did not survive one fall. The knob holding the battery cover broke. I have two left that work when they want to work and when they do work they are great. The problem I have with these two is they won't stay on. When you are in a boat on a dark night and the light decides it wants to go off, you better have a backup light. Don't buy  one of these lights
B00BJNNNQU|5|great product as expected, will buy again if needed
B00NAVTE9O|5|Solid product, inexpensively replaced OEM mirrors, and arrived well ahead of predicted delivery schedule from China. Very pleased.
B002684PVE|5|Good part delivered on time
B00LNOTM0G|5|The best. Before purchase make sure you have the correct socket (Type 1 or 2) on your vehicle. Very bright. Will buy again. '15 WRX fog lights
B00K971Z1C|5|Better quality than honda originally used.
B00GBBE6CA|5|Good Quality, fit perfect,
B005P29VHQ|5|Excellant light.
B006P37ZQS|5|No issues to assemble on a 2003 BMW 325i sport package. Car looks awesome.
B00H2XLAYI|5|Excellent well built mount<br />My Max 2 fits perfectly
B000SL0R9K|5|Comes with good variety of supplies. Case has enough space for you to add a couple items of your own. I highly suggest adding some painkillers and instant heat or ice-packs.
B00PIL6XX4|3|does the job but feels loose and  floppy.
B00M9BBFSE|5|I have mine hooked up to a RetroSound Model Two in my '60 Chevy and mounted on the bottom of my dash so I can plug in my phone, iPad, iPod or whatever without having to leave either a 3.5 mm audio cable or a spare iPhone cable hooked to the wiring harness at the back of the stereo.  I think it provides better music sound quality than connecting via Bluetooth and playing music that way.  Installation couldn't be easier, just plug it in, drill two properly spaced/sized holes at the bottom of your dashboard, and screw it to the dashboard...
B0007LL0CO|5|Made the repair, was easy to install.<br />Good price
B00OZDLFW0|5|The wiper arm arrived on time and was undamaged.  Replacing the broken wiper arm was easy (remove retaining nut with a 13mm socket wrench).  If you have trouble removing the old wiper arm off the stem (which is mounted on the rear window), use pliers by putting one jaw on the stem and the other jaw under the lip of the wiper arm center hub.  The wiper arm should pop off fairly easily with a small amount of pressure on the pliers. Do not forget to replace the washer nozzle on the stem before installing the wiper arm center hub cover.
B007XTOMYG|5|Worked great!
B00RAIK622|5|Looks great, good adhesion as well.
B009DJKW2K|5|Stopped my car from sputtering AND saved me $100.
B000QFORK8|5|I'm English, so never drive without my leather driving gloves. After two years, they had got a bit lifeless. I tried this stuff and the first application got them better, but not perfect, so a few days later, I did them again. That did the trick. They are now even softer and more supple than they were when they were new.<br />I'm a happy Englishman!
B0067UMDFM|5|Awesome , easy install , works great .<br />And for a fraction of the OeM dealer cost
B003YM6RLW|5|Looked great and the adhesive hold up almost too well! Had a hard time ripping off the old ones on my jeep
B0067UDZGI|5|Good quality product easy to install good bang for the buck. Thks Declan.
B00PA4025E|1|2 years of light use, only a couple of camping outings per year. Functionally it works just fine but... The leaks! Not from any of the seal points but because the body cracks. The first I noticed a smelly wet floor in my toy hauler I found one of the lower corners of the waste tank's base had developed a crack allowing the bodily waste to leak out. I sanded it and fixed it with epoxy glue. Another leak was noticed next time out. It was another crack on the diagonally opposite corner base. Fixed that one too. Then I noticed streaks of blue from the flush water holding tank, the treated water, down from one of the latches that hold the two parts together. Another body crack, this time in the upper section at a corner where the latch hinge slides into the flush tank! Epoxyed that now too. When is it going to end? Ever? Maybe the whole portable toilet needs an epoxy paint job. Not impressed. For the price it should be a little more sturdily made.
B00SXRTE2C|4|They arrive promptly I installed and there was no ignition, took them out and i had to gap them they work and they serve their purpose but I didn't noticed any power increase of any  kind , I still would recommend it but gap all of them before installing.
B000TYVKYM|5|Installed in 5 minutes or less. Looks just like original. Switch works just as advertised.
B006ZVJDCE|5|perfect fit & quality +fast S&H ++++
B0040CWZR0|5|Work great on fuel lines.
B00BQA3VD6|4|I pay this polish before 3 month with nice price now the price is come little up but its very good quality ,, Thank you
B00JGE2PUE|5|perfect
B000C5WCUE|5|Mechanic wanted almost $300 for this part. Got it on here for much cheaper and installed with a friend for free. Works perfectly and the &#34;check engine&#34; light went off so I could pass emissions. Easy to install and the Amazon website used my vehicle information to correctly suggest parts that worked for my car.
B00KXM164Y|5|SO GLAD I bought this.  My check engine light comes on every now and then due to a air intake issue.  My mechanic said the computer was going to keep triggering the light to go off, even though it was fixed, so he recommended me to get one of these.  Now, when the light comes on, I can monitor whether its due to my air intake, or something else that I would have to have my mechanic check.  There is a CD ROM that comes with it that gives you all the codes and what they mean, but I don't use it because I can just google the codes.  I can see the CD ROM being beneficial for people that are more into car customizing or diy mechanics.
B0007LZI8G|5|GR8 item THX
B009NL093U|5|Came in a timely manner. No problems. Looking to buy more.
B007HG7WUQ|5|quick shipping product as advertised.
B000IYR46G|5|fits well and works just as well as the oem,when Installing watch your Tranny cooler ,it is hard to get back in place
B0010G5X6Y|5|they made it very easy to be able to install and replace my OEM window regulator. works just fine as my passenger side I was pleased on the delivery and the way the product was packaged
B00ONGVX4Y|5|Will buy again... Perfect
B00PP7T0Q8|5|Good waterproof connectors. They do what they should - positive click connection and tight waterproof wire entrance as well as connector insulation.
B00J5IOS9C|1|Purchased two of these lamps for researching wide spread complaints from the RV community regarding short life and burnouts.  After two hours operation at rated voltage, the interior became so hot, the solder holding the LED's to the circuit board melted and the LED's began to fall out.<br /><br />Not acceptable.
B00L40ZQGS|1|No, I didn't like it at all. I am returning it. It doesn't work!!!
B001ABL2BE|5|Super fast shipping as always, good well built filter, I def noticed a difference in low end power, as well as on the high end. not a huge gain from just the filter but it woke the truck up quite a bit, then received the airaid mit tube 912-200 yesterday and installed it, the 2 parts together are a great bang for the buck and worth the money, don't hesisitate! Buy the filter and the mit tube together for a greater power increase.
B009S5D6RM|5|fits
B00DZUE05I|1|didn't fit my Hummer H2
B001CQWM8E|1|Mirror glass had fallen out of plastic frame or maybe it comes that way normally...hubby tried to put it back in before mounting and broke it.
B00BIJINF6|5|Just got these to show a little flair to my Subaru.  They are a nice addition.
B00G1YF068|1|These light bulbs shorted out in our trailer tail lights. Returned. New bulbs from Camping World worked perfectly, so we were sure it was the bulbs, not the sockets.
B0024NSLJ8|5|Identical to OEM for a good price
B008BC8EW0|4|They fit good.  The plastic cap that goes over the bolt on the outside doesn't clip in tight enoung.  I will end up gluing it on.
B00UEMH5L6|1|Great if you don't mind waiting forever , don't by from China
B001PPT98S|5|Quality material and it fit my Jeep Wrangler spare tire perfectly. Looks great.
B00IBLNSSQ|5|exactly as advertised
B003ULT3OA|5|Works Well
B000C55X7S|5|Quality replacement part
B003TJY7FS|2|They are bigger than the web information and won't work in the light fixtures
B002OUQI3W|1|It's made out of plastic! It will only keep &#34;honest&#34; people from walking away from your surge protector. I'd return it but it would probably cost me close for what I paid for it, like $20.00. What a rip off, do not buy!!!<br />Mark
B0071I3BGY|5|Great replacement for express box truck!!
B001KYW2XI|5|so easy to use and measures very high temperatures, can easily say 100% excellent product with nice pouch to place it in.
B004NV42PQ|5|This is the exact quality that I expected. I will be able to use this for years to come!
B00KN1T4M6|4|Just a exhaust tip, SUPER loud, I did not know it was going to be that LOUD I put it on  a Ninja 300 to clean up the look and toss the shock crap they had there... have good earbuds with loud music or just some buy ear plugs... I promise you will need them...
B001A0F88I|5|OK
B00BD6T29A|5|as advertised, looks really good on my bike
B00KTJ0D2C|5|I had ordered replacements from another vendor and I could not get them to program.  I received these quickly.  They were packaged appropriately and arrived in perfect condition.  I had no problem programming either remote.  In fact, they were done within a few seconds.  I am so pleased.  I would definitely buy remotes from this seller again.  And I love the fun color choices..............so much better than black!  Great product!
B00BBL3TOG|1|There are a couple of things I do not like. The first being that it doesn't cover the entire bile, it covers down to about 1.5 feet from the ground, and it doesn't even cover the front tire or fender which means my front fender is exposed to sun fading, wind, falling objects and bird poop. Second issue is it can’t be installed when the bike is hot, which means I can’t put it to bed when I get home, I have to try and remember to do it after I shower and eat dinner so often I forget. Lastly, I think it should have a bigger tag or something to let me know where the front is, that way I don't have to keep searching for a little tag. I had planned on returning it but I can use it on my ZX10 which is a much smaller bike. Aside from those issues, it’s a great little cover, and it was delivered as promised, so no I really don’t have a lot of negative things to say about it.
B00KTIU7FG|1|it didnt work
B000GQA8DC|2|It's nice looking with good fit and finish. The size is perfect for me as well. I went to run the center seatbelt thru the fabric loop that is attached to the base to keep it in place and the 2 screws that hold the loop pulled out very easy. I'll need to drill and attach bolts to the fabric loop. Not a big deal, but a little disappointment.
B004AFTDC2|5|The size is what I wanted . I did not have to buy 98 ,in order to get one or two
B0041RPGQ6|5|I got this for my wife and her car.  She loves it and so I am very pleased.
B00B2ATTUE|5|Well made and eliminated front to rear trailer sway.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Perfect
B00E5PK8TE|5|Powerful.  Stronger than HD battery by 50%
B0067F0LX8|3|well its my fault I bought the wrong one, it doesn't fit a can am  RT, and didn't try it out till I needed it on vacation, then it was to late to send it back. other than that it was nice material and would of been ok if I ordered the right one
B0006GF5SK|5|I personally think this stuff is the best way to go using your black water tank for a few days before emptying it
B003CG9QFY|1|Look at the photos. This is somehow suppose to lay flat, except for the fact that it has a pvc liner and won't........I can't believe this even made it out of the factory and sent to me. Just look at it. Returning ASAP. 60 dollars for this quality folks. 60 dollars.<br /><br />Just for those who say it will flatten out when screwed in. It won't, the fabric stitched on the inside of the pvc liner square is smaller and is warping the whole product....
B00CEYRPOE|5|Awesome!
B00REJXVEW|5|Awesome cover! Easy to install, great quality, and $200 cheaper that I could get it locally. Very pleased!
B0022ZJVQ0|4|Love the extra capacity.  This isn't an easy fit.  You will need to fit it to your bike.
B000C3F35W|5|Works great. Better than the Auto Zone clutch its replacing.
B00P7V7VU4|1|This is not for the Acura rsx the holes do not line up for the throttle body and the intake manifold.
B008MRTSB0|3|Fine for mounting in a thin walled dash,but not anything over 1/2&#34; thick.
B00NPIRAUC|5|Good beginner kit, and easy to install. Very happy with the looks and performance.
B003YMALY6|5|Excellent product! Very well made. Gave me enough room to run 33x12.50's on my 73 cj5 and gave it just the width I was looking for.
B0097AA478|3|Bought these and one came broken. Didn't find out the one was broken until after I installed the one. Check item before you install...
B00K1L047C|4|Serve the purpose but the fitment could be better.
B007TYAIIE|5|Great item and no problems with it
B008VPVKH8|4|I installed these on a 1980 CJ-7.  The mounts appear to be good quality, but time will tell.  The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because you have to cut most of the metal bushings to fit in the jeep.  There are no instructions included in the package, so you really have to deduce which ones need to be cut and how much.
B0002MABGE|1|The bars are sharply edged. Not good for pups
B001THQP84|5|Easy for hanging string patio lights and even light airy patio curtains. I'm sure I'll think of more uses for these great little clips and I know where to come get more!!
B004RVDI1G|4|Arrived today, I'll say how satisfied I am with these after installation.
B00J1DIE4G|3|Speaker cut outs do not fit 2015 models. Doesn't provide light sensor cut out. Fits ok on 2015 but not as well as other covers I've ordered in the past.
B0012S9A5U|5|This tool is invaluable when working with automotive exhaust. The tool pays for itself in the first use- rather than spending time and banged up knuckles trying to pry exhaust hooks out of stiff, worn out rubber exhaust hangers, these specially designed pliers push the hangers out with mostly ease (shooting some lubricant on the hanger before had helps immensely).
B009J3L4RM|1|I installed these in my 06 Altima and they worked great for a week then one of them shorted out through the side of the bulb and damaged the socket so I had to replace that as well.. I bought new standard bulbs to put in as I don't trust these any longer.
B00EC7J5CG|5|Awesome lights. They are a little pricey but to me worth it. Super easy to install. Installed on a 2012 brute force.
B00CT30SSU|5|First thing you will notice is that this thing is made to the cost. Some spot where filter media and plastic meets are not perfectly clean like OEM filters.<br /><br />However, filter media is OEM quality and it is glued onto the frame really really well.  I would say other than cosmetic difference it is equal to OEM filter.
B0093E8SRG|5|great no problems
B008N2118C|5|Army it's all branches lol
B0063VBH1G|5|Great looking hat!!
B007Z8VG30|3|Product was first lost in mail had to email seller to recived another then the decal was much smaller then expected all in all not very happy with purchase.
B007TNK0KQ|5|It work fine..thumbs up
B0054QUJ2O|5|i like it!
B006XKISM8|5|Great purchase and now my car looks better with a new trim! The factory trim was old and looked like it was peeling so I really needed that fix, this product was on my wish list for a while due to no reviews, but wow so I regret not getting soon enough YES!! I took the chance and I'm glad I did, it came fast, they sent me plenty of it and with just a very short description on how to put it on after 5 minutes the looked totally changed for good!! Don't wait any more just get it!!
B00GIYFMRI|5|Great quality. Keeps its appearance over long periods of time Nice glossy finish. Very good.
B00E4CQE2I|5|As you put them on, you feel the padding surrounding the inside frame which rests on your face.  Takes a while to get used to.  The first view is very yellow.  The glasses take a little getting used to, but are worth the inexpensive price.
B000BOC2E2|5|stuffs the best
B0002JMLQU|5|i have a 2002 dodge grand caravan. It started to shudder while traveling at freeway speeds.. almost like going over rumble strips.  After doing some research i figured it was the torque converter. So changed out the transmission fluid and added some lubegurd.. completely cured!!.  save yourselft some big shop fees and give it a try with some fresh fluid.
B0002STST4|5|Definitely what I've been wanting to get for awhile to get more organized with all the tools in the garage.
B0006HKU9S|5|Installed on a 5.3L V8. Has a deep tone under acceleration yet you don't have to listen to it at cruising speeds. It's loud enough to be pleasant to hear without being loud enough to get you into trouble.
B0002V4PRG|5|First thing I did was hook this up to my air compressor and start blasting my garage clean. I read somewhere that there was a psi limit, well... I run it at 150 psi just fine.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Works amazingly
B00062ZQ42|5|Used this to cover my water drain line on my washing machine in my garage , rats were chewing through the rubber hose to get the water . This prevents that , its just a sleeve that I used to cover a rubber hose .  Rats gone
B000CIOW54|5|Correct item, suitable for my caddy.
B00BI3RKT2|5|Exact fit and still going. I sure the bearings will last for many miles.
B005JV7VFW|4|I ordered the medium size, but was sent Large size. The fitting was reasonable, so kept it!
B00PCI3MXW|5|Awesome
B00KRQWX7K|5|Thanks!
B00PMXQFE0|5|Super bright, even during the day time. I used these in my side mirror signals and they're just great.
B00DSCZ0U2|5|Follow the included instructions and in 5 minutes you're finished. The quality seems to be the same as original equipment. I can only hope they &#34;hold up&#34;. If you're into saving a couple hundred dollars, buy and install yourself.
B0026M3OXK|2|Had to return...pintle not held firm....
B00BCRMAR6|1|Product rips and is not good material
B000CO9PAK|5|Great price!!!! Smooth ride!!!
B002SSGANI|5|great, strong, easy to assemble.
B008JFA0T4|5|Used this for bringing out the shine out of an old car with dull paint color. I wouldn't use it on coated paint cars though. I also cleaned silver plated items with it and it works great. A bit pricey but works as advertised.
B00JJZ2HD0|5|Perfect
B0077FGWHG|5|Worked good , looks good
B00B7Q3KHQ|5|In installed this unit, a stainless steel braided line, and changed the fluid all at the same time.  The combination solved by clutch problem.  I can't say for certain whether just the new fluid and new line (the old one appeared to be leaking a bit) would have solved the problem without installing the new slave cylinder, but the combo works great.  This unit seems to be comparable quality to the OEM unit I removed, and was of course much less expensive than buying from a dealer.
B000CB6FNS|2|They have failed and were broken, adjustment tab broke off, before I can really give them a shot off-roading
B008B7R5ES|5|Very good quality, A little expensive but you have to pay for the good stuff. Thank you
B000C5SG9A|5|It's what I needed and it worked
B003QLMMDI|5|Used to cover mildew stains on boat seats,  purchased vinyl prep and followed instructions,  sprays evenly,  finish is glossy,  looks 10x better than did before painting.  Time will tell how it holds up.
B0009MD13W|5|These mats are outstanding!<br />They fit in my Jeep perfectly and are extremely durable!<br />I live in MN and there is salt EVERYWHERE and I made the mistake of leaving all the salt junk from my shoes on the floor mats all winter.<br />There were white stains and I thought for sure the carpet was ruined.<br />I took them to a car wash and washed them and they looked brand new again!<br />EXTREMELY DURABLE.
B005VOXHLY|5|Fit my 2007 Mazda 6 perfectly, great replacement.
B004AJCS6G|5|Works fine in a 2006 Honda Odyssey that had a malfunctioning compressor. We got the problem diagnosed by the dealer as part of an A/C recharge service and were amazed that just the parts would cost us upwards of $500. This was a much cheaper and easy fix using our local mechanic and it works as advertised, as far as I can tell, just as well as the OEM compressor.
B007FDO4K2|5|I love them kitchen is pretty
B00L3LIHZ0|5|Deliciously nasty sound with a minimalistic appearance. Sounds like a several hundred $ exhaust at a fraction of the cost. Mechanically inclined install takes less than half an hr.
B00VGL64G6|5|Great product with quick shipping.  Recommend
B000WG952Q|4|I like it
B000E7YP7I|4|Nicely made and doesn't move in my trunk much even with the rubber floor mat I have down.  My stuff was bouncing around in the back so it's nice to have it organized and not getting banged up.  It takes up about 1/4 of the floor of my trunk.
B00OH3OXBI|3|Awesome little light.  Very well built, handy size, LED light lasts a long time and throws a lot of light in either of the two settings.  Great little multipurpose light.  Edited:  It just stopped working today.  Fully charged, indicator shows full charge, even tried charging it.  Unfortunately no matter what you do, it will not illuminate.  Going to contact the manufacturer.  Have dropped it to 3 stars.  Pending the outcome, may drop further.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|I bough almost 25 of this bulbs LOVE ALL OF THEM!!!!<br /><br />very well prices for a quality product like this Sylvania 194 or T10
B0068MTIQG|5|Perfect fit with fast delivery
B0062A7M2G|5|This stuff works as advertised and it looks absolutely great! I have purchased 3 different times and I love it!
B00L2PHAQE|5|Easy to install. Looks great. Good value !!!!
B008DREON6|2|Way too firm and flat. Couldnt get anything into it
B00LCBK4RK|5|Great struts - holding up hood fine easy to install..
B000E8SXE8|2|Good, feels sturdy, but squeaks like crazy and its very annoying, I've tried lubing the shaft in every possible way and its dang relentless with the squeaking. Plus its not the same shock as depicted in the photo. I wont be purchasing this brand no time soon.
B00H87Q28W|2|I don't think it is clear enough to be a window cling for a car.  Can't be read from a distance.
B004I0HIJY|5|awesome
B0049MRJ40|5|its real easy to hook up
B00K6498D0|5|Works Perfectly! These poor reviews almost scared me away but I decided to purchase and am glad I did. I think most of the confusion is from the fact that people don't understand how to install the driver and load the software. Has another reviewer has explained. You must download the CH341SER driver from www.wch.cn. The website is in Chinese but it's not that hard to figure out. So Download the drive and install Vag Com and you'll be good!
B00KIGHFZO|2|Did not stay on very well.
B000NCOKZQ|3|The opening size of the red terminal connector is smaller than the size of the terminal post on my RV.  I was able to cut the ring and spread the metal so it would go on the battery. It will work, but evidently this tender is made for other than RV batteries.
B003ZWHVZW|5|Fit my 99 Nissan Frontier just fine. This one is better built than the handle that was installed.
B00HH3JWOS|5|Nice very nice
B00APXHUU0|5|I love it!!! my husband loved it !!!
B004VS8AFO|4|The reverse bulb covers are two different patterns, but I think it's designed translucent to spread light on passenger side and clear for detail on drivers side. Be aware.
B00NVJ9Y2W|5|Made for a quick repair!  Will order from this supplier again!
B004IKO09K|5|Quality product, the leads are great and the book us really handy.
B00OZT18AS|5|Easy to order and as expected!
B009K4DKLS|2|weak suctiuoin
B00GVNSGE2|5|Great product
B00651C4W0|4|Antenna works as expected.
B004RCRS9I|5|I use this brush on both my cars and RV.  It is very soft and forgiving.  I like the way it gets into tight corners. The only down side is that it is so dense that it takes about two days to dry after use.
B0049YXP5A|5|Works perfect
B00757IGYS|5|Great reception and hoping that this one won't break off when at the car wash!  Much easier to remove for the wash than the factory standard and no loss of signal.  Would buy again.
B000SNBSMI|4|Needed an inexpensive cover for my bike for Sturgis, this one did the trick.  Fits the full dress Road Glide just fine.
B002PUM6MS|5|have not installed them as yet, but should work as they are oem replacements.
B00JW0CJJE|2|Wood ash tray for ten bucks? Wow, that's a good deal!<br /><br />Well, yeah. It's poorly glued wood veneer, over particle board. From 4 feet away, looks really snazzy. Up close, it's clearly junk. Worth $10? Dunno, maybe. I gave it 2 stars because they didn't promise the world, and it does what I bought it for. Just don't expect quality solid wood.
B00AOGDNE0|5|Better quality than Honda used. Did the trick.
B00OU67Z80|5|Very bright light
B004I0HIEO|5|Excellent
B000MD4YKM|3|Overall it's a good grease gun. I concur with the people that had issues getting it off the fittings. It seems like after yanking it off a few it's loosened up and I was lucky not to pull off any fittings in the meantime. If they fixed this it would a 4.5 star product.
B0024B1A3Y|4|Excellent and fit 2004 Toyota Sienna. Four stars because the original one failed at the clutch at 205,000 miles, and at about 100,000 miles the AC stopped cooling and I found that the nut holding the clutch pulley, and the pulley itself, had fallen off on their own. (Murphy's law does not always apply, the pulley landed on the truck (frame) holding the engine underneath the compressor and was rolling fore~aft for 20 miles without falling to the road, miraculously, as it is quite open down there.)
B00KS6GYVA|5|Work like a charm. Held the weight I put in it. Didn't bend or shift. Unit is light enough to easily carry around. The assembly instructions where easy to follow.
B00N32JWE2|5|Exactly as described and arrived on time. Installation was easy.
B00144B9YW|5|Quick Service.  Exact replacement for my application.
B001B0VP3E|5|great item A++++
B001TI5IIQ|5|worked very well made my headlight look good with the sealer together
B00U8NXC4U|5|Clips are just what I expected and the delivery was fast.
B00SDMM3KM|4|Great for freshening up my car. I keep it under the passenger seat.
B000M5W97U|5|Been using these couplers for ages, always good. Instead of buying a couple at a time and paying out the wazoo bulk is the way to go. Plus, you don't have to deal with the bubble packaging. Excellent buy and fast shipping.
B0094BHE50|5|I bought a brand new Kayak before taking a two week vacation from New York to Minnesota and back.  These locks and cables were excellent quality and gave me piece of mind each night when I had to leave the Kayak in a hotel parking lot. I have already recommended them to numerous friends.
B00S6IYK18|1|Great idea, just doesn't work.  Checks out electrically with 20 ohms to ground for each 'filament' but for some reason just doesn't light the light.  Maybe the 'socket' connector is configured not quite right; gotta return them.
B005P54I4Y|5|Nice goggles for my son
B003U6NE1S|4|Fits great, most will have to cut it to fit, but the instructions are great.  I ended up modifying it slightly by using band clamps (wish they were part of this), to make a cleaner install, instead of the c-clamps that crush the pipe.
B0027XZIG4|5|Excellent product, excellent seller
B00ITXB8OW|5|My Honda Aquatrax Wave Runner ran perfect after installing the NGK IMRD-9H spark plugs.
B000C9WJ8K|5|good price
B000C5E00E|5|Fit perfectly.
B00L1Y88FI|1|Not very comfortable wouldn't purchase it again
B00I8OFWU8|2|All parts in photo are not included in the kit.  Photo is misleading.
B00F4DOJD2|5|[[VIDEOID:575d30cf224d2da579dd39fb20d96aa1]]Purchased this DIY Duals for a 2003 Chevy S10 Crew Cab LS.  Everything fit perfectly and sounds amazing.    Product shipped on time and I would definitely recommend :)    Sounds MEAN!!!
B0006JLW5M|5|worked great
B004RHAF3Y|5|fine
B00COQTQ12|1|This product is not of good Quality and is very poor. I don't advise anyone purchasing this product.
B00Q4V9OOM|5|Great sticker and Fantastic Quality!
B008MISF54|5|Have used castrol oil for my motorcycles for years and have never had a problem. I've been using Rs10w40 but saw they had it in 10w50 and thought I'd give it a try in my Triumph T Bird Lt.So far there doesn't seem to be a big difference in the two they both work great
B000GU7G56|5|Easy install, took about 45 minutes start to finish. My Sportster sounds a lot better than with the stock baffles plus with the added back pressure the motor runs smoother and has more power.
B0002NILN8|5|It is a great product but it doesn't keep the heat left out !
B00HLPSBL2|5|I installed it on 2013 JX35 and it fits perfect without drilling.  It looks like a stock piece.  I absolutely love it and I can't say enough.  Quality is top notch.  I installed it by myself and it took me about 4 hours.  Instructions were very not super easy to follow but if you read it twice it should be a piece of cake.  My son can get up and down no problem now.  And the car look so much better<br /><br />Update:  after 2 years of use and abuse.  It still looks and function perfect
B00D9VD36A|5|these are so adorable!
B00ZS2QWJS|4|Works Great
B00VUO3X18|5|Very bright for only 3 LEDs per board.  They are a crisp white color, on the boarder of bluish (I only noticed that they were bluer when I installed interior lights in a different location that are clearly more white).  My only issue is that using these for a vanity mirror light, they are very in-your-face (pun only kind of intended) bright.  It would be nice if the light was dispersed better rather than just emanating directly from those three LEDs.
B00AAI5C4Q|5|The part actually is genuine, verified by my dealer.<br /><br />In the end, it didn't fix my problem (was the electronic control module on my window motor that did) but I'm glad now that my driver door is future proofed. For lack of a better word.
B00Z9U24S2|4|Nice cap but does not fit a taotao 110 quad
B00CS7T0IQ|3|Just didn't come with all the peices
B000AS1XYO|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B00N5ETMOI|5|Amazing lights, I had purchased a cheaper set of LED lights for my reverse lights, they were not very bright, I was gonna give up on LED but then I saw these and said I will try one more and these were the lights I was looking for all along, when I bought them the connectors were on backward (had to flip the wires to the opposite side, 30 second fix). They are extremely bright and I can now see everything behind with ease. Would recommend to anyone looking for led reverse lights, way too bright for interior lights though.
B003WSNZV8|5|just what a old ff/emt what,s on his wwheels
B00XMT9534|4|Love em!
B000EALHHG|5|fantastic!!! cleans EVERYTHING well!!
B00BYFB7KC|5|Like it because it's not too big, & gets the point across!
B005HAYDR4|3|great for the front.  Rears were a pain to instal.  these are good if you need something right away and can't be the price.
B000C9FU4U|5|Makes my E300 mercedes stop quick and quietly
B000LDB41K|5|Very well made.
B00CM5863E|4|Since my car mostly lives in the garage, this type of duster is perfect inside and out for keeping the dust off.  A few minutes 'petting' the car before leaving the house and I'm ready to go.  I only have to wash and wax twice a year now, which saves on paint wear.
B002UCYRZU|5|I used it to clean-up the plexiglass on our Polaris Razor's front and rear windows.<br />It worked as good or better than any other I have used.<br />The spray, #1, works real good for touching up after a wash job.
B000AS1XYO|5|excellent product
B00UEABZU0|5|buy one size bigger and it fits great.
B00O170ATE|5|great to make sure small stuff doesn't fly around the trunk while you drive.
B000CFQEBM|1|This item does not fit the 1973 Cougar XR-7 351 Cleveland motor as advertised. The company contends that their information shows it is the correct part but we have the original motor mounts currently on the car & the bolt holes do not line up at the appropriate height. Also width is too wide for the saddle.
B0050IJKAS|4|Good box for the $, but don't count on the lock ... easy to pry open and also seems to use the same key as I bought 2 of them months apart and both had the same key.  I did take the advice of the other reviewers and mounted with 4 brackets so they are sturdy.
B00CMY2OLK|5|Good quality, paint is holding up real good.
B00029JK32|5|Worked perfect
B0024E6W02|1|Terrible.  One section broke the first time I tried to use it.  The second one broke the next time.  And I'm not eligible for a return because I'm just outside of 30 days on Amazon's return policy.  Total waste of money.
B007V5B7P4|5|Perfect.... good service
B00BSFZQCI|3|not as bright as we hoped, but better than regular little lights.
B00FGSN7I8|4|Nice quality plate but it unfortunately does not fit on the back of my 1990 Mustang. It did work on the front and looks very nice. Great price as I have seen them for more than twice as much elsewhere.
B00KV5FZWM|1|I would LOVE to return this item.  I have no USE for it....  I wished I would have known it was like it is...
B0015BKT5O|4|Fits perfect, but the screws are too small for the original light bar.  Mine arrived in good shape, had a couple scuffs, but was able to polish them off.
B0091DJXV4|5|If you use this once and throw it away it will be worth it, cant believe how cheap it is. I work on ships and cant tell you just how handy it is, the recording feature for video or pics allows you to insert it into reports. Like any tool it has some getting used to but for the price and features its pretty good.<br />More of an occasional use item, if you are a mechanic using this day in and out it may not hold up,<br />fits thru a 1/4&#34; hole, nice bright light in tight spaces, but need a little help in bigger spaces,but its only so big.<br />A great over all deal, came with a carry case even though it said it didnt
B00HFLH5LE|5|Perfect replacement and worked as described
B000COA1ZI|5|I just bought a 2011 Ranger with extremely low mileage, so it's like brand new.  I decided to get the fender flares since it didn't come with them.  The flares fit perfectly.  If you have to cut away trim as I did, don't remove much past your line.  It says 1/4 inch more, but you don't need to remove that much.  The trim bead on the flare will give, and it's better to crowd that a little than have a gap.  Another thing regarding the trim bead.  Dry fit and cut to length first.  It will go on easier the second time, when you're trying to get it installed and adhered to the flare.  Pre drill the indents on the flare with a small bit, makes it easier.  On one hole, I also had to drill into the metal as it kept wanting to go in crooked.  A pilot hole fixed that.
B008VJ9URQ|2|These are good for being seen only, they do not project enough light for highlights, fogs or backup lights.  Good for blinkers, DRL's and accessory lights.  I bought these for tail lights but the brake light/blinkers weren't not much brighter than tail light so I wouldn't trust em.  They fit my front blinkers but they weren't orange and my lenses are clear.
B00ABRFG1U|5|Bought this for my Tacoma and loved it.  Sold my Tacoma but it was a nice feature.
B00LPYYF56|5|These towels make cleaning a lot eaiser than your every day towel.
B0019IB9PM|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B00BSEPX36|4|Bought for a friend Schwinn scooter.He likes them.
B00029JAOG|5|Direct replacement for my old, leaking, blown power valve on my 4150 Holley 750. It's nice to have idle and acceleration restored.
B004HCS4PK|5|The car wax is very good, and my black car after car wax is very bright.
B00FT101VS|5|I used this to replace a very &#34;ghetto&#34; auxiliary setup in my vehicle. After a little drilling and wiring, it looks much cleaner. I haven't had any audio issues, and both ends hold tight. I'm very pleased with this product.
B005T3WZDS|1|Didn't work on my stock fj five stars for Amazon taking return
B00A6AS6LY|5|Good tool to have around
B00BD4SP4A|5|Good
B00BIRO2RQ|5|One of the best packaged products I have received in a long time.  The parts came well protected...no scratches, dings or stuff stuck to the paint.  The build quality of the product is excellent.  Competitive pricing and very fast shipping.  I will absolutely buy products from this manufacturer again.
B00551DZ3S|5|Good product
B004M0WJTE|5|Percent ...  great value
B00YFHU48M|1|Not happy this was a sicker not a magnetic.
B0009IQZFM|5|This was probably the most impressive thing I have ever ordered on Amazon. This dried my entire car in one go with out needing to be wrung out once.<br />Beyond impressed. This cut drying time to a 6th of what it used to take.
B009M6TXLU|4|I love the concept and I shared these on Facebook with everyone but that is as much support as I can give until they are sold at a reasonable price. At $100 USD per truck per use it's much more cost effective to get a set of high quality Made in USA chains that last a lifetime. The thing we all love about zip ties is that they are fast, effective and cheap. Zip Grip Go; at the moment is: fast, has yet to be proven effective in extreme cold, and are not cheap. Unit cost my be $30 but that will only cover 1 and 1/4 tires.
B00881FHEW|1|Bought it to use as an extension on my back up alarm. Was billed as a necessary part for wiring up a truck. The connectors did not fit so I had to purchase a new cord kit to have the installation completed. I sent it back over a week ago but no credit so far
B00GXRFOVE|3|These work well but are very &#34;sticky&#34;. They don't slide over the surface of the glass easily, which leads to lots of elbow grease.
B008QDWGN2|5|Very easy to use
B000CQDKY0|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).  I added a new rear Oxygen Sensor as well, given the 10 years on the original.<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as it is well worth the $$ to have the job done in an hour, and you still come out WAY ahead from having the local muffler shop sell you the material and labor.
B00NAISG6O|1|If they had a zero stars this would defintely get it. Do not waste your money. I had them on my atv helmet for 5 minutes. The plastic around the goggles is so cheap both sides where the strap hooks to broke off. Pieces of garbage.
B000C59YYG|5|While installation on the drivers side of my 2005 Grand Caravan proved to be a bit challenging, these Moog Sway Bar Bushings made such an incredible difference!  They got rid of the infamous &#34;Clunk&#34; that was driving me nuts and this was a great deal.<br />I've used Moog components for 40 years and found that Moog = Quality.
B000CQ6G3W|4|Very nice cover. Way more heavy duty than i thought but, I do recomend buying a set of  ARP bolts.
B008CE070E|5|Awesome
B001HIFLGM|5|Perfect fit, excellent
B012ZQN832|5|It works, just installed it.  If it doesn't last very long I will amend this review .  EDIT ... we are far into the future and it is still working great!!!
B0002STR22|5|good stuff
B0015PK3AG|5|Great tool for newer Toyota engines that have cartridge filters. This filter cup/wrench fits snug over the filter housing and because of its aluminum construction, guarantees years of rugged use. Socket that fits this is a 24mm socket or wrench.
B001EP0GMW|5|great item and fast shipping
B000CESE3E|5|Works great!!!
B00802F2US|5|Work good and shipped fast
B001O0U050|5|Great no noise no fade would purchase again
B00JA3BMDW|3|Let me begin by saying that I have two other infrared thermometers, so I have some basis for comparison.  This thermometer takes a 9v battery, whereas my other two take AAA's.  I find AAA's to be far more practical, and I can use my eneloop rechargeables.  Unfortunately, it seems to be quite hard to find an AAA-powered infrared thermometer with adjustable emissivity on a budget, my other two cost more than this one, and one is not adjustable.  So the 9v battery is a downside, but it is a fair price to pay for the cheap cost of this thermometer.<br /><br />The thermometer itself is made of rather cheap plastic (as expected, and as is the case with virtually every infrared thermometer you'll find other than the professional grade ones), and the handle is a bit narrow for my rather large hands.  The laser is not straight, and compared to my other two thermometers, this one is not very accurate.  It is off by a few degrees at 98C.<br /><br />The screen is easy to read, and readings are updated fairly quickly though there is noticeable lag.<br /><br />I recommend this thermometer only if you are on a very strict budget and need adjustable emissivity.  Otherwise, I'd recommend forgoing the emissivity adjustment, and getting a better quality, fixed emissivity thermometer.<br /><br />One of the other thermometers I have is this one: http://www.amazon.com/Mastercool-52224--Infrared-Thermometer-Laser/dp/B000TM7HXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439464576&sr=8-1&keywords=mastercool+infrared+thermometer<br />Granted, it is quite a bit more expensive, but in my opinion, it is well worth the difference.  The grip is thicker and more comfortable, it takes AAA's, the laser is on target, it updates faster, it comes with a &#34;free&#34; meat thermometer, and more importantly, it is more accurate.
B004JEWLF0|1|Only so so effective
B00MNAALRC|3|Headlights are great! However, just a couple days after installation the brackets and bolts rust.
B004QEQIN4|2|it came to me 1/2 open and i was not able to push it in order to close it. I do not want to install it like that, some how it was not inspected by QC prior of shipment, I will try again and buy one more. so this one is going back….
B0013REXO8|5|Looks great and fits perfectly. Instructions were easy to follow, and arrived within six hours of ordering!
B00ZQ2TRII|5|Very fast shipping. I have ordered 9005 for my DRL and it is almost brighter than my headlight when I turn my high beam on. The quality is good with nice packing. I just connect the light bulbs to the original plugs. No need to connect ballast. I love this kit so far.
B000BW8W7A|5|good parts
B00829OH00|4|Good after stock clutch, recommend for any GT500 Shelby owners
B0009JKI86|5|Excellent product.
B000M5ZWBA|5|Been using this type and style of test light for years. My previous one took a lot of abuse and the cord was tattered so while searching Amazon I saw this and decided to upgrade.
B00BMJJ7UW|5|Installed on my 05 STi. Very simple install, just screw in two screws. The delete feels high quality and looks great... Nice and subtle.
B004IQHZ46|5|Great tool, just what I needed.
B006V7TBBA|5|Awesome American made set of lights.  They are lightweight and constructed well.  I was a PIAA guy but you can beat this set of KC's.
B00RKD0VKE|5|Excellent Product,Easy installation.Instructions are very clear and easy to follow.Looks great on Truck.
B000X1T2DC|5|Very sturdy and seem to be durable. I am very satisfied- I dont understand why some of the reviews are so negative?
B00A16MZO2|4|Worked as expected.
B00IKZTRLA|3|A lot smaller than I expected.
B005O01Q86|5|Arrived quickly and worked as described.  So far no issues.  Including heat and running it thorough a car wash.
B00IN40Y3S|4|quality stickers but could use some spacing between them
B000GZRLW4|5|Item came on time, easy to attach, looks great, l am happy. Peter C.
B0011FLODA|5|Good little adapter
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I wanted a one piece spring fold up sun shade.  It's easier tan two pieces and less room to store.  Quick and easy.  Received it in one day and it fits so perfect.
B00B3UTGEW|5|Matches perfectly to my 2003 Dodge ram.
B001A6CR2W|5|Better than expected. Bought second for brother.
B00HNP91VO|1|It's bright except there moisture inside the lends :( am now its full of water inside :
B004Z1JID0|5|Excellent
B000MPSA82|5|Easy to install. Better wind deflection than stock windscreen.
B000C2Y41C|3|works
B0023VKYAU|2|Works but cover for light came off right away and is dangling around inside.
B0068EQ2PY|5|I purchased this to have on my bike for emergency situations. It arrived last week and I happen to get a screw in my car's tire this week. The shop said it was to close to the sidewall and they could not patch it from the inside. I always carry a tire plug for emergency but if you can get to a shop and have them install a Plug Patch, it is always better. I alway recommend Plug Patches from the inside but they are not always possible. Whether it is because you are stuck on the side of the road or because the shop won't or can't do it. So I have tested it out on my car tire and have put 120 miles and have not lost any air. I even used the air pump just to test as I have a larger pump in my car at all times. It was slow but did the job without issue. For all the people that are having issues please read the direction and follow them. It is a diffrent than the plugs I am use to but once I read the instruction it only took a few minutes to do. Also I have seen a few reviews of people who don't know what they are doing. The reamer is only to clean out debris. It is not a saw, you should not make the hole bigger. I have always worked on my Vehicles, all my Friends and Family's Vehicles.
B00BG6IJA0|2|Does not really have enough range and the contact with the car is too small it is way too much pressure to put on a concentrated spot.  Be sure to put a stable piece of wood or metal to disperse the pressure
B007CLNIZY|5|This was super easy to install, once I had the right tools.
B00D29P5CO|4|Great value. Fit nice and do not slip. Easy to install and good quality.
B0007TF766|1|Horrible product!! The glue did not hold the box together! Tried everything
B000UOFBQO|5|Worked fine, time will tell if it holds up, but even if it lasts a few years the price it right.
B000A3I7IY|5|Comfortable, doesn't slip, easy to find
B000RMQJO2|5|Great stuff. Oil disappears under my leaky Beetle.
B00SQX3JOC|5|Really awesome lights!!
B009TAMVSQ|5|Work well!
B00PF4B3UM|5|Great item. Will buy from again
B00WZX9UN8|5|Pleased with product and delivery time. Do recommend.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Seems to be waterproof, unfortunately we had to open it in the rain so water did get inside.  Holds up well to the bugs and its thick so it should last awhile.  The straps hold it down well and only had to be tightened once between cali and nebraska.  We did use it inside a roof rack so that added extra stability.  The zippers close very easy and the velcro was easy to close for the waterproofing.  It fit well on our 2007 tahoe.
B00N3446NC|5|Received crossbars  2 days after placing order and in perfect condition.  Read some reviewers comments about stripped screws and not fitting properly.  After installing I can not figure out why those comments were made.  Easy installation as long as one reads and follows the directions, which are clearly diagrammed and understandable. No noticeable wind noise at normal driving speeds.  Great looking crossbars and at a bargain price.  One additional feature is when you hit the critical speed these crossbars are so aerodynamic they actually act as wings and lift the tires off the road; thereby reducing tire wear. :).
B002692308|5|Good item and fit fairly well
B0010DSUR6|5|right part right price good quality name brand.
B00JG3OIFU|5|I can't say for sure whether or not it's the exact same formula as its predecessor. I find that it does clean and protect fairly well, but my wife swears it doesn't work the same. So....
B004DRPFNI|5|excelente!!
B00IHK4AW4|5|Great stuff. We use it in our boat water tanks to keep the rotten egg smell out of the water.
B003TEOQ0Y|5|Happy
B00FGXEMIW|5|Works to power anything by replacing the factory switches or blanks.
B00O4BY4YY|4|It looks great. It was easy to put on. Now all I need to do is test the durability of the product.
B00DM2SK50|5|Installed very easily, but realize that some customization may be required. I had to buy longer hex bolts because I mounted my Kawell to my front rack bar. The provided bolts were too short to work, but very inexpensive modification. They throw a TON of bright white light straight ahead where my headlights can't go. It's a rock solid unit and waterproof. Hooking it up was very easy and it works great, but you will need a relay and wiring harness, which Kawell provides here on Amazon. I got the single harness since I only wanted one front light bar. But get the double if you're mounting one on the rear of your ATV/UTV.
B00O83N0WA|5|received on time and fit
B00UZ0OHIQ|5|After 2 months using it, I can say that I am quite happy with it. I'm seeing some improvement in my gas mileage (I go 6 work days between fillups instead of 5, with a work day being around 40 miles round trip) because of how I'm being prompted to drive. Occasionally, It's TOO sensitive about when it wants to stop a trip - a few times it started a new trip when I was stopped at a stop light, but new firmware may have fixed the problem, I haven't seen it in a while. My wife wants one for her SUV next!
B000IZ3OH8|5|Does and fits like an oil filter is supposed to!
B007ZGKKMA|5|Excelent product
B00853KY8C|5|Exactly as described
B002J837PG|5|you get a super shine top it off with yellow wax by pro
B003YCZ1F0|5|I got this to replace the broken boom mic on my boyfriend's Sena.  He likes it better than the original.  We love our Senas.
B009W89EAI|5|EXACT PART I NEEDED
B00IEO9PMI|4|Pain in the butt to put on but looks nice when it's done. Downside is that there was no hole for the arm rest so we had to make one.
B00ID1FW7O|4|Could use a little more power - but does the trick for me.
B00CA2XD64|5|Well made Hat!
B004ZSBMHS|5|Cool piece on display in my ws6.
B000CGPML4|5|Prefect
B00F47Z2J8|4|Very simple installation. Find a place to mount the ballasts then it's as simple as plug an play. The only problem I encountered was the plug clip was on the wrong side, if you connected it the way the locking clip would clip into the power supply plug the lights wouldn't work, so as a guess I switched the plug and it worked.....
B000C9SR90|5|Fit my 85 Trans Am perfectly. In and out with little fuss, and made my car run great again.
B00BITJBP2|1|Did not work for me.  My truck is a 2005 Tacoma, V6.  After three weeks I had to remove two of these and put the old coil back in.  It became very difficult to start the truck, and when it did it would not run for more than a few seconds.  After replacing number's 3 & 4 the truck started and runs now.  I still feel it missing so I will have to replace one coil at a time until I fine the one that is causing a miss-fire.
B00LQW3COW|5|This is a well made mini starter complete with all the needed attachments in a neat carrying case. What sold me on it was after your car is started you would be able to drive a short distance, perhaps into a garage. That was an important feature for my wife. We haven't needed it to use it to start anything to date.
B001R5PFZC|5|Worked  and still working!
B00F2OOI52|5|Excelent product of quality
B005G6J3EM|5|great as always.
B00RZTD4H0|5|I leave Crossfit everyday a sweaty mess. Now my seat is protected and I don't have to fight with a towel that always falls down and leaks through. Easy on and easy off!
B000BZI150|2|Does NOT fit pre-cat (upstream) position on my 1996 Ram 1500 3.9l 6-cyl., even though application info said it does.  No way on earth the lead on this sensor could reach the factory connector. Lead on this sensor is only 6&#34; long, and the upstream O2 sensor for my truck needs a 12&#34; lead. Item was returned, and and O2 sensor with a 12&#34; lead was ordered. Typically, Amazon return was easy, but the lead length needs to be included in the item description. It was not.
B00L2T5XIC|5|Awesome piece. I have 1 in each of my Trans Ams.
B00B29UGMU|5|Fit perfect
B00BFPZ4H8|1|Very bulky the neck coverage is thick if it riding in cold weather all the time perfect but very bulky and heavy  to be a skid lid who's known for thinner helmets I was disappointed
B002T1OKLS|4|works
B005HL4I46|4|Should come with adjustable cheek pads the stock ones are real thick and uncomfortable as the push my face into a distorted grimace.
B00B3UTGEW|5|Matched perfectly
B00W8ATJ7K|5|Much heavier than what you can find in the stores, and bigger.  Good heavy ribs on them so you can wipe off a lot of stuff from the &#34;tire tread&#34; boot soles, and they clean well with just the garden hose.  Heavy that the wind won't disturb it. Have not yet had it thru a winter to see how it will hold up in our Northern New England sub zero winters.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great for my 2014 ford escape. Found the code that was causing my check engine light to be on.
B00CTUS30I|1|its says it fit 2005 volvo s40, no it did not, its a lie, i had to pay customs over 100 % to clear it, and it did not even fit my vehicle, why did they do that, and i had bought 2, what a waste of time and monies, now i have to seek to buy the right ones,
B00KMBEMZG|5|Great price and fast shipping.
B00BEYDGPC|4|Bought these some time back (along with a Red Wings steering wheel cover) to decorate my wife's car with her favorite hockey team's logo. I've been pleased with the mats. Granted, my wife isn't exactly stomping on her car mats with mud-caked workboots every day... but they've held up to what little abuse they have faced.<br /><br />When she got a new car and we were switching the accessories over to the new car, it was hard not to notice that the mats were still in really good shape (even if they could stand a cleaning).
B00EAOIHQ6|1|Do not fit 2015 sentra, it is to larg..
B000BH5MAA|1|There was no wrench included I should get a $10.00 refund. box says made in USA item says made in china. unit seems to work OK with MY WRENCH. Will see how well it holds up.
B00802GIW4|5|Look great. Had a bulb burn out from it flickering before I got the resistor for my truck and they overnighted me one at no cost. Highly recommend. Fyi 2014 santa fe and up need some headlight tweaking to make them work. Also need the warning cancler to work correctly.
B002GZD8JM|5|Nice set of lights used them on my golf cart,look great at night .thankyou
B00AZA34U8|5|Great product at much less cost than Lexus charges.
B00J39UQX0|3|Should be ok. Nothing spectacular!
B00HE6CI58|5|Very bright. Fits perfect in my Hyundai Sonata with sunroof.
B000EDUUHQ|5|i love it...as expected
B0018NI4LA|5|i love it...as expected
B000GZTIAM|5|High quality parts; delivered on time; very satisfied and customer service I thought were very nice and polite when ask any questions definitely will order again.
B00ERIA8XU|5|I'm not a star war fan, but my brother is! He loves this decal and applying it was easy and on perfection. Just follow the instruction and you'll have a smile on your face after you're done. Wonderful quality.
B007EA6R0Q|5|Solid rack.  Built like a tank.  Easy to install.  With 2 adult and 3 kids bikes we are able to tilt down to access truck in Toyota Sienna.  It is a 2 person op to do this with all the bikes loaded on.  Narrow bars on ends are great for kids bikes.
B000GARJRQ|4|This was a perfect replacement part for my fridge.
B000C7W3OW|5|Great  fitment
B002FUR5FG|5|My car sounds  and accelerates  so much better
B00H7JWKBY|5|Love my auto emblem. It sets me apart from others with an Masonic emblems. It shows who I am with
B00ITEZH5C|5|Winning
B000EQS2WI|5|Finally our AC is working like new on our 1998 Astro van. The Hi setting only worked when it felt like it as the connector had burnt a bit. To fix things, we installed a new fan blower, resistor and this connector and so far it's working well. We also had our mechanic install all new vacuum hoses, Schraeder valve and coolant. We're keeping our fingers crossed and enjoying driving our old Astro again.
B00AXQ8G7U|5|The decal came fast and very easy to install. The seller I bought from is alextechstore. Will be buying more in the future
B00EDQYK8K|5|Looks and works like the original.
B00E9E95UO|1|Quality product. Crappy install hardware. Screws broke had to buy new ones
B0042Z0E6E|5|Love it
B00B3VTESE|5|Great, is a genuine replacement part and snaps right into place.
B00829HSP6|5|Really Good!  I recommend.
B000BZI16O|5|Excellent! Perfect Fit on my 92 MB 300CE
B003TTYUHS|1|Leaks all over!  With the cap snug as tight as possible (yes, it has the washer) fuel spill out. I've own many fuel jugs and this one is garbage!
B00SLKGK1Y|1|My understanding was the compressor came with the clutch.  There was no clutch attached.  I am in the process of determining what or who is at fault.  It isn't worth a dime without the clutch...
B003BGYWUE|5|Works very well.
B007IPORCW|4|Good reasonable part.
B000CSSR96|5|Pretty good cover, so far no issues with it. It fits well on my Honda Civic 2014.
B000EQPBLS|5|The parts arrive exactly as described in the site
B00TBHXC4E|5|Great vinyl protection for all your cleaning, sparkling needs!  Really makes your car or boat POP and shine like new, easy to apply and not too messy.
B002O3DFS0|5|hubby loved it
B004Z75I24|5|yep, it's the right fluid for the job. I don't know how to rate this.
B00UEMH5L6|5|I love this product!!! Looks amazing on my Jeep and super easy to put on.
B00CTVN3DY|3|The sun screen doesn't quite fit the car I have correctly
B002YK9L6S|4|I have used this several times now and it works great. You may want to trim the plastic tube as in my opinion, it is way to long. While this item is not necessary when changing oil, it really makes it cleaner and keeps oil from spilling everywhere when you remove the filter cover. I use this on my son's 2006 GTI. If you are thinking about doing your own oil, you will want to buy a filter socket as well as these types of filters are not easy to remove without it.
B007CX6DWW|4|These wheel covers match the Toyota originals well. The weld on one ring spring did not hold ( the wire ring used to create pressure against the wheel was broken) so I had to use one from the original remaining wheel cover. My son is happy with the look of the new wheel covers.
B007Q8LVL6|5|Very nice, fits real good thanks
B00KOQE9CK|3|Ordered on Friday and got them the next Wednesday, FAST service. When I  opened the box I was a little disappointed with how cheaply the covers were made. They did go on very easily and fit nicely under 22 inch rims.  Once they were on and I put the wheels and tires back on they did look good.
B00FFGXBDC|5|Looks great in my front window.  Sticks on super and is easily removed to center correctly
B002ZNXX7C|5|Excellent addition to my JBL receiver.
B00D8DIHOC|1|Returned
B007TYPTCO|1|Blower rubs on the inside of housing does not fit Toyota truck
B0002JMLS8|5|This is pretty much the only WD40-type of light lubricant oil I use anymore, even over the silicone products. The main reason why is it's synthetic nature which doesn't cause it to gum up. An unlike silicone products, which wear off in short order, this product keeps lubricating. Believe me, I've tried them all, even the stuff the pros and the military use: TriFlow, Breakfree CLP, CorrosionX, all those Teflon products - Bah!<br /><br />One problem I had with a small razor I use to trim hair was it would freeze up and stop working periodically due to gumming up of the lubricant such as WD40. Because it operated off three AA batteries, it had no power to break up the gum deposits, particularly when the batteries run low. I was about to give up on the razor and dump it for a new one until I tried this lubricant. So far it frees up the blades on the razor and keep it running fine. I daresay this is the closest thing to a miracle lubricant that I've seen. I can understand why it's recommended for components in automatic transmissions, which is why I bought it in the first place.
B007F2I13E|2|Some serious logistical problems here! Package arrived in a cardboard box that was very poorly sealed and one end was split wide open for almost 2 feet. The long metal crossbars were covered with rust. Bags holding smaller hardware were split open and contents were running around loose in the box, It's a wonder that none of these fell out of the split in the box. The so-called 8X11&#34; instruction sheet was crumpled and torn and poked with holes so badly that it was almost totally useless.<br />The long metal top bars had jagged metal ridges on the ends that required a lot of filing to remove them and make the bars safe to handle. The clamping plates that gripped the top edges of the car also had these jagged metal edges that required a lot of filing to assure the safety of the car's paint where they attached. Even after getting rid of these jagged edges, I had to coat the clamping parts of these plates with Tressostar's bicycle handlebar tape to further protect the car's paint at the mount clampinging points. Also had to trim the very rough edges of the rubber mounting foot pads and glue them to the plastic uprights to get them to stay on.<br /><br />Helpful hint: To complete assembly of these 2 racks, after installation of the end tabs that grab the roof, it is extremely helpful to manually and carefully bend them down and in to the point that they have to be manually spread a bit to get them to go around the roof edges of the car. They really need a good spring action to get them to successfully clamp onto the car.<br /><br />Also, FYI: My car is a 2006 Toyota Camry 4 door and after making all necessary adjustments, this rack fits it perfectly and nice and tight. I have NO fear of it coming loose or sliding off under load stress or highway speeds!<br /><br />The real shame of all of these problems is that this rack is of a great and useful design, at least to me. After I corrected all of these problems, this rack is a really useful accessory.
B0083H4SMI|4|Worked great
B00AW6SHNO|1|Battery was dead. I don't have a small enough screwdriver to take the battery case off.
B00SUTHIVM|5|Made well .. High Quality material,  made to last !!
B00ITXV3H4|2|The sticker is significantly smaller than what's shown in the picture. I was expecting to use it in my Macbook Pro 13 inch, but doesn't fit right.
B004L0365G|1|i bought some Blazer C539R LED Double Bullseye Clearance and Side Marker Light - Red i received the product and time was promised i started to install lights i found 2 of the light are amber and the covers are red i wasn`t too happy with the order.
B004A6I3OK|5|It fit just right
B0076CXWVY|5|Went on with no problems.  Love the decal
B00ZY1M1RK|5|Love it
B005U30IJ0|5|all ok
B00HQZB0YW|4|Great looking floor mats. Thinner than expected. Locking clip popped out on drivers side but was able to get it back in.  Overall very happy with these mats
B00CMOUV7O|5|I've Driven for about 500 miles and no squeaks.  The stopping power is noticeably superior to the GMC stock brakes.  I would recommend if anyone is looking for better stopping power when towing or carrying heavy loads on their Yukon.
B00K7JMWWS|5|Installed on a fz 09 2015. Didn't  have to cut the bike.
B006N9820M|5|Parts were as described and was delivered on time.
B0052FRUW4|1|Beaware.in the ad product is mentioned as tan..but it's not.I gave it to my mechanic without checking it out paid .50$ to put it one.turns out to be very light yeloish.that look stupid on my door.material is cheap.customer service is terrible
B000A3I284|5|Very nice and the quality is better than I expected.
B0019I0AU2|5|Great stuff! Put on my 2010 Corolla and what a difference! Quiet and great stopping power. Very smooth. No more grinding noise as witnessed  with the OEM toyota brakes with still 3mm of material left. Buy these and drive happy!
B008IE2VR0|5|Bought these to paste together into one 3D Anchor to use as a decoration on my daughters under the sea birthday cake. Looks awesome! Would look cute on a car too if that's why you were buying it. Would also make a great &#34;sticker&#34; for a locker, binder, front of a journal, photo album etc. If you stuck them to magnetic sheets they would make awesome magnets!
B0002U1TUS|5|After having great results with Mothers Reflections Tire Care, I decided to try out their Protectant for the interior trim and my tonneau cover. Unlike other protectants that have some sort of fuel-like smell to it, the Mothers brand also shares a pleasant, almost spice-like aroma to it which is nice considering that it's being used both inside and outside of the vehicle. It sprays on clear, and doesn't dry up quickly - so with only 2-3 sprays I can already wipe down half of my truck's tonneau cover. On the same note it isn't sticky or oily, and within a few minutes it is no longer &#34;wet&#34;. It brings some life back into dull plastic, without having a &#34;wet look&#34; gloss. Just like the Tire Care, the protectant don't seem to pick up dust and dirt like other protectants I've tried. After using this and the Reflections Tire Care, I'm going to continue trying other Mothers products.
B00QYBJ992|4|It felt better than the seat.  I did get pretty painful eventually, but I did ride for 4 hours almost non-stop!
B00RBDF5XQ|4|Works good so far. It has a blue illuminating light inside so you will need a switch or you can wire it to the ignition system. The only con would be that the waterproof covers fall out easily.
B00Z89I2OY|5|A simple, high quality grab handle. Very well made. Just as good as the bigger brands.
B008M4R5OU|4|Fast shipping and great price. Bought for a friend in need. He says it is working great, but it was kind of  difficult to install.
B000BZDOSE|1|Defective garbage, cheap plastic it broke when installing. This kind clips into slots in column, well the plastic wasn't strong enough to make that connection. Shoulda just bought from auto store that sells A grade items
B000YE12WC|3|Did not fit for what I needed it for.
B003Y323NC|5|Husband loves it! Thanks
B00P67GSRG|4|great product!  V32 isn't as aggressive a cut as Chemical Guys claim.  However, no dust, very easy to work and smells great!  Cleanest paint correction I've done!  Meguiar's M105 and M205 went in the trash. Not that m105 and m205 are bad products.  They're just extremely messy and dust everything.  I experienced absolutely no dust with any of the V line polishes.  Very happy with my purchase.
B00V7T76QE|5|I get a kick out of people laughing at this sticker on my car! Love it!
B0001L0DFA|5|This is a super nozzle built well and long lasting if you don't leave it out in the snow
B000CPCL50|1|didn't fit as described. Turns out there are 2 sizes not stated
B004J27VIE|3|Only a 3 Star right now. I will have to touch back on this. Currently on military orders for schooling, got two more weeks and I'll touch back.<br /><br />I installed the gauge, it powers on and lights up. When it starts up, it seems to do a self test; however, I tested it with the meyhanol pump test switch and the gauge didn't read. When I get back, I'm going to check, but I'm pretty sure all my connections are solid and good. May ha e to send it in for a replacement, but I won't know until I get back home.
B001O47UFE|5|Works perfectly, exactly what our Onan generator needed, and at a great price, thanks!
B0002NYE3O|5|Great pads 1
B001FBGX2W|3|All the hardware was missing, had to order nuts to fit. Cost me an extra $10. Nice blocks and u-bolts otherwise.
B003L31RK0|5|Best filter on the market
B000P0ZJIS|1|The one star review is for having recommended this product as a replacement of a specific product search. I'm sure the tool works great for the intended vehicles, but had to be modified for the vehicle I was using it on. Having searched for bluepoint 317 brought up the lisle option. Doesn't come close
B000BGM240|5|Identical to Majestic RV OEM
B0016IDV9M|5|Based on reviews, bought this for my 2004 trailblazer. A/C would only blow out of defrost and floor vents. Had my husband do the repair and within few hours, dash vents work like they should!
B0063CU57W|4|It really does fit.  Once I figured it out, it was easy.
B007EDT47G|4|Good gloves but pricey.  The Union Jack print is cool and the  &#34;soiled&#34; look grows on you.  A seam pulled apart on the webbing between the thumb and forefinger - don't adjust the fit by pulling on the webbing.  Overall, I like them and they are my go-to gloves.
B000JZD95Y|5|good price
B008HZOMJK|1|Not for Toyota Echo 2001!
B00CKZN316|5|Perfect !
B001KRFPAW|3|I'm a little disappointed with this product as it is labeled &#34;professional grade&#34; but showed up only partially coated and already had rust spots on it. As annoying as that is they installed fine and work as expected so it's still a good product. But, if aesthetics are important to you you should look for something else.
B005NLQAHS|5|Awsome product did what it was supposed to and more
B002U6IL9O|3|On low setting, keeps seat nicely comfortable on winter days. On high settings you may fry your ... well you know what. Difficult installation.
B00JBGAR9I|5|Love it.
B00U27IZPS|1|Much smaller than the original not as advertised.
B006LJ94WY|1|Item did not fit broke during installation.
B00XULVDHK|5|These shades work perfectly! I just wish they were larger but they are sticking to the windows well and providing shade to my two dogs who travel with me to Seattle on a regular basis.
B00FMCQSJS|4|Perfect
B000CITK8S|5|It was perfect for keeping the car battery from running down during long periods of nonuse,
B00M250FNI|5|These work and look exactly as expected. Bright and Red.
B00QGJGP5I|4|Sturdy construction.  I will order more for friends and family..
B00029CYRG|5|One step as advertised.  Great product that works quickly
B00A6AS6LY|5|This is a great product!!  Does the job well, you can see light through the wall so you can see whats going on from the driver seat to make sure all air bubbles come out or if you are using it to check for a blown head gasket you can still see the bubbles.  Also, if replacing a head gasket or water pump that requires you to drain the motor of coolant, remove the thermostat and add coolant directly into the intake manifold where the thermostat sits to greatly accelerate the air bubbles purging, this way the motor will have most of the air removed already as it is very hard on your motor and water pump to operate without coolant.  Connections are included and I've connected to GM vehicles (darn 3800 Series II) and an 87 Ram.
B0057PFJW2|5|Shipped fast.<br />They did not fit over the head rest on a kia forte. Had to cut a couple holes to make it fit. Looks great.
B009XIW1P2|5|Probably not the parts fault I think I ordered the wrong part# but I made it work. Loops nice
B004I11QNC|2|this Light does not match or PERFORM Well , it Blinks faster , not in Sinc as the Original one
B00KQNYEIK|4|Worked just fine
B0000AZ6WB|5|works great better than the rope that was on it when i bought the boat
B000C9SR90|1|did not fit
B009POPKDE|5|Excelent product...! Write perfect and smoth..! It came at time. And the details of mustang are perfect and good quality...!
B00BFDIVQ6|5|Arrived jus in time..wrkd jus.perfect thnks..
B008VUFIG2|5|works great!
B0038P9ML2|5|I was totally surprised how fast this tire was delivered, ordered on Sunday, received on Tuesday. I used it on a trip fron Oklahoma to California to Arizona to ride the New Mexico back trails and back to Oklahoma on a loaded up BMW1200GS. It made quite a bit of noise at 75 mph, but was stable. Unfortunately I didn't lower the air pressure for the one mile of dirt I found myself on and a deep sandy wheel rut dumpted me hurting my knee and I didn't get much use of it on trails. 3000 miles took over half it's tread on highways, much better than I had expected.
B00L84EKI0|5|This is a far better tool than the stamped steel filter wrenches. Because it also grabs the tabs on the filter housing, there is no chance it could slip and round off the soft aluminum corners of the filter housing.  If you have a Toyota or Lexus and do your own service, this is the tool to buy.
B00S75GGZS|1|This cover stinks it don't fit it was a waist of good money
B000C1ZJ94|3|Fine
B00AOGDNE0|1|Reading others reviews, it seems to be inconsistent what you order and what you get.  Similar to another user, mine came without the cuts.  It was just a solid piece of whatever material.  Also, it seemed to be very little room to fully wrap around the armest.<br /><br />I tried to look for online instructions to figure out how to put this thing on myself.  But the fact that this material was not big enough and no cuts provided, it made it difficult to figure it out.  I sloppily stapled this on top of my previous armest and it looks ok for now.<br /><br />I am not happy with this experience and so 1 star it is.
B001763SRI|1|I had a difficult time getting the disk to adhere to the dash and when I finally did my TomTom would not adhere to the disk
B00HXCIKC8|5|nice specifically fit my needs
B008L3572Y|5|Perfect, exactly what I expected.  Thank you.
B0079GPYR2|5|Useful for much more than removing hoses, great set to have in the garage.
B00S4HFNXK|4|Works well for my needs.  We have a small 14 foot fishing boat and an aluminum dock and we were just looking for a little protection when bringing the boat in.  These are very good dock bumpers for our purposes and do the job we are asking of it.  The only bad thing is that mine did not come with the straps pictured, which I would guess was because I got a free reviewer set.  I needed to rig some straps from some other nylon strapping I had laying around.<br /><br />I do think these work a little better than the rounded bumpers we had looked at, because I am able to adjust their placement well. Although again, we are talking a 14 foot lund so it is not a whole lot of weight to be tossed around in waves.  We only use them when coming into dock and end up pulling our boat out of the water.  Not sure that I would depend on them for must protection in high waves.
B002JBDH26|5|Excellent! My tailgate is a lot easier to open now since installation. A+++
B003D4O9DY|2|It fell off after having its  professionally  done!
B005YP2Y9G|5|Works great
B001JT1JZG|5|Ok
B006ZLDDPM|5|Exactly what it looks like. Well made and holds both valve covers and 8mm wires securely. I'll buy this for my next project too.
B00P2D41DW|5|With these stop light bulbs, drivers at your back may see more quickly your action on the brakes
B00B6U5JYA|5|very nice fit
B001447KCM|5|Well made.  Folds easily and stores in a 16ft no frills fishing boat.
B0068FZH8G|3|Cheaply made and left gaps! But looks good.
B008G3KA8A|5|What I expected.  Highly recommend this product and vendor.
B00BM9LXRW|4|These are a little baggier than I would have liked but they were easy to install and covered the grungy armrests like that are supposed to.
B00X9CUH22|4|So far I like it and is what it said it would be
B004IVGA0G|5|I used this on the 4th of July and I loved flying my flag high off of my trailer hitch. It was sturdy and fit a range of of pipes for flag poles. The paderborn coating wad hard to scratch and held up very well.
B00C5TEJJC|5|i love it...as expected
B000WEPI4M|5|As expected
B000C57YNY|5|TWO REQUIRED PER CAR (unless you are just replacing one side). Smooth installation, much better implementation than stock.
B00FHB44FO|1|Very thin, not your typical license plate frame. The colors are nice but if you're looking for a sturdy plastic frame, this is not it. It's going back.
B00296BA84|5|Dupli-Color paints have been on my rotors for 20+ years on 6 different vehicles.  They hold up well.  This was my first time using their spray paint, it worked out well!  Just be sure to use brake parts cleaner to degrease, mask everything and then apply multiple coats (3 or more).
B0017KEOHC|5|works great
B000C2UI1W|5|I originally gave the vendor a poor review do to the package being lost in transit, not the vendors fault!  They performed as needed, the package arrived in good condition and it is exactly as described and is what I needed, thank you
B010MVGWTY|4|Fits and looks great
B000FQ2796|5|Our jeep wouldn't open the defroster vent! This inexpensive piece took care of it.
B008N8ILQG|5|This tow helped save someone's life in a rip tide! It's awesome!
B0040CTYAQ|2|Cheap quality. I just had half of them snap off during a road trip - half of them in my driver's side door panel. It's rattling in the breeze now; the other day when I opened the door, there were 3 of the plastic heads from these laying there in the door well. *sigh* Too many bumpy roads, I guess...
B005WTPC1Q|5|Very easy to install, good performance.
B00F7H0NV2|1|Very disappointed in this. It's a low quality copy on sticker paper. There's no way I'd put this on my new car, will just get my daughter to send one from the NEX.
B00LM563SA|5|very good
B002MYLB1Y|5|Works as Advertised! Very handy and rugged. I feel comfortable using this with my tie-downs!
B00DT7S73I|4|I ordered an XL and they fit in the legs but the belt wouldn't get tight enough I had to have 3 more holes put in and they fit fine now , waiting for cooler weather to wear them. I tried on a pair at a local place and a large was too tight , so when I ordered these I ordered the XL and they'll do fine over jeans. So if you wear a L order an XL and have extra holes put in.I'm glad I read the other reviews too.
B005C2ABOQ|5|This is a cam buckle, it does exactly what it is designed to do and it does it well. I got this to use to hold steps onto a tree for hunting. It works awesome, fits a 1&#34; strap perfectly. Cams over securely and I can do it without making any noise, unlike a ratchet strap. 20 or 30 feet up a tree I feel secure using it.
B007HRTSBG|5|i love it...as expected
B000CSWCAG|3|I read somewhere this was supposed to be a balm you set and it goes off in your car like a bug balm.  This is just a small spray can that I could have purchased at Wally world for HALF THE PRICE!  I could have bought two of these for the same price there.
B007HRUSHY|5|i love it...as expected
B0067UD5M2|5|i have a 81 rabbit pickup with a 1.6 liter non turbo diesel motor in it. I have had this in for a month or so now, its been fine and was easy to install.
B001LA1ABG|5|Was what I expected
B000GV9COS|5|This was the only way to get my rebuilt motorcycle engine to map correctly, according to several mechanics.  And now, it purrs like a fat kitten.  Expensive but way cheaper than a new bike.
B008KWLE1Y|5|OEM Replacement works as should
B0041DX7ZM|5|Ok, ordered this on Monday.  Wife was leaving for work when she discovered her drivers side window wouldn't roll up.  She parked the van and stole...err borrowed my jeep to get to work.  I youtube'd a video on how to R^2 the window regulator and started taking the door apart.  The old one came out fairly easy.  The part arrived on Wednesday at around 4:30 pm.  I had it installed in the door within 20 minutes out of the box.  Amazing design by Honda?  Some guy who knows a guy who works for Honda...maybe?  Anyhow...be careful putting the door panel back in, lots of stuff to consider, wiring bundles, heated seat connector, speaker housing grommets, etc.  took me a few tries, but I got it all back together.  I recommend this and doing it yourself if you have an issue with your window rolling up or down.
B00GMSVZ3K|1|Only the brake can't
B000BPWREG|4|Very nice wire holder, but suggest getting new plug wires, and cut them to fit with the new wire holder.
B0042Z0XWY|4|Looks nice. A bit small. Arrived fast.
B000YE6SVM|1|Ordered 2 hubs, they came separately, and both where the wrong brand. Had to return both items.
B0072I2FNI|1|I got this starter from Caltric Starter off the Amazon.com web page. The starter locked up on the second time trying to crank up the Sea-Doo. After sending in a request to have the bad starter replaced Caltric spent a hole five min. to send back an e-mail stating the warranty was only good for two months. The web page the starter was on stated a one year warranty. Wonder what happen to that warranty. I place no blame on Amazon but I did learn my lesson. I will never buy any auto or sports equipment parts from a web site again. I guess I could use the locked up starter for a weight in the Gulf of Mexico.
B00M1K7X5C|1|These were pretty impressive when i first installed them a few days ago.<br /><br />Long story short a tree branch hit one of them and cracked the casing.<br /><br />I took it apart to glue the case back together and discovered the 35 watt balast inside.<br /><br />These would have gotten 5 stars but i dont like being lied to. And the way everything is just jammed into the casing makes me really question the quality.
B00D9W4I5E|5|Really whimsical.
B003YMVOWO|5|worked as expected
B00K7935KQ|5|Have these on my sonic, simple and easy to install. I painted the screws I had black for a nice consistent look.
B00BYWXWL2|3|Works well
B00TPZO476|5|Sturdily made. Nicely finished metals.
B00N4M95XO|5|I was immediately amazed at the brightness of the light compared to the OEM incandescent bulbs. I can now find items at night in the dark interior of the truck. Glad I upgraded.
B00AFZQIIS|5|Fast shipping. Hopefully it's gonna work good.
B00AFQUDQK|3|Fits nice.
B000C55X96|5|Quality replacement part
B000BZL08A|2|never a good buy for toyota cars
B001PNB4AG|5|Exactly what i wanted good price.
B00TX3UXD4|5|works great, smells great!  Lots of suds that last on 100 degree sunny day.  Rinsed and dried beautifully and didn't remove my wax like Meguiar's Classic Gold.  In fact, my jug of Meg's is on its way to the local garbage processing plant.
B0009TCRB2|5|just as advertised.. great trailer ball and good price
B007G83T16|5|Being able to lift my car so much higher than I could with my previous Craftsman jack, makes getting my car up on tall stands, SO MUCH EASIER and QUICKER!  It's a HUGE time-saver, that more than justifies the higher initial purchase price.
B008HZK4NI|5|Good OE replacement pad for the rear of my 06 Mustang GT.  I drive it hard and the brakes have had no issues.  Hardly any dust what so ever.  I would not track these pads, but for daily driving, I recommend.  Kit comes with hardware and &#34;disc brake quiet&#34;  Everything you need besides the tools to do the job.
B0019BSGTQ|4|fit pretty well. was of good but not great quality. But definitely a good value. a great mod if you have a old plethora shift boot.
B00E1SNYZ0|1|Rotors were Warped after 2 weeks causing vibration in front end. Had to skin them<br />Disappointed with quality of product. Will not buy again
B0036GGFV8|5|Seems to be very well made.
B004C443R6|1|The stitching is inconsistent to the point where it cuts into my hand in between my forefinger and thumb knuckle on my left hand but is comfortable on the right.  One hand is sewn so that I can't open it all the way.  These hurt to wear despite being the right size in most areas on one or the other hand.  I will be throwing these away and would not purchase them again.
B003BJP1LA|5|Had to replace the hose that came with my 3/4&#34; impact. Same hose, just the orginal got a welding BB burn hole in it. Other than that it both hoses work great. So much easier to plug a whip like this to a big hose than trying to plug the big hose onto the impact. The hose allows more flexibly when reaching into deep wheels or those hard to reach places. The hose adds very little weight, not that one would notice on a 3/4&#34; drive impact.
B001I7CK8O|5|Really quiets the ride with the roof open<br /><br /> even at highway speeds !!
B001HC1BMG|5|love it
B00L7E80IW|3|These do not seem to be the good quality tissues that I have received in the past. Bags were open and sandwiched together poorly with plastic wrap and tape. Some of the wrap/tape was stuck to tissues. Normally they come in the Halsa wrapper, not sure these are really same tissue that was advertised. Would not order again.
B000ALDYJI|5|Great product!!
B001T4SK2Q|4|No wrecks yet, but product appears to be well designed and made and lends confidence while riding.
B006TMOF86|5|wonderful purchase priced right
B000JERUC8|5|Great product and work's just as expected and great seller also.
B001J8PWZA|5|Excellent cover
B001EYDSZK|2|Works great,easy to install on pontoon.About $50.00 over priced I think but wanted something to fill out the last gauge hole in dash.Vary disappointed that it is back lit in red(hate red dash lights)when the rest of my gauges are back lit in blueish white.
B00W6IZWH0|1|Didn't fit my truck correctly as description indicated. Within first week I lost one shade that fell off while driving-- the double sided tape stayed on my vehicle, but the visor came unstuck from the tape.
B007TG7HXG|4|Easy to install. Great water movement. The connector cover looks great over the u holder but is kind of large if your using it in a smaller windshield like I did (Mini Cooper).
B00HR26TOU|3|I had no issues installing the lights, I did look up a video on YouTube on how to do it which helped figure out how to open everything but otherwise it would have been easy. I had no fitment issues and all bulbs work. The light is hinting towards blue more than white but I love it. No issues installing in my 2015 WRX. After a few months the two license plate bulbs began to fail, one completely and another has at least one of the LED bulbs flickering therefore I cannot recommend these for the license plate as it appears the longer time these remain turned on may reduce their life, also the reason for my lower rating.
B00BI78OL6|5|Perfect.  GREAT value
B00EC2CG9U|5|My 6 year old gal loves it. Fits 2 Barbie doll figures. Comes with seat belts too.
B00UHD4HJA|4|Decent variety of stickers, just not very high quality. I wish they were vinyl, but they'll work.
B00OSMKNE4|4|Seems like it will work as well as any basic alum fairlead.  Would have been nice to get the mounting bolts, even for a couple extra bucks.  i did not notice it did not come included since the previous one I had did. Oh well. The finish is nice and smooth.
B008CFC6UW|5|This bumper was a perfect match of the original at half the cost of the dealer part. It took less than 3 hours to install it and I have the expert advice and help of my oldest son, who is a fan of mechanics.
B00RY7YKRQ|5|awesome!!! great finish!! got in the mail fast!!!
B00P1MLT02|3|They are OK, I thought they would be a little more heavy duty, but these where so light and plastic was thin. But you get what you pay for. Works OK for temporary.
B006BDGDXI|5|Bought them cheap, got them programmed for cheap...I am happy with my purchase
B004HZKZ7M|5|Easy to install. Great, as expected.
B000CHTB10|5|Quality product that improved the light output of my headlights and made the front end of the car look great.
B000CSGT2S|5|Exact fit and works like it should.
B00OVBBU7Q|5|Received it in 5 days , all the way from Canada , which was quite impressive.<br />As for the product itself , I am very pleased , feels really strong , nice welds , nice powder coat.<br />installed in about 40 minutes of taking my time , fit was perfect , no bending whatsoever ,exactly what I was looking for , they sit close to front as possible , they seem to be a solid support for the soft bags I got.<br />This was also a great deal , as rear racks alone are 120$ and up and this was an additional 50$ for the rear in this combo.<br />excellent value for the money !<br />One thing to mention and I do hope they change it , the hex bolts supplied are SAE , I will find the right metric which won't cost me more than a couple a bucks , but worth mentioning , one less socket to worry about . The allen head bolts are metric though.
B00XULVDHK|5|Easy cling, wife over them.
B00VX07PPO|5|Good
B00GSAUHB8|5|I love this sunshade.  It really works!
B006GLA8TA|5|Excellent addition...easy to install.
B002XLHUQG|5|Everything I was looking for and more!  I was originally looking for something to reduce the rocking and swaying in our 28ft travel trailer. These seem to be of pretty good quality and with the added use of the stabilizer jacks, they have completely eliminated all movement in the RV. The spacing between tires is about 7 inches. These fit perfect with room for even further spacing. Well worth the money!
B009A0Q6WC|5|Kool!
B00077XO4U|3|The function of the product is as I expected, but the fit left something to be desired.  I had to cut the mat to properly fit around the rear seat mounts.  I certainly did not expect this from &#34;custom&#34; floor mats.
B00UXUXUZE|5|Good for the 'ol TDI
B00K7666BO|5|Arrived as described sooner than expected. No complaints.
B00EECXAY8|5|Works as it is supposed to.
B00GLXHM6K|1|The lenses unstuck very easily
B00SQH12RE|5|Worked as advertised. Would buy again.
B0098SX2GY|5|Looks beautiful on CR-V. Got it installed from the dealer.<br />It makes it easy for young ones to get in and out of the car.
B00XZ9NSRU|2|kinda cheap looking, didn't come with DIY instructions.
B0118LXJXY|5|Clutch cable worked perfectly, and was the perfect length for my pitbike. A+
B00PCE7LBU|5|Awesome look, easy install.  Looks like its factory installed.
B004VPRZL2|5|Love it! Got it for my 2012 scion tc, and I do notice a little deeper sound with acceleration, a smidge more power, and it makes a nice little whistle sound (subtle). Only thing I would say is getting it on to the intake manifold can be a hassle, but there's some decent videos online for step by step
B0076BTLMO|5|2015 ESO.  It over laps the sides by 1 inch.  Fits perfect to me.  Durable.
B003E6J93Q|5|Gift for my grand sons 4-wheeler
B0024EC9I6|5|AAA
B00BG3G5FO|5|Purchased Product on January 3, 2015. I installed it in my 2008 Yaris myself, without issue. It was a simple install and can be done in 30-60 minutes. It is smooth and quiet. I have had it over 6 month and it work flawlessly. For most people 6 months is not a long term review but I have diven the car 25k with this new Fan and have not had any issues. I see some people complaining it did not last long. If you replace the Fan yourself, make sure you remove the whole housing and clean it. My old Fan was making noise as the bearing went bad. This cause there to be metal dust all in the housing. You must clean this out or your new motor will suck it up and the motor will burn up prematurely. I also installed a K&N cabin Air filter at the same time. it is worth the couple of extra bucks.
B001O6S6A0|5|Awesome look, light weight, and very strong.  Made great replacements for the originals and for perfectly on my bike
B00UWQECUG|5|Tend to shake a little when the bike really reving, but they work fine at a coast and stay where you put them unless you bump them. They are high rather than wide stance on the handlebars.
B00D9W4I5E|5|great quality and size
B006QH54WU|5|Great product worked as exected.  Very fast shipping.
B000EDUUG2|3|Cute, stores small, ez to operate, it's just a royal pain to do
B00N6DBXG8|5|Wow! These are so bright and use so little power. They installed easily and give off a crisp bright LED color light. They work very well as daytime running lights.
B000WJAVQ2|4|Made it so I was able to use my riding boots on my drz. But I ad to put the shifter and bend it in a vise so it would not rub on my case
B000G2AOU8|5|High quality system, way better than spray bomb stuff.  Looks great and levels out nice, even on rough castings.
B0080B3GW0|5|Exactly what I needed and for a reasonable price.
B0026121YE|5|Good quality at a very good price.
B00CJA0QM6|4|Works great
B0063MI7KE|5|Great looking lights, one thing to note the lights are actually upside down vs the stock lights so you have to adjust the wireharness.
B00075XCEO|5|Fit great easy to install very quick shipping.
B00DHPSLL0|5|Bought this for my son's Birthday....it fits perfectly
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Very well made and fits perfect on my seat.  Plenty of storage for day trips.
B00GKTZAHS|4|Good for the price. Just printed vinyl though. They are not reflective. Size is perfect
B000C57YQQ|5|There are two of these in the package. Just to make it very clear.
B000GVH20E|5|I really like this bag.  Especially considering the price.
B00CG674GY|5|Fantastic item ------ use to have an analog that was off all of the time.
B011SPPXQQ|5|Very satisfied with overall experience with this product. The delivery was quick and the quality and duration of the air freshener is amazing.<br />The smell is not too strong and invasive, and its design is very fancy looking
B0049HEJFW|5|Happy
B000MK5M7E|1|It is so impractical and no instalations directions
B006ZGKZ9E|5|Perfect for easy clean mats.
B004AIHKT2|5|Fit and fixed my issue.  Good fit - Make sure you have some Lithium Grease - note in box says to lube the matching component.
B0002MSY72|5|did the job
B00429NKWK|5|It worked great. Only issue was the 30 minute claim because it's all about the prep and following the directions. Note: I trickle fed fresh water from the hose during sanding which made it easier to see the progress. I also replaced the wet tape with fresh, dry tape before I applied the clear coat. I'd get it again
B00REQ26Y6|5|Fit my 2003 S10 Crew Cab perfectly.<br /><br />Work good, look nice.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
B00PXO85DW|5|It fits in my 2015 lincoln navigator windshield. I'm ready for winter comes.
B009DJU5U4|5|worked great... easy to install.
B00OTDL378|1|Poor quality save your money
B00UXY567K|5|Great and just as described
B000E347PW|5|Worked perfect
B00LH9UNF0|5|Good product, easy install.just make sure you have the extra deep socket that it calls for,before you start. It definitely helps. I put this on a 2001 and like it so much that I am going to put one on my newer truck before there are any issues .
B001KSG3Q6|5|Great sellers the buy was perfect
B002R1ZWXA|5|Very good, it was just what I was expecting.
B003V927H6|4|Had to modify one of the bumper brackets slightly for it to fit, might just be my truck, but otherwise easy to install.  One of the supports was bent slightly when it came in, probably from shipping, but was easy to bend straight, so I didn't worry about returning it.  Packaging could be a little better though.  Overall it fits and works as expected.
B000F5ECRM|5|Tool fit perfect on crankshaft and timing cover dowel. I would purchase again from Amazon based on feedback because I need to know if a tool works or not. 2001 F250, 5.4L
B00M3NEBMK|5|Very cool.  Total ninja look, if you like that sort of thing.  LOL  My daughter loved it.
B00VACDLZS|5|They fit my renagade perfect
B004FNPOV8|5|One doesn't work
B0067DOFUK|5|Very good quality leather.Zippers on the pockets, snap buttons on the front of the vest all works fine.Good heavy vest.
B00RNCJ1G2|5|love it / makes the pool feel more like the beach
B00AR4RCXW|5|Great tool, does everything you need to diagnose  most all automotive wiring problems.
B005F2WK56|5|It fit, goes in easily and it works well.  Shortly after I bought one for the driver's side window, the passenger side window went out.  So I bought another assembly.  It does the job well for not much money compared to a dealer install.
B0041WOEYG|5|Great
B0079JWMME|5|WORKS
B00D1418KI|5|I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  My opinions are my own.<br />We have old car tires that are on their way out.  We are waiting for enough money to get new tires.  Having this tire pump keeps these old tires filled and lets us know how full they are as it pumps.  It will also save us money cause a few of the closer gas stations also charge money to fill tires.  On our other car, the tires have a long way to go before they need to be replaced, but once in a while the air pressure needs to go back up a bit.  Especially in changing temperatures.  But having this ready in the trunk makes it easy to do ourselves.  I plug it into the car's lighter outlet, connect the hose to the tire plug, turn it on and let it do its thing.  It takes a little bit longer than filling them at a gas station but not too much longer.  It is worth waiting the extra minute or two.<br />It can also come in handy during an emergency, or when we need to pump any other air pressure tires.  Even something as small as a dolly wheel that's a little flat gets filled and ready for moving furniture or appliances.  And if you get your tires from a place that fills them with nitrogen, don't use this on them unless you want to use oxygen over nitrogen in your tires.
B002XL2IEA|5|Bought this to connect to my air compressor to blow out my sprinklers.  Used two seasons so far and works great!  Bought another for my brother.
B000S2ZPXW|5|Sturdy but flexible windbreaker that redirects airflow over the leading edge of the hood and in so doing helps prevent to some degree impact with the windshield. Easy to install with supplied 3M Adhesive Tape and/or 4 sheet metal screws and plastic washers also included. Enough tape is provided to secure it without using the screws if desired. No vibration or increase in noise levels noted after driving 70-80 mph on the highway. Very well made and thoroughly protects that high wear area of the hood most vulnerable to airborne projectiles. Would buy this again!!!!
B00XV8UH7Y|5|Fit good shipped fast and look great
B0051T46G4|4|Way better then the emergency ones and don't take up much more space.  Worth the extra money for the thicker poncho.
B00OAC1A26|4|Good
B00SRF68QU|4|5 min install.  Feels good, tho it feels like it would probably bend if severely stomped on...don't use as crash brace, stay on the brake.  Also reset my clock as other user noted, but didn't mess with FM or Sat Presets.  Recommend.  2010 JK Sahara.
B00OB5GMH0|5|Excellent
B00HHNL1AQ|5|Perfect fit. Durability is yet to be determined but looks well built.
B000CO7ARU|5|I got exactly what I ordered when it said it would come.  No problems! I used it for my 1999 Toyota Corolla with no problems.
B00AWLO7NI|2|This tail light lasted about 7 months. The turn signal stopped working and the assembly was causing the problem. The light assembly was not purchased from this vendor so I don't know if this light assembly is exactly as the one I purchased from Movementauto on Amazon last year.
B001GS99OS|5|Fits perfectly on the truck, looks great. Arrived in a timely manner in good condition even thought the box was in two parts, the tape didnt hold the two ends together.
B0007OWD2M|5|This stuff is the best for cleaning automotive windows! You don't have to worry about getting over spray or dripping onto the dash or other trim of the car.  It wipes very easily along with no haze and you don't have to buff with an additional cloth.
B00SCXCQV8|5|They Work Great!!
B00KGHLHOA|3|One of my screws scriped about 4 months in.
B00515NHQS|5|Packaged great, shipped fast, OEM so already gapped.
B00WKUGZNY|5|tight fit, a plus.
B000GZGQHU|4|The shocks and provided accessories look to be of good quality. My '03 Yukon XL no longer feels like a boat on choppy waters. The directions are lacking but there's lots of video tutorials out there.<br /><br />On the down side, they shipped two different colors - one gray and one white. Not a deal breaker as you can barely see them behind my tires.
B000AM8BLI|5|Worked as the dual-filament brake light bulb on my 2000 Toyota Camry.  Went in nice and easy.
B00T5BGAUO|4|Note, the actual item has a different knob than pictured. However, the unit seems well-made and functions beautifully.
B004HCM9H4|5|the best there is along with the clay kit!
B000CNAWBW|4|They are great.
B004YGRCMA|5|Great product for a great price. Must do business with
B0058OU904|4|It was shipped quickly and is as listed. Great product.
B000OO2O6U|5|works great
B00KCQSOAA|3|Head liner had a hole sewed up ok but ok over all.
B0057W1VB8|5|Looks great
B001VFZNSM|5|I've been putting a few chrome accessories on my GMC Yukon, these really stand out ! The fit was perfect, the quality really shows
B00U9TAVZQ|2|I give it a 2 because it looks cool. It never really smelled in my car but i may not have used it correctly.
B002YKRXY0|1|Very misleading ad!!!!! What the hell !!!! I thought I would get a set of pins. The picture is misleading also.
B000B8JUG6|4|It works very well on OE rads but on aftermarket rads it may leak if you overtighten it.
B0052FRT2A|5|PRICE! Totally compatible. Last just as long as the OEM ones for $25! Buy a package because they always break on my 1999 Corolla.
B00480GZ9I|5|Good bulbs.
B00H6XPZN6|5|Great shades. Keeps sun out.
B00UNAMY10|4|Great product and fast shipping, missing installation instructions on how to remove and install robber bushing off the old windshield.  It was ease but it would make it better if it was noted in the instructions. It’s a perfect fit and it looks great on my bike.
B003DNH4BO|3|I have a Kia Rio 2010. Does not quite fit the whole car is a bit short, so can slip back up in mild wind, when it gets wet takes a very long time to dry.
B004K35WLK|5|Great protection for your key fob, good grip too!
B006CRI76Y|5|The product as advertised fit perfectly and was simple to install.
B0013THZ3M|5|Best plug on the market  my mower running like a champ again
B000K3EV0W|5|Excellent value excellent price
B01092IEEM|5|Excellent product, fit good, look good, just what I needed!
B004IS39PS|5|I run this stuff in my 79 Chevy C-10, so far I've noticed easier starting and the carburetor is running cleaner. Great product!
B00O9G8RO2|3|Racks are very sturdy. had a lot of trouble with 2 plastic covers not fitting correctly at the pegs. Advan emotion was quick to send new ones. Also the threading on one of the screws was stripped and had to have that replaced. Again Advan Emotion sent a new one right away. The product manufacturer must not be QCing the product very well.
B000FPXV5G|3|Looks great it my 94 cherokee! But the actual part that holds the cups is very small, like it really can only hold a 12 oz can safely. If your gonna put like a gas station drink in it, it's way to small
B00HJEGQQ2|2|I was really excited about putting LEDs in my tail lights but these are really disappointing. They aren't even as bright as the halogen bulbs I took out. LEDs are on the right and halogens are on the left. No, that's not a typo.
B00GMNL36E|5|This is the second vehicle I have put these on. Look great.  Hold up good to the weather and easy to install.
B0071N6ZFI|5|Good product for my vette
B00I8SJAL6|5|I've had a black/black set on my '12 Hayabusa for a few months without a single problem.  The sound is great without being obnoxiously loud, they look sharp, and the quality is awesome.  I shed nearly 30 lbs losing the factory cans - enough that you could notice it just standing the bike upright!<br /><br />I wished the red tips were available, but they stated the color was still in testing as it turns pink under heat.  The owner of the family run business convinced me black would be best and they've held their color perfectly!<br /><br />The only 2 improvements I'd appreciate are:<br />1) not having to shim the kickstand to keep it from scraping the pipe; with factory headers, they sit a hair's distance under the pegs, but without noticeable heat discomfort, and<br />2) that they could be angled rearward and/or downward a fraction further so they don't blow on your ankles during slow roll-offs such as in stop-n-go traffic, which also might fix #1.<br /><br />Highly recommended and I've often done so!
B007NZ9RNG|5|I recently installed my struts on my 2004 Honda Accord and I have to say, It rides like a dream...! Love the way it feels and the price was excellent!
B00THLI5GE|2|Not even the right tip.. I received a 4 inch inlet. Will have to go through the pain of returning now. Only reason for 2 star is that it was at least in good condition.
B0029ITVT2|5|Very well made. Fits newer Clarke gas tanks.
B007IW4U54|5|Great
B000LY7HOC|2|It doesn't fit my 2002 Honda CR-V.  Next time you guys  need to be clear and honest to the customers.  I waste 0ver 200 bucks for nothing!!!
B002L29FEM|1|Didn't work.  Guess it works for some, but not me.  Had to replace my windshield due to the combination of this products and Griot's glass polishing pads swirling up the glass like none other.  And all to get out some stupid water spots!
B00496V780|5|Works as stated
B000LVBQFQ|5|Worked on 2011 Audi A3
B00ERXG4TM|5|I love it -- genius in simplicity  -- works like a charm. Just remember it's a throttle stop not a cruise  control. If you do time on the slab it's a great addition for any bike. I move it around on three bikes without a hitch. Nice work
B000C7VY8I|5|Was concerned at first that the price would reflect a sub par product, but was pleasantly surprised. Works great and was very affordable!
B001SG7U2G|5|Just what I was looking for !thank u
B00JO9ZIA0|5|Perfect! Thank you!
B006B2YIK4|4|Great. A little heavy for the visors to hold it completely up.<br />Would love a way to ensure it is closed when not in use.
B00VCTIYP6|1|Too small
B001RJN56Y|2|Smell is over powering, even invaded my cigerattes!!!
B00HPZELZ8|5|Takes an hour to install because a wire must extend all the way to the battery but it is great, simple to do and complete.  I don't need a 7 plug  so this flat 4 works for me.
B006N9HYLA|5|Fit my 99 blazer, solved all my steering issues. I did all the steering and alignment myself. too easy and the shop wanted over $800 for less than $100 in parts and about 4 hours of work. I will never pay a mechanic to work on my vehicles.
B00SMRV4EO|5|I purchase some interior led lights from this company and had my bulb size wrong and they were very helpful in getting the right sizes I need I would definitely recommend this product to anyone
B00537Q1YO|5|Works as intended.  Do not exceed limits.
B00YHJJID0|5|This was a must have for my son we purchased his 1st vehicle.  Now he proudly shows off his favorite NHL team!
B0068N1B0Q|5|i picked up 2 of these filters for my 09 Legacy GT Spec. B. Ive only used oem filters before, but as my car has gotten older, i figured why not save where i can and change the cheap filter twice as often. anyhow the filter fit perfect and looks like its been put together better then the oem unit. more pleats and more uniform looking paper material.
B00TEA5PZC|5|Nice looking frame. Easy to install. Thicker than most frames from the local auto part store.
B00KWEVZTE|5|Fits as expected.
B000ML7QOU|2|.  I had the older red mode for several years I could set the red one on the floor and use it. I liked it; better this red one has an extremely short hose.<br />This one I have to balance on something to use it since I cut my own hair I need to be in front of the mirror . This blue one seems to be made a lot cheaper the quality I question the overall longevity.
B00OOOUY2W|5|Arrived on time. Fit perfect on my Odissey 2008. Takes only 5 minutes to install.
B000O1C47M|5|Great value for the price.  Performs well, able to cleanly evacuate the system.  Regularly able to achieve &#60;500 micron vacuum.  A bit slower than the more expensive pumps, but with regular oil changes it has held up well and continues to do the job.  I use it mostly for appliance repairs, where it performs beautifully.  On larger systems such as a multi-split HVAC system I installed recently, it takes more time to get the job done but still performs well.  If I was doing large systems on a regular basis, I'd probably opt for a higher performance unit but still keep this one handy as a backup.<br /><br />Like any vac pump, fresh oil is the key to performance and longevity.  Not sure what grade of oil came with it, but at the first oil change I filled it with Robinair premium and the performance improved significantly.
B0031BLXQ0|3|It's a nice exhaust system
B007Q1B87A|5|Line was an exact fit, easy installation and I saved on the dealers labor fee.
B00P9EJGR0|5|I really like these kick mats -- they are better than the Brica ones I bought before. These are nice because they have an adjustable strap (with a buckle/clasp) at the top AND the bottom. It makes quite it a bit easier to put on. They hold up well, too. I just ordered.y second pair (one for each car) now that my younger child's legs are longer. Very happy!
B000E2ARHK|3|Filter had no problem, was a little disappointed it didn't come with the needed o-ring but my old one was still good luckily since it's an old bike
B00OW0UAJA|5|I like the balance on this key ring.  It fits well in the hand and I don't fumble with it when trying to open my door with my hands full of groceries, etc.  I have seven normal size keys on the rings now.  There was nothing wrong with my old key ring, I just saw this one and decided to try it.  It's made well and I expect to use it for years to come.
B001GH5PX8|5|good quality and was here fast
B003TNHEO0|5|I had one of these before so I knew what I was getting. Yes it's thin, it's not a comfy cushion. It's perfect for leather seats that are either frigid in the winter or sticky and sweaty in the summer. It's just a barrier between the seat and your tush. But it does it's job so well. I probably wouldn't recommend for anyone over 200lbs. My husband sits so deep in the seat that it defeats the purpose. No air can flow through. It's perfect for me though. No more sticky, sweaty butt/back while driving in the summer with the windows down
B008H4NHVU|2|Fell off right away
B00T6J7VC6|4|Installation was a breeze and they look fantastic. My left LEDs are dimmer than the right, but just a little (thus only 4 stars). Not worth going through the return process. Connecting these on my 2013 XCT eliminated the problem with CB transmit locking up the entertainment display. Combined with the Kuryakyn tail light top chrome trim, the bike's back end looks are definitely improved.
B00HWS7XGW|2|I am disappointed with the brightness of these LEDs.  I bought them specifically with hopes of increasing my brake light visibility for my older car.  When I installed the LED on one side and compared it to the old incandescent, I could not see any difference at all.  So for me, the cost of about $15/LED versus $2 for incandescent is not justified.
B0081L74FY|5|Good tool to perform the job with quality and reduce the time.
B00D6R5VQW|4|TL;DR<br />The seatbelt buckle performed as it should. I wish installation instructions were available in the packaging though, that would have made it 5 stars.<br /><br />Story<br />After some searching around on the internet for 15 minutes to no avail. I spent about 5 minutes seeing how I could get to the bolt that holds the buckle in place. I eventually removed the entire seat to do it. Took about 45 minutes to remove and reinstall. If instructions were included, maybe there would have been an easier way than the way I did it.<br /><br />How I did it:<br />1.You basically have to pop off the 4 plastic covers that are covering the bolts under the seat. You have to slide the seat back and forth to access them, but you can get to them.<br />2. Remove all 4 bolts with socket wrench<br />3. Remove the headrest.<br />4. Unclip the seatbelt wire under the seat.<br />5. Remove seat and put on its side<br />6. Unscrew another plastic piece covering buckle area.<br />7. Swing it out of the way (it will still be attached to the seat)<br />8. Remove buckle<br /><br />to reinstall do everything in reverse order.
B004J9HEWK|1|I installed two of these non-OEM cylinders on the lift glass of my GMC Yukon.  One of the four ball sockets did not want to snap onto the ball stud.  With some patience, I was able to get the joint assembled.  The liftgate worked normally for a few cycles, then BAM!  That troublesome joint came loose.  The end of the lift support shot downward with such force that the ball-socket chipped the paint on my tailgate in a rat-a-tat woodpecker fashion.  I have since replaced both of these lift supports with the proper OEM parts.  They very easily clicked into place on to all four ball studs, and have held securely ever since.  I see that chipped paint every time I open the lift glass and am reminded to avoid cheap aftermarket parts.
B0012TZ1RU|5|Product DOES NOT ATTRACT DIRT AT ALL CHAIN WAS DRY AS A BONE PUT THIS WAX SPRAY ON CHAIN AND A WEEK LATER CHAIN STILL LOOKING GREAT CHECKED CHAIN FOR DEBRIS NOTHING IS STUCK TO IT AT ALL ..<br />WOULD TELL ANY BODY THAT THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO BUY<br />PLUS IT'S A BIG CAN LAST A LONG TIME
B001CA9CN8|1|If you are looking for a OE replacement for your F150 climate seats look elsewhere. I purchased these in June and all I got was a plastic housing. There was no filter in it at all. The factory part has a filter to help keep the incoming air clean.  Unfortunately for me I purchased it and forgot to install until after the 30 day return window. Waste of 50 bucks.
B00AC6SAZE|5|Great price!
B0050OX07Q|1|did not work
B002V4VLOC|5|Worked well. Had to do it a bunch of times. But it was the only product that worked on stucco. I was pleased!
B00FSD97PI|4|Looks and works great, only thing that I didn't like was that there was a melted part that didn't match the pattern. Overall it was a great purchase if you like having your car clean like me.
B001B6R00U|5|Great price and delevered in a timely manner
B004A34G94|4|Fit well and works as good as the original at 1/2 the price.

B005IMXH6Y|5|Works well on my knee scooter and holds a camelback eddy bottle easily.
B002UC13NE|5|Worked great in my teardrop camper.  One per side to controll inside light, outside light and accessory charger
B007HRXKP6|5|Easily installed and works as advertised.
B00BNU2I2O|4|Nice quality. Sticks on tough to my exhaust.<br />Terribly slow shipping speed arriving from Thailand. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.
B00QB475G6|4|It fits exactly as the original but the wiper is a different style, the factory wiper was a 12b this arm takes a 12a, also comes with the mounting cover or cap
B00NP3QDCI|4|Although it came from China the hat arrived within a week.  My husband was surprised by the gift and loved the hat.  It seemed well made and pretty durable.
B00K8SEYEM|5|worked perfect
B0012TWXHG|5|great for snow mobiles
B0041CDYEM|4|Nice
B001TIZZVQ|5|Fit perfect in my Wrangler Unlimited
B00VQUXXWA|5|It's really helpful to me this product specially to my baby. My baby gets irritated when the sun goes to hes face  after I put this Sun shades He feels great. Easy to fold it and keep it. Two thumps up , Highly recommended to others
B0093XZF6Y|5|BestLine are products noone should be without.
B009AQS4IU|5|My sister loves it! 6 months later, it still looks perfect! The colors are still vibrant and the chrome is still shiny. It does not chip easily (or at all) and stays attached very well!
B00TYUCPXW|5|Works
B00RU9GZK8|2|Turned out these did not fit the 2014 Sienna. Gave them to my son in law for his Scion
B008CE070E|3|solid, but loose in the receiver
B00915JI08|4|Good price
B000Q3OTQC|5|2012 JK saved 3 MPG<br /><br />easy install
B00IGIMV6Y|5|Good stuff and cheap price
B007KPSFOQ|3|Great product but I return them due to the limited visual effect on my Harley Tri Glide.
B002N1J5IM|5|Moves more air than expected even with a maxxair vent cover on top of the vent. Reading other reviews I thought this was going to be loud but it isn't at all. I almost think it's quieter than the little junk fan that was in there before.
B001CHH3GO|5|Looks great on my SRX and really completes the look of my car. Very classy and eye-catching!
B00GV84NI0|5|Great direct fit!
B00514C0AS|5|Good product
B00WPW6BAE|4|Product came well packaged and so far works excellent as described.  Working great with Harry's laptimer and dash command! I have a 2015 WRX, picks up all expected PIDS and the connection stays strong
B001GMXRZ6|5|Pic doesn't do this thing justice.  It's a beast, almost a two-man lift.  If you need a beefy mount, this will do the job.
B0090JVTYI|5|Great little dual cup holder. I bought this for a 2005 Chrysler Crossfire and put in my center console because it didn't have a cup holder in it at all. It fits fairly well and was the best fit I could find for this application.
B0052SF0LO|5|great for my dogs at night
B00252928M|5|Worked as expected.
B00BJL29QM|5|Been using these for years makes my 2005 MB smell like new!!
B000Z3BNXU|4|There a little noisy with the window open...Gap in the front part. Not as streamlined and aerodynamic as I would prefer but they do the job.. 👍👍
B003VDX5D2|5|Easy install, and has made it much easier to enter the bed of the truck. It was a good value!
B00D8BFJP4|5|Great item
B00139YMUQ|5|excelente
B00KTJ5BRE|5|Very good as expected.
B00B54SJIK|5|Best thing i bought for my truck in a long time
B00CW9JO4A|5|excellent
B00QVLQHAO|3|Works well. Drained two gas powered items with ease, flimsy, so not for heavy use, but for the three, four times a year that I will use it, it is fine.
B00J65IHB4|2|Love Valvoline's DEF, but didn't like the damaged packaging. It was leaking and made a big mess in my garage. Won't order again.
B002PYBZJO|5|Excellent product.
B00IJ6INAG|5|perfect for my 2015
B004Q19Q9U|5|I really like that it covers your ears and the shield covers your whole face without feeling constricted.  The visor really helps with the sun.
B000JK2D06|5|I have searched for the ultimate wax. I even tried to make one to sell. I was put onto it by a car buddy and I bought at a ships chandlery in Boston. The counter told me it was the only thing he used on his 67 Mustang so I went for two bottles!  The trick is to mix it well in the bottle. Heating it also helps so you can mix it. I took some out to get room to shake it up a bit.<br />It is critical to not let it dry too much.  A bear to remove when one tries a big area.  Think a two x two area. I found the trick to be: apply and remove them go back and re buff it with a third cloth.  It looks like glass!  I use it on my Maroon Corvette, black Escape and white Benz!  All three look spectacular.  As we say in Boston &#34; wicked pissah shine&#34;!!!!
B004GEWOCS|5|Fit perfectly
B0050DCLE0|3|The look is what I wanted. The quality is Kuryakyn. Only issue is the glue doesn't hold well. Had to use clear adhesive to secure them to speaker grills. Now they are on for good....
B000A3GTCK|3|it worked
B004K9ESN2|4|Great for docking and use in times of emergencies
B003YL15V0|5|This is the best multi tool I  got
B00Y5MI0Q0|1|Item looks,real nice but,is a piece of junk!! No telling polarity its,not marked .posts are a odd size soo good luck finding connectors thatll fit and sounds horrible!!my horn burned up in one day!!!didnt even attempt a refund.people who would sell such a crappy item arent worth messing with!!
B00T9AGBOQ|5|I brought this device out of curiosity,  the product description is simply too good to be true.  Among the many choices of similar devices offered by Amazon,  I picked the Coolreall unit since it has the best features relative to price as compared with other models.  I received the device about a week after I placed the order.  I then began my testing since I have to make sure it works as expected during emergency.<br /><br />Main feature is jump start :  I fully charged the device and disconnected the negative terminal from the battery of my Toyota mini-van ( V6, 3.5L),  I connected the device with the provided battery cables to the disconnected cables of my car,  the car started immediately.  I'm happy as this is the main purpose why I purchased this unit.  In addition,  the unit was quality built,  looks nice and is compact.  The carrying case is a bonus.<br /><br />Other features:  USB power works well,  it fully charged my iPhone in about 2 hours,  battery level depleted 1/4.  I then charged my laptop using one of the included tips at full power,  it charged my laptop from 10% to about 60% in about 1 hour and shut down when power is completely depleted.  Emergency light works well and is very bright.<br /><br />It takes about 3.5 to 4 hours to charge the device from 0 to level 4 using the wall charger.  However,  it takes an astonishing &#62;20 hours to charge the unit using the car charger.<br /><br />Overall,  this is an excellent unit for emergency and I think everyone should carry one in the car.
B003UTH088|1|Although these remotes function correctly with my Tahoe, buyer beware because they are NOT &#34;Factory GM&#34; anything. They are a cheap knock off and you can see and feel the difference in quality. You can actually feel the body of the remote flex in your hand when using it. I've only had mine a week, but I don't expect it to last long. It should read GM compatible,  it definately not GM in the description.
B0043BMOSI|5|Ordered on the 10th, arrived on the 12th. came with the plastic snap clips that go in the housing amazing buy. too bad there is not a six star rating
B00P0FS79Q|4|Easy install,quality product.
B00IS937ZK|4|I love it and it was great as expected.  It gives my jeep a really aggressive look.  It was easy to install. Very well built.  Thank you.
B00GEIAJCQ|3|I hate the fact that you raised your prices to a ridiculous amount, anything over $20 for 5 quarts of motor oil is ludicrous. Last time I bought I paid $14.97 for 5 quarts & it was an excellent deal. Anyone who thinks $37.41 is a good deal for motor oil is a blooming idiot. Some of these dealers have the mentality of a fence post.
B004VDSEKK|1|Would not stay on even after applying extra 3M tape.
B000CB3ZY0|5|Great fit and quality for my VW!
B00R7HJ5SC|1|This product was too stretchy
B00EZ9Y33W|5|It worked
B00JAAB5ZU|5|It was good no problem came just in time
B00EVMT6A8|4|Looks great. But the curve is too convex so you can't determine the distance to vehicles.
B007ULXTD2|5|I love it! It's more chrome and bling than I thought it would be and it's perfect! Very easy to piece together and install.
B007WMP9J6|5|Nice thing.
B000CITK8S|5|I really like these things. I have several and use them on everything in the shop. Maintaining an auto battery this way is good. Quick disconnect is good. An absolute must for all 12v electric start equipment - riding mower, golf cart, generator, forklift, etc.
B00P2D3VZG|5|Very well built lights.  The color is perfect, 5,000K.
B00P3PR9C4|5|Great LEDs. Works great as my DRL and turn signals on my 2015 Genesis ultimate without needing to use resistors. Had it for couple of months without any issues.
B001KS0NB2|1|Doesnt fit 2011 kia sedona. Koodos to amazon for prompt refund
B00LHUI4XM|5|The stainless plate frames look terrific I didn't care for the dull screw covers so I bought some inexpensive chrome covers which complements the.stainless frames.
B009TCD1VA|5|Use it all the time.
B0040CYWX0|5|great
B00KTHZMPM|5|Great product. Fast Shipping. Had keys cut at local locksmith for 5 dollars. Self programmed in 5 minutes since I already had two old remotes.<br />Now I don't have to use the old dirty remotes that came with the car and save a couple hundred bucks not having to go to dealer for programming.
B00N9QGV14|5|Great fit cant complain for the price!
B0015DMNIS|4|Quality piece. You feel like a real man holding this shiny piece of awesomeness in your hand.<br />I showed pics to my friends, and they were like &#34;it's the terminator!&#34;. So yeah, get one.
B0002ILK4K|5|Great unit, shipped timely, as described, good value !
B002YI74U0|4|Great produce
B0048E6KX0|5|Great fit, good price
B00I8R82H0|5|What I expected. Hope it lasts for a long time
B001Q8HB8Y|5|Fixed my issue - Keep a few in the bilge stay legal
B009DK1SR2|4|Overall its a nice replacement valance.  I would plan on taking a lot of pictures when you tear the original (no directions included) off and getting replacement snaps, bolts, nuts, washers, etc, because this came with the 8 snaps for the ends, a few plastic fasteners, two plastic supports and that is it. I highly recommend using primer before you put the final paint on because I used paint right off the bat and it cracked and peeled within minutes. After I stripped the paint off and primered it the paint laid very nicely.  The large plastic support under the large opening is NOT included so don't destroy your old one if you don't have a new one.  Also be very wary of compatibility with bumpers. Make sure your bumper is recessed at the ends and has the 8 slots (4 in each side) near the ends.
B008I7S8SI|5|the mirror shakes a bit after i hit over 60mph. i had read the comments from other buyers and they mention that the mirror shakes as well. overall for the price i was happy and expected for the mirror to shake. havent figured out a way to stop it from shaking.
B001G6MOG0|5|exactly as described!
B001DRNNKI|5|Not OEM (at least not identical to the VW part numbered item my dealer installs), but an exact fit and same quality at a lower than dealer price.
B002X55TRE|4|Great little saying and looks good on the light background
B003YLKJZS|2|It says it will work for Chevy Malibu 2005 but doesn't!
B00S74IG7K|5|Excellent light for the price!  VERY bright and great pattern.  Seems very well constructed and solid.  The included wiring harness is automotive quality although I didn't use mine, it wired easily to the upfitter switches in my f250.  Fits perfect in the bumper opening of 2008-2010 F250.  Can't beat it for the price!
B00F0YASQ2|5|Works great on my bmw e60! Saved $
B00G4RVLZ6|4|The delivering was fast, package is nice and includes a short instruction. I am very satisfy with the purchase.
B00B5ZYY38|5|Very nice!
B00B3P26N0|5|An awesome sticker that gets quite a few comments.
B00O0SRA74|1|Disappointed . Does not strobe. Only flash's.  Wires come undone easily. So gotta tape them together.control box is cheap plastic. But hey. Get what your pay for.  I will not use these for my police vehicle.
B00ODTCSLS|5|Works great
B00JAO5LCE|3|Looks great, lots of wind noise even for a modular helmet. Not quite as well ventilated as I'd have hoped, but it's decent. An effective, aesthetic solution to a poor college kid's budget versus safety ratio, but if I had the money I would probably buy a helmet that was a little nicer.
B000BYEJSY|5|As described. Prompt shipping.
B00KC36GC6|5|Looks great fits great very happy!
B00ASMWP0I|5|Great price.  Still going strong
B00KTIY4ZA|1|This remote works once after you program it and then it stops working.
B00BQWQN8E|1|I installed a set of those Philips Upgrade Headlight bulbs in my 2006 MB in December 2014 and one of the light is out today.  My car doesn't have low beam light on at daylight (turned off manually) and I seldom drive it at night.  I guess totally maybe only less than 50 hours of running time on this set of bulbs. This is a horrible product!
B00MGI585G|4|very nice, my daughter loves them.
B009197TBY|1|I used it for the first today and this thing is quite bad.  It would not turn on after plugging in.  Then I noticed the fuse which just fell out and keeps falling out.  If I press on the fuse with the on button, then it starts operating.  What kind of design is this?  I have a DC unit that is over 20 years old and it still works as well as the day I bought it.  I just wanted another compressor that can use AC power for home use.<br /><br />I would like to return this item for a full refund.
B006ONSA2M|5|Perfect fit for my husband's 2005 Polaris. It was installed in minutes.
B0037QFXI8|5|For the serious floorman, look no further. Great brush. Would suggest a different pole/ longer. Com a floorman over 40 yrs in the business.
B004Y9YIU6|5|ok
B000CF3WEY|5|We try to use the OEM manufacture when possible to replace O2 sensors. As usual this one worked flawlessly.
B00DR17U8Y|5|Ok
B00YI3IGA6|5|So far seems like a strange but brilliant investment. Totally see through but makes car nicely shaded. Kid likes it as well.
B00KH84KFQ|5|Absolutely perfect, fast delivery, just as requested and advertised!!! AAA+++
B00OUH1D1E|5|I love tnis lanyard its thick  material  and has a sturdy clasp im very pleased
B00SLKOUSY|5|Solid, works well.
B0037ASPYS|4|happy to find a specialty tool on amazon. small piece of insurance for valve seals.
B00LY6FX1A|2|The cover I received is drab and dull.... Not bright and colorful as pictured in ad. Background is brownish burlap and tree doesn't show up very well. Quality is good
B000EDOTCS|4|good produce
B00W8LQMQK|3|This model attaches with adhesive to the body of your car around the window. This does not go into your window channel like most models. I had to learn this the hard way. Seller should do a better job at specifying this about the product.
B001CF3NWE|5|Needed a cover to keep rain out of the leaky jeep... And this does just that. Plenty of room for spare tire and bike rack. Only issue was the antenna we have (non-stock) didn't fit through the provided hole so the plastic cap they had for the antenna popped off. However, the stock antenna would have fit just fine!
B000BQWLE6|1|It's not what I expected. It is tiny!
B00NI4X1HE|4|Haven't actually installed them yet but everyone is wanting some.
B005RU0WI8|1|Terrible quality, the clip connecting the tail with the key chain fell apart within three days, it has no movement whatsoever, not soft at all, doesn't look real. Just a waste of my money to be honest. it would have negative stars if that was possible.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|Bought kit for my son for his birthday since he just bought a new SUV.  He said he loved the products and was happy with the way they all worked.
B000CQRMAI|5|I'am very satisfied with this order, everything in this order is what I expected
B000C57XUI|2|This says it fits a 1977 nova but it does not. I have a 7/8&#34; diameter sway bar and these bushings are to large to fit correctly!
B004GXWJQU|5|works better than anything else.  Not a rust remover as much as the best lubricant I have.  I use it when all else fails or disappoints.
B00ZAAW5GM|2|[[VIDEOID:daa334f57e0a7684f05ff01bf9560b2a]]This screwdriver set could have been good if not for the following two problems:<br /><br />1) The bits do not stay in their cubby holes, they fall out as soon as the case is tipped. When the package arrived in the mail all bits were out of their slots.<br />2) The screwdriver bits are not marked with sizes.  The cubby holes in which they are supposed to reside are marked, but since the bits do not stay in the cubby holes the markings on the case are of no help.<br /><br />The kit is not totally useless as I can eye ball the bit and do some trial and error for a good fit but it does not work as designed.  Since it was time consuming and annoying having to put the bits back into slots every time I handled the case I came up with a solution of covering the bits with a piece of plastic before closing the case. This keeps most of them in place as I put the case away for storage.<br /><br />The kit does have a large variety of small tips - a larger variety than I my other small screwdriver sets.  However, I am not able to give it an \\"ok\\" rating because of the two problems.  If you are willing to spend a bit more money check out iHuniu screwdriver kit, it is a similar (but smaller) kit with a case that holds everything well and it has tips with engraved sizes.<br /><br />This screwdriver kit is provided by Trendbox with a request for an honest review.  Getting a free product does not effect what I say. My reviews reflect only my experience with the product and reviews are good or bad only based on how well the product works.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

B0000E1R21|5|There are two options to use this:<br />1.  screw it onto the first stage of your regulator.  This will allow you to quickly and easily disconnect your computer (along with the hose).<br />2.  Attached it to your computer.  This will allow you to remove your computer (leaving the hose on the first stage).<br /><br />The quick disconnect is very easy to install and use.  Just make sure the tank is closed when trying to connect it, because you won't be able to fight against 3000psi of pressure.
B001BYAXJ2|5|Excellent wipers for the price. Installed in minutes. Perfect fit. After a couple rains, wipers did excellently and look to be well made.
B00BN472BM|2|Love this keyring I bought but the thing you twist to put keys on doesn't stay closed.  Love the style though.
B00USSDEAC|5|Looks exactly like the picture and doesn't lose the shiny and blingy feature. Haven't lost a stone and I love the bow!
B008XNZZ7O|5|This stuff works great!
B00CB8WM2S|5|Although I have not had to use this (thank God) I like this model for 3 reasons. 1) the bright color - to better see it 2) the size - fits in glove compartment 3) the seat belt cutter - something that has always worried me it I were to be trapped in my car.
B00NX8EYFI|5|Cooool
B004BWB9JO|5|works great.
B001RJSJX8|5|Awesome
B00GU8IF94|5|Love the cooler fast delivery  thank you again
B000WO7D72|5|great quality,  stands up to the highway speeds very well.
B00N4M95XO|5|I have 1 dome light in my car and it lights up my whole car. Very bright and would buy this brand again
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Vehicle: Mazda3<br />When in use: I use the sun visors in the car to hold it up, which it does just fine. I like that the edges are all soft / floppy because I don't worry about it nicking or scratching anything and that it is generally lightweight when I'm putting it in place.<br />Folding: I don't typically have people in the back of my car, so I just fold it in half and stick it in the back seat. I tried once to fold it up so that it would fit in the pouch, but was unable to, so I gave up.
B000GU1J0O|5|Perfect fit for stock yfz 450
B007QQRKXG|5|Some cars and trucks are with missing nylon push-type and i want to keep the units as original (complete).
B00ARF6FB6|1|Worked for about 2 weeks, then stopped working. It looked good, but turned out to be a piece of trash.
B00AESZH0Q|5|Great Item
B00E7VF22E|4|This item fit my car (2014 SXT) the best out of the three items I bought (this, the cup holder, and the doors). No real complaints about this, it's a good, average product.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|excellent product....used on a ski boat, truck and utvs....never leave home without it..
B004RCR05A|4|Just installed this product on my Class A RV, I have only driven it 40 mile since the install, but I see a big difference in the sway of my RV. I will update the review in about two months when I come back form my big trip. Driving it over 1,800 miles on the interstate, Hwy. and back country roads will be the real test. I will let everyone know when I get back, but for now I can feel the RV rides  stiffer and the sway has been reduced a lot. Before the RV would sway left to right five to six times each way before it would stop. Now IF IT SWAYS it is once each way and the sway is very little each way.  recommend.
B001DRLQN4|4|Fit in my 2008 Lexus IS250 perfectly!<br />Got rid of my cabin smell about 90% but not completely.<br />Easy to install, only downfall is that it doesn't say which side should face up (had to refer to old dirty filter) and doesn't eliminate odor 100%.
B004BTAJ2A|4|A little big for my 2012 Honda Civic steering wheel, but nothing some napkins and some double sided tape couldn't fix. Love the feel and the look of it (the grips are at the 10, 2, and 6 positions) so you find yourself driving with the proper grip a lot more often...
B000GD5FMY|4|Love them!!
B004M23CW0|5|Very nice quality and easy to clean!
B00L1RUAY2|5|The quality was excellent, the price reasonable, and merchandise arrived within a few days.
B00065WNK4|5|This is the one to get! I don't write reviews often, but this product works well. Competitor products at lower prices had issues with broken needles, someone had to drill the leather holes to make them bigger. Here are my suggestions:<br /><br />1. Go to Wheelskins website to determine which is best for your car, year and model<br />2. read the instructions that come with the product--remember &#34;tight is right&#34;<br />3. stretch the leather all the way around the streeting whell before beginning<br />4. the instructions call for pre streching 10 and 2 oclock &#34;thumbs&#34; if your steering wheel has it. I don't have them so I don't know. It sounds right though.<br />5. Don't start at the spoke or at the seam of the product.<br />6. The instructions call for streching the string to get the kinks out. Do this again half way through the project to avoid kinks<br />7. The upper part of the stitch goes at 90 degrees to the wheel, and the hidden string under the skin goes diagonally<br />8. Re-do the stitch if you don't like the result remember &#34;tight is right&#34;<br />9. Tricky part is at the spoke. If you can't get the two leather pieces to touch each other, undo the stitch and use the &#34;dummy&#34; or single side only stitch. Continue through the spoke area until you can stitch the two leather pieces to touch each other again.<br />10. It took me 90 minutes and the sun had set. It wasn't fun in the dark with only the car interior lights on. Leave yourself enough daylight.<br />11. There is plenty of string. you can start with more than just 6 inches the instructions call for. There are an extra 3 feet of string for me. If you start with more than 6 inches, you can tie the string to a spoke to keep the first stitches tight until you finish the product.<br />12. I didn't understand the instructions on finishing, so I tightened the final stitch then used a square knot (right over left and left over right) to hide the last knot under the skin. This is where to tie the beginning 6 inches per item 11 above to the remaining 3 feet of string when you have come full circle.<br />13 while the skin started off krinkly, it stretched to smooth by the end.<br />14. Remember to make the pieces of leather touch each other after every stitch, it is nearly impossible to go back and tighten a stitch from before.<br />15. Don't be afraid to undo a section if you don't like how it looks. You are going to live with this for the life of your car.<br />16. Good luck.
B00MYFNN6C|5|Excellent
B00IQ5X91I|4|works but be patient, may have to charge a few times and repeat, but does a good job
B004DDHXCI|4|I had to file the shoulder down a lot for it to be long enough.
B001KS8LJI|5|After reading remarks made in a couple of Duramax forums, I chose to go OEM for the seal on my 91 2500HD.  Perfect fit, and expect it to last another 100,000 miles....
B00E9FS8HO|4|Was as advertised and arrived as expected.
B007Y5CZY8|5|Fits the Saturn Vue for well and makes a world of difference.
B00CO79QR0|1|secondaries hang too low

B00LNOTM0G|5|My review is short and sweet..<br />Buy them! Dont' even think twice..<br />Awesome lights!!!
B0041MCLW8|4|Good quality product.
B000F285EQ|5|works like a charm
B005WXOCRC|5|This product gave my Harley a whole new look. Thanks for helping that become a reality.
B000RFLR0U|5|great piece of kit shame we have to get it from America
B00ETS7V6K|5|I really would have liked the windshield banner, but I feared attracting police attention and opted for the front license plate bracket version. People driving too slowly in the left lane and blocking traffic, causes other drivers to speed and weave in and out to get around them, and it often leads to road rage. If you are not keeping up with traffic move the hell over! I don't know if people will even notice this plate, but if even one person does I'll be happy.<br /><br />Update... not sure how many drivers in front of me even see it. But I get tons of compliments in parking lots... clearly many people can relate and like the idea... just wish I had the courage to buy the windshield banner... maybe later when I'm not driving around my 83 year old mom.
B0002X520S|5|Stuff works great, lasts long, (&#34;does&#34; darken leather quite a bit). I use it on all my boots.
B000WO54SC|5|The foam filter seems to be of good quality. I didn't see any defects or potential defects of any kind. I put the filter in a Ziploc bag and sprayed it with Uni's Foam Filter Oil, massaged in oil, and wrung out any excess. The fit over the plastic air filter cartridge was perfect and the whole project took about 15 minutes on my '96 XT. I would definitely buy this again.
B000I04Z7Q|4|This product is very very nice; Let me start with that. I have a 2001 ford excursion(with many cigarette lighter plugs. {5 in total})and I can plug this in a plug in the 3rd row of seats and it still reaches to the front seats! Wow! The only problem was that the cigarette lighter plug adapter I purchased (I reviewed that also if you wouldn't mind rating that for me) didn't fit right and it blew after 30 seconds but that's a different story. Also, the remote is very nice and easy to use. And, it comes with a 3M glue so you can mount it to your dash!  Overall very nice product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very bright<br />Long cords<br />Nice flowing light features feature<br />Nice remote<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't work with suggested co-purchase<br />Sound feature doesn't work as well as I would like
B005HR2TM8|4|Ordered for wrong bike sent back and reordered
B004GNCRT4|4|Outstanding value saved me $200.00 plus.
B00JRJG45U|4|Shipping fast. Had difficulty removing old one had to spend about 3 hrs getting every bit of the  old mast out. They Jam it in there and if it's the original it's tuff getting it all out, cuz it jus sat n baked in there 22 yrs.  u gotta dig down in there, n look close to make sure u remove every layer of the antenna. it came out tho finally once u get ALL the old mast out, the new one fit In good and sucked right into the gears with no problem. Be careful to put the plastic white ring in inside the motor back the same way so the new mast gears can go inside there. Cuz I had that backwards the first try, no good. One way there is a flat side that can block the hole. It's a pain kinda but it's nice to have power antenna it makes the car more cool
B008S3POQG|5|Exact fit
B003BZYZFC|5|Worked great.
B002713IUY|1|Broke 2nd day of use.
B004A2D4N4|1|Lasted about a week and a half.  Started clicking again.
B000JFHNG0|5|This set worked great for fixing the air conditioning on my Grand Caravan. I vacuumed out the system after replacing the condenser and used these gauges to refill the refrigerant and the A/C is working great!
B00BIHA4P0|4|So far so good, installs easily. Plenty of dust and a slight squeak (both to be expected given the compound). Initial bedding process was simple and taken care of within couple hundred miles. I bought these for an upcoming track day to save my OEM pads. I will update next month with the results. 2013 Scion FR-S  *Post Track Day update: these were cooked by the end of the weekend. They had about 700 miles of regular street driving on them by the time the track weekend arrived and they performed well the first day even with high outside temps. I took time for warm up and cool down laps for each 20-25 minute session and they continued to have good feel, but by the end of the second day they started to break down. While they didn't seem to lose too much stopping power, they did start shedding bits by the end of the day.  **I was put in contact with EBC and they feel I must have received a bad batch of some sort. Despite not normally covering items used on track (including HDPE), they are sending me a new set of pads for my trouble. Thanks to th great and friendly service both from the seller, Speedshop and from EBC, I've bumped it back up to four stars. We'll see how the new pads handle another track weekend.
B00HRXNLIG|5|Plug And Play. Works Very Well
B002T4MPOO|5|Great
B0028JQYSS|1|This car didn't even lift a Toyota Yaris off the ground far enough to get jack stands under it on their lowest range. Added to that if felt unsteady and easily breakable. The handle won't stay put to save your life, even with the small notch that's supposed to keep it there. All in all, you get what you pay for. $20 for something that is prone to failing if it works at all.
B00GWWVKZ4|4|They fit nicely
B003WDDLTO|1|I have a deep cycle marine battery that I wanted to use my trickle charger for but I did not have the connection I wanted for my battery.  My battery has a threaded stud next to each of the battery posts for hooking up a ring type cable that is tightened down with a nut.  This contraption does not have a large enough diameter to fit.  I doubt I can drill it bigger as the rings will bind and twist them off.  Maybe I can use neighbors Dremel tool and grind them bigger but I fear all I'll be left with is a spiders web of material left.  For $5.00 I'm to lazy to return it so I will pawn it off to my nephew or neighbor.
B002MQCY7C|5|Great Product and great service..
B00029JXNE|4|Perfect size for my application and works well, can't beat the price.
B005HJ67I8|5|works well highly recommend this item to other shoppers....
B0065D3N28|3|Hits the pass button when clutch is fully depressed but other than that it is fine.
B0030G7Y64|5|love this freezer fridge  nothing like reaching over and grabbing a cold drink no matter what the ambient temp is outside  this was the biggest best cheapest one on amazon holds enough stuff  for even the thirstiest and hungriest individual for a day or two i leave it in my big truck and its cold and the truck starts every morning  highly recommended  NO MORE LUKE WARM OR HOT DRINKS FOR ME !!!!!!!!
B00SF8F5NG|3|Just received these lugnuts....When opened I found that there was a plastic bag with the lugs in it...the bag was previously opened by someone so it made me think something &#34;shady&#34; was going on...I inspected each lug nut some of them were dirty making think these were used on something before I got them...this item was not &#34;new&#34; as advertised.<br /><br />All in all at least they were all the same size and got the correct amount of lugnuts...Did not get a Lug Key for some reason..I thought Gorilla Lugnut sets get a Lug Key with them...Guess not.
B00BFDJ72S|4|it's perfectly fit the reservoir
B00C8UP7NU|3|I like it
B0002V9IFK|1|leaves marks , does not wipe off
B002FS4W86|5|These are good quality and came with detailed instructions with torque specifications.
B003NHH6LI|5|Works perfect
B000CNLBL2|5|So first off, this muffler was purchased at an on line retailer due to it being much cheaper than amazon, which was shocking! I've owned just about ever muffler flowmaster has. From the loud super 10, to the mellow super 50. I have to say, this super 40 is the perfect compromise when it comes to sound. It has a real nice deep low rumble and almost no droning at highway speeds in my Dakota Quad Cab. Interior resonance is kept to a minimum as well. As stated above, this was installed on a 2000 Dakota with a 4.7 V8 and I couldn't be happier. I was a bit worried it would be too loud, but it's perfect. I do have to mention it may be a bit louder on other vehicles due to the fact my Dakota has 2 catalytic converters. That saps quite a bit of sound to begin with. So for my application, it was a perfect fit!
B00JW1WU7E|5|It came before the date it was supposed to and it works wonderfully.  It was easy to put on.
B000N9OCGG|5|Fixed my issue
B00IMVNKOM|1|If you don't mind being soaks by the incredibly poor seal on the valve then this is for you....
B00718FORI|5|close to a custom fit...
B000ET8D1U|1|Tried to apply the rubber to my tire and it didn't stick or seal. Product was useless to buy
B000CIRR06|2|Nice looking steps. Broke 4 bolts while installing (would think they should be stronger than that?) The worse thing about the steps is the oxidation that occurs almost immediately.  I have to use stainless steel cleaner weekly to keep them looking nice.
B001PVQUWA|5|Looks good very easy to install
B009OBVXSO|1|I ordered three of these and all arrived debris of some sort on the pads.  Packaging was completely intact, so it definitely was something that occurred at the factory.  Nice quality assurance, Meguiar's.  Threw them out.  I'm not risking killing a paint job with dirty pads.
B00NFSNAS8|1|Loud. Short cord. Poor construction. Slow to inflate. The first time I needed it to inflate the tire more than 5 psi, on its 7th or 8th use, it burned up.  I'm embarrassed that I ever bought this product considering how many other more worthy alternatives there are at lower prices.  Please do not buy this product, in my opinion it is a complete waste of money.
B00KMB6A1K|5|These are great tools that no professional mechanic should not be without.  They are long, 120 tooth so you don't need a lot room to turn and are lifetime warrantied so you can tourque the snot out of them...and for the record, I have yet to break one and I use them daily.  I own a car shop and wrench on cars daily...the SAE wrenches are not needed as these mm. will fit everything.  I just wish they would come out with a bigger add on kit up to 36mm.
B00BZGW50Q|5|Came in 3 business days like it said. 2 minutes installation
B00Y1HUZUS|5|The key was easy to program for my door locks with the included instructions. With a little searching on the internet, I was able to easily program the chip for my 2005 Scion TC ignition and got my neighborhood locksmith to cut the key for $10. I'm very satisfied with the key and I know I saved a lot of money
B007137D2W|5|Came early works good used c clamp to compress also
B000A137U4|5|Works great for bike rack.
B0019WRHWW|5|Filter fit my 2012 Jeep Liberty perfectly for a quarter of the price charged at the dealer.  Easy to use and arrived in perfect condition.
B00QNUO7FK|5|As an avid car enthusiast some of my favorite memories growing up were washing the car on the weekends with my dad, so naturally when I got my first car, a black 2G Mitsubishi Eclipse, I was excited to get into washing my own vehicle! As many of you may know though, especially those who own black cars, proper car washing isn't all fun and games as I thought it was as a young boy. The rinsing, washing and small details weren't bad in my opinion, the thing that killed the experiencing for me was drying. No matter what soap, method, or off the shelf drying contraption I used, the result was always a disappointed sea of streaks and water spots. Fast forward 5 years to just a few months ago, I owned a silver R33 Skyline and although drying a silver car leaves less noticeable water marks and spots, each weekly wash still left me unsatisfied with the result. That was until I decided to bite the bullet and find a new drying solution. After days research I decided to go with this product and once I placed the order, I received it promptly which is very impressive that I am overseas. After completing the rinse, wheel detail and washing phase I began the forever dreaded drying phase and boy was I amazing! The towel absorbed unline anything I had ever used before, but still glazed across the surface smoothly and with easy instead of with the concerning resistance I always got from both natural and synthetic chamois. The water was gone after just one pass it cut my drying time in half with exponentially better results. That was the last time I washed my R33 before selling, and I'm glad it was a positive experience. The real experience came today though, as I washed my newly purchased black toyota supra RZ for the first time. Having owned a black car before, I was somewhat skeptical of how the TRC towel do, but once the time came, the product performed beautifully! Just as with the Skyline, the towel absorbed the water in one pass and left behind a fantastic spot and streak free shine. Thank you TRC for making a fantastic product that restored my long lost love for the car washing experience and thank you to the seller for a reasonable price and prompt shipping.shine.

B00WVODI20|5|Perfect fit
B00NPQO0YS|5|I love them everything about it the style the look came faster then expected date. Halos work great the side lights work good I upgraded the stock low beam that came with it with 10k hids for the brighter low beam . Tail light housing looks awesome on my truck 2002 2500HD Chevy. I will post pix when I take some photos. Was easy to install everything was there all I had to do was us the original pins. Thanks
B00RW4KLNS|1|Do not buy. They are not durable. Flimsy plastic. They refused to give me a prepaid shipping label to return their product. Would not recommend this for anybody.
B00CR3RXTO|5|I just got hooked on this company and I haven't tried anything I didn't like so far.
B000BZ91SQ|1|definatly not the seal i needed for my transmission, amazon with telling me that it was. when in deed was not. no biggie tho.
B0006301VY|5|I changed to a MINI starter and this fits only stock size starters but it is still a great product.
B000GD5FMY|5|great glasses
B00NMPR454|5|This item is well made and is not bulky.
B0016GXOXW|5|This stuff is great, I use it on everything. I wish they made some for human consumption.
B00YY7M4AO|5|I was really afraid it wouldn't work, but I knew I wanted one that either had an off button, or had a smart sleep mode. I'm not a fan of dead car batteries in the winter, and I don't want to wear out the port with a cheaper unit that needs to be plugged into every drive. With this one I can leave it in and just tap the off button.<br /><br /> I'm not one to write reviews right away, but I've never had a Bluetooth device connect to my phone so fast before. Works great with torque, that's the only app I've used so far, but I'll see if any more work and update later maybe. Very friendly customer service too.
B0055T4RU0|5|always used kiwi products since I was a kid
B012LU6LJK|5|Without this tool, good luck getting the Glow plug harness off in one piece. I've heard a lot of horror stories of people breaking the glow plug harness so this was cheap insurance to get it done right!
B00UW4DNEO|4|Shipping was very fast, rec'd the item the next day. Very happy with the item, haven't used it to jump start a car yet but have used it to power a number of electronic devices. It comes neatly packed in a nice case along with all it's accessories.
B00CIVI2PY|5|work for 2007 Odyssey EX. Easy to replace, don't know how long it will last
B0067ECOCU|5|worked as expected
B00062ZZ2U|5|Nice added protection
B002NEWZI6|5|This is a very quick and cheap solution to failed struts.  These are very easy to install.  I don't know how long they'll last, but at this price and being so easy to replace, it's not that important.
B000BB7ABU|5|used on the interior floor of my wheeler and so far its holding up great.
B005PZMKZI|5|The covers fit perfectly and look good.  Have only ad them about a month and a half so will see how they will do as time goes on.
B00NF1R6US|5|Tight fit with some air filters. If you are careful and make sure it is square before applying any force to it, it works great. Installed on an 08 avenger. Dodge's design was poor and flimsy so when you break yours, this one is a great replacement.
B00HND017Y|5|very nice clean cut stickers all the same no flaws I love the silver color
B00F66SRS0|5|item arrived on time and as described
B00LHUI4XM|2|So I'm not some license play connoisseur but some things were a little bothering. For starters the frame itself is pretty thin both in the thickness of the framed area  and the actual metal itself. This doesn't make it flimsy since it's made of metal but it is really light. It does however look a little unstylish. I drive a Mazda Rx-8 and it doesn't really suit the car well(not sure exactly why). Not to mention that I had a very large frame on for the past 8 years which left the plate stained. The thinness of the frame exposed these stained areas which I believe is a problem a lot of people might face. If you're not sure, remove your old plate and check if you are a victim of this issue before spending a whopping $25 on this frame. Also, the sides of the plate are not polished like the visible area. Although not visible when on the car. The sides are pretty ugly and could be a potential sight of wear?
B000SKV4P2|5|Best for your  herd earned money
B00BZ43WEG|3|Looks good but did reservoir seals did not fit inside the covers.  I had to file down the edges on the seals which caused a little bit of leaking from the clutch reservoir.
B00DG9K7PA|1|Do not order these if you plan on receiving a complete set of 8
B00HG2UEBA|4|Great item
B005G5RUMU|3|Boots run small or too big, no intermediate sizes make it difficult for a good fit.
B001V8U12M|5|works great.
B00IFZTUKI|5|Love feeling like I am in Hawaii everytime I drive my Jeep.  Little lose, but worth it
B00VWMKV1I|3|Designs are cool but the package grammar makes no sense. And I've had them on for one day and they're already peeling off. Cool but cheap
B00V64QADK|1|They're great you can order them, u won't get em,
B00U2C1KP0|5|once again thank you
B003V870YW|5|Fits nicely on the 100 yr anniversary Heritage Classic.
B00F675WNW|5|Fit perfectly, took no time at all to put in and solved the P0010 and P0011 code in my Pontiac Solstice GXP (2.0 Turbo).
B0002JMLQU|5|This helped my 1999 chevy . I know it won't make my transmission perfect, but it made a large improvement. I noticed a change in about 50 miles. Now with about 300 miles it seems even better. Not perfect, but much improved. BTW 120,000 miles on transmission.
B00HPS59AQ|5|Perfect fit. Used K&N air fitlers for years.
B00GZ88RZG|5|Perfect
B0058J4P86|5|There great easy to install. The only thing is they don't come with bulbs you have to use the stock ones which is fine.
B00AS9L75A|5|Oem! What else to say
B00R3QTXPW|5|Nice quality!
B000303YI2|4|Requires the key to lock and unlock.
B005NLQAHS|1|Does not work at all with my 99 f250. I'm returning it. This is not compatible with all vehicles
B003L2ZQ2Q|5|This is about as good of an oil filter as you will find.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Love it ... but the shipping was a bit much.
B00C43BMQW|5|just what i wanted
