B0024L5KQ2|4|The added groin bands help reduce pain from vulvar varicosities but is quite bulky. I can wear it at home under pajamas, but would not be able to wear it under regular clothes outside of home. I am waiting to receive the V2 supporter as well- hoping that one will be less bulky and that I can wear it under my clothes for long car rides.
B00HZV7G1I|5|Matched my sweater dress perfectly and was the finishing touch my Christmas party outfit needed!
B00JDEAC9S|5|Very pleased, good quality and it came quickly.  I will take off the ribbon because it is too short, this is an easy fix.
B00HWFH00O|5|Cute toddler girl's top.  Picture does not do it justice.  It has glitter that does not rub off. T-shirt is made well and out of high quality material. It runs true to size.  Colors are vibrant and best of all, my two year old grandbaby LOVES it!
B00K5R6N18|5|Perfect bra
B010F8TETY|5|Amazing..just right!  Golf, sports and everyday wear. Am ordering more!!
B00BPLS1CM|1|Cheap looking. I got the black, and it doesn't look like the picture. The picture is a dark shiny black and smooth fabric, whereas the actual shirt is slightly lighter, a little rough/textured and not shiny.
B0008EOBWQ|5|The fit was perfect, and the stain resistance was obvious when I pressed them.  Perfect for dress up, church, or anywhere.
B00HVT0O72|5|Comfy, if a bit small after washing.
B00JIHHJ0K|3|I like this top but it runs large and is a little too low cut.  You need to be careful when washing or it will really stretch out.
B00KC3DLJ2|1|I ordered a large and ended up with a small. Go figure! I learned my lesson with  ordering from this company.
B00J1YT9C6|2|I ordered a medium and that's exactly what I got; fits as expected and isn't too puffy or too thin. Unfortunately, the &#34;burgundy&#34; color is is more of a red-purple than a darker red shade. In the end, I tried to like it, but returned it in the end.
B00AYV8TOE|4|This robe was just as pictured got a great deal I am assuming because it was the last one in this color?<br />color is fine - it's just a robe fit was as expected  It's not thick but not too thin
B00W0TFND8|5|While this is a totally great cute dress, it is a little more sheer than the picture shows.  It's kind of boxy but great for a cover up!
B00T6RS7TO|5|I love this shirt! comfortable too!
B003GXFTGS|4|Only issue I have is the dual prongs. Sometimes it is hard to get them to both align, but then again, I do have a small belly.
B00J7HHVDQ|5|Great fit and durable jeans
B00A3Q8RHE|5|Thank you -  the dress is great!  I bought for a play and it looks and works PERFECTLY! I love it!
B00LQH0SM6|4|based on the images. they all look good,especially the yellow but I would like to know sleeve length and jacket length.
B00NZU5WMS|5|ok
B004XIZL86|5|The tag says in California this item does cause cancer??  It is made in China.  I am not planning to chew on it, but the chemicals must be their concern.  If that is the case, it should not be sold.  I purchased it to use as a coverup with my New York dress wearing to granddaughter's wedding.
B00GC2IA2K|5|The sock fit perfectly loved them
B00K6L4G3A|5|I really like this dress so much that I ordered another one! I ordered the white and just ordered the red also! Very pleased with the style and the length. I normally wear a 4-6, I've come to realize that many of the dresses on Amazon are cut very small.  I do not like to be hugged by my dresses ;o).  Therefore I ordered the 16 - I'm very happy that I did!  Though I normally wear a 4-6, I have hips and a bottom that causes certain material to cling/hug.  Really happy with the fit! I can wear to work and my spiritual meetings as well and feel comfortable and stylish but also modest. Again, very pleased with the length, it's so hard to find dresses that are not mini or just too short.
B004HWF5AM|5|Youj can sleep in these jeans or wear them like regular jeans.Flattering and comfortable.Worth the money.They also have skinny jeans in pajama jeans but i have yet to find them. Those would be really worth it.
B006MWQXQ0|5|I really like Diesel Larkee jeans and this might be my favorite pair.  Definitely my favorite pair for casual and comfortable days.  The relaxed cut is just slightly more forgiving than the regular Larkee cut, but not sloppy and baggy like a lot of relaxed fit jeans by other brands.
B00CIJABLO|4|I love Hatley, and paid more than I usually would for these. They are super cute and fit as expected. My daughter has had them for a year now and they are faded and not in as good shape, but she does wear them a lot!
B0000ANDEK|5|Wanted a well built jacket for upcoming weather and have had nothing but good experiences with carhartt. It's a great coat.
B00M24QB8M|5|Love, love, love these shirts.  Wish they made them in ever color..red, yellow, and spring colors...in the 3/4 sleeves.
B00BZ5TFOG|4|I like it, it is better than the other one sold on Amazon.  It needs to have some padding on the inside to allow it to fit on your head correctly and to make sure it doesn't sink in on your face.  Can be modified with a t-shirt, but would be better of not was built in.
B00BOQD72C|5|Lightweight, bright and lovely scarf that really punches up a simple summer skirt and t shirt. Very happy with this purchase and get lots of compliments!
B001VEID0S|4|Not exactly the same as the product used to be but very good.
B00MUKYZW2|5|These are nice pants for a nice price.  They are very soft and comfortable.  They shipped really fast with Prime too.
B000RWZWNQ|5|Nice vintage look.  Will look even better after a few washes. Back has tour dates from long ago.
B00GM2VGWQ|3|The design was great and the shirt was cool - but too small. I bought an xl and it didn't fit. I ended up giving it to my neice who usually wears a small or medium. She loves it though!
B00L5ZA4U0|5|By far my favorite burp cloths!  Others are not nearly as soft. Newborn skin deserves soft and silky. I ordered several more after using them and comparing them to others (eg Gerber). I highly recommend them!
B00KU3EQRA|5|Very nice. She and me liked it very much
B0050610YY|3|I wasn't expecting this to be a freshly ironed on t-shirt, and that's exactly what it is. I could have printed and ironed this on myself.
B00H5LN194|5|Perfect with a feather mask!
B00JO6ZCVS|5|think in asian sizes, if your american standard size woman your probably a large asian size... a Large fit perfect on my size 4 gfriend
B001PB7MV8|5|My sons head a just a little bigger then most kids his age but it fit just a little snug. But he loved it! Very well made and color is perfect
B005GLVMZU|5|Definitely closer to a size 14 for children.  I thought it might be too small for my size 12 son but he can probably wear it one more year.
B00M0G5SA4|5|Its a great quality bow tie! my boy used it for a wedding and everybody loved it! it comes very well packaged and seems to be made with a very tough fabric, so it will last long! I'll buy more with different patterns!
B00G2UBY2U|5|I really like the shirts Tri-Mountain produce. This has to be the 4th shirt I've received from them and it fits great and is great quality fabric. I also like the diamond pattern in the black part of the shirt. It fits as expected and since I ordered a 3XL, it's nice that I can tuck the shirt in comfortably.
B004VQWW3C|2|looks good from amazon pic, but the material is kind of cheapooo.. and stiff for toddler use.. the straps is not really comfortable
B00NPC6GSU|5|sexy underwear that makes the butt pop are comfortable to wear.
B005L3KIOY|3|While I really like the glove, the fit is poor. I would say my hands are average, but my fingers do not even come out the ends of the gloves and I am constantly pulling them up. As far as being able to text while wearing these gloves...NOT! If your fingers do not come out the ends of the gloves, you can not text! Would love these gloves if they fit better.
B00EVLVJJ0|5|I absolutely love these!  These have more support in them than they appear and they aren't so tight that they tug on my shoulders.  For health reasons I can't work out yet, but when I can, I'm sure I'll be wearing these under my clothes for support.
B001T4ZAP6|4|I recently became huge fan of long dresses.  I think Esprit dress is really good.  It has double layer so I don't have to worry about see-through.  It is little tighter, but it has side zip so not too bad.  It shows my tummy a bit.  I bought it when it was about $45.  It is now for less than $30.  I just wish I waited a little.  Hmm.  But, I think it is worth over $45.  I an new fan of Esprit.
B005HJ8P4C|5|Sizing chart was perfect.  Bought this for my sons welding class and if works perfectly.  He really liked the pocket that allows access to his pants pockets in addition to the other multiple pockets.
B005FONELI|3|I bought this for cool morning walks & runs and it's the perfect weight for it. The fit is pretty good. I wear a medium and it fit like most mediums.  Arm Holes are a little tight.  I'm hoping they open up a bit as the vest wears in. The white stitching for the logos on chest and back of neck could go away.  I will take a black sharpie to the white letters.  Needs an inside pocket.  Has MP3 Player pocket inside right zip pocket.  Will fit an IPod Nano, but not a touch.  Unfortunately, there is no pass through for headphone wire (you'll have to take your chances with the zipper).  All in all, not a bad product, but could be better.
B00O3JH6F6|1|Ridiculously small!!! I ordered this dress for my 7 year old to wear to a father/daughter dance which is a hawiian theme. I ordered the big girls size 7-8. It might fit a 3 year old. Now I have to pay to shop it back.
B00IID3TFO|4|very pretty, fits well, but looks better on the model obviously.
B00AKFPOZQ|5|I'm in love with this literally came in perfect conditions and a pretty bag  and a pin its perfect just and better than expected
B00J2LNTZQ|5|Excellent....
B00DN1BXRC|5|My son normally wears an XS but this is still a bit big on him. He's growing still though and was just so happy to have a real live chef coat. Great quality, it's obviously something those who work in kitchens actually wear. He loves it and wears it when he goes to his classes. Also his uncle, as a chef, recommends the brand.
B00CIR9S60|3|Buy a size or two larger than you think. The product was nice, but my daughter only wore it a few times before we had to give it away. The sizing is way off.
B00HXAV4NC|3|Excellent
B00I1EC37U|3|I tried on a size smaller at Macy's and it almost fit perfectly but it was a little small. I ordered this size online since Macy's out of it.  The larger size was way tighter than the size below from Macy's.  Very strange.  Great quality though!
B00GLQ7SGQ|5|Really cute!
B00B6EEAFU|5|A little pricy for a tee shirt but fits well and we'll see how long it holds up. So far so good.
B00K5TB03M|4|Husband likes this sweatshirt,however, he is a tall person and felt that the length of shirt was shorter than normal.
B000QHGDVM|5|Just as described
B00F1H1JQQ|1|Very disappointed ! I fake one .
B00SIXG5D2|5|I ordered a Medium (I looked at the comments and decided that I'd try it out because it seemed that people wanted it to be tighter) I usually wear medium because I don't like to wear tight clothing and it fits fine. I have kind of broad shoulders so the top part doesn't go as far out on them as I'd like but it's still nice. It's not a suuuper nice top but the material listings feel about right. For the washing... READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. I can tell people here didn't do that. It says to wash cold separately and no to tumble dry. That means delicate cycle with lowest spin (I do some spin because then it takes a while for the water to drain otherwise) and then hang it to dry. If you wash things like that, the fabric doesn't come undone. Also try not to wash it with anything that could get caught on the lace part (as in zippers, sequins, and buttons) Yes, that's kind of high maintenance but that's what you need to do with lace. Really nice top and fast delivery (ordered may 30th and received June 2nd. I live in northern CA- south bay area)
B008B909Q2|5|My Pink Turean Floral Scarf has arrived very fast, well before the shipping window end date.<br />I am very happy with this scarf. It is light as air, colorful (as pictured), and precisely what I wanted to give that extra girly oomph to my simple jeans-and-tee spring outfits.<br />The quality is very good - no run-in colors, no snags, or other flaws in fabric.  Just perfect.<br />My only dilemma about buying this scarf was if I should get the pink, or the purple one.  I chose the pink, but I wish I could have them both...<br /><br />The communication from the seller about the shipment being on its way was also prompt.  This is my first purchase from Gravity Trading and, I think, won't be the last.  The scarf + shipping was pricey but, once again, the truth in \\"you get what you pay for\\" became very apparent; no regrets whatsoever and, I'm pretty sure, this scarf will last me more than one season.<br /><br />I have not washed it yet, so cannot comment on durability but, with this kind of delicate fabric, it will be hand washed/line dried.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very feminine, very soft and pretty spring scarf, give this one a shot.
B006WP60LA|4|Robe is just what I was looking for. It gives me a feeling of luxury when I wear it and if I have on a face mask the I get the spa feeling.
B00HW2K62Q|5|Love it!
B005F4T5R0|4|It's a great bag lots of room and has many pockets for things. You should make more bags like this!
B0018OLP60|2|517s don't have the slim line that they used to have - and the quality of the material is not as good.  Returned these jeans.
B00KT1D07K|5|Very nice, thank you
B00MN3M1KO|4|I ordered US Medium and instead received US Large. My son needed it for a ski trip so we went ahead and used it anyway. Other than that, great jacket!
B000YSGDEK|5|Bought these tower while jogging and they are great. Quality is very good, sizing was good for me. i'm 31&#34; waist and bought the small,would buy these again.
B00EZIGIKY|5|Very cute top, would still buy more if they had more colors.  A bit snug around the hip area because it fits kind long on me...but, losing a few pounds will help.  Since I'm in the process...this is even more incentive.
B009A0306C|5|I love this Vest.
B005GYGEXM|4|Again, comfortable, sleek. Worked out in them and enjoyed the feel on the skin!
B00EYZRG9A|4|as advertised
B009F85XRI|5|tHIS IS BEAUTIFUL,  WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WEAR IT.,  THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT AND IT IS WELL MADE.  bUT IT WAS TOO SMALL.  GAVE TO MY NIECE AND SHE LOVES IT.
B00GLMYVV0|5|So pretty, received many compliments
B0047F5OUU|3|It's nice and silky and pretty much what I was expecting for the price, except that it is way too short.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over 5'2\\"
B0046ED92W|4|Smaller than I expected, but since it has a little bit of stretch to it, it's pretty comfortable.
B0037KMI6O|5|After three years of ballet, I refuse to buy any other tights besides Capezio. They are sturdy and durable, and I don't find myself having to desperately order them week after week.<br /><br />I can't recommend these highly enough. Especially, if your daughter (like mine) likes to do extracurricular activities in these tights after ballet practice is over.<br /><br />One (minor) critique I have is that they do run a little small as other people have noted.
B006UCHLEU|3|This dress looked as pretty as it is show in the picture here. It was amazing but unfortunately I had to return it because it was too heavy for my 2 year old to wear. It seemed like it was 5 lbs or something. My little one is skinny but I think this dress would tire any 2 year old to wear for more than a half hour.
B00Q2ZXQW6|4|No consistency between pairs, or even between the same product of a different color.  Size is as expected though
B001JBNDLW|4|Basic brief as expected.  Good price.
B00IL16YFA|5|👍👍👍👍👍
B001FENH1E|5|I bought these boots as an accessory for my pirate costume this year and I absolutely love them! They are the most comfy boots I own and the best part is that if you flip the top flap up, they become ordinary going-out boots. So that means I can wear them year round!<br /><br />Love, love, love them!
B004D3HO5E|5|I bought two and use for both daytime and nighttime. They are just so comfortable! I am glad they are made of modal and cotton instead of Nylon. The support is fine for my size 38D. If you have a huge size, the support may not be enough.
B00DDQC1H8|3|good shorts, but fall apart at the seam after 6mo-1yr, but for the price, not too bad.
B00E2YSU3E|5|Warm, nice quality hat/mitten set.  Love the fleece lining.  Bought a 2T/4T size for my 18 month old - fits great (he has a large head).  Would order N'ice products again.
B00KF3C7CG|3|For the price it works. The footed part is a bit narrow.
B00K5KNKK2|2|Didn't like the material.
B000PCKGPC|5|Good product and it is consistent over the years
B000SMXNI6|5|I ordered this and I like it so much I ordered another one. the only colors available in my size are skintone and white, so I got skintone. White bras always seem to get grey and ratty. Lol! The first time I tried it on I just fell in love with it. It runs true to size, so it fits perfectly on me, 34B, looks great  (under a shirt, I hope), and has just the right amount of support for moderate activity. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but it seems to be well built for the price. This is for sure a great buy! I hand wash mine in cold water and mild soap.
B00CVSSHTU|5|Love it!
B007N1CXWW|5|I put this outfit on and feel so sexy it is ridiculous. It arrived sooner than expected with all of the accessories and in perfect condition. It's well made and awesome to wear!
B00D7TSRHO|4|This came a bit smaller than what i thought. I just hope it doesn't shrink. Should've gotten an XL instead of L. Kids grow out of things quickly.
B003IL82EY|4|Fit as described.  Pretty decent quaity as well.
B00IJATUT0|5|Great product , great price.
B00G7GQLZY|5|great
B00N4OJ1FO|4|Pretty good. The front is a little funky on me owing to it being &#34;one size&#34; and me not having much boobage there to fill it in, but the material is fun for part of a costume. Works better on me when I cover up the front of it -- which of course makes going to the bathroom difficult -- so I sort of wish I'd just gone for the leggings or the dress.
B008G29EVA|5|This is the first pair of toe socks that I can wear with my dance shoes and that did not show.  I wear a size 6aa and most toe socks cover my toes and too much of my foot so they show.
B0085212LQ|4|The blue was actually more like navy blue not royal blue, but its absolutely beautiful.
B0052MXMSI|2|I bought this dress since it looked very pretty on the model (as usual....) and I won't return it since I take full responsibility for buying it without trying it first (taking the risk). But as another reviewer said, it makes you 30 pounds heavier, specially if you are pear-shaped and thus you have big hips and a smaller torso.<br /><br />I hated the way I looked, like I was 8 months pregnant to give you an idea; and I am not that big (37 - 29 - 43, 130 pounds). I bought the M size, I think one of the main problems is that it has a LOT, and I repeat, A LOT of fabric which is folding multiple times on bottom.<br /><br />That creates the illusion of being much bigger on bottom than on top. It looks nice on the top part though. It could look nice on others body types. Also it depends how self-conscious are regarding your pear-shaped body.<br /><br />In sum, if you are<br /><br />1) pear-shaped<br />2) self-conscious about it<br />3) and want to dissimulate your pear-shaped body and try to make it an hourglass shape...<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT! you will regret it. I took the time to write this so you use my experience. As a pear-shape, try dresses that are<br /><br />1) light on top, dark on bottom<br />2) not too much fabric/folds on bottom, so attention is not drawn to that area, and also that makes you look bigger on the hips<br />3) draw attention to the top using jewelry, accessories, scarfs, whatever you prefer<br />4)stick with a dark, conservative bottom skirt. If you are short, short dresses or skirts are better.<br /><br />good luck!
B0058O7JOS|4|I purchased this costume for my 4 year old. The size small fit perfectly. There is not much variety online when it comes to biblical costumes for children so I had to get the Virgin Mary costume even though my daughter was supposed to be Ruth. I guess it was ok. She looked absolutely darling in it. Trust me, it looks so cute once your child is wearing it.
B00ABCFF0M|5|I love this top.  I ordered a size 6 and at (5'6 130lbs) it covered my whole midsection which I prefer.  It does plunge deep, but my 32B chest doesn't reveal much (no gaping- one of the problems I have with other bathing suits  and even bras since I can't fill out the chest area.)  I paired it with some white swim shorts.
B00AHCIRNS|5|Being a big man, it is often hard to find a large pair of pants that fit well. Well, look no further! These pants fit true to size, have a comfortable waist-bad and look nice to boot!
B00MXBR4C6|3|We purchased this shirt for our son to wear around the family, so that he could tell everyone he was going to be a big brother. We own a bunch of carters shirts and for some reason this one runs small.
B003C7JK1S|5|I really like this hat. It looks classy but can be worn in any situation. The rough leather feels nice and the buffalo nickels give it character. I definitely recommend it and Minnetonka
B000CBUHRS|5|It was very difficult to find a 3x Santa suit. They had it, and I needed it right away for a commercial shoot. This was a great place to do business, as they had it in inventory, packed, and shipped it out immediately, and it was better product than I thought I was getting. I would definitely do business with them again.
B005S5H7P8|3|This top is cute but intended for people with small torso I wore it and I could see my belly botton whe I lift my arms.. don't know if it is meant to be like this.. I didn't like this so  I gave it to my sister who is shorter than me.
B00HSWLNKY|4|Quality and product was as expected, but the fit was too small.  My husband wears a size 10 and that's not even the top of the size it's supposed to fit.  So, keep that in mind if you are a size 10 or above.
B002OWUA48|3|Very nice shirt.  Looks even better when you hold it in your hands. Very soft, comfortable cotton, too.  And a very big disappointment.<br /><br />The BF and I had just returned from a trip to Vermont.  I decided to order him a shirt as a surprise.  However, this shirt is NOT true-to-size.  My BF has worn XL sizes in everything for years.  When we opened the package today, my reaction was that the shirt was going to be too small.  When he tried it on, unfortunately, I was correct.  Fits like a size Large.  Great shirt, otherwise.  If not for this one issue, I would award product at least 4 stars.  Now I have to hassle with returning to the seller.
B00G18VDUQ|5|I bought this to embellish , and it was just what I expected.  Lays nicely and fits as excpected.  I used a couple of bobby pins to hold it in place just in case.  It is satin, after all, and therefore a little slippery on the hair ;-)
B0073MLZ70|5|The wallet was great quality, the wallet arrived on time as well as when I expected.  I like the craftsmanship and feel.  Thank you
B00KXBIKEO|5|Shipped very fast!My head measures 23in. and I normally wear a 7 3/8 or a large,which is what I ordered. This is a little bit big but I can pull it down over my ears and it fits good then.I may look funny but I don't care, it's a work hat.I'd definitely rather have it too big than too small.I could, and might, wear a headband along with it.Next time I will get a medium.Other than that I am very happy with it.
B00B6E8POM|5|My 6 year old begged me for a mood ring. I could not find any locally so I ordered this one. She loves it!
B0009MII94|2|i bought it according to my 6 year old son's size but still it was too large i wore it !!
B00GEK4JGG|5|Very flattering and sturdy, good for pool and laps.
B00KHWGUBY|5|Fit my daughter great! She loves it
B0006OL53G|5|I've been a fan of Led Zeppelin since I heard them for the first time - that was in 1969. Naturally I like to wear a Zep T-shirt every now and then. This is one of my absolute favorite pieces of clothing, and I only wear it on weekends! I don't want my job to spoil it!
B007MN1N5O|4|Just received my shorts and found that like everything else the material is thinner (just like all t-shirts).  I do not think they are making this style anymore and that is sad.  I have Yellow, Pink, dark blue, light blue and the new pair of shorts and would have bought more if they were available.
B00R8SFWEQ|5|I am normally a small in everything, 34A cup. I ordered a large because of all the reviews. Well the top is a little big but I was planning on sewing in some padding anyway since I am flat-chested so really no complaints! The bottoms fit well, thank goodness I lost some weight otherwise I do not know how they would have fit lol. At least the top sheer cover drapes over your butt so even if your booty pudges out it is not noticable! Overall very pleased, this is a beautiful swimsuit!
B00F99PAMU|5|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it!  Arrived quickly with original tags.
B00MEVCYMK|5|Although I received a different color than I ordered,I love this scarf.It is so soft and warm and very versatile.
B00J5HEC2G|5|Enjoy it!
B00CORTCCE|5|Very happy with purchase.
B00HVRAPV4|5|Love it!!!! Been looking for this scarf for months
B00HQNHKR0|3|You can also!
B0034G65BU|5|Going to the store to purchase underwear is very irritating, so I decided to look for some online. These underwear are just the right size and very comfortable.
B00JQRS9R4|5|As good as I expected.
B00MJMVEDO|5|Love the pink color, great style with loose fit, great print, soft n cozy, LOVE it!
B00IYJT85M|5|perfect
B00L9ZAXU2|5|Loved it!
B00EAM6666|4|The coat fit as expected and looks so adorable on. It seems to be warm, although the weather is not exactly right for this type of coat just yet. But it is beautiful. The detail is what makes it stand out.
B00LO7SHQ2|2|Bad memories
B008FCYSJ4|5|I love this hat it's very comfortable and I got lot's of compliments. It is super cute!!! Would buy again!!
B00BBPVKD4|5|I love everything pattyboutik!!  The sweaters are beautiful and fit perfectly.  I have about 6 other pattyboutik sweaters in my amazon que!
B00K5MQ8R2|5|Fit Perfect And Fabric Wasnt That Cheap How i Expected i Liked It And So Did My Hubby
B0012IUZTU|3|my granddaughter wore them,but they did not look that good on her. she is kinda hard to fit.
B0009G8XS6|5|I got it on sales for $9! Soft, warm and very good quality. The color was as shown. I really love it!
B00JMQ612E|1|If you have a larger bust, dont even bother. Cups are too small. No support what so ever.
B00FDYE2Z2|3|Fit as expected but seems to have permanent creases in the skirt which makes the bottom fit a little weird
B00AIEGC5K|4|Love this little set on my son.  The gown is especially soft and sweet looking.  Always getting complements on our Zutano baby clothes.
B000KGIEPC|5|They are perfect - they make your legs look nice and it's great to wear your open toe shoes and feel comfortable.  They are very silky and<br />classy looking.  I am very happy.  Thanks!
B00JFPVHHG|4|What a pretty little outfit!  Looks so pretty on my grandaughter!
B004NPKCB0|5|Sizing is pretty much exactly as described. Wonderful, thick material. Not cheap or thin. I would definitely buy again!
B00168ADBG|4|Bought specifically for biking (Bicycle) to work. My gf had complained of bugs in her eyes ad tearing up well riding in the cold. So far they have worked great. Seem a bit flimsy but what do you expect from goggles this cheap.
B00CTSFGJG|5|My granddaughter looked so pretty in the dress
B0009QE8M6|5|I bought this shirt for a guy friend, he said the shirt is perfect.  he said that it would be a good shirt for boys/men who ride bmx or dirt bikes to wear because it is tight fitting.  he loves it and recommends it to everyone.
B008H8V61E|5|I was concerned at first when I found out that the pants are automatically sized 6&#34; smaller than the jacket since I normally wear pants that are 8&#34; smaller. On the reviews that I read before ordering, a lot of people said that the pants ran on the small side, so I took a chance and ordered anyway. The suit did not disappoint, it fits perfectly! It also came on the day they said it would, which was very quickly. I would order from them again with no reservations.
B00D3HTM7O|5|I have ordered this style several places and am very pleased with them
B001G6POUI|5|The measures where acurate, nice cut, surprinsinly fresh and cool, i was expecting a sweat box, since i live in a tropical country but no. Overall very good product, and a very cheap price
B009JWIE2Q|5|Good quality, very cozy and warm and my daughter loved it. It was a big hit at her school and got so many compliments on it. She would drive me crazy to put a jacket on even when she's turning purple, now she won't take it off.. I wish I gotten one for me 😬 I think I'll get me one!
B008CD5QOM|4|Item arrived quickly as always from amazon. Ordered a large but label said xl. As it happens it fits ok if slightly large but that's fine with a sweater on. Could be it is a large but mislabeled which is why these sell so cheap. The coat itself is great though very comfortable and well made. The bib I wasn't sure of but figured I coud,take its off. It does however work really nicely and makes a big difference in cooler weather especially if you dont wear a scarf. All around a very nice coat especially for the price!
B00C6U1SAI|5|The quality of the costume such as the stitching and the fabric used is wonderful & such a great deal.  The costume came in a garment bag which really beneficial for shipping & storage for after use.  There are slits in the bag that create pockets to store the collar and head piece in an organized way.  There is no quick release in order to get into or out of the costume quickly.  Meaning, there is no zipper.  One must untie the back lace up section and have it retied in order to get into the costume.  For me personally, I needed help to get in & OUT of the costume.
B00GP15W1A|5|Awesome shirt i was exicited to see this printed !
B00JADTIRY|2|The fit is awkward! I bought it for my two year old and even though I got size 3, it is still tight near the waist.
B00AJM5QTY|4|Love THESE jeans! They fit true to size, for me, and wash well. They price is not that bad either.
B00GSNHM5O|5|Everything went well
B00KSFD3CY|4|Very Very warm! Well-made and comfy!
B009W1L8Q8|5|FINALLY - great shirts with sleeves and tails that are long enough :).
B00HRNADXW|5|Great shirt
B008AT4M0C|5|I really wanted a true ivory color, but this was more of an off white.  Other than that I love it!  It fits great, looks great, is not too heavy but is heavy enough.  Great sweater!
B001I0SVX4|5|My husband, who is a hat guy, has wanted a bowler/derby for a while, so it was the perfect anniversary gift. This hat is soft, high quality wool felt, beautifully lined and the size it is supposed to be! I could not be happier!
B00E9UTDH8|5|They fit perfect and were super comfortable. They were so comfortable it made me realize how uncomfortable my other ones were.
B00DHUAU4Q|4|These leggings are extremely comfortable. The waist band is higher and thicker  than most leggings have, and it's about 5&#34;- 6&#34; &#34;tall&#34; (meaning length up and down. I don't know what terminology would make more sense), and it's very stretchy, but tight enough to truly keep the leggings from sliding down at all.  But you should be aware that the leggings themselves are very much on the sheer side-not at all opaque. The picture doesn't portray just how sheer they are, so anyone who doesn't read the customer reviews may be in for a surprise. Because of the patterns on the leggings and the type of panties I wear, my panty lines do not show, but I can tell that other types of panties may very well leave panty lines quite visible. If you're planning to pair them with a tunic that won't be a problem, but if you may wear them with a shorter top it's definitely something to take into consideration. They're of adequate quality as far as workmanship goes, about what you should expect for under $10. But the main reason I gave them only 4 stars is because they run pretty small. I wear a size large and they fit me a bit on the tight side. Not too tight, but tighter than I expected them to be considering the product information says they will fit from size Small through Size Extra Large. Size Large is usually fairly loose on me, and I can't see these leggings fitting anyone who's even a little larger than I am. So if you wear a size XL, or if you wear a size L but it's a bit on the tight side on you most of the time, then these leggings are NOT what you're looking for! That being said, the Sellers are excellent in working with you if you do purchase them and find you need to exchange them or want a refund! I ordered 3 pairs of these leggings at the same time--all from the same seller and all the same size, but in different patterns. But due to a fluke one of the pairs was actually a child's size with the wrong sizing label on them. The Seller went out of their way tosend me another pair in that design, and I got them only 48 hours after contacting them for the first time. (The replacement pair were the same size as the two pairs from my original order that had fit me). So at least you know that if you do purchase these leggings but are dissatisfied for any reason, you'll have no problem getting a prompt exchange or refund. I'm actually pretty happy with these leggings, and as long as you're not looking for some that are opaque, or need some that will fit a size XL (or even a large size Large), you probably will be too.
B00ASIUJPA|4|Great price, they delivered the dress on time all the way to Costa Rica. Their communication was super professional since the beginning so I felt secure.Tthe dress is just like the picture, only the straps can be a littke different. I  recommend George Bride.
B0064BL882|2|The plastic part of these concealers is bulky enough to press against my skin in an uncomfortable way.  I won't ever wear them.
B005EQJJRK|3|These are flimsy and thin. If your child likes to play long hours in the snow than these won't keep him warm. Double up on the clothes underneath this suit. Wet seeps through as well. True to size, they fit fine on my son who is 6 going by regular sizing. One of the legs was sewn wrong therefore I have a feeling we got factory seconds, but I didn't have time to send them back.<br /><br />In all fairness though for the price I guess this is what we get. Look for a sale from Carhart or on snowsuits that normally cost a lot more.
B006ZBLN7C|4|The tee shirt matches perfectly with my mask and wig. Wore it for my halloween costume and got a few laughs
B00MFQSVJ4|3|I bought these polos for work. I got blue wake, cobalt blue, rich red, and slate grey. The colors are really rich and look nice. I haven't tried washing these shirts yet so I'm not sure if their claim to be &#34;low-pill&#34; is accurate. I usually wear medium shirts but you never know with women's shirts so I went with a large and it fits fine. Roomy enough to be comfortable. These shirts are really long though so expect to tuck in the shirt. The quality is not really good. If you hold the shirt up to the light, you can see light through it. Basically, the material is really thin. With my company, it's $20 a shirt including the company logo so not too bad but if I had another choice, I'd have bought a different brand shirt.
B00M2UC5YU|2|I like the color and the texture of the leather. However, the construction is way too flimsy to hold up against normal wear and tear. Bill capacity could also a problem, since it would be too thin to hold many bill.s However, this would fit better as a formal wear wallet, thanks to its small size and shape.
B00M0EOLRC|4|A little small for a 4\5
B00C1EQEZ8|2|What I received is almost red and the fabric is Acrylic, but see picture here it shall be very light orange, and either Modal or Lycra Fabric.<br /><br />If Amazon provide snap uploading function here, I'll show the actual thing I received.
B004PBJ27C|5|I just ordered the Bellefit and I am very excited about using it. So ready to get back to my pre-baby body.
B000J45N9A|5|Fits to size.  Quality is good.  My girls liked the color and designs.  The price is really good for this pack.
B00546ER40|5|I was amazed when the socks arrived as they are a heavier weight, better made and much prettier than I expected.  I was an all around good deal and will be looking for this seller in the future.
B008YCTOJ4|5|Made well but just to small. Hard to tell how something will fit when you buy online. I will return them.
B004R853YY|5|It seems silly to rave about leggings, but these are great. They run slightly small - I usually wear a medium in leggings and the large fit perfectly - a tiny bit of extra fabric, but still snug, and they don't fall down. In fact, I have to say, the waistband is one of the best parts as it holds well without contributing to a muffin top. I'm a little too middle aged to feel comfortable wearing them with just a shirt, but with a long top or mini skirt, they look great. They don't look like leather per se, but can pass for pleather - just a lot more comfortable. I liked them enough to get them in two colors, black and brown.
B00JB94MUU|4|3 year girl fits 5,the clothes is a little small
B0051EDDQ8|5|I love the style of these Lee pants!  These are my go-to brand every year before school starts!  I'm an elementary teacher-librarian which means there is no telling where I'll be sitting, kneeling, standing, or crawling during my work day.  These pants go with everything (string is my favorite color) especially our assorted colors of polo shirts with our school logo.  The BEST PART of this order was a size that needed no alterations...this has never happened before!  Since I'm a little &#34;height challenged&#34; but wear a 14, usually the rise is a little too long and the length is way too long.  I was so excited that I unpacked them, tried them on and hung them in my closet! Nothing to fix!  These pants in the past have been durable to wash and dry and have held up well.  I often travel with 2 pair because they go with everything and I can dress them up if I need to with a jacket.  Enough said...I can't believe I found my perfect size!  Please keep  making those &#34;short + petite&#34; sized pants.  There are more than a few short people out there!♥
B003IBP9XG|1|Product color was not as the picture described
B009NP9144|1|This t-shirt appeared not slim fit!It wasn't clear to write why that it is slim fit, on quality the goods appeared average!
B000Q3ABDW|2|The look of this head wrap is weird, it is very shiny with lots of pink, purple and gold. I thought it would have muted colors, but this is quite vivid and very shiny.    Although it is odd looking it fits well and feels great.    I gave it two stars because it fits well, but I did not rate it better because it looks ridiculous to me. If you are in to flamboyant wear this may be just the thing for you.
B00E9Y56SY|5|Very nice/ 2nd time ordered as they are so nice - fit perfect- no lines
B0030BELGU|5|like every other Levis product, very high quality and style. i am sure this belt will be with me for years to come. its very strong but soft leather.
B00KI213MO|5|I love it, well made breathable fabric a great gift idea my husband wears it everywhere.
B000NWOA06|5|Forget buying those baggy \\"pajama\\" jeans. These are the bomb. They are comfy, look great, hold you in without pinching, and never bag in the knees. Well worth it at any price.
B00Z0AWNG4|5|Great !!!
B00EZBZRW6|5|Nice quality, slim junior fit, which was nice for my 10 year old niece. She loved it! She looks very cute in the t-shirt.
B00AX6QYN8|5|SO Cute!  stayed on well.  Everyone loved them!
B008NCYBYS|1|See thru and black lettering on front and back insides. They aren't a one size fits all. I'm a 6 and they are too big but are especially loose around my calves.
B0085MRPP8|5|Its a great hat. I love it. Great quality, and looks fantastic. It'll wash easily too. I'm a happy customer!
B007PF74S4|4|The color pattern and stitching of this necktie is superb; however it might be a little longer than normal.  It was also difficult to get a tight knot perhaps because the microfiber fabric is a bit &#34;slicker&#34;.
B003NX8C6K|4|Lighter weight than a other fleeces but that's what we wanted. Fits well. Color is good.
B00OURQFVC|4|I am 5'5 and 115 pounds and I normally wear S/M size but knowing that their size run small I got a L one. It fits okay to the torso but it's too tight in the sleeves. It's really pretty though,I just wish I would have gotten an XL.
B00KHCGKH8|4|Pretty good
B005KU8DI6|5|The color matches perfectly with all other tiffany blue wedding items. I have not put it in the little one yet but I am sure it will be just fine.
B00OPQ3ME6|5|Awesome belt. I bought this belt for my son's birthday. I ordered the custom one, because he needs a 54-56 in. He absolutely loves it and it looks so nice. But, I had two issues. I opted for the slow shipping because my son only  comes home on weekends from work. Would'nt you know it came a week before it was due to arrive. Thankfully he didn't realize what was in the package. Also on the bottom of the box it said xl. I had a moment of panic until I opened it. Thank you for a great product!
B008G4PGNI|1|I have many belts, but this one is by far the worst belt purchase. I bought this thinking it would function as any belt. The item was delivered on time, and at fisrt I was happy, and when I first put it on it looked great. The color is a bone white, and it looks nice. Only once I bent down, breathed to hard, or did anything more then a sudden movement the belt would pop off. I am not a heavy girl so my weight was not the problem, although I thought maybe it was a smaller size. Therefore I gave it to my 8 year old daughter thinking it would fit her better, and the same thing happened to her. Basically it was a waist of money. I would NOT recommend this product if you plan on breathing
B00B6EATC8|5|The teal is more emerald green then blue green no hints of blue whatsoever. But still love it as I couldn't decide between the teal or green. I'm happy with it. But it's emerald not teal. Very soft and hope it will last just as long as the one I purchased back in 05. And still love.
B00XIRLRUO|4|Nice shirt very comfortable.
B00EOM0U1O|5|I really liked this outfit on my daughter!
B00EZTSDSS|4|good, nice to wear
B00KHB8HSY|1|I expected these to be like other leggings I own, which are basically jersey stretch pants. These are more like footless fleece tights, and I would not wear them as leggings.  I wear a size 22 and bought the size 3x/4x and could not get them on past my knee. Was disappointed based on other positive reviews!
B00BF331LQ|5|This bathing suit is absolutely beautiful. It fits perfect, and super pretty. The color is very eye catching and the picture does it no justice. Super comfortable and I got lots of compliments.
B0085TIE74|5|I don't write many reviews, but these pants exceeded my expectations.  I expect rugged quality from Carhartt, but these pants are constructed very nicely.  The fabric is very heavy, but a smooth, soft hand makes them way comfortable.  Wish they had more colors, though.
B0095K6154|5|On time and very good quality, love that it have a little bit of brown.
B00FWKEJ6Y|5|ok
B00BTX7SB6|4|i am able to fit all my credit cards and stuff easily without the wallet bulging out.
B0094MU8HA|5|I get compliments all day, every day I wear it. This is also WAY better than any silly costume I've seen. It's reasonable to wear out and I love trying to protect it from stains. Should order a second one soon. Wish we had more buying options... you could go a long way with these themes... Storm, Jean, Cyclops, Colossus... it would be very easy to market this brand. Just a suggestion!!! What are you waiting for? BUY THE DAMN SHIRT. It's flipping cool.
B00NPKWDHA|4|Beautifully made cap, but, a bit on the small side for 2 1/2 year olds. We tried to stretch it and it did help a little. I suggest a little bigger next time its made. Mother's loved the looks and the workmanship.
B00H9MWYZ6|5|Good fit.  Thank you for getting it to me quickly.
B00VI07X4W|3|This top was very tight, even though I ordered the 3X that I usually wear in all other tops that are very loose on me as I like things that are loose.
B00H4L150C|5|Bought for my 14 year old son. He's happy with it so, so am I!
B0081GDHMS|5|I love dickies because they last long and they are low maintenance pants.
B002MDKJBI|4|I really like HUE products and these did not disappoint.  However, I prefer the look of Hanes Reflections when wearing dresses. The Hanes are thinner and run easily.  For cold weather, the HUE's are better!
B006R88CLI|1|Not what i expect, too tiny!! I'm so disappointed with this bag, I'm also feel  stolen, and I consider this as a false publication.
B00JE5B0QU|5|Absolutely loved this blazer...beautiful color
B00F9T6E20|5|I had found these in an outlet store, but didn't have my size.  I was very happy to see them on line.
B00BGM35XK|5|The first time I put this dress on (for a karaoke bar birthday party), I was told it was too fancy and I shouldn't look better than the bday girl. To be fair it is a very very nice, heavy but slippery fabric on the skirt. Looks very lush. The bust is elegant too.
B00IT2WMB6|5|As advertised
B00DB292A8|5|Most comfy bra ever. Cheapest on Amazon ($40 elsewhere).
B00J2D7QUS|3|I like these for comfort but they're too thin and cheap looking to wear for anything but that. Also they kinda fall down a lot.
B0040Z38JG|3|if you are in the 10% of the male population that is 6' and over, and fairly slender, the sizing will be ideal for you. If you are under 5'9\\", you'll be frustrated by the sizing. Because I'm short (5'6\\") and chubby (38\\" waist), I ordered the L size. After wearing them, I can see that I'm not going to get any support unless I pull the waistband up to my belly-button. (But I don't wear any pants that high. Alas.) This is frustrating, because I bought them specifically for their sweat-wicking properties, because I wanted to use them when exercising. If I lose weight and my waist-size becomes smaller, these underwear will still be too large.  Until I bought these, I never realized that so-called *low-rise* briefs are actually underwear for short guys.<br /><br />I'm particularly frustrated by the sizing issue because I'm quite impressed by the material and workmanship, both of which are excellent.
B007646IKO|1|This belt is poor quality.<br />It's buckle is too  narrow for the belt.<br />It it very inconvenient to use this belt and its edge has been worn very serious now.<br />I'm not satisfied.
B0064YQHA8|5|Love this onesie..super cute, gave it as a gift to a friend for her baby shower, perfect for the outdoor type folk.
B0047DT6OM|5|This is the second one I've had.  Wore out the first one! It's simple, comfortable, and easily washed.  Very pleased.
B001NEKAWK|5|Worn this style for years.  Long wearing as it holds up well with laundering.  Very satisfied.
B00B7NZY9G|5|This Sweater fit perfectly & was of excellent quality! Fit to size. Would recommend without a doubt. Our grandson loved it!!
B004YCUVBS|3|They tend to fall down throughout the day.  And could offer more compression.
B00FHCBN34|2|I taught that the top was going to be cotton.. didn't like the fabric at all..only looks cute in the picture....
B004882G5C|5|Gloves were much nicer than I had anticipated; also larger. These gloves are generously sized.  My husband usually has a problem with glove size XL being slightly too small, so I ordered XXL. Unfortunately, I had to return them.  I requested the seller to exchange them for the same glove in a size XL.  So far, I have had no reply from the seller.
B00T11TDD4|5|Great swim short at a good price. I may be ordering a second one
B00BRXVUEO|5|I just got this bag today and I really,really love it!! It is really sturdy and feels like it can hold some weight,which is a good thing because I tend to carry around a lot of stuff. It is bigger then I thought it would be,but I love big bags so its a good thing. I highly recommend this bag.
B00DV0XJKO|4|I have purchased this one for my wife, she use to tell people she does not drink because she would look bad in Orange. I set out to prove her wrong, because I felt she would look great in this dress and in orange, She has gotten so many complement's on it and just about fell over.<br /><br />Edit: As many reviews have stated pay attention to the sizing guides, Many of these are Designed and made out side the US. in China Korea, so a small is XS and a Med is S. Use the measurements guide to help pick the correct size. Good Quality IMO. My wife likes it and looks good in it. She is 5'2\\" and athletic build and a Large worked for her
B00H3WE5AY|5|This is my 2nd cap I have purchased from Chemo Fashion Scarf, and I will be purchasing more of these. The quality is the best and there are so many colors/styles to choose from.
B00HUM7R8Y|4|I'm a 36DD. I bought that size and it fits pretty much as expected.I just started jogging and i feel very secure. Its kinda hard to get on, but once its on, the &#34;girls&#34; aren't going anywhere. I think they may be getting smaller since I've been working out. It works, but I think I'm going to try it in a smaller cup size.
B009DZUFTY|2|It broke very easily
B000783S2C|5|Great quality and durability. Minor shrinkage but tight around the neck. I should have bought more of these than the others.
B00M41LL6U|5|Good 👍🏼
B00R9XLXAC|5|We were going to visit our daughter and granddaughter and I wanted something light that I could throw on if it was chilly. I bought and returned several. I was so pleased by this sweater. It was the perfect weight and nicely designed. When I washed it, I saw that it was made in Minneapolis. That explained the excellent quality. It washed like a dream. I dried it flat and then tossed it in the dryer for a few minutes to get the wrinkles out. I wish it came in other colors.
B008VPS8DM|5|So soft and true to size.  I bought a pair for my son and now am ordering a pair for my husband.
B003GXFTFY|4|nice belt
B002DGOYV0|5|This was purchased to go with a dress I also purchased on Amazon. Wasn't sure it would work together but luckily it did. Looked like they came together. The wrap was just enough to cover up and still looked dressy enough for a fancy wedding.
B001BKPGJS|5|Can you say pink camo!!!!!  I love this shirt.  It's great, fits right...and I get more compliments on it everytime I wear it.
B00DC69RXK|1|Save your money.  I bought this fur for a Christmas present to me.  When it arrived, it was not the same as pictured on Amazon.  I was very disappointed in this product!
B00JERVGUI|1|Over all the bra is way to small. Ordered a 36HH, the band is way to tight and the cup is way to small.
B00ORL477U|4|They feel great, I can barely feel them on and they wick moisture away quickly. They don't really ride up at all and they hold everything in place nicely.<br />Now, my only error was getting the wrong size! The sizing chart listed 32-34 as Small. I didn't see the entry at the bottom that said to order 1 size up. I needed Medium, I could probably get away with Large too. I will give these other 3 packages to my nephew and order a larger size. The color was okay, gray but not the gray I expected (kinda like alien skin gray). ~BlueIsaac
B00NPEMYLQ|5|My son will only wear Hatley pajamas.  We are on the 4th pair and he loves them!
B00HFO3HZY|4|I have become a bit amazon fanatical. So easy to search for items on my phone. The last 10plus yrs I have used destination xl 4x underwear. At 11$ a pr now, I thought i'd ck an alternative. These were less money; they fit fine.  They feel a tad lighter, so might not wear as well. Most of DXLs stuff lasts a long while.
B00IMOAMMW|4|i wish they made these in a larger size and a thicker material.
B00D4KDI6G|5|perfect
B003AP454E|5|A super cute costume! I thought that this costume was very cute for the price. My only comment would be is that it is one size fits all and it might be a little tight if you are a larger woman or have a larger chest.
B00KGSCR8Y|5|Very cute! I bought 2 of these for my granddaughters! a fun little outfit and comfy to boot!
B00DRGU4QE|5|My wife is in love with this suit she's very modest and well I don't like to share her beauty. Love the suit seems like it will last a long time.
B0027VT5X8|4|the mask comes a little creased, but nothing that you can not fix... also its not so white like the one in the picture but i like it even more, the best is the hat. Excellent for the price
B00KORB4HW|5|Great price!  Exactly want was expected
B00HMHKTNW|5|I got this for my dad for Christmas. He owns a numerous amount of tall tees, but has never had a tall sweatshirt. HE LOVES IT! Tall clothing for men can be really expensive, but I paid $26 dollars for this (which is about the price of a regular size hoodie). Some colors are more expensive than others but that is VERY common in retail (colors go with the seasons). Quality is great for my carpenter dad. Will definitely buy him one in every color!!!
B009UXU5R6|5|I THINK THE SCARF IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND COLORFUL.  IT IS FOR OUR SON WHO IS RATHER CONSERVATIVE IN HIS DRESS AND I THINK HE WILL BE VERY PLEASED.  MY HUSBAND AND I WERE CERTAINLY PLESED WITH  THE SCARF.
B00BWFW8LQ|5|These are ao versatile and so cheap. Have been wearing them since I got them. :)
B00FPHXVFE|2|the shirt was very pretty, however the stitching is of a poor quality, when my daughter put on the blouse several stitches opened, on the sleeve and shoulder. we were very disappointed.
B00KBZSTFW|4|I expected that a preteen boy of normal build would swim in a man's small.  It fits him very well.
B0018OT5GC|5|EXCELENTES JEANS
B00DYYP2IE|3|I am generally always a 1x. this shirt seems to run quite small, so small that I don't want to wear it until i lose a few pounds.
B006JL2HKU|5|These fit great, I like the lower waist and the skinny legs are fun too. I wore them with my cowboy boots!
B008BF5N9Y|5|Trip to NYC from Florida. My daughter needed gloves but wanted the ability to still use her iPhone. She loves them
B00F9BA4UQ|5|They are adorable and fit well. Grandson loves them
B00GC3VI14|2|bad  and cheap quality
B00J23DOI6|4|the dress is pretty and the material is little is not very soft, but I think is little hot for summer. but the price is little too high for this type of dress.
B00GWUF94O|5|Perfect fit. As always from Calvin Klein jeans.
B00KF6T2DA|2|I'm a size 4, but can still fit into my size 2 pants. I mostly wear a size small shirt and sometimes a medium. I got this item in a size medium and I couldn't even get into it. If I were ever to try this item again, judging by how it fit... I'd try an XL.
B000KGKBOO|5|My name is Cynthia and through out the years have always managed to end up working outside. My currant position I drive a forklift and make deliveries from point A to point B. In doing so encounter all kinds of weather and its not a its to cold outside cant do this now kinda job. My last camoflauge coat lasted 15 yrs and started to let me down last year. Started looking and knew I wanted a mans coat, good fit, stay dry and warm. Got all this and more from my coat I love it. Get a lot of compliments on it especially from the men. When they see the Carhartt emblem they know Im a lady who knows her job and good quality when I see it.  Thank you for a good quality affordable coat.
B005J80FQW|4|its ok
B001W0ZG5G|5|These Onesies are made of very nice material, I love the way they feel. I will buy again!
B00GYX2MVW|4|Nice product.  Less than 1/2 the price of Nike compression shorts I had just purchased at Dickx.  They fit as well and the quality is as good.
B003XIHZXG|4|As anyone who owns an ASUS gaming laptop can tell you, it is hard to find a backpack that can actually hold the thing.  This bag works well with room to spare.  The construction also seems to be quite durable, so longevity should not be a problem.  I would recommend this bag to anyone willing to spend this kind of money on a backpack and who needs to carry a large laptop.
B00IYIOSX0|5|It is fine, but it is too thin.
B00KHJNZ6K|5|Love that the hood is a soft, stretchy material.  Really pretty color, too!
B00OP3XMT4|1|The material is horrible.. No stretch to it and very uncomfortable to wear.. Love the saying.. Do not like tee shirt material.
B0096E7UZO|5|A git for my grandson. The sweatshirt appears to be well-made. It's thick enough to be warm. I bought DC because that is the only brand my grandson will wear.
B00SNBFNFU|4|Maidenform is synonymous with quality undergarments for women. I have been using this brand since I was a preteen. This fit as expected and never rode up on me throughout the day which is something that usually happens with other brands. I have to say that it is a true fit and it doesn't fade in the wash, ever!
B0024J07QC|4|This item is very cute and as described, except that it is a Juniors size XL, which would put it at about a Ladies Medium.  I'm using it for a costume so sponge bob's head will just be a bit stretched out across my bosom.  after that, it's probably going to my niece.
B000C4UATA|2|I ordered these because my child needed one t-shirt for a Father's Day project at school. When I received the shirts, one had two snags and strings hanging from the neck seam. Another shirt had an ugly black spot stain on the front (which did not come out in the wash). The third shirt was fine. I decided to keep them only because my daughter needed a shirt for her school project and I did not have time to go to the store to buy another one and one of the three shirts did work. So, in effect I got one shirt for the price of three. Not the deal or the convenience I had hoped to have.
B00JGG7K52|5|Looks great just needs a little bit of stretching and it will be prefect for a the summer! Can't wait
B00L9HLYQ2|5|I like how it feels on my skin, it's comfortable as hell.
B005SJIRUS|4|Cool and simple
B003QJUHI2|5|I purchased the pink and lilac colors and I love them!  Especially the lilac one.  The fabric is so soft and they fit amazing.  I totally recommend them.  I will buy another one!
B00F86QNNO|5|The dress was even prettier than in the picture. My daughter looked; gorgeous in it, it was delivered earlier than expected.  A very satisfied customer experience
B00JB615GM|5|great product
B000OV9A8S|1|I learned the hard way that no size on pants matches other pants. I tried it on and couldn't fit anything in the pocket because there's no slack. I went to Costco and it fits perfectly. Try on before you take the tags off.
B00KPZ0R94|5|Great quality product, would think it was Carter's brand..
B002WJI8MO|5|I wear a 10 1/2 wide (women's) and finding thin black socks that fit me can be difficult.  Generally such socks are bundled with other socks of weird colors, or they're too thin, too thick, too tall, or too tight - but these are just right!  I'm definitely buying more.
B005YN9APO|3|smaller than we thought
B008VS8R30|5|cant complain one bit, one of the best things ive bought from amazon. just dont throw it in the dryer and hang dry it instead, good material and nicely made. thanks!
B003TN6KZY|3|Though it looks really cute when worn and is of good quality as far as how it's put together with the stitching etc — it is long and your height would need to be 5'10&#34; for it to sit mid thigh. Yes it's true that one can gather it up to the level you're happy with; but as it is intended as a club dress and you're obviously going to be dancing and moving around a lot, you will find yourself constantly gathering it back up again.<br /><br />My partner is 5'6&#34; and it actually sits just above the knee and has to be gathered up at least 6&#34; to 8&#34; for it to be at the approximate position the model has it in the photo.
B0047F3QIW|5|Buy several. It's like wearing a man sleep shirt but super soft and feminine.
B00X4WIFV2|5|Soft and cute.
B00ESJ26P6|5|Grandson love it!
B00LI3UF9Y|5|Just what I was looking for!
B00L9YM8CO|4|I love this product.  The only issue was it was too small.  Extremely nice quality merchandise, so I decided to order again, but in a larger size......
B006X4GNI0|5|I love this belt.  It is fun.  The size runs true to its label.  I would buy another product from this company.
B00C6PEJPY|4|They fit great everywhere except they're too long. I am 5 foot 7. Im not short. They shouldn't be so long.
B000GHS0P4|5|My husband enjoys wearing this overalls and they are made great.  They wash wonderful and hold their shape. I just wash and hang to dry and they look ironed.
B008SANA5Q|5|This sleeper is true to size, and is darling! Soft, natural cotton is not too heavy, and makes for a happy boy.
B003TMWVEE|3|Nice loose fit, soft and thin fabric, good for hot weather. Requires ironing but it's 100% cotton. I'm not particular about wrinkles but the part that gets buttoned folds over itself and so do the corners of the pocket flap.
B00JBB0A04|5|The fabric is water repellent and if it gets wet when I leave it outside on the line, it dries quickly.  If rain water happens to get in the pocket, it drains right out and dries as well.  I'm very pleased to find this apron.  I think it will last a good long time.
B00CM3XJGU|5|Very cute and great quality.
B000O7TD16|5|Great for pretend and Halloween!  It is a toy and looks like a toy.
B004R1NNJS|5|This shirt feels like silk.  Soft, fit as sized.  I love it.  Sorry have not washed it yet so cannot give report on that.
B00A04CHZ2|5|perfect
B00AME2YOY|5|I bought it as a gift and I hope it looks good on the kid.I love it and it looks great!
B000QYEY7U|5|Ordered two tan from amazon and they are great. A nice weight and well made. Picked one up from a local camping supply store, this was the olive green, which feels a bit thicker. I like them both, and like the different weights as well. I would order again for sure. Nice to have in a BOB, and I wear mine all the time as a scarf.
B0017UJ8RI|5|Nice costume.
B00MRXJVR6|5|So comfortable and cozy.. Fit very well
B0018ON8FG|5|Love my 501's! I have worn these since the 70's and still love the originals!!
B00LMLBCWG|5|I love how these jeans feel. You can move in them, unlike regular denims. I say they are somewhat large, because in my case the waist could be a little smaller. There is a slight gap in that area for me, plus they'd be perfect if the waist was just a little higher. But I give them an excellent rating anyway. Fit good in the hips and butt.
B00EOBKM6I|5|My new favorite go-to pants!
B00L401XX8|4|this choker has plenty of stretch, fits comfortably around the neck, and the rhinestones have a nice, noticeable sparkle.  very sexy with clubwear or lingerie.
B000Q76K10|3|needed the costume for a school play  nothing to be shocked about it's cheap like 90% of all costumes    I'm glad to have had it +++
B0010VF6PW|2|Somewhat small
B005OR7G7E|5|I would recommend this wig for the price. I looked good & stayed on all night. I was in Las Vegas dancing all night long, it stayed put. I also got lots of complements
B00A6G3SAW|5|they were a little big, as in , &#34;choose a size true to you&#34;. normally, active/atheltic underwear like these are not true to fit, you know, like, you must order a size up, but these are true to size. so go with your american size and youll be fine. the quality of course was great as well. no complaints
B00ORKJDFW|2|I was waiting for this item 5 weeks and after I got it I found out that fabric is more like polyester not cotton. It didn't keep me warm when I was wearing it, it was little tight to the body and the fabric was also thin. Seller refunded the entire order along with shipping since it would probably cost me a lot to ship it to China.
B000RFP1PW|3|I bought myself a pashmina shawl because I LOVE cashmere.  The price was too good to resist.....but as the old saying goes 'you get what you pay for'.  The color is great, but the fabric was rather thin.  I don't regret the purchase, but it is not as substantial as I would have preferred.  It makes a really nice scarf to wear with my coat though.
B002UQDVQW|5|Simply amazing. This is a heavy-duty belt buckle. It is colored red and blue. It is just what I was looking for-I gave it as a gift and the guy who got it loves it.
B00D4KWP3I|4|Great for a gift
B003IFLCVK|5|good
B00K5AKI02|5|This wallet is handsome, thin, and holds everything I need it to.
B00YBDB664|3|The material is oddly see through but heavy. I was going to take it to Jamaica with me but I will just use it around my house. Not in love
B00EYNHSAO|5|Soft cotton knit that fits well and looks lovely.
B00JKAKRT0|5|Very pretty and original.. I love it
B002PJ58GA|4|A good deal for this hat. It fits good and keeps the sun off of you and the price was okay.
B008V780WY|4|I love it. I will be ordering other colors!  You need to wear a tank underneath. Fits true to size.
B002QRBLUI|5|Decent value and quality.  Quick delivery.
B00LM32ZAM|5|Absolutely love the fit. I bought small, and Sis loved it. (She is 5'2, 115 lbs, 34C) Thanks Amazon!
B003Y008IW|5|This item is very good quality, fit perfect, and it very comfortable to wear. Definitely my best leotard.
B00B3W88YO|4|Overall I really like this product! I am a slender person (120 lbs 5'2&#34;) and love the added booty this gives me.  I ordered a small and it fits just fine although I usually purchase medium underwear.  This gives you DRAMATIC size increase, so if you are wanting a subtle look these undies might not be for you.
B00NESI44E|5|I'm in love with Reducci pants!  I've bought several in different styles.  I went up 1 size just because I'm not a spring chicken and they just seem to hang better at least the lighter colored ones.  The dark ones I bought are a my size and a bit tight but look good
B00IGAODHM|1|This product is a good quality piece. I gave it one star because it took me over 2 months to receive it, and it didn't fit.
B00C7YICY8|5|I got the pants for my son.  He loves them and says they are so comfortable and durable.  I am getting him another pair in a different color.  Thanks Levi!!!!
B008H49HH8|5|Nice hefty long scarf. What's the point of nice warm bibs and coat If your face is wide open?<br />Mom really knew how to bundle us up but we got older and smarter and stopped wearing scarfs? Rubbish. 48 years old and just rediscovered how handy and functional these are. Carhart quality is second to none.<br />Rochester NY is cold!
B009LDP944|4|I can tell that this is a quality shirt.  I love flannel.  I had many compliments on this shirt.  The colors were nice and the fit was great.  I would have liked it maybe a pinch longer but I can't complain.  The price and quality can't be beat!
B00D3RLE8Y|5|Looks great on my Harely . Perfect size!
B00LMIATY6|4|Order this a little bigger than you think you need.  Its a great shirt, they just run small.  Of course, I'm taking some PED's and pretty much every other supplement I can find.
B00E0ERMDK|5|My son loves this sweatshirt, great for chilly new England mornings! Fits exactly as I expected, great color, warm, soft and cozy.
B00A3GBZ0K|1|The color is revolting.
B00SZ8IE70|4|Other than being very small I like it. It is very cute!! I did not see the dry clean only when I bought it and hate that!!  I should have read it better.
B00MY5Z6Z8|1|Not as pictured. Fits like an oversized unisex sweatshirt (not fitted like on model), and the writing is so faded that the letters look like grey on black rather than white.
B00D4K3B22|4|Sweatery material. Cute. Granddaughter likes it
B002NPCIPK|2|I thought that the name Fruit of the Loom would guarantee a soft, sturdy product. Well, I was wrong.  The material is a bit rough and thin.<br />I would have returned them if my son hadn't fallen in love with them when they came, saying, \\"Big boy underwear like Daddy's!\\"<br /><br />They do the job. My son is thin and they fit him very well, which is the one positive point. They are 'just like Daddy's', too, which is a bonus.<br /><br />I think I'll stay away from ordering things like this online so that I can feel and test the material before I buy.<br /><br />Fruit of the Loom, I'm disappointed in you!
B00E99GJG2|5|I like it very much
B000RKTACW|3|it ran a little big but it worked out okay. Our son really enjoyed the costume other than it was big on him.
B007BY959K|1|Awful fit, stretches out with wear, those dangly things at the crotch (why???), see-through. This sweater has nothing going for it. Amazon had it's initial price up at 300$, somehow I find this hard to believe.
B00SGOVVR8|5|perfect fit
B00E9RGAJU|2|I bought these with the matching bra, but I really don't like the feel of the fabric at all.  It just feels very cheap and uncomfortable.
B003KXX5FQ|4|I ordered this to go under a Queen of Hearts Halloween costume. It is perfect, just what I was looking for. It is not too short, perfect length and adds just the right amount of poof for what I was looking for.
B00LVRV1WC|3|Not sure about the size, but didn't fit, ran small.
B00EALXIFE|5|Excellent...
B00B58U5S8|4|All purpose good material. .good fit
B00VWXTIKW|1|Very short torso, I'm only 5 ft and could barely get it over my shoulders
B00995TMTM|1|runs small and not as described
B00K5KPPBE|3|made much smaller than tagged....Cute dress but if you are full in the chest area....not a good idea.
B00IY9ZMTS|5|Great
B000SV1PD2|5|Adorable, looks very nice with the matching raincoat I got, we didn't wear them outside yet, but at home my toddler loves them
B00LASIWSI|3|They are cute but I thought that I was getting 2. Since the description states Headbands, as in plural. Still cute though and shipping was fast.
B009RQ67Z0|5|Great looking shirt, easy to clean.
B00TA28UGA|5|Great shirt! I plan on wearing the heck out of it all summer long.
B00FJ0SF3A|1|Sleeves are very very loose, it fits a body builder
B00INA0SPQ|4|The V  neck come down a little farther then I wanted. Wish it was a lil longer, but I love the material and super cute!!!!
B00S0R8BC4|5|Rad! Love it!
B003IXDEGS|1|I never even got to wear it. After just one wash, literally half the stitching at the bottom came away.
B00LVAYA2C|2|Photographs better than real life and is so tight and scratchy.  It's heavy and hot, for the few minutes I had it on after wriggling into it.  I think it's better for a winter event.  And showing all your curves and wobbly bits.
B005HWH93C|1|I ordered patriot blue but they were navy.  It did not state that they had feet and the picture is not clear in that respect.
B00DGOWDRA|5|It is so beautiful that make me cry. My granddauther was very pretty in it and she also loved it.
B00AMA1QEC|4|I'm 5'4'', 150lbs. These aren't baggy as shown in the picture, but they fit me from my ankle to my knee and show out of my boots (which is what I wanted). They stretch enough to go over leggings or even over skinny jeans. The end that has been at my calf is somewhat stretched out, but not lose enough to where it won't stay up.
B00K769BLQ|5|A very good product.
B008TKJ4QO|2|The ties on the robe were hanging by a thread upon opening. There was also a hole in the arm seam.
B00J8RD292|3|I ordered this and apparently sent for one bra and two panties. I was expecting the set. I'm not sure how to order the set now.<br />However, they fit true to size.<br />i don't think I will bother ordering the set or this again.
B000I3HV6U|4|As expected and on time! A great deal. Wish they came in more sizes. Excellent condition. Very durable and multipurpose.
B00E7KSP4M|2|Doesn't work well with touch screen and doesn't keep hands warm
B007K3J5QU|3|These are good fitting shorts but unfortunately, I didn't realize they were polyester. If cotton they would have been rated 4 stars
B0053A7M4Y|5|Love the way the look on me!!! especially when I wear mini skirts! ;) ....Plus the fabric is soft and it feels nice to wear them...
B00ACIGNJW|2|At first I was very excited...  I needed new underwear and these seemed to be just what I needed for the right price.  However, after wearing them for more than an hour you begin to realize that the designer must have had fat old woman thighs because the thigh holes are huge.  How huge?  Huge enough to where my sticks and stones are always hanging outside the front pouch which has more in common with the string from a thong.  I might as well go commando, because what's the point?  Now it feels like my mongoose and maracas are on a constant vacation atop a Chicago high rise.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
B005OTZS18|5|My husband loves these!
B0006U69HM|5|Great hard wearing jeans
B00PTGB08G|4|I bought this belt in three colours right off the bat and I do not regret doing so. Also bought some buckles with them, in the same order, as they are sold without buckles. Looking on the bright side, this gives them added versatility!  They are true to the colour in online picture and fit true to size, ie unlike some other belts, if you select for use as a waist-belt, they are not long enough to be used as a trouser belt also. You can easily interchange buckles as well, given that those two little eyes are pins, which you can open and click back shut by yourself! No special tool is needed as we discovered where I took them for the buckles to be fixed! These are lovely, eye-catching belts that seems solid and should be durable. Worth the 'No Buckle' hassle!
B00JUM6MCE|5|Great price, great fit, nice and comfy!
B00PHG19VQ|5|This is so very comfy, and people are always complimenting it!
B004FPHZCM|4|These are 70% cotton, and the high polyester content is not ideal -- our 4 month old is even starting to get some adult-style foot odor! He sweats a bit here in the desert heat where we live, and it appears his feet are not immune. But the socks are still necessary at times, especially due to the big temperature swings between day and night, inside and outside, which he is regularly exposed to.<br /><br />So these are not perfect, but they remain on the boy's feet better than most socks we have tried before, which is a plus. And despite the negative reactions with sweat, which we would not expect in a cotton-only sock, these are still decent, well-functioning socks on the whole.
B00BR4NKIC|3|i got a large because you can never tell...it was way too large.  but i just sewed straps onto it and voila!!!  No problem!  So overall, it will serve its purpose as a swimsuit coverup, which is all that matters, it works.
B003552QFY|5|I bought this for my 93 year old Mother in a nursing home.  She loved it.  Said it made her feel like a Princess.  I ordered another!
B007ZELGA2|2|I did not get the shirt that I ordered.  The one that I got, had no stripes on the sleeves and it was suppose to be white along the collar, but it was not.  It was also not faded like advertised.  The only reason I am giving it a two star is because it was nicely packaged and arrived in 2 days. Other than that, I am fairly disappointed.
B002JQ2J5C|5|This bag is really nice.  Very casual and not flashy.  I really like it...but it is a bit small.  Too small for a guy? ..Dunno..I gonna try and rock it (as the kids say).  It looks almost rugged enough for a guy, but not too much bigger than a woman's handbag.  I'm not lookin to carry a bunch of stuff so it wouldn't matter in that department.  If it didn't look so cool and such a great price, I might return it.<br />Size wise: would fit a notebook computer 10inch, but not much bigger.  Maybe a medium size binder.  I just need something to carry my lunch supplies and what not from my car to my office.  Thing is cute.  D*mn cute.  That's the problem.  just wish it wasn't so d*mn cute!
B00EALWKR6|5|I'm going to a party and not really ready to expose my goods to the world but this fit so well!! I'm at 34DD and got the XL it fits so nicely I feel extremely sexy in it! Would recommend to anyone!!
B006Z8HAEU|5|The material is very comfortable and of good quality.  It fits me just perfect.  The price is also nice, but the cost of shipping is kind of high for just 1 tank top.  I purchased three of these.  I will probably not order this one again due to the total cost of purchase.  But it was worth buying at least once.
B00GTB1OBS|3|nice hat....little puffy,bulky, but fits pretty well, nice adjustable Velcro back closure
B000QWA2RI|5|I had a squeem a couple years ago and wore it until I wore it completely out. I had to order another one because I missed my squeem. Don't leave home without it. It really works.
B005FYNXGO|5|Very nice fit and the price was great too.  Will be ordering another pack.
B00IUMUK00|5|I bought 2 of these shirts, size large, one locally and the other through Amazon.  Both are true to size and fit me well, except they are longer than most other shirts.<br /><br />They are great quality and made of thick material.  The shirts haven't required ironing after removing them from the dryer, except the pocket flaps developed a wrinkle.
B001CICMN2|4|i have been wearing legs pantyhose for a long time. my silky mist pantyhose, sheer control top pantyhose look sexy. my legs pantyhose go very well with all my high heels and pumps. i wear pantyhose all day and legs pantyhose nylons are one of my pantyhose i pull up. i also wear no nonsense pantyhose and other pairs of nylons and pantyhose, sheer toe pantyhose with sheer control top pantyhose, or sheer to waist pantyhose with reinforced nylon toes, i wear a lot of nylons and pantyhose and legs pantyhose will always be on my pantyhose legs.
B00F15QYJU|5|I got this for my sister for Christmas. The price is excellent (even with the shipping) and it fit her great, exactly as it should according to the images from the anime. The fabric seems durable and all patches are embroidered on, except for the back, where it's screen-printed. This may be off-putting for some, but my sister was glad that the back wasn't embroidered. Her only complaint was that the jacket was darker than she expected, but even she revised that complaint when she looked at some official art from the anime. Shipping took exactly as long as they said it would, which was unfortunate only because it came after Christmas. If you're looking for Attack on Titan cosplay pieces, I would definitely recommend this jacket.
B00DNSRXQU|5|Love this mustard maxi!! Perfect length for my 5'1 height!!lol And it's a bit thin material but definitely not see through.
B00OMUOD52|5|Slightly large but I have not washed it yet. I love the weight of the gown, great for summer.
B000SQS2QU|4|Nice durable backpack that kinda holds everything. Its also heavy to start out with. Overall its a good backpack.
B00GYTNSLO|2|I think I ordered a size medium and it fits like a XS.
B00EF5WCE8|5|After attempting to alter my own socks to fit my well-loved collection of Vans, I eventually broke down and had to order these. Turns out it was well worth it! They don't slip off of my heel when I walk, and you can't see them when you wear Vans or Keds.
B002OPFPTA|5|I got this for a relative who is always cold . . . is a really nice little fleece hat in neutral colors so that it can go with just about any color coat or jacket.  My relative likes it and it is machine washable.  Nice!
B009BKWE9U|3|only had it for three weeks & the handles had popped. other than thst it is okay, does keep purse somewhat less junky.
B00HA2NVAM|5|Cute,comfy
B00PVU4J9M|5|Looks great
B00NAKIR9I|4|My son loves the fur coat!! I ordered a large so it would be a little big on him and it just fits. I would order two sizes up for the perfect fit!
B005CSO7SG|5|The title says it all…a great sweatshirt which is what I was looking for.  Well made, nice soft fabric with a high quality zipper.  I'm 5'7&#34; and the arm length is wonderful with enough fabric to even fold the cuff back.  Not the cheapest sweatshirt, but I'm thrilled with the quality and fit.
B000UOMVRG|2|The jacket looks very well done. Cloth seams durable and maintenance free. I really kike the design, the stripes on the sleeves and unique collar design give the jacket a distinctive look. I would recommend my friend to buy the jacket.
B003V4AKK2|5|I bought this wallet, based on the reviews here on Amazon. I have to say, I am very impressed. I absolutely love it. It would make a fantastic Fathers Day, husband/boyfriend present any time..
B00FBD2G1C|4|Alittle thin, but they are solid socks for the price.
B00LMJRDLW|5|well made. fast shippping
B003F06XQW|5|This is very well-made —— the fit is great, the fabric is very nice and it stays on the head. And it just looks freaking awesome! A great value.
B003JZPNEQ|4|I was trying to order my go to nursing bra, but I can't get it shipped to me.  I tried a bravado but the cups were enormous and then I found this one.  For the price, I can't complain at all.  The bra is comfortable, fits pretty decently, and holds up well.  It doesn't fold on the sides like my other one does, no side stabbing!<br /><br />I'm a 38D in VS and ordered a 40D in MM.  I have a bra extender that I can use, haven't had to yet, but it is a little snug (not overbearingly uncomfortable).  If you're concerned about fitting into the cup, go a size up.  The shape holds up well, doesn't cave in, and looks smooth under a t-shirt.
B00A24LJ9K|4|They fit perfect only thing was to many pockets but for being cargo pants what do you expect right it was only the zippers on the pockets what bothered me great cargos tho
B000NZW3IY|1|The effect that this t-shirt has on women is pretty impressive.  Unfortunately its natural healing powers reversed my vasectomy and I impregnated nine women in two weeks before I realized.  They all had twin boys.  Now I have 18 sons and spend most of my money on child support and condoms.
B00EV5HQA2|5|My husband LOVES these!  He loves to show people what time it is.  lol
B00EXWE3BI|5|I had read that the dress ran small, so I ordered accordingly.  A beautiful mother-of-the-bride dress.
B005FU4OJS|3|The deep blue color of the jeans continues to bleed even after several washes, especially noticeable on white shirts, etc.
B00F51DRDQ|5|I bought 2 of these tied for my grandsons to wear at my wedding.  They were dressed as newsboys, with suspenders and newsboy caps.  Everyone thought the boys looked adorable, and the ties were easily adjusted so they were comfortable.  I personally think the ties are small for a grown man, but they were perfect for a 12 and 15 year old.
B00BXBAFK0|5|I love it
B00368CLDW|1|Not even close to the bra size it claims to be.
B008DLVHRI|5|I purchased this dress for my pinning ceremony. I love the look & fit of the dress. I am 5'5'' and 126lb and I ordered a size small. it fits perfect. I was dreading having to wear a nursing dress because half out there are hideous, but I can actually say im excited for my pinning.
B00E3BDIWE|3|This aren't junior size. My daughter size small adult women size and this is still big on her. I guess it's okay with inside clothes on.
B00X41XUJ0|5|Cute and comfortable
B002QR9G4Q|3|Nicely made except the buckle wouldn't stay closed due to the prong being too short.  Major problem.  I had to bend the frame closer to the prong so it would catch.  Of lesser importance, the picture is misleading; where I was expecting all beige the tongue and and frame were brown.<br /><br />I have two other belts from this company (black and brown) that are just fine.
B009653N5E|5|I am busty so I like clothes close to my body.  The only reason I returned this was because the fabric was thin (but not cheap looking).  It looked great in the front for this reason but the back was too tight and showed my bra straps.  Great style. I was really sad to return it.
B00KY7EAFA|4|Enjoy my hat. Great buy.  Many compliments from others and most importantly the wife likes it.  Just the right weight for Fla. wear.
B002NPCJ5E|4|they are fun, nice, and my 2 years old daughter loves them. I don't like too much the material but she doesn't care and it's really hard to find underwear for 2 years old so perfect purchase
B00U6XBNWK|3|I ordered a 40 D because that's the size that's been fitting in other brands. The band size was great, but there was a lot of &#34;overflow&#34; from the cups. It seems like it'd be very comfortable if I went up to a 40 DD.
B004FYY49U|5|I love these shorts for summer, they are well made with Levi's quality materials, and can last through many washes. I have both colors, faded and not, and recommend them to women looking for flattering shorts that wear well at a reasonable price.
B009G48W2O|2|Item is adorable, but the XML is about a size 3/4 I wear a dress size 8 so after reading reviews ordered Xlarge still very tiny...sad wanted this for a costume ....not worth the return shipping .....
B0063NRNXU|5|Super comfy and looked great with my maternity ranking top. I felt comfortable and smooth. It's great that there are &#34;underwear&#34; built in.
B00DFYC7J0|4|I enjoy Shadowline but the smalls are quite roomy,droopy and l o n g... This style is lovely on (at least my husband said it is)
B00ASPPQGU|5|Love these PJ's for my son so cute and very comfortable!  I am for sure going to purchase some more like this.
B00166VGUK|5|It was everything I thought and more. I loved the color and will definitely be ordering again soon. I would recommend this product.
B00EE141R4|5|Favorite shorts all summer!!
B00JAB5FPU|5|I love these things. They allow me to wear skirts for extended periods for the first time ever!
B00RTH9SJQ|1|WAAAAY too small. Not worth the money. Super bummed. I even ordered a size larger and it barely covered my boobs
B003YZY5OU|4|Terrible packaging, crushed on arrival but washes and works well.  Wrinkles abound but great for every day use, not for the office!
B00MI2PT5E|5|Love it!! 😉
B00F5XVUN8|5|T shirt has great pattern and co lours.  Fabric was not heavy cotton. For my son it was perfect gift.
B006VYLC2Y|5|My husband loves these! They are slightly fleece lined. The biggest problem with them is that seams will pull apart. It's the nature of the fabric and sewing will not help. This is where fabric glue works wonders. A small amount on the two pieces ends the problem for good It will not pull apart again. My husband works nights and winter is pretty cold .. he said he's quite toasty in these . I recommend them highly.
B00SHWJ0UO|5|These fit perfectly for my size 7-71/2 feet.  I do stretch them before I hand them on the line to make sure they hold their fit after washing.  I don't know if they would shrink in a dryer.  Comfortable and cool on hot days.
B004ONBHGK|5|These socks were a &#34;gag&#34; gift that ended up being a hit.  My husband loves them.  Great fit, great style and they are wearing well.
B003WYM9P0|5|My husband really likes them. They fit wll.
B00HJTZVLI|5|Came on time and my dad loved it for his 80th bday.
B009IS55PU|3|Good for my wife but not as durable as she would like. She put a hole in them first time she worn them
B007ZLJYUY|5|Nice lightweight vest with interior pockets...good for overseas travel.h
B002N6Y77Q|5|My love for America is strong.  My love for a quality made sleeveless vest is almost as equally as strong as my love for America.  I love displaying my love for America as often as I can, which typically includes sporting as many America themed or Stars and Stripes inspired clothing articles as possible.  So when I moseyed across this here Stars and Stripes American Flag Sleeveless Vest, I knew I'd be serving America proud and pleasing myself with a purchase of another stellar vest.  I also knew that my sculpted upper shoulder regions would be properly showcased with the vest's lack of sleeves.  I figured that the golden brown hue of my triceps would look spectacular alongside America's Stars and Stripes.  And I was right.  Whenever I hit the town in my Stars and Stripes vest, I know exactly what everybody's thinkin'.  They're thinkin': \\"There goes a true American, sportin' his Stars and Stripes.  And, golly, he looks dapper with his lack of sleeves and impeccably sculpted biceps.\\"  If you love America and sleeveless vests as much as I do, this purchase is a no-brainer.  Do yourself proud.  Do your country proud.  Represent America in the most fashionable way possible: sleevelessly.
B00G60A508|5|Other no show socks will quit on you after you put them on. These stay put all day, they won't fall underneath your heel. Worth the price.
B00NSM415C|5|Love it. Paired it with high waisted suspender jeans.
B008CQPX92|2|The fit was ok on these but I tried them on once and then wore them for an evening and was surprised that the pattern 'broke apart' a bit. I don't really have a better way to explain. But they got here on time and looked great to everyone else since no ones was as close to my legs as me!
B006TJ5MC2|5|Will buy more when I see them; I used it for a gift at Christmas; and wished I had more, so I will be buying additional ones when I see them!
B00AENG41M|1|These shorts are adorable but they are too tight in the butt and thigh.<br /><br />I wear a 6, sometimes an 8, in pants and so I ordered these in an 8 only to find the shorts were basically suctioned to my thighs and booty. For what it's worth, they did fit nicely in the waist and the length is almost exactly as it appears in the photo.<br /><br />I am returning and ordering the 10 (I've never ordered a 10 in anything but hey, these shorts are cute). I will update my review if the  size 10 fits.<br /><br />Update: The size 10 is huge in the waist, tight around the butt, and perfect for the thighs. I'm thinking these shorts will work for someone who has a flatter behind but not for someone with even a hint of a curve. Going up a size didn't make much of a difference. I've been wearing them around the house to stretch them out and have had a bit of success. The lesson I'm taking from this is that boardshorts might be one of those things you just have to try on in a store. They are cute shorts. Hope others have better luck with them.
B0076PV2MM|3|It's not as well made as i thought it would be. The knitted stitches of the 'beard' are very loose, so it doesn't protect your face very well. It's more for show than anything.
B00O1CAH0G|5|I'm very picky about what goes against my skin, especially with base layer stuff like this in the winter. I'm most impressed. Ordered 2 sizes larger per other reviewers suggestions, they are perfect. Nice & long, non binding anywhere, move with me no matter what I'm doing. Non scratchy or sweaty as some long underwear are apt to do. The colour & texture is attractive as well. I like the wide non binding elastic in the bottoms and cozy fit around the ankles and extra length in the arms.<br /><br />So if you order these, get at least 2 sizes larger and they will fit and be a little loose. They are a bit thinner than some I've tried but far more comfortable with plenty of stretch without sacrificing warmth.
B00JGBJZEQ|5|Looks just like pic shown. Very cute and comfortable too. Thought my whole life I was a 34A and measure myself the proper way one day and found out I was a 30D. Best fitting bra I've ever had! Very happy with my purchase.
B00M8RGA5M|3|This is definitely a &#34;get what you payed for&#34; product. In no way is that SUPOSE to be a bad thing. When I saw this u was super excited because $10 for a swim suit is a very good price but the quality meets it. Being completely honest here it dosent flatter you but in any way or give a very good shape to your chest but it your looking to hid a little bit of your stomach it is great. The colors are not quite as what is shown but are still nice. It took about 2 1/2 weeks to ship. Over all this product is worth the money but now the best swim suit ever bought
B00U7Y6DLE|2|A lot shorter than expected, but super soft. Also, blue powder kept coming off of them before the first wash. Wash them alone the first time unless you want everything to be blue!
B00LOUEESE|4|Really cute design, but it had kind of a strange smell straight out of the package. I'm not quite sure how or if I can fix that yet, but it's definitely not going back into my nose until I figure it out!
B008LWRZS4|5|fit nicely, not too baggy.  I'm 5'4&#34; and they come to the top of my knee.  Wash nicely, no wrinkles.
B005KOVU7I|5|Very nice scarf, looks good with anything and is very soft and warm, the brands name looks really nice in the scarf....good shipping experience
B001W707U8|4|I picked up a pair of these in side medium for my ballet class.  The fit is nice, but I found out the awkward way that they are quite then, and thus quite a bit see through under semi-bright lights.  Thankfully my class is full of easygoing people and I'm not easily embarrassed.  There exists the possibility that I just ordered too small of a size and as a result really stretched these babies beyond normal capacity, although I'm a pretty small guy so who knows.  I might recommend ordering a size larger than you think you might need.  These have held up extremely well though, I must say.
B00PBYLK8Q|3|The first time I wear it, It was broken, the string went off-line... But it's okay, I need to wash it carefully in order not to make it even worse. It's not as good quality as I expect.
B00B3XUKA8|4|It was a present. It looked nice. I like it. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
B00589D6F4|5|Fits perfectly,  I was surprised with the small trim of pink on the edges.  It added just the right bit of zing.  The fabric is so nice.  I feel like I am dressed up just a little bit more when I wear this.
B005ZMJAZ4|5|It's hard finding close that fit me being 5'4 male. Got to say I'm glad I found Doubju because of the fact there sizes run smaller. This quilted jacket is perfect for the light winter cold where I'm from. Looks good, feels good and have gotten a few compliments since wearing it. Doublju has become a great place for me to buy my clothing.
B00NTU6XXG|1|Cheap and cheap quality! Don't waste your money!!!
B002QQ7SCE|3|I agree  with David, \\"photo lends to the expectation that the logo is on the pocket. IT IS NOT. The quality is great, just not as advertised.\\"  Unfortunately I read his review after I purchased and returned the shirts.  Great price if it came with the logo on the shirt.
B002JPAL4Y|4|The material in these pants is very fine. So fine that the pants don't stay on a wooden hanger.<br />I don't like the way the pockets are sewn in. The front pockets do not &#34;swivel&#34; when you sit down. I have lost stuff from my front pockets.<br />Otherwise, nice trousers.
B00CBES8RA|3|its fine
B000VLS5ZU|3|This wig looks like the one in the photograph.  It is a decent buy for the price.
B0071NUSR4|5|My son loves all things Sesame Street, and Cookie is no exception.  On a 3 year old, this hat is slightly large, but they'll grow in to it.  It has a &#34;big kid&#34; feel, that I think my son enjoys, and he can look like Daddy :)
B00X0D9OGA|3|Nice as a wrap for swimwear!
B001D5L1X6|5|Ordered this in combo with a neck gaiter and they work great at keeping u warm in the cold would recommend this product to any one.  Have a few friends who have ordered this after I let them try it out defiantly a must if your not a fair weather rider!!
B00D3ONYJO|5|I love it, My man loved it,  Races the AMRA series and would recommend this to all the riders in the series for T-shirts
B00DV1LVO4|4|This jacket is nice but is a lot thinner than expected. I can now see why it says it's a spring jacket.  I thought a 4-in-1 wld be a lot thicker, so I will have to put an extra layer on my son when it's really cold. The price was great as well.
B00KIZF64C|3|Not the material that I expected and the color was a little different. I had to return anyway as it ran a little small but nothing wrong with it, just size. #widehipproblems
B00KH61N8A|4|This runs a little small so I ordered a size larger for my grandson. It was a huge hit. His exact words were &#34;Awesome&#34;
B009I2PNGW|5|The material isn't cheap and thin, thankfully.  I love the graphic, it looks like the episode with the beloved and adorable Greendale 7 in 8 bit form.  After one wash, the color is still vibrant.
B00B3HV3SW|5|This bra is like a piece of heaven ! I have started wearing it before baby even arrives and next time wont even wait this long.. quality of fabric is excellent and fit and shape of bra is beyond expectations!
B00W3HJT82|5|This cover up is AMAZING. I was super nervous ordering sight unseen and the phrase &#34;one size fits all&#34; is especially scary but this is perfect. It has a drapey fit but doesn't look frumpy. The fabric is very light and silky smooth and the colors are perfect to show off that summer tan. It has great coverage in back, slightly less in front but enough for pool or beach wear. I freaking love this!! Glad I went ahead and spent a little more to end up this happy. Can't wait to take this to the DR with me next month on vacation. For reference, I'm 5'9&#34; 175 lbs.
B00F0T4SK4|4|All around nice wallet just wish it was thinner
B00HR1WVSO|1|They don't look like real true religious jeans looks fake not worth 100 dollars they looks cream color not white I am very unhappy
B0059DWL9Q|3|Good product but sizing is poor. Runs to large.
B00KTON0PE|5|A beautifully fitting dress with lovely fabric and good craftship.  I bought two others.
B00E9Y51RA|5|I have worn these panties for a few years now but had a hard time finding them in a store. I searched Amazon and of course, there they were. I highly recommend them!
B00GUTYE3O|5|Great quality hat. Quick delivery. Lovin' it
B00D9OCRB4|3|It's a weird fit as the onesie is wider than most for that size. Otherwise, the outfit is cute, like the bib.
B0088QLX2C|5|My almost 4 year old is about size average for her age and I got her the 4T. The jacket fit Great with a little growing room and the quality is excellent. Better than expected.
B00CBTPH2E|5|i like it
B00NBS7D3K|4|I really like this product, but it was just somewhat bigger than expected
B00BXEFFGG|1|Poor quality<br /><br />  The leather on the belt started peeling around the buckle after the second time I worn the belt. After one week it was trash.
B00LES0VEW|4|I like the material and how's it looks just wish I had ordered a larger size
B00QQ30OH4|5|this is probably the cutest jacket I've ever bought! my little one sure loves it! wear and tear is expected with our little bundles of cuteness, but if you simply maintain it, you should be fine
B00AWB0IG8|5|Very godd product. It met my expectations.<br />Excellent quality.<br />Delivery Washington satisfactory.<br />I recommend This product 100%.<br />Considers it in my upcoming purchases.
B00EFEPHP0|5|Love this. The color is a bit more green in color than the picture appears, but that worked for me because I didn't really care what color it was. The fit is nice. The sleeves are long and didn't shrink after washing. The length of the shirt itself is long, too. I'm 5'8&#34; so length is important.
B00CDL1QNO|4|I like this HOODIE~ ~it is light weight just to my need !<br /> Thank YOU~ ~GOOD JOB ! I will be back .
B00ATXYY78|5|The shirt was the perfect fit! Loved it. It has a matching pair of pants which are sized a bit smaller (a large is more like a medium). If you order both, I suggest to order 1 size up for the shirt and the pants.
B00KC73K7Q|2|I does slim my waist but mine was very difficult to put on and it was uncomfortable. I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong size or not. I like it cause it does shrink my waist.
B00KAU4KRO|2|Returned it. Didn't seem like the correct size would fit as it is very tiny in the middle.
B00CALRR1W|5|Perfect
B00QPTZDDO|4|Excellent goods Thanks for the seller
B006UZSX8K|5|I could never wear it. I just wouldn't look good in it. My shoulders are too broad and my hips too narrow. Am I thinking about it too much? You bet.
B003N18GTK|4|My old wallet wore out. It had a zipper in the midline for coins falling to either side. Neat idea, but coins stuck in the middle made closing the wallet annoying. I wanted to try a coin purse wallet.<br /><br />Overall, this is made fairly well. Seems it will last OK. The coin purse makes it very easy to deal with loose change.<br /><br />My main complaint is that the slots for credit cards, ID, etc. are too tight. I suspect that's to make sure they don't fall out easily, but it's a pain to slip cards in and out of them when I want to. It also means I put some extra cards (loyalty cards, business cards, etc.) in the second bill area because they simply won't fit in the card slots. An extra 1/8\\" or 1/16\\" of width in the slots would be very helpful.<br /><br />If you don't have many cards but do want to keep your coins in your wallet, this is a good option.
B0072OHWTY|4|I bought this for my husband for Christmas, it's one he picked out on his Amazon wish list.  I love the weathered look of it. Since we live in the deep south, I'm hoping we'll have weather cool enough for him to enjoy it.
B0030IMYYE|5|Fits perfectly in waist, length,. I feel comfortable and look nice too.<br />I would recommend these jeans to friends. It was a good de a l.
B00P3U6ZZQ|5|I love my blouse.
B00PCYVBDO|4|It's for a gift so i have to wait and see. But it cute.
B00KNQQQ6I|5|My daughter really liked this shirt and fit just fine. Not too big, not too small.
B00BQLYWJC|5|Love this shirt. the orange one looks more burnt orange in the online picture but its a bright orange which i liked even better
B006SRTGC2|5|I am 5'6 tall so the thermal pants have some minor lumps formed near the foot, but it does not feel like lumps and also gets hidden under regular pants/jeans. The fit is very comfortable and the fabric is very soft and cozy. I live in New England area and wear these for commute to work, it protects me even at 0 deg F and not a single itch or irritation for 10+ hours. I love it.
B00HQVY40S|5|Compliments from everyone. Easier to find wearing bright colors
B00BQ9OQ7W|5|I liked the fact that the material of the shorts are made of a very soft material that feels smooth when you rub the material. I didn't think it would be so I made it into a bathing suit combination with the shirt and it goes perfect. It fits my almost 5 month baby perfectly, and he is big boy for his age.
B00KAR3UZA|4|fit and looks are great.
B001DQ5YZ6|3|The cross looks cool, but the necklace had bad quality. The necklace started spreading open on the end and the cross rusted.
B00HVWSQG0|2|I've noticed that the heels will develop holes in one or two wears?  Has anyone else noticed this?  I've had to darn the holes.  I still own older Hanes crew socks and never had this type of problem develop.  I might go back to buying boys socks as they seem to last longer.  Still I'm disappointed that a product that has a great reputation should produce inferior goods.
B001J6OMIK|4|Looks great, feels great.
B002XULPHW|4|Well made.  Heavier weight than Balera, which sheds moisture more readily.  Match the product to the situation and be warm, dry and happy.
B00AOCX43Y|4|Not only did this product arrive early, but it also fit great. I'm about 5'10 and a dress size 8, so I was nervous that the shirt would not fit like it does on the model in the picture, but it absolutely does. Just be aware that this is a shirt, not a sweater. The material is thinner, but that just means that you can get more wear out of it.
B002IRND9I|5|I love the hat. Is it available in a color other than the gold I got? I'd like another one in grey, black or brown.
B002LG4RBY|5|Best wolverine shirt I ever bought my husband. He still loves it and I purchased it over a year ago. It is good quality and the black still looks really nice!
B00AX71NPG|1|the criss cross backing doesn't fit well across the back. needs a bigger bra
B004LWZ2WY|2|Ridiculously expensive. Does not fit my average sized newborn. It is too loose and keeps slipping off.
B00M42B1CS|4|Luv it fits great so soft<br />It could've been a little better quality because I like my clothes to last forever<br />But otherwise no complain
B00DWXJVD4|5|good~~
B00A9RDMI6|4|The ad says this pajama pant in navy or gray is all cotton. WRONG. The waist label is marked 60% Cotton/40% Polyester. These pants will NOT be shrinking, and they run WIDE. Therefore, many people should buy these one size smaller.
B009VZR7Q0|3|They stretch out and do not maintain shape.
B00OSKO8QA|1|Returning - poor fit.  I wear XL.  The gloves are sized as L/XL.  They should probably just size as L because I don't think they are going to fit someone with a true XL sized hand.  Otherwise, they appear to be of decent quality.  If they actually fit, I would give them a FOUR star.
B00GM46T44|5|Awesome fabric and shape
B00QLDENQM|4|For ten bucks its a fine deal.  But I did find that its skin-tight fit made it feel too small.  Amazon and I contacted the seller  to return it, and I was provided a shipping return label almost immediately.
B004P815J8|5|Though it only provides light control, it has great material and a great shape. It is perfect for daily use. I use it over shapeware underwear or under a shaping top if I want firmer control/support.
B00DTCRLXK|1|This is suppose to be part of the Queen section and for plus size girls and this is not by any means made for plus size women. I ordered the 2X and it looked like it was an XS! not true to size what so ever! But when ever I requested to return it the people who I ordered it from were wonderful and just reimbursed me my money.
B00AO4NI3I|5|The color and fit are excellent.  I really like the way the hood looks in the back.  And of course Tolani makes the very best.  I am happy to own it.
B006JD9O5Y|3|The shirt is good looking and well made but you have to watch out for shrinking, width wise is fine but length wise not so good.
B00E0IWX4E|5|Like the floral colour and design. Fits well, love it. Thanks!
B00RMPJKBQ|4|Very nice shirt, fit perfectly fine, but after the first wash it shrinked a bit, still fits good, but not as good as new. I still like them.
B00A6XR1DU|5|It is what you would thank. Great quality, very sharp
B007XD4QRU|3|I ordered a small, but they shipped a large. It fits in the chest, but is too big everywhere else and the gathers on the front of the stomach do not lay flat like in the photo, it gathers and makes it look 'paunchy'.
B00685F8M6|5|I originally ordered this scarf as a Christmas gift for a family member but ended up keeping it for myself! It's light-weight so don't expect it keeping you warm in 30 degree weather but it's a nice accessory to an outfit. I'm usually not a huge fan of the small tassels that are tied to the edge but I can usually tuck most of them in so they don't drive me nuts.<br />Because of the colors, you can wear this with several color schemes and it can also be dressed up or down. I've received many complements while wearing this and would consider purchasing another as a gift.
B006L3V9Q4|5|I have always purchased &#34;cheap&#34; socks.  Whatever I can find at the Dollar Store or discount store.<br /><br />I'm running a 10K and have been training....found I hated the cheap socks as they slide off my foot or bunch in the shoe.<br /><br />These socks are WONDERFUL.  They stay put and have a smidge of cushioning in the bottle.  They sold me on how paying a bit more for them is well worth it!!
B005PEEWW8|5|This style works for me because i don't want a super binding garment, but one that has a bit of hold and smooths everything out. This item does that for me. I am a size 12 and a L fits just right.
B00DF6FICQ|4|Very pleased with the quality. Soft, warm & fluffy.  Just a tad small for my sz 9 ft, but that doesn't affect the wearablity or comfort.
B000H9C4H6|3|Not as full as the A line super full hoop less (another review), but great for those who want a medium poof.
B009FVTFM4|4|I would like to purchase a couple more in different colors.
B0002TORXU|5|Very Good Buy !!!
B00AOH8WO0|4|I bought these to walk in.  They are very short shorts.  If your equipment wants to poke down your leg, you may have difficulty wearing these.  On the other side, if you look good and want to show it off, these will do the job nicely.  The leg openings stay put, and they don't crawl up my crack (a problem with some short shorts).  The size is identified as Japanese sizing.  I usually wear a Medium.  I bought the Large.  They fit fine as Mediums. Price is reasonable, shipping is fast.  Not a bad deal.
B00A6BKUYO|5|Great feeling shirt made in the usa
B00PG1BZZ2|5|Love the colors and the softness.  Great value for the price. Have been using it for some holiday \\"pop\\".
B00L42I7Z8|4|Super cute and I get loads of compliments on it. On cold days I like to wear tights or leggings and a cardigan with it and its still super cute. The fabric clings to leggings and tights but that is easily remedied by a skirt slip.
B000VQIU6O|4|Others have complained, &#34;It's not as good&#34;, but this is the first pair I have had.  They feel really nice on.  I don't think there's as much cushion in the sole of the sock, however.  They come up higher on my calf than I would like, but perhaps, that will feel good in the winter.  I was surprised to see there was no natural fiber in this sock--all man made, therefore they must be laundered with no bleach and similar white fabrics.
B002CJBAVK|5|The fangs are easy to use, put on, take off and save for later. They are great anyone wanting to be a vampire for Halloween!
B0073MLZ70|4|Love the wallet - has all the space I'll ever need and then some.  Please check the dimensions before buying.  I've adopted to this wallet - but it is a bit bigger than my previous one.  It does the
B003WEQMZI|4|This is a nice product in terms of material and workmanship as well at the design. I'm glad I got one of them, it fits and feel like a $50.00 cap.
B0047N1028|4|good fit - nice casual pants
B007WMU30G|5|GREAT FIT AND TRIBUTE TO THOSE BRAVE OFFICERS LOST IN 911.  PERHAPS 911 COULD BE EMBROIDED SOMEWHERE ON THE SWEATS.  I LOST I LOT OF FRIENDS THAT DAY.  GIVING TRIBUTE NEVER GETS OLD. NEVER FORGET!
B00U7Y33P8|4|For the price this is a good shirt.  It requires ironing but looks very professional.  The only negative is that it came with a small spot on the back.
B0027RPK86|5|i have these pants on right now.  they are very comfy.  better looking on than in the picture.
B00939L7H4|5|These are awesome!!!
B00AXIV1N4|5|very nice jacket
B001COW95M|5|Very soft casual shirt. Love it, washed well.
B00GTSE2G0|3|It was a little larger than I thought it would be.
B008VH4MGM|1|Very low quality light weight shirt.  After 2 washes the collar is frayed.  The logo looks to be sprayed on and will be gone after a couple more washes.  The t-shirts that I have purchased from this same company are of much better quality.
B00STV3U5E|5|I bought 2.  Both my husband and my daughter are excited to wear the shirt on the 14th.  The t-shirt seems well made.  It is not real thin like many t-shirts I have bought.  It seems like a great quality.  The shirt arrived sooner than expected too.
B00K2C3VJ8|5|My fiancé just loved this shirt. She was so excited when I got it for her! Quality of material looks like it will stand up to washes.
B00NG4YNFK|4|Shipping to the States is a little long, but understandable. Overall very nice product. These are my first impressions. I have a athletic build, so i cant fit into most slim fit or skinny jeans. But there are perfect for me surprisingly. Size chart is very true. Overall nice product.
B00FR95H6Q|5|Wonderful, my girl love it
B000W18WIO|4|I have a lot of dress shirts that lose that crisp feeling after a few days.  This quickly became my favorite shirt, being that it feels like new every time I wear it!  People are mentioning that this shirt runs big, and its true.  However, it is also a TALL model.. so unless you are a true Big and Tall man, you may want to avoid this.  Neck measurement is accurate.  I find it awesome that when I travel, this shirt doesn't have to hang up.  I get to a hotel, put it back on a hanger, and it is wrinkle free just as they claim.  I don't see any lose seams.  The length of the arms is perfect.  I dig on the quality of the material.. nice and lightweight for a long sleeve.  For those who don't dry clean, this shirt holds color beautifully... and the black buttons look sharp.<br /><br />My final verdict is this.  If you are a big guy, this shirt is for you.  If you want a rather inexpensive shirt that will make you look and feel sharp, this is for you.  If you like wrinkle free shirts and don't have time for a dry cleaner on the road... this is for you!
B00IMB2520|3|The suit fit well and seems to be &#34;okay&#34;. Not the best, but you get what you pay for. The mask though....trash. I went and spent the extra money on the nice pennywise mask.....WAY BETTER.
B007371V42|3|Not sure why this showed up under my account.  I did not order these socks, nor would I in the future.
B00K8274HC|4|Good item
B003NSAR9U|5|Please make another coat in the same style and different color.  I will never get rid of this coat and certainly will never get cold again.
B00JLDWUQE|5|There's nothing I don't love about this costume. Best thing I have ever purchased on Amazon, costume wise. I've been having a lot of trouble trying to find a costume that fits me just right, but I finally found the perfect one! The material is great. The dress is the perfect length if you're looking for a short, but not too short, costume! (I'm 5'5&#34;). The only issue is that the cape is pretty wrinkled when you take it out of the packaging. Has to be steamed or pressed. Not a huge deal. All in all, if you're looking for a nice costume that accents your bust and waist, this is the costume for you. Plus, it's super freakin' adorable and comfy.  Definitely worth the price! :)
B00NUCETTI|4|My wife was very pleased with this scarf!
B00KYKZNGM|5|I love these leggings, I bought them on impulse, but they were only $10.99 so whatever. Going off the other reviews that said they run small, I ordered them a size up and they fit like I thought they would, they're super comfortable as well, and not too hot. The colors are fabulous and I definitely recommend them to anybody like me who hates wearing real pants and just wears leggings instead.
B00G9TQSKM|5|The fit is really nice, the colors are bright and the shirt of nice quality. My little guy doesn't want to take it off, not even to sleep. Very cute outfit
B000UZ7O9U|5|The leather is wonderful, it smells great and feels great. The cover is well made and very stylish, a little tight to fit both a checkbook and a transaction register but nothing too bad, I'm sure it will loosen up.
B004UJ9QXE|4|These are an older version of the Elance which are usually available at Macy's or any department store like that, but on Amazon, they're cheaper if you choose a set of patterns that are either of a past holiday or something they might consider spring but it's fall. Older version or not, they're still good and do the coverage job you need.  If you need underwear, it doesn't matter.  I love the 100% cotton.  They're soft, don't ride up, and always the go-to panties for me.  Enjoy.
B00XAEYT14|4|Nice .... Didn't get a chance to wear it on my trip .., but I did try it on at home nice fit .
B007G4LYE4|5|This is by far my favorite top, gives you a great figure, super sexy.
B000TJSMP2|1|I just recieved these snow pants and they run 2 sizes too small, I wear an XL and ordered the XXL so I can wear a layer under these and they do have an adjustable waist and suspenders so they should have been fine. They fit like a large. The pants are nice, so order two sizes larger or you will be wasting $20.00 on shipping too return them.   [[ASIN:B000TJSMP2 Trespass Black Ski Snowboard Insulated Pants Men's]]
B00CXSSBI0|5|Great Hoody. Very soft and well made. Timely Delivery and very satisfied. The XXL is a little bit big for me, but I like my Hoody's to be roomy and comfortable. Thanks!
B00FX37XAO|5|So cute, fit my petite 3 year old perfectly!
B00EO61K78|5|It's like having a midget stripper walk around holding your balls in the palm of her hand all day.  Order a size smaller than your waist dimensions for the best fit.
B00IPO3W7G|5|Great fit and great look. Breaths well.
B0008EOWLG|5|Fits perfect seems like Lee is the best true fit brand I can always depend on.  Very durable jeans. Like the pocket size
B00N23PTLM|5|Beautiful!
B00065IA10|5|my brother in law has spinal bifida and his feet swell so this has been great for him to wear at night
B00G5AV710|4|The dress is beautiful however, it is too small.
B00EFEHR0S|5|Best shirt i've bought in a while. People love it.  Fits well.
B004ETGY0S|3|I only got this item so I could get free shipping, but I thought it would be pretty nifty. Instead of a cute homemade looking friendship bracelet, I got a manufactured piece of rope! It actually isn't that bad, but DEFINITELY is not what is pictured above. Overall I saved like 4 bucks by buying this so no harm no foul. I am, however, sincerely saddened that Amazon would deceive me like this. I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS AMAZON...I thought we were friends.
B00PJ1R80A|5|This was a gift for my husband and he hasn't seen it yet, but I know he will love it! It came quickly, and packaged well. Great design!
B00JGIG6CS|4|really liked this dress,  ordered a xl and it fit perfectly:) very stretchy flowy material...
B00LIWSVQE|5|quality is great but size seems to run smaller than expected.
B002WYKK5M|2|This hat runs very small and should be listed as a newborn size.  It is very nice but very small in size.
B000QANR0Y|3|Thought it didn't have any sticker in the back, turns out, there are lots of them, I would say you get what you pay for
B00C41GGHO|5|These were on my daughter's wish list for my little infant grandson.  Living in Florida, our cold spells are just that...cool in morning and late evening but during the day can get warm with the sun shining.  Therefore, these warmers are perfect worn together with a onesie and socks.  My grandson appears to be more comfortable with these as well instead of the bulky long pants.  Changing a diaper with these on is a cinch as they don't interfere at all.  I think this is the fourth style my daughter has now.  The quality is awesome and they last over many washings.  Highly recommend.
B004Q5UQZE|5|They asked me how do they fit, I always buy large because I can not stand anything tight on me,<br /> I like the shirt the one thing I would like to see is that they go back to making 100% cotton I have had these shirts before<br />I still have them and still wear them but they are 100% cotton they seem to keep me warmer.  I would buy this shirt again'<br />they are nice, they are soft, they do not make me itch. It is a all around good shirt the company was good also.
B0007YR96M|2|though I measured as a 44D by a bra seller I was unable to close it. I was disappointed for this.
B00LU2878O|5|I gave these to my husband for Christmas. He wore them for the first time this week with the big cold snap that hit. He really liked these pajamas. They are warm, soft and fit well. I highly recommend.
B0031U0PRY|5|As someone said, this belt is very short! I'm 30W, buy 34 just right. But this belt is of good quality! Recommend to you!
B00M7CA1K8|3|Ordered a medium, which is my usual size. Its more like snug underwear, i can breathe and be comfortable in it but it doesn't &#34;shape&#34; like i would have liked. Had i ordered a small, the waistband would have been too tight and uncomfortable. Overall, its a good product, but i'm definitely looking for a better one.
B00M7H2FP2|5|These wallets are adorable. They do protect your cards from being scanned but only hard 8 cards. Don't overload the wallet because the clasp can snap, but they work as advertised and are very cute!
B008GS2E9I|3|TOO big for my 7/8 year old but we used it anyway this year…now it has a hole in the bottom…NOT sturdy enough for an 8 year old for daily use to/from school???? Should be better made!
B003LZIBL6|5|Not super durable (each one of these lasts me about 8 months), but I'm happy to pay ten bucks every 8 months to have a small, stylish wallet instead of a huge wallet that gives me back problems.
B00A9ME762|4|Wish it came in children's size; purchased for my son to use for talent show. It was too long on him, but he still looked cute.
B0061YVV0W|4|While I like the style, the size options are a bit too generic ( several sizes come under large) and I was unable to specifically request 7-3/8&#34;. Thus I am in need of something to reduce the hat size somewhat. Also, I am now looking for printed hat bands with a tropical or Caribbean theme.
B00GTUE696|5|My granddaughter loves, loves, loves this dress! It suits her to a  &#34;T&#34;. She loves all things Hello Kitty so I sent it to her as a gift. My daughter reported her squeals of delight when she saw it and how happy she was when she put it on. She gleamed and felt so pretty and special.
B00WDPJU6A|3|Very, very thin fabric, more like a gauze, transparent,
B00K6MO1HA|1|If I could give this 0 stars I would. It is such poor quality that it's not worth even the inexpensive price tag. In less than 6 months I have had two zippers break, and both clasps on the strap broke as well as two ther parts of the strap. The problem is that the &#34;metal&#34; is not metal at all, but some really, really cheap imitation. Avoid, do not waste your money unless you don't mind having parts of your purse start to break in less than one month's use and then become totally useless in less than six months!!!
B00NCYTR7I|4|They are very soft! The fabric is a little thin so I'm affaid they might rip.
B00ESG47G0|4|Well when I ordered this product I was looking from my kindle. What I expected was a hoodie (which is also what the title entails). What I received was a jacket. Not a big fan of jackets because the zippers are always crud, and this one looks and feels like it will break after 5 zips. Oh well. Waited 3 weeks for the wrong product and I'll deal with it and maybe find a way to make it into an actual hoodie.
B00HDA2QHK|5|I love It!!!!
B00IPD6CA6|5|I love this dress with the shorts! Fits perfectly and it was a great price. I would buy it in every color of the rainbow if I could.
B00IXWFWKA|3|very see through cant wear it witch out something over it or under it
B009Z3Y72A|4|Having read the previous reviews, I anticipated the jacket to be on the small side, but this is small! The sleeve length is fine, but the overall length and size of a medium is more like a small. My 5 year old was also disappointed the hood didn't zip up all the way the way the creeper jacket did...but I also read that on previous reviews. I just hoped my son wouldn't mind, but he did! Overall though, he is happy, which is the main thing!
B00V7SEMZI|2|Not a fan of it.. the material is really cheap.
B00TXJK81A|5|Soft and wonderful great for all seasons
B006PF0PGI|4|I ordered this from South America and received before EDD.<br />The dress is really pretty, it makes you look thinner.<br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the inside of the dress is not lined and the fabric is just as it is but is just a detail.<br />I recommend it.
B00B8YRI66|5|I love the fit and was pleased with the item. I ordered this one in another color. Will order from this seller again.
B007YVYOJ6|5|This skirt is absolutely wonderful and goes with almost anything. Can't wait to wear it this spring and summer! It was worth the price for sure.
B00L406766|5|Great shirt, very comfortable to wear! I got a meduim size shirt and I'm a girl that's 5'7 140pounds the shirt was a bit big wish I got a small but its ok I still live the shirt.
B008JGLTKM|3|Fast shipping and not too much packaging. It fits somewhat boxy and a little on the Shortside
B00OAV9BI2|5|I loved the dress but it was a little short and a little small but I am tall. A bigger size might have fixed the issue with length.
B00B1C3DYG|5|It is awesome. The inside of it the fabric is so soft! I never wanted to take it off!
B00ME7KQFG|4|They are decent quality and dont seem as fragile as I expected because of how cheap they are. Somewhat thin. they are a darker shade of khaki but not too dark. 4/5 overall to me which was better than i expected
B00CXOSCHE|5|Really helpful for rapid diaper changes and a change from onesies.  Fit really well, and can take off like a onesie, too.
B009W7LI4O|4|Very pleased with the size and quality of the bag. To note, the bag is a much brighter neon green than the picture shows.
B00GO0LM4S|5|GOOD SIZE AND. FIT...
B00EG8N8XI|2|Are you kidding me? Maybe it's for starving children, but mine is not. I can't even vear it on my 15months girl who has only 80sm tall and 10rg weight.
B00I9MV4HO|5|Nice fit
B00TF1U29Y|4|Looks great!! Just wish there were underwire to keep the girls together
B005FB44TW|5|I was hesitant to order this robe and usually spend close to but not quite this amount for a robe each season.  My other robe was completely worn out and needed another for end of season.  This robe exceeded my expectations of what I would receive.  Very soft and plush.  A bit on the heavier side but fantastic for cold mornings.  Extremely comfy, has been washed and came out of the wash with no problem.  A 5 star product.
B00T730PQA|2|Love the dress, hate the color. I wanted a red dress for my graduation party and when the dress came it ended up be a dark coral color. And the worst part of it all I already have a dark coral maxi dress so now I have two but different styles.
B00P1TWYRW|5|What can I say this is an awesome item. Been wanting one for 30 years. Now I have it. It is remarkably comfortable and light. I can't praise this item enough. A must-have for everyone who loves Tom Baker's Doctor.
B00JRWVT8E|3|The wallet is very pretty and there is room for lots of different things. My biggest complaint is the spot for the drivers license. It is very difficult to get out of the slot, if you need to remove it for any reason. I'm also not crazy about the coin pocket, the zipper just seems like it is going to break easily (though it hasn't yet) and it's a bit hard to get the change out because the pocket doesn't open wide so you can get it out easily. Last, I feel as if it is somewhat cheaply made. Granted, I didn't pay that much for it, but I just don't have faith that it will last very long... I hope it does, because it is cute, but I guess I'll see!
B0030355RM|5|Adorable and very good quality.  Fit was true to size. I bought this for my godson and his parents loved it. Definitely worth the money.
B00QIJKW00|5|The granddaughter says it was great Christmas gift.
B00MHH6ZEO|4|Very comfortable.
B00H0CZSI0|5|This top is flattering and hugs you in all the right places.
B004PA1ULO|5|I bought an XL. Fits perfect. I have gotten plenty of compliments about this shirt. Wear it when riding my Street Glide. thx
B00LMI5XAQ|4|It looked nice, but it did run too large.
B00CMST4WS|4|I typcially wear a medium size, so that is what I ordered. It fit as I anticipated it would. It is a cute shirt!
B00SJ6KKN4|5|Great quality.  Nice colors.  True to size.  Fits easily over my son's wide feet (which we sometimes struggle with)
B00AGA1IUK|4|This will be a gift. I like it because I'm sure my granddaughter will love it because she it all into beads, baubles, and bangles.
B00DJIHBBG|3|Fits good , color great, only problem they r THIN...
B008OW814S|5|My son asked for a buzz lightyear coat for Christmas. Found this one days before and am do happy I ordered it. He loves it and I am very happy with the quality and price!
B00DBBH6BQ|2|Edges fraying after 1 week of light use. Looks old all ready so I might return it.
B004AICQFK|5|I received this dress today and absolutely love it! I am about 5 feet 6 and the large fits comfortably all around. I also got the dress in the other colors too...and they all fit the same. The material is light so it will be especially great during the hot summer days.
B00TQ8FB10|5|Great buy!  My son is 11 years old but wears a size 14-16. It was perfect for camp and fit him very well.  It washed well and the terry cloth was good quality.
B003ZYDUIM|4|I bought this bra for a belly dance bra. It's nicely padded and can take the extra weight of coins being attached to the bust.
B00G3363Y0|5|I was so unhappy that it didn't fit me the way I wanted it to.  They have gone over and above to help me.  I love to deal with people who are willing to go out of there way to help.  I was very sad that I had to send it back the poncho was beautiful I loved the collar and the bow in the back.  Very well made.  Awesome people. It looked just the picture did very soft.  It wasn't suppose to arrive till February and received it very quick.  Thank you for all of your help it meant a lot to me for you to go out of your way.
B0046IB3AI|5|Good quality of cotton.  A must have for any Homebrewing Geek.  My husband gets compliments whenever he wears it.
B0073ARUIA|4|Arms run small
B009KYL038|1|With a name like Dockers, I expected quality. Unfortunately, the buckle on this belt fell off within 3 months of the purchase. With it only being worn a couple of times a week at most, this should have lasted longer. I will not buy another.
B00C1YW9AW|5|Love, love, love this shirt!  It's soft and sexy.  Just what I wanted.  It's a little sheer - as it's advertised to be - so I usually wear a cami underneath or with a cardigan.  Very flattering.
B008VFUQW8|5|Tried on the suit and it fits great! The measurements offered are true to size. Bought the suit and dressed it up as a Prince outfit. Love, Love, Love the suit. It's pure white not off white and is made of good quality. My little prince received lots of compliments. Highly recommend.
B00G65P0NA|5|i love this, it goes great with my belly dance attire.
B00W3EW03Q|3|It was made of great neoprene material, but it was just wayy too small for me :( the seller was super awesome though and gave me a full refund for the suit
B006MAOO6S|4|Soft, comfortable...he's worn them two days in a row...the weather's been yucky with freezing rain and snow....but my 12 year old son loves them
B008YGELE8|4|This is just what I needed for those spring days when there is a chill in the air but I don't need a heavy coat. Plus I can throw it over work clothes for the office or dress it down for the casual wear to the grocery store.
B0002UCES4|3|Not bad it works but not quality .
B00AQMT4KE|3|Just  a simple dress. Not too impressed with the material but appears to be one that you can feel just relaxed in.
B00JSP9SLA|5|These are very comfortable, colors are good
B003EEMBEC|4|We like authentic.  These scrubs fit into the real items I ordered and also the Doc McStuffin medical kit they received.
B007OUEOWO|3|I have another pair of these Slender Secret jeans from Lee and loved them, so bought these thinking I'd love them just as much.  I'd recently lost weight and needed to size down.<br />Unfortunately this pair fit almost like jeggings, and while I know with the stretchy fabric they will loosen up after wear, they were just TOO fitted through the knee/calf area, and this caused them to bunch up, making them appear shorter than they actually were and not so attractive on me.  Loved how they fit my butt and waist, but I guess the legs weren't boot cut enough for me.  I'll be sending them back.
B00760Y67K|4|The dress is very complimenting to my plus size frame. I am about 5'2 the dress is alittle short however with some black tights and heels outfit came a long way. I love the material not to thin and its elastic material feels good to the skin and well venitlated. Love the dress got many compliments definetly a show stopper.
B000BN6JQK|5|It's just what I was looking for!
B002OULZHG|4|loved the cap, even though I ordered the small size, it was still to big and had to return it.<br />Wish they made an extra small<br />There was no hassle on the return
B006TWHSYE|5|I wore them on a warm easter day and they were not too hot to bear. I really liked them and they worked perfectly with the other items i purchased to create a bunny costume.
B00CAFUDDC|4|I really like the fit and they are perfect for wearing under dresses especially form fitting clothing.  Great value....I have in black & nude.
B00DG6HCV0|5|Warm, nice fit.
B006PI12FS|4|Scratch up real easy and I ordered 2 one red and one green l. There a good size. Not too small and not too big. One seemed a little better quality than the other but there brand new in package and hold about 8 credit cards/ license and only a few bills of money like a couple folded 20s and about 8 singles folded. They come with a limited lifetime warranty. I like it better than my old wallet. Lighter, sleeker, and your money and cards won't go anywhere. I say get it for the price and warranty. That's my 2 cents.
B00EVJS0HG|4|oky doky
B000Y9CJ8S|4|I'm a big guy. I had hoped for a larger poncho but I knew that I ordered one size fits lots. Its fine.  Bigger and lined would be cool though.
B007A0TKKO|3|I expected this hat to come to be in a nice box instead I recev'd it in an bag, which<br />casues it to bend -up and lose it shape. I can say the Hat is very nice.
B00CTA5QRQ|5|It didn't take too long for this sweatshirt to become my favorite.  Its warm, soft, fits and looks well and is solidly stitched.  Would highly recommend to any guy looking for a stylish sweatshirt.
B002R0F8JE|4|Good fit for 6 year old dancer.  Last a long time and wash well.
B00HX569KK|5|I would buy again
B00MFL4K44|5|Nice quality.  Had to get them hemmed for short legs.
B003OQTQ34|5|My husband loves cahart.. He has had a carhart before and love the quality. He likes that the money clip is in the inside.
B00EL3KMXC|1|The skin on my legs began to burn immediately after put them on.  Even after multiple soakings and washings, they remain unwearable.  Cannot imagine how or why such material is being sold.
B007S01VP8|5|Looks really cool and everyone noticed this larger than life costume. Only problem we had was keeping the back fastened. Great costume though!
B00BOOH2RA|4|Love the color and cut is flattering, however, it really runs pretty small.  I know formal wear is supposed to run small and am glad I ordered a size larger than what I measure.
B0048J72ZA|4|Definitely a hat for a slightly larger head.  Very warm and comfortable.
B00553XNM4|3|Although looks very supportive the cups were a little big. This bra has lots of hooks in the back of it.
B00T6SME6A|5|Love it, fits great, nice and cool and easy to care for...
B00M11XSVE|5|amazingly perfect!
B00QNW8HRC|4|the size was a bit small and since i like things big i really wish it came in more sizes, but i really like the shirt, and the material. it did take like a month to get here. but other than that is was pretty good.
B006G7JXTA|5|Our daughter has a shoe size 5.5. The medium size fits her great. They will stretch a little bit more as her foot grows. I would not recommend these socks for summer as they are warm. They are great for fall, winter (with warm shoes) and spring. I love having six pairs and not to look for matching socks all the time as I did in the past. I usually do laundry every five days so I have enough. I plan to buy large size for the next year.
B005CSNY5S|5|great quality, unfortunately too long, would be good fit for a tall person
B00G9N25B4|5|The colors are as vivid as they are in the pic. This scarf fits nicely as a fashionable addition on your head or around your neck (would look awesome tied around a white turtleneck!). It's not long, but more squarish (is that a word??). Feels silky and is quite becoming for any age.
B00IDF25DE|3|They run very small. I am a short person just under 5'3&#34; and they barely went over my knee. My calves are shorter than my thighs so it doesn't make sense to me. I also have pretty skinny legs and they were tight!
B00FOXD172|4|Fit great but the smaller decals (baby hands) started peeling off after first washing
B006MW17ZC|5|Amazing deal, got tons of compliments and it kept me warm on a windy day with only a tshirt under!<br /><br />Great Buy, will defiantly be back to the store for more!!<br /><br />Packaging was great, minimal and not wasteful at all!
B00H4RS5TU|5|Fits like the model looks and is brighter in person. looks great with jeans and black pants. Can be for work or play.
B001300X1W|5|High quality patch couldn't have asked for better!
B0018OHOSS|4|I ordered 2&#34; larger in the waist than my usual size in jeans. After a couple washings, they fit nicely and are very comfortable - but definitely a pretty relaxed fit overall. A nice pair of comfortable jeans, with more legroom than the slim straight jeans I normally wear.  If you are looking for a snug fit - this ain't it.  :)
B00GY1HHVY|3|Should buy an extra size so it will fit properly
B00JOARRZ8|2|Why is this darn thing so short? I get that it is &#34;Asian&#34; sizing and I ordered for my measurements according to the size chart, but it isn't long enough to fit my torso (which is pretty average). I don't know who would have such a short torso besides my ten year old and then it would be too wide.
B00R74VIQC|5|I love the shirt. It fit as expected. The material is so soft and it was very comfortable!
B00G96XQQE|2|It's not too too bad...I'm not OK with da fact of yall debitting my acct...then placing da funding back into my acct..just to take it out again...not ok....it put me da negative. ....not cool
B00BNBBGOE|5|Comfortable, with enough support and almost feels like wearing nothing compared to uncomfortable narrow straps, rubber/elastic that irritates when sweaty, underwire that cuts into you, etc. The fact that I bought 4 and gave one to my daughter who also likes it says a lot for me!<br /><br />Size seems about the same as my other clothes - I generally wear a &#34;medium&#34; in women's sizes or size 10. I bought medium and like the fit.
B00GFXZ2JK|2|after hiking about 30 miles in 4 days, had two larger blisters.
B00ACIFT5Q|2|Put it on at 8 am as a crew neck. By noon it was a v-neck.....
B005H3JHJA|5|So... we picked this (and every character) up for Christmas for our daughter (2) who loves Gabba.  The only issue that we have run into is that this, and all the peruvian style Gabba hats (with the dangle ears & string) are that they are adult sized and tend to run quite large.  This Brobee hat fits nicely on my head (adult male) with an average sized noggin it's still got some room.  If I put it on my daughter it's workable, but still on the large side.  If she is running around or dancing it is likely to fall over her eyes.<br /><br />I will review each item individually, but in case you're only looking at one of them I will break them down by size (at least our experience with size) here and in each review to try to help.  This list is in order from smallest to largest.  (Plex, Muno, Brobee, Toodee, Foofa)  We also got the DJ Lance Beanie and it's still adult size, but as a beanie it's small enough to still fit relatively well on our daughter without falling off or covering her eyes.<br /><br />The hat is very warm and is a great sleep hat as it's been exceptionally cold this winter.  Also, fantastic to embarrass older children if you are willing to wear it out in public. :)  They tend to run a bit on the expensive side, but if your child loves the characters as much as mine... buying a cheap hat to keep warm isn't what you are going for to begin with.
B0078JN3E6|5|ok
B004RHJ0WQ|4|This wig worked perfectly for my Kurt Cobain costume.  It looked great and fit perfectly.  I even performed with my band wearing the wig and had no trouble with it moving or falling off.  The only reason I've given 4 rather than 5 stars is because the hairs seem to fall out somewhat easily when running your fingers through the wig.  It's only been a few at a time, so it hasn't altered the appearance of the wig.  It's simply a minor annoyance.  Otherwise, great wig!
B002ZAPJW2|2|These gloves are just basic white cotton gloves.  They tend to fray very quickly and no longer look sharp after just a few hours of use.  Not high quality.  Fine for a costume, not so great if you intend to use them for a longer period.
B00UNOB9US|5|This is a wonderful wallet exactly as pictured in photograph and described.  Packaging excellent.  Quick delivery.
B0007CKMGS|4|Great looking.  The waist size was right, however the length was too long.
B0061SMOQS|4|I have a small head and will make slight alterations inside the headband. A very pretty hat, but took a long time to arrive.
B00VQ954TQ|5|Love it!  Nice material and fit was as I expected.
B00MXJ9VC4|3|Good and a just able
B000PQH8O0|1|This is NOT a heavyweight dome cap. This is actually the Titan Classic Spandex Dome Cap that can be purchased on Amazon for $2.49. I spent $8.99 + $6.39 for shipping to get a quality cap, but what I received was a tiny cap made of very poor quality. I called e4hats customer service line for an entire day and was not able to get through to speak to a person. Please don't waste your time and money by purchasing this product. I will never order from this vendor again.
B0017UHCEY|5|arrived fast, fit good
B007RER1RW|5|I love these pajamas, they fit really great, and they are a great material! Certainly a great buy for these pajamas!
B00QL55ET0|5|Really nice,its a must have if your a fan of the 90s animated series
B000JWJM8U|5|Great hat,  work in it regularly,  fit perfect and super light weight.  I couldn't be happier with the hat.
B00475H9XU|5|Bought this for my 7 yo daughter and it worked perfect.
B007R0I102|5|I love my Heisenberg shirt.  It is very comfortable and fits very well.  Definitely recommended for any Breaking Bad fans.
B00LMOSHDK|2|It was not as dresses as I hoped it was almost tshirt material. Not really dressy enough to wear as a shrug over a dress.
B00BJOR658|3|Looks ok doesn't come with leggings but the camo is semi stretchy so fits mid-sized girls. But for price not bad
B00NGQLCC0|1|Would not recommend ordering these. The dyes do not appear to be set. Quality is suspect.
B01143RUB8|3|Quality seemed nice, but was MUCH smaller than expected.
B00O0OYMTW|2|They don't reach to my upper thigh like other stockings.  And the lace, or a layer of clear latex, is not what holds these stockings up.  It's a narrow cord of elastic, similar to a rubber band.  Which even with a thin thigh like mine, will create a mark and dig into your skin.
B006C0V18W|4|Really like these board shorts. They are comftorable, great looking and size was accurate. I think the price is reasonable to.
B00F8M8BLU|4|Receive what expected.
B00JMXQHGC|5|Great price and this outfit is adorable. Usually I don't buy sets because my son is small and the pants are usually big, but this all fit perfect. The jacket is super soft, stylish and warm. He looks awesome in it.
B00HUNY38K|3|I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. We live in California so it didn't need to be too warm, and he did specify to me that he wanted &#34;a sweatshirt that he could wear year round&#34;. The looks are ok, they're similar to the assassin hoodie found on DealMan (there the price is around $30-$50 but probably a higher quality). This does not give much warmth, and there is no torso shapping, it's more a rectangle fit so it doesn't hug a man's shape too nicely. I also had to do a few adjustments to it; the pockets were sewn up so I had to remove the thread to make them usable. The snap on buttons are also made of cheap plastic, and the hood is actually not adjustable. I gave it 3 stars for looks but does not function well as a sweatshirt.
B00IX5YRQ2|5|I ordered these for the junior bridesmaids in my wedding. They are perfect.
B00GOQ3YWA|5|It's a beautiful and gentle Congratulations to clean your work
B00028B4UK|3|They were the wrong size
B00I8P9YSI|5|Love the dress! Comfortable and gorgeous.
B00CUTQ8BO|2|This was a great lighter functionally, but the element failed after 6 months and would no longer light. Total disappointment. I expected something more durable from Zippo.
B00IK2HXC8|4|This suit fits my wife very well.  It is a bright blue and has great contrast with the white trim.  She really enjoys it!!
B00JVUFLZ4|5|Great quality and fast shipping made this the best deal online. I normally do not purchase online due to how particular I am however I was very happy with this order and will continue to use them going forward.
B00KCR1KPA|3|The size that i got were fine towards the front of my foot but in the back they were loose.  This meant I had to wear another pair of socks over them which defeated the whole purpose of wearing them.
B005PVOB86|5|Husband loves it
B00851C5TU|5|nice jeans
B00CX87DXY|3|the shirt's a good product delivery was quicker than expected but shirts run on the small side
B001J1XD76|5|love it as a collecter, great.
B00FT77X18|5|excellent
B00I1LVJBE|4|A tighter than normal 34, but they stretch when you move. Have about 10 pairs of these Hurley board shorts. Love them!
B006SRTB6I|4|Serve the purpose of keeping yourself warm, but shrink noticeably after wash using gentle, delicate cycle in cold water. If only the pants were made longer to offset the shrinking.
B002HJ377A|5|I was hoping this shirt would make an impression and it did.  All the girls who work at Dairy Queen were so into me.  So, along with the discounts on my Blizzard's I get (thank you shirt) I'm also up to my neck in lovin'.  Like the howls of the wolves so does this shirt also enchant.
B00Q6EILEG|5|This is a very nice top.  The style is more comfortable than I expected, and it is quite soft.  Material is quality and not transparent.  It would be nice if there were XS available, but the small looks nice tucked in.  Very feminine that way.  Pretty blouse.  Well sewn.
B0085AL3GW|5|Haggar slacks fit each and every time and are such easy care.  Also look great.  Never disappointed.
B000N8TEL0|4|I bought these pants for my son's high school uniform pants. It's a good shade of gray and they always look crisp and sharp with no ironing. Love that. Sturdy fabric means he can play video games on the floor without wearing through the knees or butt. Just wish the fabric was a bit softer and I don't like having to carefully clip off the little Dickies patch - always afraid I'm going to tear the fabric. But a great choice for school uniform pants.
B00J2FNLPK|5|These shirts were a huge hit! So cute, perfect fit and great way to make the announcement! Our kids loved them.
B007VIWHA0|5|I have finally found a pair of jeans that fits!!! I have always loved the Levi brand but as I got older I couldn't find a pair that fit right. Wore them last night for the first time. No bagging after 4 hours of wear! I am 64 5'4&#34; and 137lbs. The length was perfect. No muffin top as these sit a little higher on your waist but they don't look like mommy jeans.I also have a blue pair of 512's that fit the same. These are the skinny look jeans, not to tight but slim and if you have a tummy these jeans will make it look like you don't. Very slimming! Plus I got both pairs on sale at Amazon! I expect these to be my go to jeans this spring.
B00846IRV6|4|Finally here, and well worth the wait.  Perfect size, well made and a big hit.  The quilting makes this a perfect toddler first backpack
B00TS4D7AO|5|Fit was ok, but would have liked a little more room, and my twin grandsons are small for their age.  Lovely shirt and they will wear it.
B0045ON1TE|5|Wonderfully soft, fine wool. Large scarf/shawl. Love the pattern. Bought two as gifts - greatly appreciated. Have not heard how they wash/dry clean. Would highly recommend and would purchase again
B003ILFTOK|1|My wife has been in good shape all of her life.  She IS NOT hefty or overweight, (like 5' 8&#34;, 145)  This top she wanted is ridiculously small for a Womens Large.  (The brand should be named 'American Apparel' for a reason.  We are not talking third world here).<br /><br />The return policy is that you have to pay for return shipping, AND their Discretionary Charges including THEIR HANDLING fee; and taxes (which should be refundable).  So it does not pay to send it back.<br /><br />We will just donate it.  And avoid this retailer like the plague.  My wife will never buy from American Apparel again.<br /><br />(sent with approval from my spouse)
B007F8QTFK|5|perfect pjs light and comfortable.  Keep me warm on a cold night but I don't feel smothered.  very happy :)
B0002TOZ00|4|Really nice quality, good socks just beware these are really long!<br /><br />Not a fault of the sock in any way, I just did not realize how long these are
B003Y01LR4|5|I got this for my daughter who is in a wedding as a flower girl. I am very happy with the purchase!!
B0050AFXC0|4|I use these shirts daily as undershirts. They hold up great, but do eventually need replacing. When that happens, they become workout shirts...
B006G7JZBQ|4|I have these socks in grey that my little boy has been wearing for about a year now.  They hold up well in the wash, and the shape keeps them on little feet even when there is room to grow.  I was a bit mislead in that the picture shows 6 pair of pink socks, but the package had three pink and three purple.
B004KPFEDE|5|shirt looks and fits wonderful!!!
B00Q3E0JPI|5|wonderful fit<br />wonderful picture of Mickey
B001BG4YEU|1|This bra should not be made in a D cup, is not for more than a B in my opinion.  Lovely construction, fabric, etc., but not enough support for more than an A or B.  Returned
B007SJ60YG|5|These are very comfortable! The fit is super nice and I am very glad I made the choice to by them. Very well made!
B00H4TR2EW|5|Great buy. ....it fit my boys perfectly
B00DQVTLP0|5|LI've them...bought 3 more colors. So comfortable
B002JIO2ZK|2|Not good, do not suggested
B00FF1ZK8Q|1|Hello, I'm in love with your brand. love it wear it with pleasure. but this time I was disappointed as the overshirt's size is XS than Medium. till today I was wearing MEDIUM sizes but I think there is a problem with sizes. I feel very unhappy as I'm not able to send you the overshirt back. it was jus wait money. I wasn't expecting to face such problems with my beloved brand.what a pity.
B00DJNZA2S|3|I really liked the argyle pattern, but these socks are much thinner than I expected Anne Klein to be.
B007JRACLE|4|Llegó a tiempo, era el modelo que elegi, la unica diferencia que finalmente me gustó es que en vez de botones traia cierra.<br />Para mi está perfecto !!!
B004AZZGLO|4|It bled when grape seed oil, our favorite &#34;personal lube&#34;, was used when my GF wore this to bed (along with her 6&#34; heels and other assorted accoutrements.  Amazon was kind enough to send a partial refund so that we could keep it and not give a negative review.  We have since washed these vinyl/synthetic garments before playing with them.  Delicious.
B00CJJUH9O|5|Kids are into minecraft--Love the design of the tee shirt
B00DQYWKA0|5|It is a very durable, waterproof, and good looking jacket that I use for multiple occasions. I take it with me to Boy Scout camp and I use it just as a casual rain jacket. It is very stylish and for a waterproof jacket it breaths very well. It also compacts nicely into a ball about the size of a softball so I just carry it in my backpack for school. I would highly recommend this jacket.
B008A1X87S|5|I ordered this dress for my upcoming birthday party and I love it!  It runs a bit small so I would suggest getting a size up (as I did).
B00XLEA8P4|5|Nice and comfortable.
B00BXXME8Y|2|Did not like it, it felt too thin, cheap
B00A433RBW|4|I love this infinity scarf! It looks just like the picture and can be wrapped around my neck in a variety of ways. It is nice and warm. It still looks stylish and works well in the blustery Chicago weather and is a welcome addition to my winter outerwear.
B00QXXGNWM|5|Wearing this hat in a Wisconsin shop with no heater in the building was a brilliant idea.  Minus degree temps this January were no bother with the head not exposed to the elements.
B00E8GRIIE|4|Nice fit, but I haven't washed it yet. It says hand wash on the tag. I added a little more color with fabric paint to make mine more like Mossy Oak camo. Now I can blend in like I live in Monroe, LA.
B00B5MPVV0|5|Too cool
B0054NFD1Y|5|Bought these for my 16yo son, who is very fashion conscious.  These fit him very well, and he finds them flattering enough to want to  wear them daily.  Hes' told me that these are the most comfortable boxer briefs he's ever worn!  That's good enough for me!
B00JBGM9G2|5|125 pounds 5'5&#34; FITS WONDERFUL.
B00EFEUMZU|5|perfect Christmas Gift
B006ITNOQ4|5|I really like this bag.  It's lightweight but sturdy.  I ordered this several months ago and it has held up really well.  It is perfect for my job, I carry all kinds of things in it.
B00HDA3FQG|4|a litter tight
B00EIQR75I|5|Looks and feels amazing.  Tummy control and enhance chest area. I love it!
B000EU66UE|5|These ear muffs are very warm and fluffy. 100% fox fur is very soft and keeps your ears warm and out of the wind. The band is very comfortable and does not put any pressure on your head like some headbands that give me headaches. Very good quality. My ears thank you muffs:)
B00L9CK3A0|4|Beautiful and light.  I was nervous to purchase a dress that was labeled &#34;One Size Fits Most&#34;, however it was perfect for a person 5'6&#34;, Size 10-12.  The dress also arrived very quickly.
B00AJQLHIO|4|Not really true to size<br />dissappointed
B00AYCZDDI|5|Good quality product that fits right and is very comfortable. Would recommend this to anyone looking for casual around town fashion.
B003E3A7QC|5|Great.  Comfortable.
B00527MAEU|5|hubby has small feet. works out well to wear in the office (secretly)
B000UMQB1U|4|a little big, but wrapping the red sash around it made it fit much better
B000SKI752|5|perfect get full
B00ARI52XU|5|One of my top three Deadmau5 shirts.
B00NUHD3DQ|4|😄
B00CTRSCCU|5|love this
B005C53J38|5|I wear them all the time.  To bed and out everywhere.  I would buy more of them, but in different colors.
B001N2UTBE|5|I love it!
B00C1FPH9Q|4|good quality but a bit expensive $7-8 a pair with taxes
B00AVS87TW|4|The dress is very pretty and easily can get five stars, the only problem i have with it is that i ordered a 12 month sized dress for my daughter who is 8 months old and the dress can harly fir. My daughter is not considered big for her age, in fact she is a bit small and still the dress was a close fit. I would recomend that you take a larger size than you really need.
B000QV1OKS|4|Great bra but the plastic clasp broke in 3 months. Unfortunately I cannot return it nor can I obtain a replacement clasp.
B000N3X91Q|5|Very nice pants, very confortable, my son loves those pants.
B00933AE10|5|Fits snug and doesn't loosen after washes. I use it for working out and it doesn't get loose when I use it
B00AGAIJBQ|5|I have always wanted this tie to wear with a white but the price was prohibitive and I now happy
B004A7XXRQ|3|cut a little small. buy a size bigger than you normally wear. does not shrink in wash.  nice material. thanks
B00JD41YRM|1|The top fit OK but the bottom was NOT a women's medium.  That bottom was made for a 10-year-old girl!  I am normally a small to medium on the bottom; I would have had to buy an XL or XXL for it to have fit properly.
B001ODUA1Q|1|This item was delivered to me today and I am sending it back tomorrow. First of all, it is yellow. Not khaki, not greyish... just yellow. The Ghostbusters did not wear yellow suits. Maybe in the crappy cartoon they did...but trust me it's yellow. Second, I am a taller guy with a bigger build, so I knew I needed a bigger size. Umm, I could drive a dump truck through this thing. It looks like maybe this was made for two children to wear at the same time. You know, if one was on the others shoulders. Anyway, I just wanted you to know that every time this costume is purchased, Bill Murray dies a little inside.
B003TU1I8Q|2|I saw good reviews about this costume and i thought i would buy it. I wanted \\"toga\\" dress for halloween for a long time and it was supposed to be it. The fabric looks very cheap and it lookes like i could make even better dress by myself, i am size 6-8 and i dont look big at all, but this dress made me look like i am 12! Very dissapointed... I am going to return it for sure...
B00EMG3UOG|5|These are adorable and I love the price. Gerber's Onesies tend to fit on the small side, but as long as you know that, you can size accordingly. I use them as pajama onesies for my four month old, and she's average sized.
B00LL9TMTO|5|Fits great and my wife loves it.
B00C78CNX0|1|Wasn't fit at all and the discription wasn't the same as the item
B000MOOJ7Y|5|We got 3 of this dresses for my Sister-in-law's wedding. They were so adorable and my daughter loved her dress, not to mention that the price was unbeatable!  Truly recommended!!!
B00NTD54YM|4|So comfortable and sexy. Love these pants!
B00FYF8V48|4|I am usually a extra small in drawstring but these were a lil snug
B00J8OU0AO|5|Small fit me well, it's comfortable and soft enough. Not one of the super thin tees and should hold up well.
B00IYS1CBG|5|I 💜💜💜💜💜 everything about this scarf!  So happy with my purchase!  I found the perfect shoes to go with it!
B0085VPQX2|5|I only buy Carhartt products because of their long lasting, comfortable wear, and also because I can wear them as casual attire outside of work and they look great!
B00L6S5X52|5|Got them fast from China. Already used some.
B00DAU49FO|1|Material was very cheap. The golden part on the waist looked extremely rubbery.
B00MXVSEYI|1|Do not like the fit of the hat😔
B00J25KOK0|3|It does not help with your shape.
B007H3R2LI|5|I'm happy to have a comfortable bra that fits. I've had a couple of large Bravado bras and they're just too big for cup size so I bought the medium and it's perfect. I've got a wider chest without a big cup... Maybe a 38b (on smaller side). My normal 38b bras rub and hurt and the band feels too tight but this fits perfect.
B004XVVZW4|5|This bodysuit will become your favorite.  My friend reccomended it to me and I love the softness of itl.  The commercial brands are not upto par with this one.  I really suggest you try one and then fall in love.  My baby is worth it!
B008OXC1DO|5|Love em. Very durable comfortable and rugged. Many pockets to put stuff in. They are kinda thick though so you will get hot in the heat of the summer
B007JFETGK|5|Great shirt for the money!
B00G5JIGSS|3|I'm 5'4, 110lbs and wear between a size 25 and 26. I decided to go with the 26 because I was looking for a slightly looser fit and because another reviewer said they run smaller than usual. After wearing these for a day I  think they're actually more true to size for Lucky Brand than not.<br /><br />After washing they fit pretty perfectly but as the day went on they really began to stretch out and loose their clean look which seems to be common with this brand. They also have a weird fit in the thigh/crotch and land pretty high up making them a bit uncomfortable, especially if you sit as a desk (or anywhere, even) for prolonged periods of time. Other than the weird fit and unflattering &#34;saggy&#34; shape they take in the butt, thigh, and waist area toward the end of the day, they are actually pretty nice quality, inexpensive, and casually stylish enough to get 3 stars.<br /><br />PS... I suggest sizing down if you're in between sizes and dislike the saggy end of the day jean look.
B004BIIU6I|3|the shirt color is a bit different that the one showed in the pics, but still is a nice shirt, great quality print and has a nice feel
B00LL3NHBE|1|The flowers fall off a lot.
B007XOQGXQ|4|Ordered XL - seems more like a L.  If you order, you may need to go up one size from your normal size.
B008BT63TE|4|As described and didn't seem to shrink much in the dryer either.  They are baby socks, not much else to them.
B00S80XVQE|3|I like this top. I wished i had purchased the black though as the pink isn't as pictured. It's  more &#34;dirty pink&#34; almost &#34;dull peach&#34; looking. I orderd a medium  ( my normal size) and it fits. A few minor haphazard stitching on hem so if you are a stickler for these things, beware.
B004O9U4C2|2|The image looks great, but the material used is rather flimsy. I was expecting something more sturdy.<br />And apparently I overlooked the extra folds in the middle of the hat, so it's going to be very difficult (if not impossible) for me to have something embroidered across the front.
B002VESB9A|4|Every little French girl who has lost her hair from chemotherapy should have a beret in every colour of the rainbow!  I am very pleased.  (Je suis tres contente!)
B009QUNH3C|5|Love these pj's - they are soft & comfortable. They wash & dry well & the fabric still looks & feels great!
B000BIDG7A|5|this product real fits very well and slims your waist perfectly!!!! thanks amazon and i would definitely order another one.<br />love love!!!!
B002UUAC0G|5|its a nice well fitting hat, comfortable, great worn look, half the time i forget to take it off. i have always wanted a hat with a design i like and this was just that. there is another one that has who ya gonna call on the bill and a different design on the front i was thinking about getting it as well.
B007AW9ZCA|5|I had bought a pair of these socks while vacationing at Tybee Island, GA and loved them.  I found them on Amazon so I bought 2 more pairs.  LOVE THEM.  They are great to wear around the house.  Cotton and nice and warm.
B00M2OEY40|5|I would say 5 star item and I will definitely order again.
B007TKUN2O|4|Love these bras.  Just wish they were a bit more comely . . . they're not something I feel beautiful wearing.
B00BD8UMV0|5|great
B00TQ7PH9M|1|It doesn't fit my wallet
B00QUOP32U|4|Makes really nice soft jammies, but definitely not fancy enough for a dress up dress.
B00NTZF9XQ|5|The flare is much bigger than it looks on the picture. I wore it with a white over coat or just by itself, usually over a pair of leggings. Got a lot of compliment. I guess the point is to have a rather fair skin and it really shows and make you look good even at my ripe old age!
B0027E3I3S|4|I bought this tie for myself. Being a skinny 5'4 female, ties that are made for men are way too big for me. And ties that are made for boys tend to be pre-tied or clip-on. This tie however, is great. The length is perfect, and the width is a good match for my small frame.<br /><br />The quality is decent. It's not anything fancy, but it works well for a business casual look. It adds that touch of professionalism to a button-down shirt and is perfect for every day wear. I will be buying more of these in the future, in a variety of colors.
B002L9BZT8|5|The Ear Warmers from exolite are a pretty good bargain, and they work very well. They keep my ears warm even at 40F, and hold up well even when it's windy. The item was delivered promptly and the seller was nice enough to follow up after the purchase. 5 stars!
B0018OLLXM|5|COOL
B000OE0OAS|2|Beware!!!  What was advertised by this company was not sent to me.  I was sent a striped polyester shirt; I was under the impression that I had ordered a silk burgundy shirt/bonus tie combo.      Just watch what you order from this retailer.
B00I1LOA6U|5|My 6th grader uses this and it is big enough to fit all of her junk in it.
B0085VBVTU|1|Size runs TOO small, it shrunk after first wash  AND FABRIC LOOKS CHEAP, VERY POOR QUALITY!!  DO NOT  BUY IT!
B00GUY7652|3|Very sturdy material but difficult for arthritic hands to stretch around to close. Also, not suitable for large-breasted women as it doesn't have any &#34;form&#34; and just comoresses breasts, making for a not-very-feminine appearance.
B00I4KX2E4|4|Nice shirt.  Fits a tad on the small size after washing.  Great color an island style.
B00KL53PH4|5|My son loves these pants. High quality. Fits a bit small.
B00D6F0ZFQ|5|LEES THE BEST
B008USYKK0|5|Great backpack don't know what the other people complain about the backpack is se what cheap I'm a way but what I got it for I really can't complain this was a great backpack over all and people should buy it we'll that's just my opinion I give the backpack 5 stars and It arrived on time no later on early just right on time thank you guys
B00IKBHZCW|4|Fits right as i expected, and with such a good price i love it!!!!!
B00Q3J6EMK|5|Love em!
B00SMRN88Y|4|Got them for my boyfriend and he loves them, says its a great product
B00CUALVAG|1|Hated this product. Item not at all as described, looked very cheap.
B00O5UN4JU|5|Excellent! I love the little me!
B00NYRHJ3W|5|Perfect fit!  Great top!
B004VIYBHA|5|Not exactly the color I expected, but it will do just fine.  Thank you, it fits perfect and will be beautiful for the wedding.
B0049UYTAE|5|My niece loved it! Was a Birthday present to her. Thanks!
B00L6AQQ5Q|4|Fits well, nice material
B00F37JG14|4|fits great but idk it just doesn't bind tht tightly, if I were to get a size smaller I think it would hurt cuz it fits perfectly fine
B0085Y3CR6|5|As a US Army veteran, I like wear lapel pins to show esprit de corps.  This pen makes a nice addition to my collection.
B00CEIU7JU|5|Best fitting and most comfortable briefs I own. I highly recommend ordering these briefs. Came back to order more and I see the price has increased tho...no matter, I need another package.
B009WKT6O0|5|The workmanship is excellent. The material is also a great shirt. Size went perfectly. Bought at a deep discount and was very pleased. Now I will always pay attention to the products of this manufacturer.
B0031T5TSA|5|The hat was so nice and warm and it's the only hat that could fit my small head! I loved the colors and I think that this was last for quite a number of winters (in Michigan, snow in April and May is not unheard of!) Kudos!!!
B00IP38CIG|2|The thong is definitely not size xl... more like s/m. The bra cups for the XL is for A sized boobs... weird underwire... doesn't look that bad when the underwire is taken out but still not a XL fit. A little disappointed.
B0081ZQYYM|5|This is a well made jacket that runs true to size.  It looks just like the picture, and the quality is evident every time you put it  on.  It is a light jacket, but very warm.  Perfect for fall weather or layering.  It is quite versatile, and it will make a welcome addition to any well dressed man's wardrobe.  Well worth the money.
B003605DJO|5|I had bought this shirt as a bday gift and it was mailed promptly and he recieved it. The sizes are very accurate. will most def be back
B0091VVKIU|5|This sweatshirt is exactly what i wanted.  The quality is great.  Not Cheap!  I have had it for about three months now and still looks brand new.  Very Happy
B002KXWZE4|1|This gold tooth is too big to fit on any of my teeth and won't stay on. Also, the shape is way to rectangular with no curves at all. It's basically a big fake gold folded in half rectangle. It has nothing to make it actually stay on your tooth.
B00ACDD59S|4|very comfy, what i wanted
B00ICDQCM2|5|I am impressed by the quality of this shirt, it fit perfect and the fabric doesn't seem as cheap as I thought it would for the price. I got it for a Halloween costume and it was exactly what I was looking for! It was a lot cheaper than buying the same product in stores and good, if not better than what stores have. I really liked this product and I'm pleased with what I got!
B00GFMX608|2|There is nothing slouchy about this thing! It fits just like a regular beanie does.
B00HN5BKAE|4|Made cheaply but it is a sexy beautiful dress and I get many compliments
B00CU8CJJU|1|I was very dissapointed with the size of this dress. It looks like it's for a baby doll. It only comes done to my daughters waist. She is only ten months old and everything else she wears is a size12 months.
B002ZHUT16|5|my 9 year old daughter wanted to get this shirt for her dad for fathers day. nice tshirt. no complaints. true to size. i would purchase it again but they dont have bigger sizes for my other family members.
B00GN8K60M|4|Great fit and great price.
B00LGCDD6E|5|These leggings are great! They are comfortable, and not see through. Also, they came super early!
B008LT590S|5|I LOVE THE LAYERS! Once again, a beautiful wig from a great store! Just to clear things up, it's a brown/black wig and it's perfect for this cosplay I'm doing! Highly recommend to those who want a layered wig in this color! :)
B003N18K28|4|This top is super cute. The only con is that it's not designed for people with larger chests...it makes the top of the blouse bulge out. The design and material is really pretty, though!
B00BQ6LPCO|4|Wish it came with optional straps.  Fits small so bought larger size.
B00MNCXZ8C|4|Fits nice though the sponge thingy is super bad quality, but thats okay if you know where to but a replacement or decide to simply take them out. There is an opening for you to be able to do so.
B00HWFAMVI|5|Very light and airy with a comfortable fit around the waste. Planning on purchasing a few more pairs!
B00FS727NS|5|fit and comfortable
B004CJ2RHO|5|I bought these socks for my son who turns 1 in a few days, so I was hoping they would be a little big. I do wish the non-skid area were more than just the Hanes letters and covered more of the bottom of the socks, but they should work pretty well. He is a little over average in size and the crew tops fit well, if not also a little bit big. They should fit him for a good long while.
B00BFWD5KE|3|my wife did not like the way they rode up.
B00387F3D6|4|It is a nice belt. The belt buckle is heavy though other wise it is avery nice belt. It is made of leather. I enjoy it holds my pants up.
B00KX0AEFI|1|Belt arrived broken and looked used.
B00MH3T78E|3|had this hat in maroon and black.  This one seems a little smaller?  But it's all good
B0078LAURM|5|My son is on the husky side and these are they only shorts I can find him that fit right. They stretch so it makes for a perfect fit!
B00MWAFPMO|4|looks ok, does not have anything you can write on, but fit well, comfortable, regular scrubs material
B00QRX58WO|5|Perfect dress for my granddaughter for my wedding.  She looks like a little princess and it fits perfectly.
B00D6G8VZG|4|6'3&#34; 200lbs - Athletic build: Size Large<br /><br />Fit perfectly with a minimal amount of layers.  Very comfortable at night in 30F-40F degree weather temperatures.  It was a little warm in 50F weather during the daytime, even without layering.  Can handle wind very well. Extremely warm hood!<br /><br />I bought this jacket for a recent trip to Sweden and it turned out to be the perfect purchase.
B00GIJ1FZG|5|I love It
B00F2HQ46A|5|He loves it.  The quality is great fits nice and isn't made thin like some of the shirts you buy online.
B00PQUEUBE|5|Love this for nights and mornings.
B00368CRRM|4|I love the way the shorts feel.  The elastic give extra room at the waist.  The shorts wash well.
B00LAWEYJK|5|Great price! Good value! This seller is a must! Customer Satisfaction! I brought this scarf, for a Birthday present. For my Mom, I love her.More than words can say! She always loved, wearing scarfs. So I said for her Birthday. I had to find. A scarf I knew she would love. When I saw this scarf, I knew she would adore it! I'm soooo happy. When it was delivered. It looks exactly, as the picture! Same length as described! She's Head Over Heels! With this Breath-Taking scarf! She loves the print/colors! It's stunning with all her clothes! She loves it dearly!
B00GUNVY56|3|Nice coat
B0077QTTNO|2|it looked soo much better on the model the fabric is clearly different then the one on the picture. I was looking fowards to use this as cosplay but it material quality is poor. I was expecting like a decent quality but it is made out of childrens holloween costume material like cheap sort of pladticy yet fabric material. The maid head thingy / hair band thing was very poorly made it was a single piece of lace glued on with an exstreme amount of hot glue. The band its self is a very cheap plastic as well.the dress is very short feels like it might rip if i move too much. and the size was quite small on the tighter side. Dont really recomend it unless its for little kids.
B0096RUM0G|1|Cheap cheap cheap! !!! Tacky and very cheaply made. Looks painted onto a pair of cheap kid socks.
B003TJMMFA|5|Came in a very timely manner. Used a tutorial online to figure out the different ways you can wear it. Would definitely purchase this again but in different colors. Great for mixing and matching for different events/occasions.
B00AMGS4GY|3|I like the looks of the dress, but the video is a bit disturbing, since the model is sooooo thin.  How would the dress look on a normal (healthy BMI) weight?  The dress would look quite different.
B005ZY5S5I|5|Satisfied with the purchase
B00CKL7TV0|4|perfectly fit .. great quality
B007P3S46W|5|My daughter loved this scarf.  I actually did good for once in selecting a birthday present.  Points for dad.  Good quality and she was happy so I was happy.  Shipping was fast.  It arrived well before the end of the estimated shipping window.
B00BV2TFIY|3|Fit great, quality is decent but then again they're only $50-you get what you pay for
B005G0TG8Q|5|this is a great product since it accomplishes all the functions it anounces and my boy loves it. i totally recommend it.
B0082N2HYY|5|I found this at a reasonable price. I really love it. The swimsuit is not see through and covers me well. No better way to show off your patriotism!
B004JI9D48|4|Nice but cheap its good to wear occasionally until I lose enough weight to buy better quality. When you are fat you do what you can and since it stretches it wont bind.
B00JD40Y0A|5|💖💖 my Harvard shirt!!!
B00FSKW8KC|5|feels great, love the color, looks much better than in the picture...
B00DJRMV6M|5|Nice looking, good fit. Just what I was hopeing for!
B004HX8T8G|5|Nice and comfy!
B000PLS4LG|5|It is the best quality key case we have found in years!  I plan on buying more so he has backups.
B002ML1HB6|5|Im tall 6'4 and thin. I usually have a hard time finding proper length. These fit perfect.
B00CEOQ1G2|5|My daughter said she wanted a seatbelt belt? What???? She loves the belt and wears it a lot. I feel it's a bit pricey, but considering how often she wears it, it's a good buy.
B00E0KY3LS|4|Super cute! Just be sure to measure yourself for the right fit and you'll be fine.
B002RVF3NE|5|I've been wearing 32B's, 32C's when I could find them, and when I tried ordering bra's before, the size was always off. This fits exactly as expected, I'm wearing the 28F right now, and the cups might even be a teensy bit too big which is a wonderful feeling after years of everything in my band size popping my nipples out. Which sounds fun, but is definitely not. The band and straps are thick, and don't slide or cause indents. I'm definitely only buying Freya bras for a while.
B00AO1EO6G|4|Nicely fitted on me. I need to grab a nice jean to suit it for my outings. Nice top guys
B00D27LXLS|4|Y'all, this hat is HUGE!  I must have missed that in the description, so don't make the same mistake I did.  It's almost comically large.  Great if you want to sit in the sun and have your entire body shaded at one time.  I was looking more for a hat to cover my face.<br /><br />The hat itself is really pretty, and the structure looks to be pretty solid.  It's gorgeous on - just not practical for my needs!
B000KRUYFO|5|This suit looks great.  The suit zips shut and then snaps cover the zipper.  The snaps are kind of weak, and the whole suit needs to have threads trimmed.  I am very pleased with the suit, it is exactly what I wanted.
B00GTB0O0U|3|I went to BOMBSHELL instantly. I ended up buying a sports waist cincher, however, to workout in. It's a lot more comfortable.<br />This one I would keep on for about 2 hours at a time. At first I needed help getting it on. I found that as long as I could get the first and last hooked together then I could lay on the bed and get the rest hooked. I like this one maybe for doing chores around the house but I really like the shorter one to all day.
B005OUIDHS|1|the material was awful, felt like plastic and my son hated them, couldn't return these jeans fast enough and replace them with a better pair
B00M3ES5CQ|5|Great! Super soft!
B005OGURNK|5|I bought this robe for a month ago and I use it every day. It is warm, soft, looks great. Size is also fine.
B003KGKJHA|4|this is an experience to wear. Though a little too big I did not want to go through the hassle of trying to return it
B001JTC34M|4|First let me say that Amazon sometimes carries what appears to be the same item under different listings and at different prices. When I went to leave a review for this item my search brought up Faux Leather Shell Aviator Hat-Brown for $25.99 with Prime free shipping. I paid $36 for mine under the listing Automatic Pilot Hat - Distressed Brown W28S43D. Also the one I received has a decorative buckle whereas the Faux Leather Shell Aviator Hat-Brown listing says the buckle is adjustable. I thought mine was also supposed to have an adjustable buckle. Maybe the description has been corrected since I bought mine. Fortunately mine fits,but it would have been nice to have had the option of adjusting it. Pays to search under several search strings to see if a very similar item is also available on Amazon. Anyway, it is a nice hat and I am using it. It seems to be water resistant and I like the brim to keep the sun out of my eyes and off my face. The chin strap adjusts tight enough to keep the flaps over my ears snugly while still snapping over the top when I want the ear flaps up. I was hoping for a heavier warmer hat. This one is lightweight and the polyester lining is fairly thin. I live in the mountains of the North West so this hat will suffice for Fall and Spring, but I will need something more heavy duty for the winter.
B00DDFISTO|5|Really comfortable. Would recommend
B00L3YOIP0|5|great item. my sone loves it.
B000TJNC70|5|They are just perfect.  The waist size, everything.  We will purchase a couple more pair, when these wear out.
B008EZ5DUK|4|I was hoping they would be a little bigger, but my 3year old loves them!
B00CZ2CYHS|5|Looks great on. Always get comments . goes with alot too.. love this scarf, it looks better then in the picture.
B009CCRK8C|2|Too small. Returned them.
B005IVWRIO|5|ALSO SECOND TIME PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, ITEM IS VERY SOFT AND MY DAUGHTER HAD BEEN WEARING NEAR EVERYDAY EITHER HOME DAILY OR SLEEP
B00MXGZT5A|5|A perfect hat! True English style. Very stylish!
B003838HHY|4|Very comfortable shirt, looks good right of the dryer. Material is very soft, I recommend them. They are a great buy!
B00G7JNHOY|4|Cute, well made, but shirt a little snug & short on my son.  We'll have to go up in size.
B0007XFVUO|5|I love lingerie and definitely have more than any person who doesn't own a lingerie store ought to. I actually saw this item at a friends and fell in love. I immediately went online and ordered it and the matching thong. It is sexy as can be, but probably the most supportive of any bra I've ever owned, next to my best heavy duty sports bras that is! For having a fairly large chest I was amazed that I had actually found a gorgeous bra that lifted my chest so high and gave the most amazingly perfect cleavage. I am actually hoping to buy several more in different colors. Also, this is the best fitting bra I've ever found. Definitely recommend.
B008KCK0FK|5|It's more than I have expected for the price. Great comments from people at work and it feels very comfortable.
B00FJ5LI3O|4|I 'upgraded' from the small Sharkk case to this one. The small and this one (larger) are almost identical except this one is taller so you can fit cash as well as your cards. The case itself is, just as the small one, which I have used for a while and am very happy with, very solid and gives your cards protection from sitting on it and bending the cards.<br />As others have noted, the latch mechanism isn't the best. It opens a little too easily. The real downside of these cases is when you drop them. The case will pop open and since the cards are pretty lose, the will all fall out and spread across the floor. A different material for the sleeves would prevent that. Other than that I love these cases as they really help keep your cards from getting bent and scratching against each other.
B00BWJ2TE8|3|Sad days.  Dumb thing rolls up my leg.
B00B6E8MF4|5|Great!
B0012FSYT6|2|too cheap do not buy
B00193MFLY|2|I should have known something was not quite right with these t-shirts when the price was almost half the price of other brands.  The fabric is what I would describe as super-thin.  I've been wearing Jockey and Calvin Klein, but thought I'd give Hanes a try since Hanes is a major brand, and the price was much less.  I'm very disappointed in the fabric - VERY THIN, and not really that soft.  I'm returning them.
B000J43SRY|4|The underwear looked as advertised and came on time.  It was a Christmas present and I don't know if it has been used yet. But looked fine.
B000VSC5O0|2|They are great for warmth.  But always feels like it's going to fall or pop off.  Since it wraps around the base of the neck it brushes along the coat collar which makes me continue to adjust them.  Then when I turn my head to watch for traffic it \\"pops\\" off.
B00I3CZ778|4|Nice jeans but they don't bell as much as I would like. They are more like boot cut jeans as opposed to bell bottoms. The price point is better than I've seen anywhere else online or in stores.
B00J365ZZC|5|My girlfriend really liked this, so needless to say I liked too.
B00MY7MFVE|5|A present for my younger sister. She loved it! It was soft to the touch and warm without being overbearing. The two of us might not have the most refined tastes in scarves, so be forewarned.
B005RD7O0E|4|These jeans are well made, good denim, and fit well.  As usual, Levi has a price premium over other similar brands, but they are much more reasonalbe than most \\"designer\\" labels that are poorly made and more of a fade piece of clothing.
B00MWKNZ3K|5|I wear size L and ordered a L fit perfectly.
B00NQAHLNA|5|everything was great
B00O4CSEQ2|3|I have a number of this style babydoll by Affinitas, all in 38DD, they fit perfectly, however I found the cups in this to run large
B000S68YOU|4|The t-shirt is arrived within the delivery time and as discribed.<br />A minor issue was relatede to the invoice,but I've cleared with the seller.<br />I'll buy more in a short while.<br />Thank's.
B003A8H12O|3|You get what you pay for. Very cheaply made.
B00BK1GU34|2|These shorts have no pockets as described. VERY inconvenient since my son has nowhere to put his phone, house keys, money, etc.
B007MF1B2C|5|Beautiful product.
B00T5EI7MA|4|These bras are great, they have a &#34;wow&#34; push up factor, and they are great under t-shirts, they don't show.<br />They are a little too low cut for working out, I don't feel that supported when I am running, so I wear them for everyday bras.
B0085JT4GY|5|fits great and super durable I have had it for over six months and still looks like new and I use quite often when I wear skirts and dresses.
B000I12I56|5|Great value. Sturdy fabric. Easy care. Looks good.
B00A7RXC1U|5|Again, this top is comfy and matches perfect with with the pants and scrub jacket for my long days in class and lab. I would recommend this to any Medical student.
B00AG42JM2|1|It fit well and very comfortable but I put it through the wash once and it came apart at the sleeve. Not worth it.
B00NNPXWPY|5|We love these little sundress rompers for the summer and this one was so adorable. Fit is as expected. Must mention though the color is a little more neon pink than peach. I loved it anyway, but I do want to add in this review if your not into neons than this might not be an outfit for your little one.
B008GS1BB0|1|the left arm have a hole and is tearing appart  since this is a doble layer material ;<br /><br />I will claim my money back.
B00IR57AYE|5|ok
B003IGINUC|3|The point where the hood and the front zipper sort of meet was flawed and came right apart so I had to hand sew to fix. I did it on my own and did not contact the company and their other items are typically really nice.<br />The color is nice. It has not faded and my son wears it all the time
B007HBY1XW|4|I love it and it adds a bit of fun and laughter.  Always getting compliments.  It stays on great even under water but it does not keep my hair dry.  I have long hair and it stays on great and it's comfortable.  If it kept my hair dry I would have given it 5 stars.
B002EI1M7G|5|got these to wear for a burlesque performance and i LOVE THEM. never thought i would want to wear such high waisted panties but they are definitely comfortable, with minimal lines.  they smooth you out and and very silky and feel nice to the touch.<br />i will be wearing them even after the performance! maybe even getting more pairs.
B00IEGMID4|5|Beautiful shirt
B00DZEPJ22|4|I love this sweater. It is soft, it doesn't feel processed, it feels homemade and really comfortable. The stripes are really cute, I'm 5'5 and it fit me just fine, hung right over my butt, so I could wear it with leggings if need be. It is not as &#34;baggy&#34; per say as it was in the photo, but it was still oversized and exactly what I was hoping for. Perfect &#34;cuddle up with a latte and read a good book&#34; sweater.<br /><br />The breast pocket kinda falls near your mid stomach, so I took one star off for that since it looks a tiny bit awkward, but not unwearable.<br />I would recommend this for anyone who wears size medium, and maybe large if you wanna push it.
B00N21DGLO|1|It is not as cute in person as it is in the picture. I bought this for my niece who is 5ft and about 135lbs. I read the reviews and decided to order a large due to it running small in length. Length wise it runs really short. She had a hard time getting it over her shoulders, but buy it being a large, it runs big width wise. Which is the craziest thing. The large is more for someone well under 5ft but way more on the plus size. There was way too much room, and looked so crazy on her. This item is made very awkwardly and not worth the price. Buyer beware should be stamped on this!! I plan on returning the item and going with another brand.
B00EQV0AQS|2|This was not a bad shirt for the price. But somebody do not know what size a 5xl is. I am not a small guy so I ended up gifting it to someone smaller
B00LAEWBVQ|4|I like how the skirt flows and allows your legs to move without restriction.  The top part fits a little tighter than I like, but I can still wear it.
B005FA04II|3|These run really, really large so be careful when ordering. After I received what should have fit, I had to order the next size down and return the first pair. There's a lot of polyester in these so they might not be that comfy in warm weather compared to all cotton or a more cotton blend.
B007GB8EZE|5|Love the variety of themes they have on these PJs.  We bought all the boy's themed ones, since my son loves these PJ's.  We bought these before and tried them out.  They are definitely soft and comfortable.  Now we are back and getting more as they have new themes.  Love them all!  Very cute top with cute matching pants, we definitely can't complain.
B0002TORXU|3|I wear a brace on one foot and the sock always end up slipping down before the day is over
B00OVTN77Y|3|It's kinda tight around the top of all the socks, & it's kinda disappointing that the part where the fabrics divide it's white instead of the color of the sock :(
B00D3TQOYQ|3|This is a very nice quality vest but it is longer than I expected. It looks kind of funky
B002USCHLU|3|This is so cute and exactly as shown, but the sizing is off. It says preemie but is more the size of newborn clothing. I will keep this and eventually she can wear it. Not what I was expecting.
B001E2045O|4|This shirt is of good quality.  It shipped quickly and looks great on my husband.  It didnt shrink much when washed.  Good purchase overall.
B00IIS8BPC|4|This is a pretty dress that will best be waiting in my closet for the beginning of spring. It would make a nice Easter dress. It is not cheap looking, but definitely could have a bit better look to it. It's cute, but don't expect a luxe look. I would probably keep it to daytime use.
B000A33QQC|5|ok
B006Z5U1GC|5|very good
B00L5H18DA|5|Very well made. Love all the colors.
B007PENQ7S|5|I purchased 2 dresses and they fit excellent.  When I saw them they were gorgeous.  For the price I was not expecting what I got.  I had purchase similar dresses from another seller but the dress does not compare to these.  I really love these dresses.  Fit good and I used them to be at home.  I will definitely buy again from this seller!
B0051D8KF8|3|I purchased these same jeans from Penney's Dec 2012 in light blue, talls.  They are fantastic.  So I decided to purchase more in a variety of colours.  Alas, same jeans but the fit is different. The online order jeans were much tighter in the waist and did not have as much give (stretch) in the hips/stomach area as the ones purchased at the store.  A couple of other reviewers had mentioned that these jeans ran small, but since I had just purchased a perfectly fitting pair, I assumed the same style brand would fit the same.  Very very sad.  I really loved the pair purchased at Penney's and wanted these to work.
B00N26G8UA|5|My 7 year old grandson loves Skylanders and he only wears boxer briefs just like his dad.  From my viewpoint, these briefs are good quality and , reasonably priced.  For my grandson, they fit well, feel comfortable, and they are &#34;cool&#34;. Add to that the ease of purchase and I am convinced I will be back for more.
B00IUAU9SA|5|I love the design. They seem small at first, but after you where them they even out to the right size. They don't last very long. The fabric tears very easily. I have more then one of these with big gaping holes in them, but the prices are low enough to where I can just buy new ones.
B009LATZ3I|4|For this price, the fit and quality of the shirt is pretty good! Among the other shirts I bought, this one came out tops due the quality if its cloth.
