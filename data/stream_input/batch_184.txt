B00KHZTNI8|5|Love it
B0000532VC|5|great product
B0098IPRWG|4|Great stuff for those with sensative skin and razor irritation. Highly recommend this. Use this on my neck face and head.
B003D7LJ8Y|3|So I purchased this after hearing Manu good reviews on YouTube. I have a little bit of oily skin so it didn't seem to do much. I tried it on my mom n it seemed to work very well for her mature skin. Remember this is better for older skin
B0012BQFMI|5|This product has been around for many years and I must say its the best thing out there for pregnant women.  I did get a few stretch marks below my naval but if not for this product they would've been all over my tummy.  My sister used it 30 yrs ago and it was great then and its great now.
B0075X0Z46|3|This trimmer is absolutely painless but it doesn't trim those rogue nose hairs as well as my old rotary trimmer.
B005VTCNLO|4|The feathers are very cute, and fashionable. When I first got them I couldn't figure out how to make them stay in. Then I saw that on the little bar, you attach a barrette. Or you can tie the feather in. Some of them stick out.
B0080G0QO6|1|I've bought this product before, but this particular one seemed really watered down. I didn't really like it too much
B001641KTY|4|This nail polish is a beautiful, long lasting shade of dark indigo with a lovely shimmer. It's a versatile color that will look great on short nails in winter or a summer pedicure.
B00IALDHDI|3|I gave this product 3 stars because it didn't curl or lengthen my lashes.
B00CUCNID2|5|What a beautiful quality wig!! I used it for Ariel in a Little Mermaid production. SO much better quality than a disney wig. Thank you!!
B00029P414|1|Poor.  Retured
B00Y5GA67W|2|I wanted to love this. I really did. But only a few hours in and the product completely broke up on my nose. So gross. So sorry CoverGirl but I won't be back.  I did receive this product for free, but these opinions are mine.
B0097G3XDY|5|Great product. It really works as promised! My eyelashes were noticably longer and thicker after four weeks... Unfirtunately I developed an allergy to one of the ingredients which made my eyelids itch and sting, had the exact same problem with the latisse so i had to stop using it. Be careful not to get the product in the inner pockets of your eyes through tears or dripping as it will grow hair as well and it hurts to pull out! Would highly recommend product!!!
B00394DVIW|5|I can brush my teeth now without inflammation from SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate). Many people do not know that their toothpaste, shampoo and skin care products are causing them discomfort at the very least.
B003UGSU62|1|I bought these lipsticks 3 months ago, and all the shades are pretty ugly, definetly did not suit my fair olive toned skin.The lipsticks are very chalky and once applied they come across as very cheap quality.
B00OTLOHY6|5|Arrives in time. My favorite color. I love it.
B00819JPMG|4|This product is very good. The slant of the pencil itself makes filling in your eyebrows very easy and fast. I didn't know when I ordered this but it actually comes with a spolie at the end so that you can groom your eyebrows after applying the product. Highly recommend!
B000N7GRP2|1|Broke after only a few uses. Power cord we think, but hard to tell. I would not buy this again.
B005E0NVMU|5|This is the first time I've ordered this product but I will order it again the size makes it easier to carry in your purse and because you can throw it away after several uses It maintains cleanliness
B003GLYZ5G|1|The packaging was old and maybe shop-worn.  I have used this product from another company and it worked well. It's a very tightly wound metal spring, this one appeared to be rusty and the package had be open.  I threw it away!!!!!
B004C1148K|5|What more needs to be said?  This works as advertised.  Does what it claims with no fuss. Even daughter uses it.
B001BBUW7S|5|I like this product because it has the quality and workmanship of Revlon products formerly available in local outlets (Long's and Walgreens). Very sharp cutter, and easy to hold onto.
B003ZWEW1S|5|For the money, it's a winner.  The 90 min - 2 hr melting time is not overwhelming.  And it's not a problem to keep warm for a few hours to use later in the day.  I love it for arthritic thumb joint.  And because I like things really hot, I did not find the high setting to be extreme.  The bonus of the 2 mitts and plastic bags make this a great bargain.  They are extras in many baths at 4 times the price.
B000UK2W4C|5|It's hard for me to add to what others have said, but go into any store that sells Sonicare toothbrushes and you will immediately see that this model is much slimmer and more comfortable to hold. The brushes are slimmer, too, and the unit just has a nice, futuristic look to it. It also comes with a travel charger and a nice carry case, including plastic covers for the brushes.    I was using a Braun electric toothbrush, and it was still running well when my dentist recommended I switch over to the Sonicare.  I haven't had it long enough to note whether it's a lot better, but it is a lot more invigorating and I have a feeling my next visit to the dentist will be much better.
B002LFV8PI|5|Great color
B000C2329C|5|Best smell in the whole world! wish they didn't discontinue it :-( Michael Kors you need to bring this back!
B000C1VYFW|5|It's my scent and at a good price.  = 5 stars
B005JW5RWK|4|My son is 2.5 year old, he already pick up this training chopstick. It is very easy for toddler. I like it.
B0009PVV4K|5|I researched half a day online for the best affordable flat iron and this is a winner. <br /> <br />It gets very hot quickly and you just glide your hair through - you don't even have to do it slowly (provided you use small segments of hair).  And, the shine it creates in my hair is amazing. <br /> <br />These plates are solid ceramic, not just ceramic-coated, so it distributes heat evenly. <br /> <br />I have very coarse, wavy, frizzy hair.  I was resigned to just cut my hair all off until I came across this flat iron. <br /> <br />I never thought I'd say this but, I LOVE my hair now.
B000052YD4|1|Here are the ingredients, from the Plax website.  Now, which ingredients actually do any good?:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Water, Sorbitol Solution, Alcohol (8.7%), Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Benzoic Acid, Flavor, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Saccharin, Xanthan Gum, FD&C Red No. 40.<br /><br />The first one, I think.  Save your money?<br /><br />--Joe
B001189I3A|1|purchased this because it was featured on Dr. Oz...i didn't find that it did anything of improvement for my under eye puffyness...
B001BODNYO|3|the clippers are great and everything else it comes with but the trimmers. the trimmers barely cut any hair which really blows! but the rest of it is fine.
B004VYHMU2|5|This is the last time I will review this products... I buy it on a regular basis and my hairdresser always comments on how soft my hair is. I don't have to use conditioner on my hair anymore. LOVE it and use nothing else but this...
B0058DUW4I|5|Fast shipping and product is good
B00D9NV2D4|5|This product is exactly what it says it is. Came very quickly and smells exactly like any other ivory African shea butter I bought. From reading other reviews I thought there was going to be a recipe to make products from it but there was not.(update) there was a recipe book in the shea butter. The butter had melted and leaked out the plastic bag it was in. It solidified over the small recipe book. Now that I'm getting toward the end of the package I have found it
B004OYYTLE|5|It's a classic. Works great on dry rough hands. There's a reason it's been around for years, it's a lotion that works.
B000A6QTA4|5|I'm allergic to most other sunscreens (the spray-on & sport types give me hives if I even touch someone who is wearing it).  Although the 28 SPF is a bit high for me - if I'm not careful, I'll end up with really odd tanlines - I really like it.  It really is not greasy, smelly, sticky, white, thick or any of the other objectionable traits many sunscreens have.  It's very much like applying a slightly thick body lotion.  I'm blonde but I don't burn (before I found this, I just didn't use sunscreen and I'm paying a price with visible sun damage) and a light application keeps me from turning red at all.  Brave Soldier Solar Shield is the best I've found!
B002CVTVVY|5|What can I say? The parts all feel like a high-quality product- everything is solid, parts fit together well, and the materials are sturdy.    The little cleaner booth may or may not be useful, I don't know- I've never had much of a problem with microorganisms on my toothbrush in the past.    Ultimately what matters though is the job the brush does, and let me say it is fantastic! I thought I had found a winner with my previous Oral-B brush; I got lazy and mostly stopped brushing for 5 months, and started again in the last month with that brush. I went in to get a dentist checkup, and my teeth were reasonably O.K. which I figured was pretty good catch-up after so much slacking.    But now... this brush blows the old one away. My teeth are so clean it feels almost like I just walked out of the dentist after I finish brushing (except a little slimier). It's that good.
B006E3STSM|3|I was really skeptical about this product bc it is suppose to help with black circles under your eyes. I can say that I did notice a subtle difference. My husband noticed it too but it really is not a huge difference. I think if you combine this with sleep, it will probably be more helpful p. I give it 3 stars. It does what it says but it not miraculous.
B002HSWFWY|5|I have tried and reviewed several of these products and I've not been head over heels for many. I've used these products on and off for about a year. My skin is 32 years old, suffers mild hormonal breakouts, milia and broken capillaries. I think this is why this skin care line is not revolutionary for me. Most of it smells great, uses quality ingredients and makes your skin feel pretty good. It just doesn't solve or aid in my issues. That said, this lotion smells exactly like a cucumber and it's so refreshing going on. I don't wear a moisturizer too often because so many of them clog my poors and exacerbate my milia. I like the LaNouvel Cellular Hyaluronic acid Nutri Serum by Sweetsations as a daily moisturizer, but when I need just a little more moisture this is the one I grab. It's a little heavier than is like but I do love the smell and soothing feeling. Overall, pretty great.
B0000YUXI0|5|I'm using it with my 9 years old daughter and it's working! We are both Very happy with the results...
B002WVONXA|4|This stuff works well, and smells great!  No fried chicken smell after tanning.  I wish the bottle was bigger though.
B00CDE46LU|5|LOVE THIS. SO SOFT LOOKING ON FACE !!!
B00AFV3QH8|4|Makes my crumby fingernails look lovely!  However, BEWARE that if you do not follow the direction in taking off the strips (i.e. you enjoy picking them off once they begin to grow out or become chipped) you will practically ruin your nails.  Follow directions and have happy nails.
B008OM3NUA|5|Great eye shadow in nice colors.
B0017WNSBS|5|I saw it for sale on Amazon and thought, &#34;I remember this from barber shops when I was a boy&#34;. Since I was a boy I never used it, of course. But I do now and I love it. Every like product claims to soothe your face, but this one actually does. If you want a lot of scent, try something else. But if you want to use something that makes your face feel smooth and clean, this is for you.
B005DYJS4C|5|Moisturizes my hair and gives a nice sheen to my thick natural coarse. Also soften and detangles my hair. I use it daily and you only need a few sprays. This product has a nice clean fragrance also.
B00KZDWL7W|2|Smells like oregano and hasn't done anything for my toenails so far.
B006G0ZMOC|1|Clumpy like oatmeal... And runny in some places. Disgusting. Like it had been sitting in a warehouse for years.. I loved this lotion, very disappointed.
B000C21406|5|EXCELENTE...
B0007Y83CQ|5|This purchase was for me. I will buy one more for a family member. Thanks Body Tools for a great product.
B001B0YMB6|4|This product fits my makeup well.  I wish it were a little bigger and offered more deep pockets for my brushes, but for the price, it works!
B000POX4PY|4|I was surprised at how well this oil worked when rubbed into my aching knees.  The pain subsides and walking is much easier.
B003AYEUX6|4|You may have to reapply. It does work though.
B001JOWUEA|1|If you want an Organic product this is NOT it!!  It's not even Natural.  IT IS NOT Natural nor Organic. Anyone who wants to buy an organic product is also not the same person who would purchase a lotion that has a few organic ingredients that is then mixed up with a lot of parabens and other chemicals.  It defeats the purpose.  This is just basic deception for the purpose of getting a niche of the organic conscious market.<br />This product is the equivalent of ordering for yourself to eat a whole regular thick crust Pizza from Pizza Hut and then asking for a small side of gluten free pasta.  Ok so other than the pointless purpose of portraying itself as \\"Organic\\", it's no different than any other watery runny greasy messy lotion.<br /><br />Read the ingrediants of your \\"Healing Gardens\\" product and then google/bing all those chemicals in this product.  You will be appalled.
B000SDI6MI|5|This is the third time we have bought this.  Love the smell and feel of this lotion.
B007K6K0IY|5|I wasn't a fan of gel deodorants before this product! I hated the wet feeling and wasn't convinced that it kept me dry better than a solid deodorant did. I was skeptical when I first tried the Secret Outlast stick, but it didn't take long to convince me that this really works! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. It dried quickly, and I didn't feel sticky or gross while wearing it. It didn't leave marks on my clothes. It kept me feeling protected - even in the hot, humid Houston weather! My only criticism would be the amount it suggests to use. The directions say to click 2-3 times, as wanted, but I've found that one click's worth of exposed gel is enough to keep me protected for 48 hours. All in all, a wonderful product!
B005MF19XU|5|This nail polish was not as wonderful as I'd hoped it would have been.  I like the product quality, but the mood change seems to turn the polish dull.  I also wish that the manufacture would include a note as to what mood the colors represent.  But, all in all this is a product that is true to its description and it is worthy of purchase.
B0002DUGD6|5|I have been buying this oil for over a year now. I am impressed by how delicious it is, so much so that I actually *want* to eat that stuff. Compulsive eating of a wholesome food that takes care of your brain, skin and hair? Hell ya!<br /><br />I have convinced three of my friends already that they should include this in their diet by just feeding them. I pour a teaspoon in my morning oatmeal, another one on yogourt (with vanilla whey protein? YUM!) later in the day. Absolutely tasty. Feels like you're eating lemon cream pie.<br /><br />Do yourself a flavor: GET and EAT this! =)
B0002DF0D2|2|the battery goes down too fast. I've owned several of these and the batter seems weak.<br />unsure whether I should return it
B00AZ5KC26|4|I really wish I could give this crown five stars. The only problem I had was with the triangular point at the bottom. It was uncomfortable on my head. But with a slight tweak with a wrench I just pulled it forward a bit and it was comfortable for hours. This crown is so pretty that it really doesn't even need the point at the bottom. This was a great purchase!
B001XURHC0|1|I ordered this product as a gift for my father.  We were a bit rushed, so I ordered it last minute.  First, even though I ordered overnight expedited shipping, this company decided to do its own thing and the product wasn't delivered until 3 days after it was due.  Second, the product was absolute crap!  The set was mismatched and didn't belong together, the stainless bowl is realistically a $.50 bowl!  It still had a Made in Taiwan sticker on it.  The razor didn't actually FIT in the stand, it would fall through!  What's the point of a razor stand if it doen't even fit!?  Not to mention these were also mismatched!  What a joke!  Then I send it back for a refund and only received 80% of the refund after having to pay $10 for shipping!!!  STAY AWAY!
B006OC431K|5|Love this product. Its affordable, non greasy and pleasant scented natural mineral sunscreen that moisturizes. One of the few makeup goes on smoothly without feeling oily and like I have a thick mask on. Also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Absorbs quickly so hasn't stained any of my tops since I also apply it to my neck and chest daily as well.
B002UWGJE2|5|El vendedor es excelente ya he comprado otros productos al mismo y son muy buenos, siempre llega a tiempo y en buen estado.  La fragancia COCO es realmente divino, me encanta el olor a coco y ademas perdura el olor. Recomiendo este producto a quienes les gusta el coco.
B0080MGH5M|4|I have been trying to find a BB cream that suits my skin.  I like this one because it's a matte BB cream; and I have combo skin & tend to get quite oily in my t-zone.  This particular BB cream works and doesn't dry out my face so much as other matte BB creams have.  It has a light pleasant smell that I also like.  I will most likely re-purchase this BB cream over some other's I have tried in the skin food brand.
B001X1F6T0|5|I first tried this as a sample and was hooked.  Then I couldn't find it, I thought they had stopped making it, but I found it again that the Kiehls in NYC.  This stuff is amazing and you don't need a lot.  I just bought a jar and I have a feeling its probably going to last me for at least a year.
B001DBBC84|4|Works well
B0049WJA9C|5|I give this a 5 star because this product is amazing!<br /> I love this product it does what it's suppose to do and what's amazing is that it gets really hot really fast and it makes all kinds of curls.<br /> There is nothing I dislike about this product.<br /> I would definitely recommend this to anyone. If you want something to make curls really quickly this is what your exactly looking for. This item makes curls within about 5 to 6 seconds if you want a stronger hold in curls I suggest you hold it in place about 10 to 15 seconds. Other than that this product is amazing. It's a must have.<br /> Also if your not sure about this product, don't try researching it any where because you won't find it. I tried googling it and everything and I found nothing about this product. I was unsure about receiving it, but when receiving it in the mail, i was in total shock that this product worked amazingly great.
B002C5IUWQ|5|I love this.  It feels light, not oily or heavy on my face.  Last all day.
B000C2365M|3|My mother has worn this perfume for as long as I can remember, I bought her two bottles last April for $8.97 for a 2.5oz bottle.  This same item is now selling for $75 a bottle that is just completely outrageous!  Great perfume but not worth the price at all.
B0056TA0NM|1|did not work well. also had a bad taste no matter what I dd. no more .
B003NNETG2|3|I AM 72 YEARS OLD AND USE THIS EVERY NIGHT FOR MYSELF SINCE I CHEW ON IT INSTEAD OF GRINDING MY TEETH. IT TAKES ABUSE BECAUSE I CHEW ON IT. I LOVE IT....LYNN
B00A0IWTDI|5|We use lots of Suave products here.  They all have seemed to work well, and normally you can't beat the price.  In fact, I can often get it for free by combining sales and coupons.  This shampoo cleans well, and you don't need much of it to lather and clean well.  Every scent we have used has been pleasant, but never overwhelming.  If you don't have any particular scalp or hair issues, this is the product to use.  Why spend more than you need to on personal care?  Try the shampoos, conditioners, body washes, deodorants, body lotions and soap products.  They never disappoint.
B000142AZ8|1|This product proved worthless in a side by side test against Jergen's Natural Glow.  Absolutely no color AT ALL!!  Can not recommend.
B00O19XA0S|5|Excellent product
B00910ZHJE|5|this set is so pretty and glittery! and some of the colors for the nail art set is great for fall! very dark colors for fall I love them! they work awesome! get themmm!
B00JU3KRRE|5|Very nice.  Honestly I bought for the cute packaging.  Been using a week now and it feels great.  It has a very earthy/natural smell and a good tingle - not a burn.  I feel like I'm doing something good for my skin.
B002NVRY4E|5|I am not sure why I can no longer buy this at CVS or Sephora but...<br />This is the best alternative for an air conditioner that I can find (along with a standard fan).<br />It also sets powder makeup very well.  Long wear that lasts through a double shift!
B001TJ7RPC|4|I bought this flat iron 7 years ago from a salon that was going out of business for $20.  I took a chance on it for that price and turns out it is the best flat iron you can buy.  So... this year after lots of use, the heating plates popped out and that was the end of the iron.<br />Looked on Amazon and there is was...Price about $70.  Since I had already had one, I bought it from Amazon.com and was sent to me by The Beauty Source.  Turns out, however, Hai will not warranty the iron since is was not purchased through one of its authorized sellers.  That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, no warranty if you buy through Amazon.
B0058W05IM|5|Ok, I don’t actually carry a purse, I carry a book bag at work. Ladies, ever carry that bottle that leaks or spills in your bag? My body spray would do that, and while the book bag smelled nice, it was a waste. The little travel container is easy to fill, and DOES NOT leak…at all. I even ran it though the washer by accident, and still no leak. I’m going to order another one. LOVE IT!!
B0043OYFKU|5|My mom had hers for a few months and I got mine as a Christmas gift. I love it! My acne started clearing up with the use of this and the exfoliate that comes with this system. I loved it so much that I went ahead and bought the full size one because it's the only thing that helps clear up my acne! I have combination/oily skin if that helps anyone who's deciding whether or not to try this.
B00LKSVFI2|4|I needed this mirror because I wear contacts now and my optometrist advised me to use a tabletop mirror rather than using the bathroom mirror in case my contacts fell in the sink. It serves its purpose. I can see myself very clearly. However, I don't think I'll ever use the 10x mirror on the reverse side because the image is just too blurry for me. Overall, I do like it very much.
B001426RO6|1|My friend recommended this and I found the eye brow one. UNLESS you have baby eyebrows, not sure how anyone can use just one.  Not worth the price.
B000FRWNL2|5|nice waver revlon. new and make really good wave =) its not expensif for the qualities of the stuff .
B001ECQ55M|5|there is not much more to say than great it works for me as need it
B00CFZJN2Y|3|I received this Braun's °CoolTec electric shaver as part of a program Braun was doing. When I first received it I was highly impressed.  The idea of it was pretty \\"cool\\", however after using for a week or so I am less than impressed.  I know this is an electric razor but it didn't get into the hard to reach contours in my face.<br /><br />I also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs.  It says that they only last about 3-4 weeks on the packaging.  I don't want to have to remember to buy \\"extras\\" for this so I don't know if I would recommend just based on this.<br /><br />Over all it was just an okay razor, but not the best out there.
B000GCMXWK|5|I have used this product for six months now and have found it to be very beneficial in calming, dry irritated skin. I only use it 3 times a week and use only small amounts each time but it does a great job. Fragrance free and gentle for sensitive skin.
B000WHYB1A|5|Easy to use. Made to last.
B001TJLZ5U|1|I tried to dye my hair twice with this product. I have light brunette hair and a bleached streak. Even after 1 treatment of 20 min and a second of 30 min the only place that shows any color change is the blond (which the bottle says you don't have to bleach it just won't be as vibrant if you don't). Even the blond is still 90% blond. The second application was done by a professional friend of mine who tested it on her finger which should've stained but it wiped (not rinsed, wiped) right off. This is not worth the money.
B001A6DGPE|5|Great product that will enhance healing of skin breakdown. If you have dry, cracked, or skin breakdown that won't heal this product provides the healing you are looking for.
B002JPJ2ZS|3|after 1 month little change but will continue as directed to see improvement.
B000ZHCQ3M|3|LOVE IT ! SHAVES THE TWIG AND BERRIES WITHOUT BITTING . BUT THE BLADES DULL QUICKLY AND ARE VERY EXPENSIVE!!!
B00S59Z78S|4|I gave this to my mother to test out on her neck area since she is always complaining about it. She is very pleased with the results.<br />We have all noticed a difference on her neck, the lines a little smoother, she loves how soft her skin feels. product. The smell is very light and not bothersome at all. The cream doesn't leave that weird greasy feeling and it absorbs into the skin quickly.
B005Y6F4WO|5|Very good I buy 7 pieces and arrives perfect.
B00FP6ORY4|4|I'm giving this 4 stars because there are some good pieces in here. I wasn't thrilled about the foil, but that's because it wasn't that different from using tin foil with cotton balls. I actually had to add some extra cotton inside because it wasn't big enough to hold enough acetone. The soaker dish works pretty well, giving you the ability to to soak just the nails with a hump in the middle to rest your palm on. I haven't tried the pump bottle, but the fillable clean up tool works pretty well. I really like the individual soakers. Yes, the will leak if you try to get up and do stuff with them on. I do one hand at a time and keep my fingers pointed down. No leaking and no smelling acetone throughout the room. It makes removal way easier and keeps me from spending more money at the salon to have them removed!
B0006NH946|5|Don't get me wrong, this is everything I want from a soap; all natural with no toxins....but I was expecting a bit more when it said &#34;magic&#34; on the bottle.  I've put it in excellent positions to surprise me with magic and it's failed every time.  The closest I got was almost convincing the TSA that the stuff was magic when it was found in my carry-on.  The massage I received immediately following that conversation was magic, so maybe there was some magic in it after all.
B008FZZH2S|5|Great item, came in perfect timing.
B002LFQ0ME|5|Great!
B00Q7E7PLA|5|Excellent product!
B00H3ACNXM|5|Nice comb for dressing up your hair
B004TC1Q1C|5|I understood the shipping time since not in North America. With that consideration the product arrived in due time. The item is expensive however this seller offered well below anything here in the US. Always concerned for authenticity of a fragrance, this bottle is real and exactly as promised. I am PLEASED! thank you :)
B00871KNMY|4|Very Good!!! We like very much...We will order some more in next time...It is nice and beautiful....Recommend to buy some more in the future....
B00B9H3E4C|1|Very very itchy.. Even after mixing with aleo and then tried mixing with coconut oil still very itchy.<br />I like the lotion so much better the lotion wasn't itchy.
B007ZTLQAC|5|After using Nu-Gro the first time, I could feel the tingling on my scalp, after 4 days I saw growth!!! Matter of fact, a comment was made on 1-19-14 the top area of my hair was thin, but was now filling in. The comment would have been more pleasant, had it not been made in front of my man, oh well the truth is the truth!! I hope others find success with this product. It is worth the try, and if it does'nt work, don't let it remain used, Pass it on!! PEACE & BLESSINGS!!
B001PUP3JM|5|Absolutely love LOVE this product!<br />Vital in my skincare routine!<br />Smells great and feels amazing!<br />http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/05/drugstore-skincare-routine.html
B00HZFYQ4E|3|Good price,but the only work okay, not great. I was trying to do a ombré designs, but when I was staring the nail polish onto my nail, you could hardly see the result because little nail polish transferred over on to my nail from the sponge.
B001GQ3GEY|5|Great product
B00AOXXJJ2|3|I am prescribed sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur face wash - which keeps my face totally clear - and ran out of it without planning ahead of time to order more. I bought this with prime because of my impending acne emergency hoping it would do the same as my prescription for my skin. While it didn't do the job as well as my prescription it definitely kept my breakouts under control.  However, I dislike using it as a spot treatment ointment (which makes my skin itch and burn) and prefer to use it as an exfoliating face scrub. Overall, I think it's a decent option for someone looking for an acne cure who doesn't have the resources to visit a dermatologist and pay for expensive skin prescriptions.  It seems to work for a lot of people based on other reviews, and the price is fantastic!
B0002SQ47S|5|These batteries last for about a week.  Others, not so long. This is quite a boon as I don't always remember to bring a spare battery.  My hearing diminished about forty years ago in Viet Nam when we were hit by our own air support.  I finally gave up and purchased a hearing aid and long lasting batteries that I can get through Amazon Prime helps me to adjust.
B009SAYCAC|5|good product. thanks
B006G0D1V8|5|I heard of this product through a salon at a Wal Mart. It actually works. One needs to use it for a month or so to see the regrowth of your hair. I use it every other time I shampoo. You really need the whole kit and use it correctly. It is much more cost effective buy purchasing on Amazon.
B0086VIA20|3|A little small. Standard is better. I found a better deal (cheaper) $ at Costco after I had purchased these.
B003U23R8M|3|Takes quite a bit for full coverage of neck and face.  Non-greasy
B00MGVKA4C|5|I have tried the lavender, and this product is amazing!  It's a luxurious oil that I use on my face to remove makeup and then I leave it on as an overnight moisturizer.  It noticeably made my skin feel smoother and helped with keeping my face from drying out.  I also use a small amount on my hair after blow drying it to give it a nice shine.  It smells great (I have been asked what that lovely fragrance is that I'm wearing). I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to use something natural on their skin and hair.  I'm getting ready to try some of the other oils they offer in this line.  Super product!
B000KONYJK|4|Let me apologize ahead of time for my review because I'm a guy and don't know all the terms for facial discriptions when it comes to \\"beauty tips.\\" Anyways, I got this product mostly out of curiosity, but I am glad I did and would recommend it to anyone. I have a bad habit since childhood of pushing together my eyebrows to sheild my eyes from the sun, and have created creases or \\"wrinkles\\" (though I don't think they are really \\"wrinkles\\" in terms of aging) on my forehead between the two eyebrows. I applied the cream to the area including on my cheeks and neck. After only 4 days, I noticed the wrinkle between my eyebrows dramatically decrased. I also noticed the appearance of a firmer jaw-line. I noticed the affects after only 4 days, which is probably fast and may sound too good to be true, but I am in my mid twenties, so that may contribute to how fast it works. Anyways this product works, and is definitely cool. Ummm.. sorry.. had to throw that last bit in so my review wouldn't sound so feminine...yo. Ahem.
B005PUZZR8|5|Works great!
B007FTZ6J4|3|its not immediately the results so i cant say its good or bad yet.<br />the hair its not regrowing, but its not preventing hair loss as well...<br />so i will see what happens, im fallowing instructions so i will find out if it works or not.
B000F4GLQS|1|it's very hard got it off. I used soap, facial cleanser. Eventually it did come off, but the skin was red and broken.
B001MA0QY2|3|I ordered this for my wife as birthday present.<br />she like a lot when she see it first. after using once she replied when I asked how do you like it. she said, its okay.........<br />hmmmmm..
B0013ND3RA|5|This is the best denture adhesive on the market at this time. It's easy to control how much powder you want to use. The taste is pleasant, and it holds my partials in place all day. It also has fewer ingredients than all the other adhesives.
B001DKMY9Q|5|It is the 2nd one I have purchased for my husband. He really like it. Says he doesn't need anything else.
B00LMIVLXY|4|Great product! Smells nice too. Worked its way into my daily styling routine!
B003WR3QSG|5|Exactly what I expected, works great.
B0037TS8DC|5|It works SO good...I will never use anything on my hair again.<br />Shipped fast and in perfect condition so big YAY for the seller!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B001E96MRG|5|I purchased this product because I have used it before. It is a light moisturizing oil suitable for any skin type. I find it expecially good in the summer months. It is not oily and heavy. My daugher likes to use a heaver oil in the winter, and I might agree that purhaps the feet might want an heaver oil in the winter months. Great Product! It is also really really good for massage.
B00CST4AS4|1|No change with this soap. Even got my  girlfriend to try and no improvement in skin. Will not be purchasing again. It was only used to control my acne. Skin was just really dry, had some peeling.
B00KK62714|5|I’ve had difficulty with cellulite since I was 16 without even being over-weight those dimples on your thighs that every woman dreads were still there.  I have tried many cellulite creams in the past and they have done nothing but waste my money!  I can honestly say I love this product! After a couple weeks of faithful use, my skin looks smoother and less “hail damaged”!  It feels tighter to the touch as well, which I really appreciate, talk about a self-esteem boost!  I also forgot to mention that I have very sensitive skin and react badly to many things I try, and this works very well for me.  It’s smells nice and absorbs without a greasy residue.  Don’t hesitate!  It works!
B001E5EBPU|5|This is a safe and excellent product for those who have sensitive reactions to certain products.<br />Loving Care products do not contain ammonia or hydrogen peroxide. Natural Instincts products<br />contain hydrogen peroxide. Clairol quit making Loving Care. Hopefully Clairol will enter the<br />natural and organic market and resume making Loving Care again.
B004RONZ16|1|I question if it is the same cologne or if it is quit old it does not have the same aroma as the cologne I purchased in the store.
B0086LC0BW|3|not really a slow speed. slowest speed goes too fast to use on my nails.
B002RTV4Y8|5|These oils by Eden's Garden are equal to doTerra, or Young Living. For most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that Edens Garden is not as good. Edens Garden in my opinion is the best in quality and purity for the price.
B009W6W1GO|4|I'm happy with the item. It holds my chrombook safely and it's not too heavy. I like the pocket to keep my charger and earsets.<br />I gave 4 stars because it is a little too large for my chrombook. I recommend this to anyone.
B00KB1TRIO|3|this product can be very messy and a little hard to apply. Its nice, but would not buy again
B005F750JY|5|Good quality!
B004O6Y39U|1|Maybe I am missing something but this buffer did not buff at all. I would not recommend this product. ...
B0043OYFKU|4|Bought this for my daughter as an option instead of the Clarisonic, which she really was wanting. We just could not justify the price of the Clarisonic, and after reading the online review for it through Amazon, we decided the Olay Pro -X had alot better track record, for a fraction of the cost. So far she is very pleased with the results she has seen using the Pro-X. Her skin is alot smoother, and the texture has improved. She has pretty flawless skin anyway, but this just get's all those impurities out and leaves her face clean and clear. This set only came with the bristle looking heads. She was really wanting to use the foam scrub heads. I will have to buy those separately. It looks like they are available in the higher price Cleansing system from Olay Pro-X. She is very happy with the results, we just wish it came with a better variety of heads and more cleanser. Hence the 4 star rating.
B00ARID2TQ|1|Hated these.. Just horrible hair!! It's the most hideous color I've ever came accross on my life. Save your money guys I promise that this hair is trash
B004GDW63G|3|This lip balm is pretty average overall.<br />It does a decent job but it wouldn't be the first thing I reached for when chapped lips are a problem.<br />I definitely prefer the untinted Burt's Bees products I've tried.<br /><br />Its in my purse--but a backup.
B003552FAU|5|Love this product and have been loyal customer for years. Would like for the natural or nude to come back
B00B69WSBI|5|Very goog!
B00CDAQCAW|1|So bad
B00EO8W6LK|5|effective & best of all - no perfume! The only down side to this packaging is you can't see the back of any of the individual deodorants so you can't tell what the ingredients are the first time you order. Luckily, this had what I was looking for in an effective deodorant.
B0006PLP7G|4|Hard to get excited but it does what it is supposed to do.
B0000Y3LQ6|5|I hAVE BEEN USING WIBI FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS FOR DRY SKIN AND IT HAS MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE.  IT IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND SO I AM GRATEFUL TO AMAZON FOR MAKING IT AVAILABLE.
B00CPUXKWI|5|Great product.
B000Q46HBQ|5|My mother just loves this stuff.
B003SAB3VY|5|Perfect for melting down...I like working with this product while making pain rubs.  Keep your face a safe distance away, very strong-ventilation is a must if you are using the product in a small enclosed area.
B004OI3JHU|5|Have use this foundation for many years, was introduced to it while living and working in the Middle East.  The product is made in Ireland.  Liquid Illusion applies beautifully with the right amount of slip.  The coverage is not too heavy and has a touch of shine, making skin look moist and fresh.  At my age, I don't like a matte finish, so Liquid Illusion is perfect.  Also, this color has the right amount of rose for my pink-toned skin. Rose tone foundation is difficult to find as the majority of colors are gold toned.  Miracle Touch foundation never dries out, making it an economical purchase.  It is one of the best foundations I have ever used. In my younger years, I was a Counter Manager for a major cosmetic line (Monteil of Paris, which no longer exists). This foundation is a strong competitor for the high-end expensive foundations. The packaging is practical, comes with foundation and foam makeup application pad.  The only negative I can mention is that the plastic case can break easily, meaning several of my cases broke at the hinge. Saying that, I still continue to purchase this foundation.  Amazon is the only place I can find it.  Love it!
B006QO4BRM|4|This light arrived and one of the four bulbs wasn't working.  However,  the light still cured my various gel layers in two minutes.  Nice light to have.
B008DZ3VCI|4|Doesn't smell as good as I thought it would. Still smells good, but it gets old fast.
B000U2AQNY|5|Love Love Love !!!
B00GTQC8OK|5|Super soft, very long, and beautiful for layering. I ended up damaging my hair prior to the extensions arrival so I ended up darkening my hair to hide the damage. I sold these to the salon that fixed my damage and purchased darker ones to match. I only have positive things to say about Tressmatch extensions.
B002QHYYR0|5|Was a little worried when I first saw how small it was. After lathering it up I was greatly impressed by how much water it soaked up. Lathers great and feels great.
B000Z6B2W4|4|great fragrance.keeps lingering around for daylong.very attractive.what i dont like is the price,its not for common man like me,yet its one for who is more interested in quality.i cant recommend as its costly.high quality perfume.
B00HSE4WJG|5|I am so incredibly picky about brushes. I usually don't buy amazon brushes because more than once they have fallen apart on me immediately. However, these brushes have far exceeded expectations. They feel strong and rich and soft. They give you a tool for everything you need, and for an awesome price!<br />I saw a few comments putting these down, so I was a bit worried, but I've now been using them for a while now and they have worked beautifully. I usually name a pros and cons list, but there are no cons to give. I am proud to apply my very expensive makeup with these beautiful brushes.
B00WZWB9X8|1|All look the same. Not what I expected.
B000EZYKTS|1|don't know if its because of my skin, but it cause lots of ingrown hairs which appear as ugly red bumps everywhere. it's really a pity because expectation was high. though the pain is bearable.
B001B82ADU|5|Awesome!!!!
B004DBT544|1|It got so loose right awe that its purpose to conceal tattoo was lost. use a stocking or sock. seriously, do not buy it.
B00MFX4B3C|5|Love, love this organizer! Fits all my makeup. Super fast shipping!! Very happy with the purchase!
B004TP9FHG|1|please don't buy this. I threw it the second it came in the mail. Don't waste your money. Save it for better quality glitter eyeshadow.
B006VLRE56|5|excelente
B001SIS7MG|5|Helped covered
B00JOSEHTO|5|Great job! Very fast delivery.
B003NZFMCK|5|I've been showering with this soap for a year now. It leaves a clean feeling like no other soap without drying the skin. It smells wonderful, even my boyfriend is hooked on it.
B00FOMLHCE|4|Very pretty.  I recommend to every woman.
B008XWC3UM|5|Very reasonable price. The only thing that it looks like it has repetitive brushes. Which is fine for me. Thanks.
B000AUIFCA|5|The Oral B Floss Action brush heads are great.  I still floss but less often.  I can fill the deep clean with these brush heads
B005CPZK26|5|Great lip moisturizer. Pack of two is always handy.<br />The formula stays on like forever scent and taste free which is great. Love wearing this under my lipstick it makes it last longer . There are times I've applied this to dry cuticles and its done the trick of maintaining my nails well till my nextmanicure
B000C1UBFQ|5|really nice scent- clean- stay on for a long time- good price and I would definitely purchase again- I just love this scent
B005OZM810|5|I love Sigma, always have and always will. The quality is good and it's a cheaper alternative to MAC. Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors. I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment. Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.
B0060NKL2S|4|I like this soap. It smells wonderful, feels clean, and doesn't dry out my skin. The little salt chunks are pretty useless though. They break out of the bar easily, so they don't do much for exfoliation. They just detach and cling to you which is a little annoying.<br /><br />I also didn't think it lathered thick enough for beard shaving.
B004XDEAK6|4|The Helix Threadease has made it alot easier to remove/thread facial hair; I mainly use it for upper lip and my upper eyebrow. Under the eyebrows is very difficult though because you usually need to have someone else pull the skin so that you dont accidently pluck out too much hair (or the wrong ones). Easy to use and quite straighforward otherwise. I would recommend checking out the How To videos on youtube if needed.  * I would also like to add that the sellers were extremely friendly with answering my questions and I have recommended this product to all of my friends.
B00121PZZG|5|A good value for strong Vitamin E Oil with prompt delivery, saves me from going from store to store, paying more and getting less.
B000S8JB68|5|I love this curler! It is a great value. I love that I can change the size of my curls. When I first started using it, I did burn myself a couple times.... So when you first get used to it, I would recommend wearing a jacket or a long sleeve shirt... I haven't had problems since.
B0036QFZ46|5|I use it for my skin and in my hair as a substitute for product. I have extremely sensitive skin, so a lot of things bother me. Hempz is about the only thing I can use without having an allergic reaction. I also have extremely thick, curly hair, so taming that mess used to be a project, to say the least. I've been using this product for over a year, in every kind of weather, and as a product substitute ( for mousse and creams and all that other junk normally used to tame the madness that is curly hair) it is absolutely stellar. My hair is manageable, it shines, and it doesn't turn into a mass of tangles anymore. Use it. Best investment in health and beauty I ever made.
B00SQ81NFO|5|I dropped 6 drops in the palm of my hand and rubbed my palms together and then breathed in deeply. I repeated this process a few times. I felt revived! Inhaling deeply is good for our healthy anyways and so why not inhale Joy?<br /><br />This Premium Synergistic Blend Of Anise, Cinnamon Leaf, Clary Sage, Lemon, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang and Jasmine essential oils is heaven in a bottle! Lemon is on the forefront of this essential oil. I also detect Clary Sage which I am new to, but can recognize it. I am loving it!<br /><br />Here is a great gift idea - for  pennies: Birthday Bath Salts - Mix 1 cup each of Epsom Salt and baking soda and 20-30 drops of Scential Health Joy. Use 1/4 cup per bath. Put into a cute container or mason jar. Wrap with a ribbon or raffia bow.<br /><br />Scential Joy can be worn as a perfume. I have a pretty glass spray bottle for my purse. So much healthier than a perfume loaded with chemicals and alcohol!

B00NDVUNNW|4|It hurt my eyes like crazy . Wonder is that good or not
B00R1IL1MA|4|Works really well. Great purchase! Would definitely use this product line in the future!
B00H1GK6SM|5|Works great at hiding your thin hair.
B007V4ZLZC|5|Love it!!  Just what I needed!!
B008PTPSF0|5|I love these. Have no problem with them. I just wish the quantity was higher. If I would have known, I would have ordered more.
B00006IV3M|4|Excellent buy, takes time to get used to it but a great buy for the money. Just as expected. Strong Motor and excellent results. Really like it. I would recommend it anytime.
B0098QMRGC|5|Wow ! I  am sooooo... happy i ordered this tiara it is elegant and very princess like. It complements my look totally.<br />If  you're considering purchasing it. Go right ahead. You wont regret.
B00365DABC|5|Best facial lotion out there for anyone even if you have sensitive skin!
B000LNWUIG|5|This is really good for my hair ... no alcohol and holds well!
9790778287|5|Arrived as expected
B002K8W58K|5|This is THE best stuff on the planet.  I've had horrible skin for over 10 years and have literally tried EVERYTHING. I even went on Accutane when I was 18 for 6 months. It cleared up my skin initially but then about 2 years later, my acne came back. I've tried several other prescription drugs and topical creams and everything possible at the drug store and nothing has worked...until this! I had a facial recently and my facialist told me I should try tea tree oil products because they are anti-fungal and really help oil the acne causing bacteria. OMG. It's been 3 weeks and my skin is AMAZING!  It's completely  clear! I've always had issues with hyper-pigmentation even after the pimple disappeared and this has evened out my skin like nothing I've ever used!  I use my face wash with a clarisonic mia as well so it gets the best cleaning possible. My skin feels so refreshed and soft after I'm done.  Seriously, if you have acne-prone skin and have tried everything else, give this a shot. It's incredible!<br /><br />Note: The first week I used it, my skin was REALLY DRY.  So I added a little bit of deep moisturizer in combination with the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion which helped a lot! Now my skin is used to it and is literally amazing.  I also use the toner, moisturizer, face mask (twice a week) and BB cream. LOVE LOVE this whole line!
B00HJZT0YQ|5|These taste and work great!
B00TKPGHDK|5|Well pleased!
B002VECJ4I|4|Bought this for my sister while she was in the hospital because it was easy to use in bed. Liked it so well we are both still using it. Wish I had got a lighter colorbut it does feel nice on my skin and covers well.
B0017OLMVE|5|I have used this moisturizer under my makeup every morning for years, and love it.  Have not found anything better.  I think the price is outrageous, but purchase it anyway.
B0015GQZ2U|5|Hard to find don't know why you can;t find these in stores.  I use them over and over again to get maximum use.
B000V2ACI2|5|This wax is amazing. I have medium length hair that's not oily and this product works great in my hair.<br /><br />Loves<br />- Long lasting hold, even after intense workouts<br />- Green apple smell and doesn't drown you in the odor when you put it on<br />- Matte finish<br />- Doesn't need a lot of product to achieve look (at least for me)
B00P87JCHW|5|Beautiful tattoos! They are easy to apply and wonderfully accessorize any outfit. The turnaround time between order and delivery was quick. Thank you.
B00IZB0AII|4|Small, but pretty good overall.
B0042WM5RS|5|The scent is heavenly; the ONLY perfume I have ever liked.  And it is perfect on the wearer.  So how can I not like it?  The price is also very good.
B00HSP4PYM|5|Smells really soft and sweet. Does not have an arid smell which my husband really likes and I enjoy.
B00HT16ZUC|5|The full range that these strips measure makes them versatile.  The color coded results page is helpful.  Great price for a fine product.
B007RZNR60|4|Excellent glue for acrylics.
B000CEMTSU|5|I need nail files to keep my nails neat trim and protected from harms way.  I'm a guitarist and electric bassist and my nails have to be ready.  This file does it.  I use the Revlon product and this...  this one travels very well and remains in the gig bag ready to use at a moments notice.<br /><br />Great file and a really nice action.
B000VER1RU|5|love the product
B00LWGE24Q|5|I love this product!! It is so great that I can just add this into my foundation so it matches my tan instead of buying a new foundation. I even use it when I'm not tan because I love the way it makes my foundation look!
B00WL6SW2Y|4|Stays on pretty well.
B000X1KR40|3|I have naturally fickle skin, with breakouts. I decided to give this a try because it claimed to aid in healing and stopping breakouts, but it also claims to not leave your skin feeling dry. I purchased two .35 oz soaps to try out. For the first couple of days I used this morning and night with no trouble. It left my pores visibly smaller after use. Also, my face my more luminous. However, it did leave my skin dry and I had to use a moisturizer quickly afterwords or else my skin would have started to peel from the dryness! I had not had this issue before...after about four days of using this the pain began. A few seconds after applying the lather onto my face and neck it would burn. By burn, I mean it felt like I had just rubbed acid onto my skin. Yes, it was that bad...I thought that maybe this was just because the soap with making blood rush into my skin so I kept using it for about a week afterwords. Big mistake.  My skin was left red, damaged, dry and in loads of pain like I had burnt it. Some days were worse then others. The pain became even worse when I was washing it with cool water from my face. I had to run cold water across it to relive the intense burning. I could not leave it on for more then a few seconds. It burnt my active breakouts especially bad, but my whole face and neck was in some serious agony. I should have stopped using the soap as soon as the burning came along, but I was thinking that maybe my skin was just getting used to it because no other product had made my face burn like this one. Finally, I gave up and stopped using it. It took my about a week of noxzema to recover from the damage. I'm not allergic to anything, and I wouldn't say that I have necessarily sensitive skin so I have little clue as to what cause the pain. Either way, I know for sure that I will never touch this stuff again! Haha. I decided to give it *** because it did reduce my pore size, but those results quickly vanished once I stopped using it. Ouch!
B000RJUZMW|5|GREAT Christmas Present! The receiver loves it and wont stop talking about it and how smooth his face is. Also says he only has to shave twice a week because it's so good. Best Christmas gift I've gotten ever.
B003BQUDKM|3|Careful this is not the golden one that comes with the shaver. The picture clearly says 'super close' on it below the foil. When I opened the box the the foil that came was silver and said 'Close'. This one doesn't shave as closely to the skin because it is thicker .. It may last longer but you will find yourself having to shave more frequently.
B00CLPV3M6|4|This is my favorite aftershave.  I love the light, pleasant lime scent and the perfect tingly feeling after a shave.  My problem was with the way it was shipped.  Though it was shipped in a zip lock baggie, the lid wasn't taped and it became unloosened during shipping resulting in a lot of the product unnecessarily wasted.  I will look for a different vendor when I'm ready for another bottle.
B006RFZ9IK|5|This product does a great job cleaning your face.  It travels easy too.  I will be sure to order this product again.
B00HT16XEK|2|I didn't see any major change in my size with this product..im not a very heavy person anyway I just have a stomach and that is all.but it really do not wotk
B00CQ5C54G|5|Love this Product, my hair is beautiful every morning.
B00K7ZTZD6|5|For a friend
B00QQ7KYU2|5|Great set for the price. The dotting tools and brushes are a nice selection of sizes. Having fun with the crystals but recommend getting a waxed pencil to help apply them.
B00BD40X7C|5|Great for thick toenails. Bought an extra set one and use them to clip dogs nails.
B00TIE19Z4|3|Doesn't fit my kitchen faucet well.  Just passes, barely.
B009Y8B5P8|1|I did not like this at all! Something like a fragrance is so personal so even reading reviews may not help. I should have listened to the reviews because this stuff stinks!! I didn't bother asking anyone I knew if they would like it...I didn't want to chance it that we would be around each other and I would have to smell that mess. Straight to the trash it went. I really was hoping I'd like it but I was proven wrong.
B000F8FZ5W|5|After using this for the first time in the shower instead of a back brush, I threw away the back brush! With a \\"shoe-shining\\" motion starting on the back of my neck and working down to my legs, I felt so clean!!! A back brush NEVER felt this good!!  I bought a few for stocking stuffers this year!!!
B00LGXX28M|5|good
B005IGUMPY|1|This is not what I expected out of a product that sells for almost $300 a bottle. Glad I bought a sample before purchasing thus at a regular price.
B00GTC1JHQ|5|Nice smell to it.  I really like this soap.  It is a great purchase for the price and thank you Amazon for delivering this to my door rather than having to carry it from the store!  Very convenient if you put it on auto-ship and the price is the same as in stores or less.
B0012XO2W6|2|I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately the tint mixed with the SPF left an intense white yet pinkish sheen on my olive skin. No amount of rubbing would blend this product into my skin. While it did not work for me, I do believe that it might work really well on those with lighter skin complexions or cooler undertones.<br /><br />Although more expensive, I found that the Josie Maran Argan Oil SPF 47 blends in beautifully and has the same two main ingredients that I look for: Zinc and Titanium Dioxide.
B002B0GYN4|5|perfect for clearing out my Lungs.
B00ARWNVG6|5|it's metal purple flowers very pretty bought it for my daughter. recommend to anyone that like hair accessories I'm looking for more like this one.
B006DMUPHW|1|This product is thin, watery almost, which means it doesn't moisturize your skin well.  Nor does the scent last past four or five minutes. I will not buy this again unless it is seriouly revamped.
B0002YH3PY|5|I've used Gigi muslin strips for waxing but decided to order the roll instead in hopes that I would get more out of it. I think it will last longer than the pack of pre-cut strips I had previously. This roll is good quality and the material seems a little thicker than the pre-cut strips. You definately need sharp scissors or pinking shears to cut this so it doesn't fray and leave strings all over the place. Next time I need epilating strips I will re-order this instead of the pre-cut strips... I really like the fact that I can decide how long they need to be.
B00AWR6GRC|5|I use it after every wash. Like most women I use a couple of things so no telling if it is the single most effective of all the products I use but I do like the fresh out of the salon smell.
B000P1TYEM|5|These are hard to find so this is a great value. I had a couple of the smaller plastic dispensers and used this to re-stock them. If you have those annoying food traps, then carrying these at all times is the only way to go.
B003OGQYC0|1|The shellac products in general are not for impatient people, they get \\"gloppy\\" fast.  I have been doing my own french manicures beautifully for many years and found that by the time I put the cream puff shellac on the tips,even though it would look perfect, as soon as I cured it in my machine it would bubble up and look poorly.  I am able to do regular shellac nails with some success (not as nice as when I get them done in the shop but they still last 2 weeks so I'm happy), but I would love to get my money back for the cream puff cause french tips are not working!  I know how to do nails, but am not real great with Amazon.com, so don't know how to get $ back for a  product without it costing me :(  Good luck all
B00GQ9I9IO|5|I have been using true skin C for two weeks and have noticed the deference. My skin looks more softer and younger looking. With recommended 100% love it.
B003H8588G|4|It goes on smoothly and its like a nude gloss but looks amazing when you put the actual lip gloss over it.
B004BUKFXC|4|I have used Designer Skin products before while indoor tanning and this is another worthy product from the manufactuer. No, the tingle is very low, however, if you like a nice cooling sensation, this bronzer is ideal. You will see the best results while using this product in a medium- or high-pressure bed. It is worth the price, since Designer Skin charges up to 40-50% more on their website or if you buy from a retailer.
B00H0S3TV2|5|Got what was promised. Fixed my Glasses.
B004ZH5MTS|5|I was in the search of a brush holder that would hold a bunch of my brushes and not cost an arm and a leg. I was about to purchase the MAC brush holder which only holds 8 and looks like a pain to close...when i came across this holder. i loved how many brushes it holds and the pink casing. When i recieved it in the mail i was very happy with the product. it did have a slight order when i opened it but has since gone away. i didnt need any of the brushes but thought it was still a good deal just for case itself. i would recommend this for anyone who needs just the case or the brushes as well. Oh and i LOVE LOVE LOVE that it just snaps close instead of the wrap around strings you have to tie.
B000C1Z63I|5|I will recommend this parfum for any woman ... Always have been one of my favorite fragrances .. i love it
B008QMWPYS|3|It's OK. The smell quickly diminishes, but it lathers nicely and is quite soft on your skin. I don't think I'd purchase it at full price, but on sale it's worth it.
B004Y5NA1I|5|If you tried Carol's Daughter products before and hated them...TRY THIS. This makes my hair so soft and I even sometimes use it as a leave-in!
B007Y6FN3C|5|Reminded me of the time I went on vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. Mandalay Bay use to have this product in all of their guest rooms.
B001MHNQYW|5|I am very happy with this product the jar is HUGE........definitely will recommend this I've wasted money on LOTS of poor acrylic powders so happy I found a product I can stick wick
B0009EILKS|5|I've used these strips for years and I love how well they work.  Thanks to the small slits, they fit like a glove and do a fantastic job at removing my blackheads!  I use them once or twice a month and wouldn't be without them.  I use facial peels, scrubs along with masks, even a cleansing brush, but nothing removes my blackheads the way these strips do!  I recommend them.  Debi B.
B001GQ3GEY|3|Good product from Wahl, but the image shows a very compact and organized stand. The accessories do NOT go in the stand as easily as the picture on here would imply. The stand is very flimsy plastic, and its like playing Jenga trying to get all the pieces in there. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a very durable and efficient way of organizing everything.
B00068HAK4|5|Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it
B00C7DYBX0|1|I am glad I did not spend a lot of money on this product.  There was no noticeable difference.  I wouldn't buy it again.
B001L3ZCLM|5|This brush applies blush beautifully!
B001B8RND2|5|Was a gift for my Dad and he loves it, smells great. Perfect Christmas gift. Nothing else to say but I need so many words per review.
B0032Z21HK|5|I love this shampoo & conditioner! My hair feels so soft and smells so nice! I was truly amazed at how soft my hair was after I let my hair air dry. Made my hair feel so clean! I can get away without washing my hair for three days when using this shampoo and conditioner combo. My hair never looked greasy, stayed fresh, and there was no need for dry shampoo in between washings. I usually have to wash every day - every other day.  I thought this shampoo lathered up nicely and a quarter sized amount was perfect for my elbow length hair.   The conditioner was definitely thinner and less rich then what I am used to, but the same quarter sized amount worked just fine to condition my ends and give great results. It just took some getting used to, because I'm used to having a thick conditioner.  Would definitely recommend and will buy again!
B008YQM40G|5|I've been using this for a while and my husband has started using it too. Other people in my family have begun using too. Why? Because it actually has made a difference. My mother-in-law actually asked my husband if he had gotten his teeth whitened. Good stuff.
B0020MMFH2|4|My dad asked me to order this perfume as a valentines day gift for my mom.  The perfume arrived damaged . The cap was broken, some of the perfume had spilled and the box was discolored due to it. I contacted them as soon as i found out. Emma , from the company,  sent me emails trying to resolve the problem.  It took quite some time and I got a return label for it . I sent them pictures , per their request, for their insurance claim.<br />Long story short march 14 I recieved a replacement perfume. The box from the outside was not the same, however when I opened it, it had the SAME damage and same amount spilled.  It made me wonder whether the only thing that had changed was the outer box.<br /><br />Anyway, I sent another email. This time asking for a full refund along with a return label.<br />The process has taken too long and has been very cumbersome with no signs of resolution.<br />I will update this post once I hear back from them.<br /><br />I don't know whether I would ever order perfume from them again.<br /><br />03/15/2014<br /><br />I recieved an email back from Emma who is a customer service representative on the case.<br />She apologized for the inconvenience and issued a full refund back to my account and said she will send a prepaid label if necessary.<br />She also apologized for the terrible experience ....<br /><br />Overall , I'm satisfied with their response although not fascinated with the experience.<br />I would look into what other products they offer, just because of their good customer service.
B00GM4G5ZM|4|Great I use this every day
B00346U886|5|Bought these to self pierce my tongue web and my tragus. These needles are great! They are packaged separately and in sterile sealed baggies. Would definitely buy these again.
B00BC27QFW|4|... However, it worn out quite quickly after first use compare to the price you pay for, hope it's could last a bit longer
B00CNWY1YY|5|Does anyone remember Neutrogena's first microdermabrasion kit that came with that massager thing and the crystals?  They have since replaced it with some kind of weird exfoliant pad, but the jar of gritty crystals was my favorite thing - I didn't even bother with the massager, I just used my fingers.  (Ok, that sentence sounded bad. LOL)  The only problem was it was expensive to buy refills.  It's been years since that product went off the market and I never found a good replacement until now.<br /><br />They sell this stuff in an even larger quantity, which is technically a bigger deal, but this jar will probably last years if you are just using it weekly.  The only issue is that it's hard to mix it in with your face soap or oil or whatever you are using without risking getting soap/oil in the crystals jar.  You truly don't need a lot of crystals, but you want to get the ratio right, which means you may want to add more halfway thru when your hands are wet.  I usually pour a little bit out on to a post-it or a tiny finger bowl so I don't have to worry about contaminating the whole jar with soap/oil.<br /><br />You can mix this with your favorite soap, or add it to jojoba or grapeseed or vitamin e oil, or even honey and scrub away.  I recommend doing it in the shower or right before because it can be hard to rinse all the crystals away.<br /><br />As I get older (I'm in my mid 30's), my skin gets dry in the winter, and this stuff really helps get rid of those tiny bits of flaky skin.  It also helps smooth out slight wrinkles, which I am just starting to get and feel a bit self-conscious about.  For the price, it's really a no-brainer, and you have the flexibility of adding whatever product you want with it to customize your skin care regime.
B000FQ5OIM|4|I can't find these replacement tips ANYWHERE except on Amazon. I love my Water Pik irrigator. I think it does a better job than traditional flossing. However, these tips are too hard to get on and off the head. Don't know why. They look the same as the originals, but they seem to fit a bit differently.
B00GJG9JCY|5|Not as good as trivectin( leaves skin dry)
B0016D4RQS|5|All of the scents included smell wonderful, and were not opened. A great variety.
B0051918JW|5|This is great for removing facial hairs, thou it hurts on my first few tries.
B0012H0Y6K|3|UNFORTUNALLY THE FOAM ROLLERS ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECT, THIS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND WHEN I TRY IT, THEY BEND VERY EASY. I CAN NOT FIND THE GOOD ONES IN A STORE ANYMORE, SO I WONDER IF SOMEBODY CAN TELL ME WHERE TO FIND IT PLEASE. I REALLY NEED TO FIND THE SAME BRAND BUT BETTER QUALITY.
B005DWX5ZW|4|My neck has been killing me.  I have 3 types of  electric massagers at home. I keep this one in the office as a quick fix me up.  I have to sit through  5-6 meetings regularly every day.
B00H4M38NS|4|Great product😃can feel the difference
B00IR0W530|5|OMG this product is awesome for my 4b hair. Since I went natural my texture has changed has gotton more curly. This product I used last night for a conditioner and sat under a plastic cap for about 1 hour and my curls where sooooooo soft and springy. I literally could run my fingers through my hair with no kinks. Its smells so fresh like minty lemons which I love for the summer.
B000ICRDSW|5|This is an amazing product! I use it twice a day, morning and night, for 15 minutes each,concentrating on the deep lines. I'm  consistent with the use of it  in this way and  it's toned my face, particularly the cheeks and under the chin  and has given me a more youthful appearance. Within a few days I could already see a slight change and after two months I look ten years younger! People remark when they learn how old I am but I'm an older woman so this might be why the change was so dramatic  on me.
B00KGO8XY0|4|I love it, the only thing is if you do re-applay the gel , the fibers fell all over you face,,, otherwise.. Im<br />Happy with it, i will buy it again;)
B001QXKDRA|5|I hate canker sores! I haven't had one in years but I just got a nickle sized canker just inside my lip. It burned so bad. Hurt to eat, hurt to drink. On day 3 of such severe pain that i could barely even talk I remembered I had tea tree oil. I dabbed some on a q tip then placed directly on the canker for about 30 sec. Tingled a little but didn't hurt at all. Once I removed it it instantly felt better. I then went to sleep and woke up to a numbing effect and noticed it was starting to heal very quickly. Put it on 3 times daily and over the course of 3 days it was completely gone. I think it cut the healing time in half and plus added a numbing effect to it.
B003AYEUEA|4|All the kids give this toothpaste thumbs up. Great taste and texture! Will buy again. Love that it's SLS free and fluoride free!
B000G62I12|5|Great!
B008FMCN64|1|This it retarded , the colors they make sure don't seem to match normal skin,
B004NMYMJG|5|Love this pink color, it has a shimmer to it and looks great by itself or layered with a glitter color over the top.  Either way it's a fantastic buy!
B0043OYFKU|5|My skin is super soft after using this. I LOVE IT.
B00019HUOY|5|Thank you Perfume Emporium! This fragrance is impossible to find - has been out of production for ages... it's a small miracle that you guys stock this. This is a great 'clean sharp guy' cologne. I often get one of those 'ohhh somebody smells good' comments when wearing this.
B0015IXM4C|5|The people on the /r/wicked_edge subreddit heaped praise upon this inexpensive Italian shave cream, which enticed me to give it a try.<br /><br />Now that I've been using this for a week, this is my analysis. For starters, I practically have to work at it to cut myself using this stuff. Very slick. It effectively buffers my skin as the Voskhod blade's unyielding Russian steel cleaves through my stubble. Yes, Cella is, indeed, a marvelous product that puts the merely serviceable Williams and Van der Hagen soaps to shame with its lathering, lubricating, and moisturizing properties, not to mention the delightfully confectionary almond smell that it exudes. This turns the act of shaving into a feast for the senses, rather than a humdrum chore, which in turn, causes me to pay closer attention to my shaving technique, and that results in a better shave and healthier skin.<br /><br />At last, I understand why shave soap manufacturers and wet shaving enthusiasts tend to put so much emphasis on appealingly scented soaps; what I had previously deemed effete is, in fact, a very pragmatic consideration. Great stuff, buy it.
B005JFPGX2|4|This has a great consistency and feels lightweight. Offers full coverage but does not last all day. Honey 27 is appropriate for some around NC 35/37. I'd recommend mixing a primer with it before applying.
B000O1NORG|1|The original scent has been modified from a light clean smelling after bath splash to something that can make your eyes water.  Bring back the original.
B00ESYFTVO|4|Actually works great ... Only complaint didn't come with instructions in English
B0052P1NX6|5|LOVE
B000QSDHPG|5|Love these products, but I strongly recommend to read the CURLY GIRL book first. You will get the most benefits base on you curly hair type.
B00I8U775K|5|like how I can remove the top piece of it. its small but still love it
B004YD73CC|2|Totally not spirit master paper. However it does work with the crappie stencil maker we got as a freebie in a previous order. WILL NOT WORK WITH 3M THERMAFAX.  The design comes out solid purple? Great for hand made stencils though. You just look at the stuff and it sticks to the transfer paper.
B008VIL11U|5|FIVE STAR
B00CUXWC2O|1|i returned mine immediately . you are better off getting a sports bra or something. your breast just hangs there. not what I was hoping for at all.
B004BD0ZU2|5|It was as great as it was on the L'Oreal video. Shipment was Fast.
B00D879BFW|1|Doesn't really work, but it does make your skin very soft, while removing any hair lol. Won't be purchasing again.
B004SGKMA0|5|sharp
B000GLRREU|5|I was considering a portable water flosser for my office.  Since I do not have my own bathroom, I have to hunt around my hospital unit until I find a free sink.  So portability was important.  However, after reading Amazon reviews of all the available portable units, it was clear that none did a good job (weak stream, low tank capacity), and all had reliability problems.<br />By the way, one fellow wrote that the tank size on portable units WAS adequate, as all you have to do it get the food out from between your teeth.  This is not true!  More importantly, you are flushing decay causing bacteria from below the gum line.  Waterpik instructs to floss 3 seconds per tooth.  And you need to approach from the outside and the inside.  So tank capacity is important.<br />The Ultra's compact size means I can carry it, along with my electric toothbrush, to whichever sink is available.<br />The coiled hose is in the middle of the device, so you can use it at any sink.  And it coils right back to it's original shape after use.<br />The spray flow is less than the Hydro Floss, but definitely powerful enough to clobber plaque.<br />The unit is significantly quieter than the Hydro Floss.<br />The styling is aerodynamic and modern, which tells the bacteria in your mouth that RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!<br />The large, knurled ring at the base of the pic is easy to rotate.<br />You even get extra attachments which I don't use but some will appreciate.<br />So this is a great machine as a table top unit, and as a portable.
B00COX5UPQ|5|I usually write detailed descriptions of why I rate a product the way I do. It is what it is. A pure, 2oz lavender essential oil without any other ingredients. 100% pure essential lavender oil. I actually have another brand of lavender by a more expensive, superior company where the oil is better than Nature's Own Essence. But, I would recommend this to someone. Still a high quality lavender essential oil. Plain and simple.
B00PYK2UI6|5|[[VIDEOID:6112fe873baebd88bdcf016ff8ba96a0]]I have wanted one of these for quite a while now.  My teenage daughter has acne and I have large, visible pores.  A salesperson at a department store wanted me to buy one but I just didn't want to spend that kind of money (around $100).  I really wanted to give one of these a try to see if it could help.    This kit is even better than others I have looked it.  It has different brushes but is really a whole body kit.  It comes with the cleaning unit, one big body brush, one sensitive skin face brush, one small face brush, and one pumice.  So you can do your face, whole body and feet with this one set.  It's very easy to use.  The attachments just pop onto the end and you press the power button.  I use my normal facial soap on it and get it good and wet then move it all over my face.  I have figured out how hard to press the unit to my face based on what feels comfortable for me.  My daughter uses the regular face brush and I use the sensitive one.  I feel like when I am done that my face is so much cleaner than just washing with my hands or a washcloth.  My daughter uses it once a day in the evenings when washing her face.  I do use a make up remover first  then use the brushing system.  After you are done, you rinse the brush off and store.  The unit is water proof and can be used wet or dry and with or without soap.      If you are looking for an affordable brushing system, I would recommend giving this one a try.  It has definitely earned 5 stars in my book!    Sample purchased at a reduced rate in exchange for evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.
B0015R9GBG|5|Grate
B004O9PCGU|5|I love this fragrance.  It reminds me of &#34;Fracas&#34; but this is easier to wear.  Fracas is the older, more glamorous sister to this younger, carefree sister.  They both share the tuberose/gardenia beauty.<br /><br />It opens with beautiful orange blossom along with a fresh pear - the pear is like it's just barely ripe so it's not overly sweet.  The orange blossom fades quickly then it's on to a wonderful tuberose and gardenia.  The tuberose is similar but not the same as the &#34;Fracas&#34;; it has a bit of the buttery creaminess but it is also a more green/flowery tuberose - not quite as carnal.  Then there is the pretty jasmine & a bit of sandalwood spice.  The musk is barely there providing a bit of depth.<br /><br />If you don't like tuberose and gardenia, you may not like this.  I happen to love tuberose especially when combined with gardenia so this is one of my favorite fragrances.  I love all three of the Robert Piquet Fracas line:  Fracas, Douglas Hannant & Petite Fracas.<br /><br />The sillage is just beyond arm length & this lasts about 12 hours on my skin.<br /><br />I have never gotten a fake fragrance when I order &#34;Ships From & Sold By Amazon&#34;.
B0030HO592|2|I mainly wanted this for the case itself. The products were a side benefit. I'd had a case like this that lasted for years and was perfect for dealing with TSA checkpoints. Unfortunately, there's a paper lining at the bottom designed to advertise what the product is -- that &#34;10pc Premium Men's Travel Kit&#34; part. That didn't remove cleanly. I've got a case with all this sticky paper crud along the bottom sides.
B00G7IOZXM|5|good
B00XQ21G1Q|5|nice compact unit that works well
B002KG28PW|5|I don't use any other shampoo than this
B002ZNJIIK|5|Our granddaughter loves it.
B002HRENXO|4|We got the wall mirror mounded with no problems.  I love the looks of the mirror.  Very well made.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is:  I don't think it is a 10x, not as strong as my 8x hand mirror and the light could be better.  I use the little 15x mirror often and husband uses the 10x to shave. The price was very good.
B003EMJHG4|5|excelente
B008RZ7SO6|4|It is one of the best in the market.
B003K63Q8E|5|My 7 year old daughter loves this sunscreen for her face. Lotions irritate her eyes and she previously used California Baby's sunscreen stick. That one is very hard. This one is quite soft in comparison and is softer than the Neutrogena Baby sunscreen stick. But it does have a little texture. After putting some on her face she rubs it in easily and it doesn't show.
B001C65CIG|4|This is a great soap for acne, not available elsewhere that I can find. Thank God for Amazon, for bringing products to our doorstep that are not easily available locally. I must say I found the price steep, but it is a great product. My only other comment would be that if one is ordering something small, like soaps, in multiples, there should be some sort of incentive to buy multiples by not charging full price shipping for each item. I did probably end up paying three times too much for shipping, considering they all arrived in one small box. That is the thing that turned me off, hence only four stars. A fantastic soap, but an incentive to by several would be nice.
B00GXE5ASY|4|I absolutely love this product! Was very pleased with the low price, but was disappointed that it took several weeks to ship.
B002DP19ZU|5|Great colors that stay on all day.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I will never go back to pharmacy makeup again!
B0002PU864|5|I've been using these wax strips for my upper lip for years and am very happy with them.  I noticed in other reviews that the people who complained about them were pretty much first time users.  It takes a little practice to find your technique, but once you do, these quick and easy strips work very well.  Warm with your hands, pull the strip apart and now you have two very sticky strips.  I use one for each side of my upper lip and they work great.  I have not used for bikini area since I would think these could be too small, but for the face, they work very well.
B002CLL85Q|5|Very nice razor of top quality.
B007HLWNT6|5|This is something I discovered on a shopping channel, and I found it cheaper here. I love the feel of it as well as the smell (dream cream smells a little like a Dreamsicle but not obnoxious and fake). I miss it when I'm out, so I keep this on my wish list.
B00UI3OHG2|5|I really love this face cream.  It's so light and velvety.  It sinks into your skin really nicely.  It has a wonderful refreshing very light orange fragrance that is not overpowering and that disappears quickly.  Makes my skin feel smooth and very soft and well hydrated without feeling oily or greasy.  I've been using it for over a month and have never had any break outs.  I have oily/combo skin and I think it's been helping to prevent whiteheads.  Also love all the natural organic ingredients.  I would highly recommend this product.
B0045OR410|5|love it
B00DZHYAI8|2|Doesn't work
B006L11B2I|4|Works well but be careful that you do not drop it.  I did and I ended up using glue to fix it.  Works great now
B00F4TQ4QG|5|First off, I really like the light scent that this shampoo imparts on my hair, not a heavy perfumy scent but a fresh clean one. I dye my hair with the Clairol Natural Instincts semi permanent dye and was looking for a &#34;pre-dye&#34; shampoo that would clean my hair well and NOT coat the shaft with ANYTHING for the best adherence of the dye. This certainly did the trick. It also left my hair very full and fluffy which is something new for me as I have baby fine, limp, straight hair, so you can see why I am really liking it! Now if you have dry curly hair that needs some built in sealer/conditioners into the shampoo, then this is NOT the one for you unless you always apply a conditioner after shampooing. For me and my needs, I am very pleased and give it 5 stars as there is nothing to improve as far as I'm concerned.
B000GCY2BA|5|Good product nice result
B005HFAY22|5|If your a stylist and don't own one of these you have no... Idea what the heck your missing out on!! Great thing ever invented. Easy to change the blades, durable, and my clients can't get enough of it!!
B005SKDTGY|4|Love all of the items in this bag but the eyeshadow piece fell out so unable to use that. Otherwise love the mascara and the blush, and the lip stick !
B000T5QN5M|5|I've been using this makeup for years now and just recently discovered I can get it on Amazon and save about $6 per bottle. Great product and fantastic savings!  The makeup really does stay on for 24 hours if not washed off, and looks great on my agdry skin
B001CT053U|5|Received item quickly and as described, thanks!
B00B4PWEJU|5|work greats! totally recommend it
B0046MK34G|5|PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.  THEY LOVED IT!
B0016BC2BM|5|i only use this shampoo now. it really helps thicken thin hair. i felt like i was losing my hair... i started using this shampoo only and my hair feels fuller and healthier. it works
B001G7PMX6|5|good stuff, what else can I say
B003UKKH6O|5|Having gum problems for a couple of years already, this friend helped reduce completely the bleeding and better feeling during the day. Timer is a good way to keep control of time spent.
B003CTTZQQ|5|This product  is amazing
B004NYTR8U|5|My daughter realy loved getting this for Christmas.She also loved the colors, and how good the glitter looked in the polish.
B00GLE8SNK|1|I have been using this on my face for some slight discolorations and on my arm for a darker spot.<br />In all cases this has not made any difference. It has not done anything, good or bad, that I can<br />See for dark spots or general quality of my skin.
B000H68J2S|5|I have a serious mouth condition that leaves me with tender gums that bleed easily.  Floss and those small brushes made my gums bleed yet I needed to use them - until I bought the QuickBreeze.  My husband installed it with no problem and I use it just as easily.  I love not having a another item on the bathroom counter and not having to fiddle with cleaning another apparatus.  Most important is that this device gets out food particles easily and painlessly.
B005YNB76E|5|Great product. I am a repeat customer
B000TAE0RK|1|Didn't do anything for me
B001PQHUKQ|1|You need a \\"NO\\" star rating.  This is an example of why the disclaimer on TV is so emphatic about the infomercial not being endorsed by the station, these are a waste of time, money and resources used in the manufacturing process. They are uncomfortable to wear, the sound amplification is uneven and it quit working after two days.
B00H997H74|1|They are good if you are using them as part of a costume, they are very shiny and hard to blend in with real hair, very unnatural looking.you get what you pay for I guess. On another note, the shipping was free and received them before the estimated delivery date.
B005FYJBFG|1|This color shows in the description that it is pink but it's more like fuchsia don't be Prize when you receive it it's more purple than pink... Display does not represent well
B001OVQSJG|1|These are not the right product. Not official Paul Mitchell Tea Tree. I have been using the real stuff for years. I would normally get it at my salon but they went out of business. I went to amazon and little did I know they are fake.<br /><br /> I noticed the smell was off.<br />noticed the tingle sensation was different.<br /><br />my girlfriend complained about it drying her hair out..<br /><br />anyway if you compare the real bottle next to the fake it very obvious that the bottle is fake. you can see the mis-prints in the writing.
B003NXSJUE|5|Exactly what I was looking fot. Love the color. Works great!
B002PQ8BQM|5|Let me start by saying that I have a big problem with over sweating, especially under my armpits.  It is a condition known as Hyperhydrosis. It does not matter if I am being physically active or not, or what the temperature is.  My armpits are just always sweating.  This is very embarrassing, and it ruins shirts very fast.  I have tried every deodorant there is including many clinical strength deodorants.  Nothing has ever worked until i tried Sweat Block.<br /><br />Sweat Block has stopped my armpits from sweating at all!  I have been so happy with this product.  I know this will sound really cheesy but this product has really changed my life.  I no longer have to wear 3 or 4 layers, or constantly keep my arms at my sides.  Since I have started using sweat block, I have not once had armpit sweat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who has experienced similar conditions to mine.
B0094DF68A|5|Depending on your hair style, you might need a quick comb/brush. I found this very convenient: it can stay in a pocket and be used when needed.<br />Note: I'd have preferred a different color, as the light blue looks like some baby-stuff.<br />Cammo colors would have been great :-)
B003V360NY|5|As they have for 50 ears,  the best shave  you can get with an electric razor.   I had one a long time ago but this new one is so updated.  the battery charge lasts a long time thru more than 15 shaves.   Best buy I have made in a long time.    cal white
B005U977DY|5|This oil quietly does its job. Not greasy, doesn't dry up quick like another brand I bought. Can pour too quickly out of the bottle you may want to buy another container to dispense. Will buy again
B00CC89OE6|1|Terrible product, I would give it 0 stars if I could. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life and this product after applying twice has made my skin break out into a rash. It's now been a few days and the rash hasn't gone down, if anything my skin is now sloughing off. I would not recommend this particular moisturizer or any of their products.
B001VEK1IU|5|This product has renewed my razor.  I can't tell the difference from when I first bought the razor, crisp and close shaves are back.
B000TA6Q4U|5|These brushes replaced a collection I had gathered over the past several years. I am very pleased with the brushes and the results I get.  It is so nice to dump all the old stuff and start using professional quality tools!
B00J3MPS4E|5|very good,I like this very much
B000SSHQKQ|5|Love, love, love the fragrance of this product.  Cleans very well.  I will always us this brand. I have the lotion and hand wash and they are both wonderful.
B003XIVQ7M|1|This is without a doubt the most vile tasting toothpaste I have ever used. I would rather attempt to eat hair, than use this again.<br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
B003LA90RU|5|Had to leave a review for this product its the best  product ever ....my face is clear now its so unbelievable. I will recommend it any day any time
B00213K5H2|5|Nice product!
B0030HNNS6|5|Has to be the best eyeliner I've tried to date. Once dry, doesn't smear. Long lasting. Easy application. Better than the sephora brand...
B008II7CS4|1|Didn't even hold for one day.
B001CWIIN6|1|I purchase this attachment from my local Sally's Beauty supply and had yo return it I own a conair hand held blow dryer but trust me it doesn't fit
B00NFFL1MS|5|This stuff works great! I haven't had ANY ingrown hairs since I started using it.
B00BOUPKLE|5|Great for styling, without being too sticky or gummy.
B00BDTDSPQ|5|love it, i use it to set my concealer and foundation
B00HBJ3KEQ|5|Great Product!
B0092OUOJ2|4|Great polish as always with OPI, but the color shown is not accurate. It's acutally a deep maroon. Pretty though.
B008R7BT5S|5|THIS STUFF DOES WORK, BUT, THE ONLY THING YOU CANNOT PUT IT ON AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER, WHEN YOUR PORES ARE OPEN, BECAUSE IT WILL CAUSE BURNING.  I PUT IT ON THE NEXT DAY, BECAUSE, I DID NOT HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE.  I KEPT IT ON FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, THEN WASH IT OFF AND I  MADE SURE MY UNDERARMS WERE COMPLETELY DRY, BEFORE ADDING MY DEODORANT.<br /><br />SO I HAVEN'T HAD ANY SWEAT UNDER MY ARMS SINCE I USE IT, AND I AM A PERSON THAT SWEATS A WHOLE LOT, BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />SO, YES IT DOES WORK<br /><br />DIANE
B00IZ3FZN6|5|Been using for a few weeks now and can see brown spots lightening  So Yeah!!
B001QX2OIG|5|I use them when I ride my horse without helmet and they stay on place, hold hair back and don't squeeze my had, so great stuff
B00KH6F6TM|4|Makes my face red for a while after use. Definitely increases blood flow!
B00GB8KYEW|5|Just switched to this product from Aveda's grooming clay and I'm glad I did. This clay is much stronger and lasts all day
B006MNFJIM|3|Kind of a light weight cheapie handle, but it does fit the Atra blades I had in abundance.  So at least I'll get to use those and not waste them.<br /><br />The delivery etc went off without a hitch.
B00IU2C148|5|Product was as described and arrived on time.
B0002DUSRA|5|These work splendidly.  They're extremely comfortable and stay in place.  Each one lasts between 2 and 3 weeks.
B001IMYEL0|3|Does sorta work like a poor man's (or woman's) WEN, but after using it my curly, white girl hair got kinda crunchy.  Me no like.<br />I think any conditioner would probablly work as well and for less.  In any case, moving on.
B0032K0A1E|5|Great mint green. Goes on smooth. Good formula.
B004M7WKKK|5|great ones
B00H1GK6IC|5|Will buy again.  Very satisfied
B00O0WRO08|5|It is quiet and works great. I like the cord keeper when traveling.
B001CT09ZO|1|I had an empty bottle of this ... it smelled so good. So I finally found it on Amazon but it was nothing like what the old bottle smelled like. I will find someone to pass it on to as I can't stand it.
B00DCCQR78|5|Works great if you have mild blemishes.
B00UE2EDCA|5|another great product from Swiss Botany!  love it
B005PUZZR8|5|Hit and miss with shavers/body groomers, in my experience.  I bought this to use for my beard and a little &#34;manscaping&#34; and it blew my expectations away.  It's powerful and feels of good quality.  The adjustable comb is a nice feature, too.  I mean, it's a trimmer.  Nothing huge to report on, as far as that goes.  Works as expected.  BUT, the batter lasts FOREVER.  I can't tell you how happy that makes me, especially since it's so powerful.  Figured it would be like every other shaver and barely last a few days.  On one charge it has shaved my chest/back/neck multiple times over the course of a month.  Beard, too.  It just keeps going.  I don't think I've ever had a razor with this kind of power and battery life, together.  Couldn't recommend it more.  I've only used one of the blades, however, so I can't report on the other two or three that came with it.
B009QUWT0Y|5|I'm by no means a connoisseur of soaps or bath products in general.  I don't, however, like generic soaps from the store for bathing.  I often am given  high quality, unique soaps, and I use them until they are gone.  For the first time in years, I ran out of fancy soap. I bought this one because it seemed affordable and interesting.<br /><br />This soap smells really funny just out of the packaging, dry, and not in use.<br /><br />I decided to use it anyway, and it actually smelled quite good when bathing.<br /><br />I'm pleased with the product and I plan on trying a few more from their line when I run out.
B0033QTYRS|5|love it
B006IBM21K|5|I have been doing nails for years, this is the second light I have purchased from royal nails, not because it was broken but it almost just as cheap to get a new light rather than replace the bulbs. Light works FAST, QUIET and very BIG. Best light I have ever had. Worth much more than what I paid. You will not find a better quality light for a better deal. I have had many many other lights that broke or didn't work very well so have lots to compare it to. I had tried to order another one a few months ago but they had to stock in and my heart was broken! So glad they got more in!
B00ANTO702|4|I don't notice anything special about this brush.  It brushes easily when wet but through dry, wavy hair it still tugs.
B00GYF65TK|2|It remains tacky on the skin and causes the delicate under eye area skin to bunch up an stick.  I like the delicate scent, but will not purchase this again.  Plus no notable change in the under eye area.
B00AKL3ETS|4|Excellent
B00BTT366G|5|This is the best lotion ever! And the best price. The dermatologist recommended it for me and I love it. I have dry skin and it really helps. It's good for all over although I don't recommend it for the face. It doesn't hurt the face but the dermatologist said you needed a facial moisturizer for your face. Other than that I would give more stars if possible.
B00N0F399G|5|I missed the special at Macy's and wanted to try the new colors. Love the makeup, hate the colors of the bag!
B00E9EHFR4|3|I bought it to replace the broken charging stand for my razor.  It works, but i think it is way over priced.
B0081CWUE8|5|Cleans hair very well. Leaves hair soft.
B0048KSGZO|5|Holds all your stray, unruly eyebrows in place. Bravo!
B001ET73FQ|5|I love this stuff, its the only thing i use. Works great! Its easy to heat and is a lot less messy than wax. Easy to apply and wash off as well.
B00K9SEM84|4|Love this! So will you! Go ahead and get the 3 pack so you can give the extras to family to try!
B004DN5ZSW|5|very good
B001A7YGS4|4|Love this
B000M4EI5M|5|Turntable was given as a gift to my son, a musician with a good ear for music quality, and he tells me that playing his old 33s has been very enjoyable. The price was good and the quality excellent.
B001ET7HJI|5|Wonderful soft mask to help you block out light.  It's like a sleep fairy, once it goes on, I fall asleep.  Great for airplanes, Hotels and camping.
B003WR3QSG|5|Perfect
B00GMQ4PVQ|1|Very Very Disappointed! I turned the Santa on once and he sang and moved. The second time I went to use it on the SAME DAY it did not work at all. No singing or Movement. I already have one at home I ve had for 3 years from the mall. This one is horrible quality. Can I return?<br /><br />Stephanie
B003983HZK|5|Good quality
B00PMCWIEM|2|I brought 3 from the actually Dsenyo site.  They are VERY small.  I have an average size head.  I could not even get them on.  If you have braids or locks....forget trying to wear these.  It's really disappointing because the colors are beautiful.
B0091ENBQG|3|Not as good as the old type, not as creamy and in different packaging. I was disappointed that it wasn't the Concealer product that I used for years.
B000IMQ5GS|4|I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I do see an improvement in my skin tone.  Finally someone thinks of us women going through Menopause!  Thank you.
B001E0ZQ54|2|I like it and my daughter too. Recommend it.
B000HX4JWK|5|Great anti-aging serum!
B001TAIFZM|5|The shipping was really fast and was packaged nice. I love how that make the serums per order and they had a date on the bottle that said which date it was made! I just started to use this product and it does not flake and it dries quickly. I hope I see good results within a few weeks.  Keep up the great service!
B00F4GUUWI|5|Every product I have tried has worked perfectly.  I use a serum, moisturizer, the best redness cover up EVER, perfect brow pencil ( lost all my hair during chemo for Bone Marrow Transplant including brows and lashes), Tightline eye lash serum.  All is growing in thick and healthy now in part, I think, because of my use of IT cosmetics. TRY THESE PRODUCTS YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED, in my opinion.
B00MF1X0JA|3|No results seen so far
B009YSSLAU|5|I use this product every day after my shower.  SO far it has had a wonderful effect on my skin.  Moisturizing and clean feeling, I really love Dove Men+Care products.<br /><br />It is a light formula, so you do not feel greasy.  The lightness also carries into the smell, which is light and masculine.<br /><br />I feel like my skin has gotten better with regular use.  My skin is not dry or greasy.  It is actually getting less sensitive, or so it feels.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for men looking for a great daily moisturizer.
B001ET77OI|5|My favorite soap :) I love lavender scented anything, and this bar has a slight scent, not overpowering. Perfect amount of suds and I love that it's organic and natural. Will be repurchasing.
B009P5T3KO|5|Excellent. It really worked for me.
B0053L2E1O|5|Love this soap. I will always buy it
B001VD9QRI|2|This product is not durable.  Seems cheap and not recommended for thick hair.  the item broke when I tried to place it on my hair to hold my pony tail in place.  Only good if you have very thin hair.
B000XE5260|5|Nice, fresh, crisp smell.  Great value. Bottle &#34;feels&#34; cheap and plastic so nothing great there. I get compliments throughout the day on the smell so I guess its received well.
B0026IFLG2|5|This cream surprised me. I've been using Ponds Cold Cream for years to remove my makeup & that works great. I needed a richer cream in the winter because my face was getting dry in spots. This cream moisturizes well, doesn't leave a greasy feel or look & my makeup goes on very smoothly (foundation) There is a stronger smell than what I was used to, but honestly that doesn't bother me, once it sinks into your skin or you put your makeup on, you don't smell it. Its a good cream, I really like it. Hopefully it does smooth out the small lines or spots on your face like it claims to. But whether it does that or not, its a great cream for winter months! Excellent at night.
B00I3N2I0G|5|Love the smell of the Head & Shoulders Dry Scalp Care with Almond.  It smells so clean and fresh and I have long hair to the middle of my back and it is so thick and course that my scalp can not breath in the summer time which causes my head to itch and have dry flakes, after using this 2 times my dry scalp was cured and I had many compliments on the scent and how full and soft my hair is.  Great product
B0089K4YYG|1|-100
B004530AB2|5|After years of being a blonde my hair was starting to feel the effects (dry, hair breakage etc) My hairdresser recommended Kerastase Oil for my hair, I was rather cynical  about it but thought I'd give it a go anyway......wow. My hair feels like silk after use and this is coming from someone who has very thick hair with years of peroxide damage, still it feels fantastic and smooth after drying. Previously I would dry my hair and due to the thickness of my hair it would end up like a haystack on my head. Pricey but honestly worth every penny. Smells beautiful as well. Top buy!
B001AYY38A|5|Love this product --makes my skin smooth and bright. I have sensitive skin and this is gentle enough for me.
B00JI5JEV4|4|I purchased these brushes, because I wanted some that were of a mid-range roughness for dry brushing my face. I have not tried them, but, judging by the feel of the bristles on my hands, I think these are what I was looking for.
B00JZFB13G|5|Great!
B004OJBLSI|5|Great product!
B00070E8LA|5|I'm glad i spent the extra money to buy this bad boy. I bought Wahl before, andy's and norelco.<br /><br />THIS IS A BADA$$ CLIPPER, VERY WELL BUILT, WORKS LIKE A CHARM, VERY SATISFIED!!!!<br /><br />SPEND SOME EXTRA BUCKS AND BUY THIS ONE!!!
B004NRFAZG|5|Love love love.....lasts a good time. Generous amount of soap! Cleanses well and smells so light and refreshing
B004ZEQYQG|5|LOVE IT!  Love it - love it!  I tried this gloss because it looked cool in the tube.  I bought it as an experiment.  It goes on like a Clear blue.  My BF says it makes me look cold.  Lol.  I will use it up because it still gives me that moist feeling that I like so much in a gloss.  I won't buy this color again - but, I WILL use it up on the days that I don't really care what I look like.
B0065I0UMO|5|I have severe eczema and was looking for something to calm my skin down during these extremely dry months. Nothing helped. I was tired of looking, to be frank. My house looked like a Walgreens branch threw up in it, with all of the lotions and creams.<br />Then I found this. Saw the raving reviews and thought I'd give it a whirl.<br />This is the best cream I've tried yet (and trust me on this- I've tried so, so many). The ultimate plus? It has eucalyptus oil in it, so the entire room smells like a relaxing spa, immediately, once applying it. I love it so much. The scent is the thing that made it official.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended to all those dry-skinned people out there, like me.
B000FS05VG|1|Broke before the one year mark...the cord opened and started on fire
B001A3HPT0|5|Very nice, as expected !
B000X300MC|5|I buy one of these wall mount dryers every time my old dryer is exhausted.<br />I use it everyday and it lasts a long time before replacing it.  I am pleased<br />with its durability.
B00020UQQQ|5|I can see why generations of English Royalty and dignitaries prefer this brand.  This is truly a luxurious shaving cream fit for a King.  Did you know that they found a tub of Truefitt & Hill shaving cream in the ruins of the Titanic?  It's true.  Look on Truefitt's website.<br /><br />Before I used any Truefitt & Hill product, I was kind of skeptical because I previously used The Art of Shaving creams.  Don't get me wrong, The Art of Shaving does a great job of making an excellent cream.  But I must say, you really get what you pay for.  If I had to rate this cream, I would say it is ten steps above The Art of Shaving's products.  And the tub seems to last forever.  I am addicted to the way Truefitt's 1805 smells!  It awakens your senses in the morning.  It is a true pleasure to shave in the morning.<br /><br />As far as lather, this cream creates a thick and fluffy whipped up concoction that leaves your skin smooth and smelling great.  I thought the fragrance would irritate my skin.  It didn't at all.  You may want to try a Truefitt sample pack.  You can purchase it by going directly on their website so that you can sample all of their creams and fragrances. You could use Truefitt's pre-shave oil, but, you may be able to get away with not using it since this is a very moisturizing cream.  The best way I could describe the smell is oceanic and masculine.  After I'm done with my three shave passes, I apply [[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt & Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]] and then [[ASIN:B000YOOJ6I Trufitt & Hill 1805 Cologne]].<br /><br />If you're new to double edged shaving, you may want to pay attention to some other items in my shave rotation.

B000YY7M9E|5|I found this product in a beauty magazine as a great but less expensive night cream.  I replaced my Elemis night cream with the Aveno, and am very pleased.
B0091Q10M6|1|This wig started to tangle and shed the moment I tried it on. Save your money and do not buy it.
B000V87F9U|5|This is the ONLY product that works for my thin, lifeless hair which has no body.  I use it as a styling product.  As I'm using the curling iron in the AM, I lightly spray each section prior to curling it.  When I have all hair curled, I run my hands through it into position and spray with a stronger holding spray....I'm set for the day and since I can only wash my hair every other day, I just comb through it at night and do the process again the next day. After two days it's the perfect \\"dirty\\" effect and I always know I can have a great style when I really need it.  I can't believe how well it works for me and my hair type and how hard it is to find the product on store shelves.  Amazon offers a great price.  I searched long and  hard to find a replacement and couldn't find anything!  Thanks.
B000WHNI2I|3|I had to buy the replacement brush heads since mine fell on the floor and broke. It went down 3 feet and landed on carpet. Who would have guessed it. They are not made very well, especially for the cost! As much as I love my Sonicare toothbrush when these heads run out I will replace the toothbrush...not the heads.
B0002MSSGE|5|veay good!
B000XE6336|5|For some reason, my mom loves this stuff. Whatever.
B00B6L0LJW|5|I found that the item came on time.<br />Was Great Quality at a Low Price.<br />I also like the fact that they are super sharp and look like they will last a long while.
B00IK9LMV4|5|This is the best primer I've ever used so far. I will definitely be buying this from now on. Doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores,  Makeup stays on all day and this hides my pores and fine lines, skin is soft and silky
B001E763NQ|5|I always have used this soap. The macho men in my life,  my husband and grown men sons use it as well and I've given these bars of soap away to friends. It smells good and clean, and does not dry out the skin.  It is long lasting and a great value, but best  yet, it  is enjoyable to use.  For holiday gifts, I put this bar of soap inside a hand knitted wool pouch and give them away for holiday treats.  The sack felts and shrinks as the soap gets wet and soapy.  No soap mess.  It's a built in washcloth, and when the soap is all completely used, it leaves  a little sack or pouch, old fashioned, but nice.  Simple pleasure.
B005FYJCE6|5|Love this lipstick. Super matte. Awesome color. Only need to reapply after eating.
B001C6H6F8|4|Love love love this makeup!  The colors are so bright and a little goes a log ways.  Just wish they were bigger, colors are smaller than a dime but great product!
B002BGWP6S|5|I love this product. It leaves skin feeling soft without being greasy. And I love the soft natural scent and creamy texture. The only problem now, is that I can't find it anywhere and looks like Avon quit selling the whole botanical line.
B0073E7JFK|2|My feet were dry again after two hours I aplied it.
B00PBGQ0SY|5|I absolutely love this razor! It's amazing! It makes things so easy because it turns/moves with the contour of your body while shaving, instead of being stuck in one direction. It's 5 blades get every hair in one glide. It's truly an amazing razor, the best I've tried! I was able to try it for free thanks to Gillette!
B000J14PR4|5|Works great. We use it for a cat's pills and makes short work of crushing them.
B00B60GAUC|4|I really like this product. I really have no problems with smelling or sweating when I use it. The only down sides is that it's wet at first but it dries fast and it gets on my clothes. It does run out sort of fast but I may be using too much at a time. I am buying it again though.  30someweeks was great sending me a replacement order for free when I complained about the first shipment leaking. They were really nice and cared about their service.
B0084710GO|4|Good product
B003XKY57S|5|I love this oil. I wonder why it is quite a bit thinner than other brands I've used. It absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn't have a much fragrance.
B000XR8NPY|5|These smudge sticks are excellent.  With my order I received the two 9' pieces + an additional smaller one as a nice surprise.  The sticks are HUGE & I don't think I'll need to buy more for months if not longer.  I like to burn one small leaf daily & then seasonally I'll light the whole thing for a more thorough smudge.  For those complaining about it being hard to light - I haven't had that problem.  It will burn out tho if you don't keep it moving, but I think that is to be expected.  Overall, this is a great product at a great price.  5/5
B003V249L0|5|I love it. I'm buying another one, 'cuz the dummy here took it to Chile without checking the voltage there first.
B00022UDZI|2|Maybe it was completely a coincidence, but one of my molars developed resorption shortly after I started using this product. I used it again months later (had to have that molar pulled and had a dental implant placed), and my teeth become very sensitive and hurt if I use this product for a couple of days. It does whiten teeth, but I don't want to take any chances with my teeth.
B00152F4OY|5|I LOVE using the product on my long thick, dry, curly hair! I live in a small town and once they stopped carrying this product I was very sad. Determined to find this product on Amazon.com........... Whhhaaallaa I was in luck finding a store front that carries it. My hair is very dry and if I do not use leave in conditioners', my hair looks like a giant birds nest . This product I apply on wet hair and leave it. It is great for dry scalp and repairs dry or damaged hair. I use it once a week, therefore, the 12oz bottle should last me a month or two. The other days I do a regimen of thick leave in conditioner followed by gel and hairspray.
B000YOSI6U|5|This stuff is great if you have a problem with your shirt front gaping and/or pulling open across the bust. A little bit of tape and everything sits flat and stays like that all day.  I do shorten the strips a touch so they fit between buttons.  I haven't had any issues with them messing up my shirts, even after leaving them on through the wash & a low dry. Love the nifty tin too, easy to have handy in your bag.
B006368LYW|5|I have very curly hair, and this product works great to eliminate frizz.  I usually apply it to dry or damp hair just before leaving the house.  It is lightweight, and does not make my hair &#34;crunchy&#34; like most mousse does.  It is expensive, but I think it is worth it and always have it in stock!
B007HD570Q|5|Great product so far!
B002ZNJIJE|4|Good price, nice quality, fits well enough on the little mount that they recommend. I got a different head than pictured. The one I got looks younger and has smaller lips, eyes, nose - but she is cute. The makeup she had was too subtle for my tastes so I colored on her face with Sharpies. The colors held up and did well so far.<br />I got this head to make it easier to maintain my wigs and it works well for that purpose.<br />Head is certainly smaller than a typical caucasian female adult's head.
B00FAEOCP0|2|This mascara does not volumize, as some reviews claim it does.  Good for lengthening lashes.
B002RBF1PO|5|As the number of blades goes up in modern razors, and as the price goes crazy for refills, I thought it would be fun to go back to one of these.  I use a brush and shaving soap now too. It's really enjoyable and the shave is just as good as the new multi blade models.  At first you might cut yourself (get s syptic pencil) but after one week I never cut myself. Probably just learning the parts of my fact to be careful with.
B001G5FOLI|5|AAAA++++
B00367NWGI|1|I bought these wipes because I had heard good reviews on YouTube. About 30 minutes ago I used one to remove my normal make up that I wear and my face is ON FIRE and is REDDER THAN A TOMATO. I would highly suggest to not even try these wipes...seeing that majority of people in these reviews have said the same thing. Stay away...owwwweee. If I could give this product ZERO stars I definitely would.
B00AEKJMN2|3|The product claims to noticeably whiten your teeth within five days.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  After using it for over a week, my teeth were slightly whiter, but nothing too noticeable.  I've listed the pros and cons below.<br /><br />Cons<br />- The biggest downside is what I already stated.  It doesn't noticeably whiten your teeth.  I think this could be used if you've whitened your teeth and want to maintain the results.<br />- Each tube comes with less than .05 oz (.04) to be exact.  That's not a lot of product.  I will say that a small amount seems to go a long way.<br />- The whitening gel and pretreatment come in a convenient tube.  However, when I opened the box a lot of the whitening gel had seeped out of the tube.  It was a little messy and a waste of product.<br />- Usually the main ingredient in these products is peroxide. I couldn't find the list of ingredients that listed the percentage of peroxide.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Comes in convenient tubes<br />- Easy to apply<br />- The pretreatment seems to work.  I brush my teeth with Sensodyne because I have sensitive teeth.  This formula did not irritate my gums at all.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because I think this product may help to maintain whiter teeth; however, I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for an effective teeth whitener.
B003UOBTSA|3|This foundation is ok---I used to use it a lot but honestly I don't think I'm going to buy it again. The issue I have with this foundation is that you have to apply it just right---otherwise it looks &#34;ashy&#34;...especially if you have a darker complexion. You also have to apply a lot to get the coverage you need---so it's cheap enough if you are dying to try it but honestly there are way better foundations out there than this one!
B003YJAZZE|5|This Shaving System is perfect!<br />I never thought that a shaving system could be that good and jentle.<br />I had an older broun system and tryed a philips new one, and both are not even close to this one.
B004DGDBI0|5|Beautiful and well packaged
B003VCZX7E|5|Zapzyt makes 2 different acne washes that look similar. They are both fine, but make sure you are buying what you think you are buying.
B003S17772|5|Brought them for my sister. She loved It! I Love the Asian type of lettering on the box! looked awesome!
B0057MHTAA|5|Cleans well at full strength but I prefer to dilute and use a foam dispenser. Doing this reduces the stinging eyes that can occur.
B0001TJX2Q|5|Great moisturizer for the winter months.
B005DRPQQI|5|Smells heavenly, works like a dream!
B0052JN7XG|5|best investment we've ever made, love to use it and have that fresh from the dentist clean feeling. thank you
B0023XF60Q|5|This stuff is great.  I used to get expensive shaving creams by Gilette and such that didn't do their job.  I would be bleeding badly after shaving my mustache and beard.  Those folks need to be given a shave using their product to see how useless they are.<br /><br />Now that I use shave secret, I would get really nice, close shaves with a mediocre shaver (3-blade) and would have very minor cuts if any.  This has revolutionized my shaving experience.  I bought mine at Walmart to avoid shipping costs.  Thanks for the tip Amazoners :)
B0010ENXSG|3|Moisturizing cream, but the lavender scent is overwhelming and strong.
B00756HQNQ|5|This product works great.  I have had other similar items from the tv ads but this one is far superior.
B008YJBYD6|5|This headband is amazing for the price! My daughter wanted something simple yet elegant for her wedding and this was perfect. I am sure if we bought it in a bridal store it would have cost at least $100. The picture is nice but does not show the true beauty of the piece.
B003IW4AS0|5|Works like a charm. Best results we've seen after trying several products. Took a few months but all of my hubby's scalp flaking has subsided.  Will continue to purchase!
B000TUFLIC|5|Excellent product and speedy delivery. I examined the comb closely to make sure there were no rough edges, as another reviewer mentioned having a problem with this, but the comb is perfect. Thank you.
B000UBN5S8|5|This stuff works really well!
B00ACJI45W|5|I bought it because I thought it was going to be more of a holographic nail polish, but it turns out it IS glitter.<br />I hate using glitter nail polish, but this is an exception to all rules!<br />Gorgeous on my toes!<br />Did one fingernail and couldn't wait to remove it...I need smooth nails because snagging drives me crazy.<br />All in all, given my information, this nail polish is stellar and would probably buy again!
B00EW801V4|3|Good price...long delivery and they let a little light in through the bottom.
B00A8NKWS4|5|Nice quality
B0015SBOLU|1|Unfortunately, the new and improved version falls apart too annoyingly easily. &#34;Rough&#34; side separates from the rest of the round unless you rub gingerly.
B0027JU9A8|5|PPC is a staple for children on the autism spectrum. This is the best results we've seen and it's our first time using this brand.
B00DEX61A8|5|Good lotion for the winter.  Has a touch more greasy feel and staying power then the regular nivea lotion that i use in the summer.  Good product.
B000GCIC52|5|Great medicine in a tiny bottle.
B00FTC6ZBM|5|Leaves skin feeling natural and not greasy like some other sunscreens
B0052333E0|1|Have not received item yet, still waiting. Ordered on nov 26 . And for some reason i lost all my recent orders, says no history
B00196N78Q|5|This scent is terrific! Which is a relief because I usually don't care much for \\"blue\\" scents, often finding them cold and sharp. I was buying it without the benefit of a sniff, purely on the Puma name. Was not disappointed. My inexperienced nose definitely catches a grapefruit-like citrus note with a woodsy undertone.<br /><br />Just found this description for Puma Aqua Man: Aromatic fruity fragrance. Top notes are ginger, pink grapefruit and pepper; middle notes are cyclamen, melon and tomato leaf; base notes are sandalwood, oakmoss and vetiver.
B001ES6XZS|5|Nubian Heritage does not disappoint.  I have bought numerous products and have been beyond satisfied.  Great line of products.
B00005337I|5|I have no complaints about this product!  I have absolutely Thick, Dry & Curly hair which makes it difficult to untangle.  This conditioner settled in and started to work in just 5 minutes.  I could not believe I was able to comb my hair with little resistance...
B008GOR6O0|4|okay product....somewhat fits every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)
B008PEMOV6|3|I've used this brand of electric toothbrush for years.  The battery eventually wears out and I ordered the latest model. But for the first time, the new charger ONLY works in the US.  If you travel a lot and need a multi-voltage charger (110v-220v), you are out of luck.  I don't know why they made this change but it makes the device useless for me.  Odd when all cellphone, computer,etc. electronics chargers are all multi-voltage nowadays.
B00AB4W2H4|4|I really liked this eye shadow. I got the everyday color, I like wearing purples, lavenders, no other colors look good on me. I haven't had any problems with the colors I have used. For the price it's pretty nice. I'm not one that can go spend a lot of money on make up, so when I saw this, I was excited!! I normally buy the maybelline that has the 3 colors. But wanted something that I could play around with other colors but stay close to the colors i use.  It's worth the try, especially if money is tight. I would recommend this :)  I will put a picture of what I got below.
B001QY8QXM|5|For me these provide a great shave and they are a great price. Would definitely recommend them.
B0063GYS7G|5|I use my doggers for everything except going out to an expensive restaurant. I hike in them, I use them for construction work, I use them around the house, in the garden and even going out to the movies. They are supper comfortable, very light weight and durable. They are the lowest cost natural foot wear available. After switching to wearing doggers my foot, knee and ankle problems have greately reduced and mostly gone away.
B0006G8D7A|5|When we were in Hawaii for our 25th anniversary last fall I kept walking into shops smelling this wonderful fragrance.  It just smelled like Hawaii....but whenever I asked what it was I was given different things to smell, which just weren't it.  Or I was told that I was smelling a combination of all the smells, and would just have to smell them.  Well, I finally found a travel kit of Pikake and just loved it.  I had to have it....now whenever I wear it my husband and I remember our trip to Hawaii.  A wonderful trip to remember.It is light, sensual, a wonderful summer fragrance that won't weigh you down.  I highly recommend it.  It took us awhile to find it on line, the stores around here don't carry it.  Buy it....it will be worth it.  The next best thing to a Hawaiian vacation.
B001UE7D32|3|The only great thing about this hair dryer is the size. It is really convenient for taking with you on your travels, but that's about it. It only has one setting for temp/speed- at least one more of either would be really helpful. It is rather loud and the heat is higher than what I like to use on my hair.
B004493F14|3|I really needed the darker color......but I thanked the provider!
B001W2K51O|3|Bought for my wife, she says it worked, but she wasn't really thrilled with the results. It is a little harder to use than regular shampoo and does not lather up as easily. The wife says she would be ok with a product that is a little harder to use of it performed better than her regular shampoo but this bar was no better or worse than regular shampoo in her opinion.
B003RYJF5C|5|for his bday party we got them to go under his shirt and he took them off but our 4 year old loves them haha
B007FFJ7F2|5|This is the only product of proactiv that I use. I started off using all 3 steps as a teenager, but this is the only part of the line I still use. I wash with Mary Kay timewise and use this after. I'm at the in between age of 25. I need to protect my skin, but also need something for acne. This has never dried my skin out, but it isn't super moisturing, so if you have dry skin you might need an additional moisturizer. This really controls breakouts.
B001MA0QY2|5|This heats up quick and doesn't take long for my hair to get straight.  I have medium length layered hair.  The only thing is that any longer and it would hurt my hands/arm to use because of the weight of the tool.  I have problems with my arm.
B001TOUB7I|5|This product was everything it claimed - and just the perfect color for me!  Goes on easily, and stays put all day. I will be ordering it again.
B00132FV8U|5|I could bath in this stuff ..... One of the most refined gentlemanly scents I have used and I have used a lot. Any Pinaud user needs this in their rotation period. Trust me its like a light musk meets the original clubman and out came perfection.
B000OSY0BS|1|I found it expensive for what you get.  Ten ver tiny sticks.  Smells good, but I'll find a better deal elsewhere.
B00BHHRUXU|5|Very nice fragrance. Smooth and engaging. Not overly dramatic or revealing; thus a nice touch of fragrance as the lady walks by.<br />Packaging and shipping was excellent. Product sold at a good/fair price.
B001ET77PC|5|Smells great and no chemicals.  I love this scent as well as the peppermint.  Better deal than buying locally as well.
B00BPGGUUW|4|You can feel it working after you apply it.
B004REGO00|4|OK I bought this in a fit of panic. I am  fair skinned, early 40's,  and always  been told I had had fairly great skin, since I am careful about sunscreen, have used ROC Retin A for years and don't tan,  but lately I have been noticing  that the  wear  was really  starting to show in my face in ruddiness, sagging, redness, fine lines and a tired look. I didn't want to do botox, not my scene,  and I was kind of scared of IPL or lasers, since the $150 I could afford for it  meant it would not be performed by a  Board certified lisenced plastic  surgeon.... so.... I ordered this on semi- impulse,  after some research, then immediately felt like a vain ass.<br /><br />The customer service is NOT very communicative. It took them several  weeks to ship, and they did not offer tracking info until I bugged them for it.<br />When I use it, it makes me feel like an insane vain person as if I am Norma Desmond  in Sunset Boulevard. The lights are bright and it tales a long time to do my whole face.<br />  I would DEFINITELY recommend  using protective eyewear like the kind for sunbeds, to protect your eyes.  The treatment area is large, so its awkward on my nose, for example. I block off  the extra light as best I can with cloth and my hands, but its rather inconvenient. You can sort of read or sort of watch a movie while using it, you can surf the net with it, do emails, I bet lame TV would be good with it, but anything else is kind of a no go.<br />BUT....<br /> It works.<br />I have used it 6 times, with all 3 lights. Apparently its best to use the red first, then the green, so I use blue after. I used it 3X the first week 2 days apart, skipped 5 days because of my crazy work schedule, then used  2X this week, 5 days apart<br /> Anyways  I  noticed a difference after my second use.<br /><br />green light: I used the green light on an age spot that I had on my chest, and it is fading- slowly, but noticibly. It's not gone all the  way but I expect it will be soon. My fair skinis getting very even toned and just radiant. A lot of the facial blotchiness I had  is  leaving.  I feel like I can use less makeup now.<br /><br /> red light :<br />I have seen my forehead wrinkles and the line between my eyebrows  lessen considerably.  Like 3-4 years taken off.<br />I am not seeing so much change in the lines around my eyes, but perhaps it will take more time.<br /> I have been using on my jawline and I see an improved jawline, less sagging. It is subtle, probably others would not notice it, but I notice it.<br />I have some broken capillaries but they are not changing so far, if they do I will update.<br />Overall my face is starting to look plumper and more youthful.<br /><br />Blue light- I have dry skin so its not much of an issue for me, but I had the occasional hormonal pimple and my pores were getting larger with age. But wow the blue light works on  the pores so they become invisible. Hormonal breakouts are ZAPPED. If I had oily skin this would be great.<br /><br /> So- yes I felt vain and crazy using it, and  yes the changes are subtle, probably others would not notice them- yet. But I know I look better and I am curious to see  how it will work over more time. The results persist, like I didn't do it for 5 days, but the results lasted. I will update later if I get more action from it.<br />I am not giving it 5 stars since the customer service is so  bad, and I haven't  had it for long enough to get super dramatic results.<br /><br />Like right now I'd say I feel better its a nice personal  thing,  Its definitely boosting my confidence, I think its taken like 2 years off so far but no one else is telling me I look amazing.<br />If I can remove my age spot with it, and I see more facial improvements over time, i will revisit this review and let you know.<br /> ALSO FYI I don't use product on my face when I use it, just bare clean skin, I do use a vitamin C serum after  and  ROC Retin A on days I don't use it  and had no ill effects,I actually  feel like they all enhance each other.<br /> Hope this helps.  I am NOT a shill I am a real person. (-:
B00L4EX7XS|5|Because the main ingredient is witch hazel the smell is terrible. But I feel like my skin has brightened after using this product.
B004Z209HS|5|I've used both Moroccan oil and One n Only Argan oil and I have to say that Pura d'or is my favorite.  I wanted an organic product I could use on my face and hands and this is working beautifully.  I've only been using it for 3 days and I can already tell the difference it has made in my hands.  I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave an oily residue like lotion.  Highly recommend!
B00HREXHGQ|5|Tried them all...this is the best!!
B008HODSUU|1|Very very very thin, you put every piece in and it still is thin. I have ,any extensions and this is by far the worst one
B005AZNS72|5|GREAT AS EXPECTED.....
B00IAADWJ8|5|Helps my permed hair grow and heals and protects my scalp.
B0076OMYBQ|5|This is the only product I can use for my curly hair that helps with frizz & gives me soft curls!  Without this product I wear my hair straight. Love this product!
B0007V6PK6|5|I used this religiously my entire pregnancy and voila I only have 2 teeny tiny stretch marks! And while I don't know if the butter or genetics helped, it certainly didn't hurt!
B001U2KTHQ|5|I had burning mouth for almost a year and now just chronic dry mouth.  I have been using Biotene spray and mouthrinse, but the effects are gone too soon.  I recently ordered Xylimelts and Salese.  The Salese work, but leave a bit too much slime in my mouth and the flavor is too strong.  The Xylimelts on the other hand are wonderful!  Very mild taste and works in a subtle way so my mouth feels moist but not slimy.  I can easily talk and read out loud while using one of these.  They last about 40-60 minutes for me, but that's a huge improvement over the 5 minutes of relief with Biotene.  I am ordering more of these.
B004I6J4E0|5|Best Cologne. Been using it for 20 years
B004667U3Y|5|Brand new, great quality. Great for displays! Great price too!
B00DGW4L1S|5|Have used it in the past, found it to work very well and a good value.  Helps reduce friction when wearing shoes, especially when diabetic.
B00L5E81WY|1|I have been dying my hair for 35 years. this burned the heck out of my scalp and the fumes were hideous.  I had to bail out after 2 minutes.  This wasn't the normal scalp tingle, this was full-on someone threw furniture stripper on my head burn.  I have a chemical burn on my cheek from where this product dripped down my face.<br />Stay away from this product.  It deserves no stars, but a star rating is required.
B000P22TW0|5|As expected
B002CMLS14|5|Great smell
B00374THM8|5|I've always liked this lotion, and although it's not as thick as it used to be, it really absorbs well and is great for my skin.  I like it better than costlier products.
B003TJCVGK|5|I'd really love this product because after I'd washed my hair and applied the 2-minute conditioner and rinsed my hair. My hair softened instantly and my nappy hair had ULTRA manageability and I'd was able to style it with great EASE!!!
B000GCLRF4|5|Love these...will definitely buy again.
B00COX5UPQ|5|Very concentrated so only need a few drops to create lovely strong smell.  Very good quality.  Will definitely order again.  Thank you!
B007ZC4VGU|5|The absolute best cream made. Soaks into your skin and keeps it moist. Good from your nose to your toes.
B000C1UEY4|5|WONDERFUL!  Best price ever. No sooner placing my order and it arrived in my mailbox.  Great service for a beautiful fragrance. Thx Amazon--will order again & again!!
B003PGFD1M|5|I have been using this product for a few years and I love the way it makes my skin feel. Goes on very smooth, never greasy. No harsh chemicals.
B008ZBS8GY|5|my hair along my hairline grew after how many years...i recommend this to anyone with itchy scalp and wants healthy hair
B00EUG8S4U|4|It is good! But it is too small for my heavy hair. It is cute and easy to bring with.
B00EOAZZXO|5|I used to be a Mitchum girl - you know that deodorant that's &#34;so strong you can even skip a day.&#34; When I realized the toxins and aluminum in that stuff should be avoided I switched to the Crystal. That worked pretty well - didn't last as long and if I dropped it (which seemed to happen frequently it would crack and chip and and jagged edges don't feel good under your arm.<br /><br />I've tried Tom's with tea tree oil (who needs to sweat that stuff starts out stinky!) Lavilin - a gooey mess. I tried an all-natural, organic, made with essential oils version made by a lovely woman at the farmer's market - smelled good in the tube but was not effective for me. I even tried making my own with coconut oil and baking soda (which are 2 of the ingredients of Green Tidings) but it was kind of messy and burned my skin.<br /><br />Green Tidings got it right. It took a few days of consistent use but now it's as effective as Mitchum. Honestly, I can skip a day and don't notice any smell. I even seems to reduce sweating which is a bonus.<br /><br />Be careful though - it is an oil base and I did notice some discoloration under the arms of a couple blouses. I've found that if I shower at night and apply this before bed I don't need to re-apply in the morning. And my then the oil has absorbed into me or my pj's and isn't an issue any more.
B008PEMOV6|5|I've been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years. This is the third version, purchased it primarily for travel so I could have one on the road - It's become the main unit and I travel with the older one. Teeth feel clean and my dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth were on the last visit.
B001MS7H14|5|You might have to occasionally put it on if you're out sweating in the humidity or during a hot day. Other than that, I've only ever needed to apply this on once. It lasts all day, but it doesn't reduce shine. You'll have to use powder for that. The skin on my face is sensitive and this product doesn't irritate my face whenever I use it. It makes my face look amazing! I've recommended this product to my twin sister and she uses it during her make up routine now and she loves it!
B00FVGS3W0|3|initially loved it but brushes fell apart 4 months later.
B00DA9ZM2O|5|absolutely am in love with this palette!!! it's sooooo pigmented and the colors are just drop dead gorgeous!! looks great on lots of skin tones and some of the blushes serve well as a highlighter also! this is perfect for someone who would like to add to their makeup kit..
B0001MBRYK|5|This is the best trimmer I have used, it does exactly what it claims it will do. And no cord and no batteries with no noise<br /><br />Well thought out product
B006K3ONSQ|5|One member of the household prefers this shampoo over all the others we've tried. This low priced basic 2-in-1 works for a variety of hair types and performs well. The scent is pleasant and mild. The shampoo rinses out easily and is attractive in color and feel. Good basic product that often gets used by other family members when we run short of the trendy brands. Love this product.
B004QNIC1G|5|I love, love, love this stuff. I have told everyone I know about it and they all love it too. It has cleared up my acne along with my teenage daughters and son's face. I used it on my sunburn and it took the stink and pain out...which was great (for this very fair skin lady). I also had some recent surgery with some large scars and it worked really well to help the scars heal nicely. This is great stuff, we now use it for any and all skin irritations at our house. This product is so worth trying!
B004EBFY70|3|I like the fact that the razor head is small, but I haven't quite fallen in love with this tool yet. I'm having a hard time trying not to &#34;scrape&#34; my skin up just to shave some minor hairs underneath my eyebrows. Maybe it takes more practice... I'm not saying it's a bad product, but I'm also not saying it's my favorite ;)
B000NE2W6I|5|II have used the John Paul Bright shampoo for the past few years, and love it. Her coat comes out fluffy white; the final look is comparable to the look her groomer gives her. Product came within two days of order. Seller is fast and efficient!
B00C41DHGW|5|This product is definitely worth buying. Totally water and smude proof! A little difficult to remove, but that's the point.
B000JL7WQK|2|the scent didn't last very long for the price it smells better in the lotion form and last a lot longer
B00139FCVO|1|Feel free to purchase this product if you absolutely must, but understand that as of the date of this review, M.A.C. doesn't manufacture cream eyeshadows.    This isn't a matter of this palette not being real M.A.C. eyeshadows; it's about the fact that cream shadows don't even exists as an option to purchase from M.A.C.
B008SYXJU8|5|This brush makes it so easy to apply gel liner.
B002VBTNA4|2|I'm used to Kevin Murphy shampoo having a lot of sudsing action!  This shampoo has virtually none.  I hope it's not watered down or a fake.
B000F5KFZU|5|I used to use the Taylor of Bond St. shaving creams but was sick of being stuck with a strong smell until I finished it up.  The Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream is has a mild fragrance (there is some, it's not completely unscented), but I will take it versus being overpowered by the fragrances of Taylor of Bond St.  It's also a bit thicker so it lasts a really long time.
B000JNQSIQ|5|These things pack a lot of power for the price.<br />I have thick hair that grows fast and needs to be clipped often to keep up with the hairstyle that I like, these are great.
B001AMRQ2W|3|I think the multiple floating head concept is way over rated in that my first Norelco, many years ago, cut about the same as this one.  I do not like the grip on this model as much as another model I presently have.  The charge does hold for a long period, however, a warning that batteries were nearly expired would be ideal, rather than simply dying in the middle of a shave.
B004INQ65S|5|Right before I bought this, I had purchased a Paul Mitchell straightener from a beauty supply store and hated it. So, I spent a few bucks on this cheapy one and LOVE it. It is slim, heats up quick and only requires one or two passes max. I can dig it.
B002NGMEVM|1|Very disappointed...no steam ....as was advertised. Would not recommend to anyone.  Very disappointed . Watched the video, used distiller water still did not perform as was advertised.
B002QI2TPI|4|Like the way it sticks.  Just a little need a little lighter color.
B00K0LUGKI|5|This shampoo lived up to expectations. I will buy again for sure. I could do without the heavy perfume smell, though. Thank goodness it dissipates within a couple of hours.
B0001EKRYO|3|I had a facial back in 2012 at this boutique spa in Denver and the anesthetician recommended I try this product to help with my inflammed acneic cysts. I thought she was just trying to upsell me because I had bought the service as a promotional coupon and was paying half the price. I decided to buy the product anyway because I thought &#34;why not&#34; if it works, then it would be a good investment. I think I paid close to $30 USD for this at her salon which was totally fine because I realized that it really does work. I use it primarily as a spot treatment and find that it does a good job drying out my pimples although if I use it too much I can end up with a bit of a red, dry irritated spot.<br /><br />I needed to find a replacement and while searching online I came across the exact one on Amazon. I ordered it and was very excited as it was a little cheaper and it seemed hard to find. When I received I compared it to the product that I had bought at the salon and it seemed a bit different in consistency. The packaging was almost identical and the smell of the product was the same but the one I received from amazon was a lot thinner. The one that I had bought from the salon was thicker and much more effective at drying out my pimples. I'm not sure if I received a defective product, but I still have both the one I purchased from the salon and the one I ordered and try to alternate them when a pimple pops up.<br /><br />This does last a long time and if you get the right product, you are sure to get great results - at least as a spot treatment!
B00I6E9QE8|5|Love it.
B0037YHF2C|5|This stuff is fantastic! I'm purchasing my second bottle today. Apparently I have enormous mutant oil glands because within an hour of cleansing I can run my finger down my face and it's like an oil slick! Despite my overclocked oil production my cheeks and forehead can get flaky and dry, so I can't eliminate moisturizer altogether. A few months ago I picked this up and couldn't be happier. It's cool and soothing and relieves that tight feeling right after washing my face. My skin feels a lot less greasy and I've noticed a drastic reduction in flakiness in my dry areas. This product is great to tuck into your bag for use throughout the day, especially in hot summer or for dry indoor heat in winter. Just a quick spritz really wakes you up and makes your skin look fresh and dewy, not oily.
B00G0K6ZQC|5|I decided to try this out as a sport duffle. It readily holds my change of clothing, toiletries and and random items in the main compartment, which measures 20x10x10 inches, more than enough space (largely than a backpack). I can also squish some food shopping in there too on the way home.<br /><br /> I can put squash balls, a notebook and pen in the zippered side pocket. That measures about 8x8 inches.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out what the empty sleeve on the opposite side to the zippered side pocket does, but the notes say it is a &#34;luggage sleeve to slip onto a roller bag.&#34; ** Oh I see now, the sleeve could indeed fit over the pullman handle of a roller bag.<br /><br />When I ordered this, I had not quite figured out how it would replace my backpack as I ride to the gym. But the handles fit over my shoulders OK as a mock backpack. I think this will save daily wear and tear on my nice backpack, which is overkill to use as a gym bag.<br /><br />Colors are attractive, and I can readily see using this stuffed into its pouch and taking it on short or long trips to haul stuff back. Nice colors and design too! The navy and red work well together.<br /><br />It says &#34;wipe clean&#34; so I guess you can't throw it in the washer ... oh wait, this is made of recycled plastic bottles so wiping clean ought to work fine.<br /><br />The maker, Blue Avocado, is a group of three women entrepreneurs, friends and sisters, in Austin, Texas. Good going! They have lines of travel gear, shopping totes and storage items, and kid's lunch carriers.
B00RNKKXN4|2|Poor quality of product. Packaging was falling apart. Colors were not as shown. Came on time though.
B000CNKC6M|5|Perfect!
B00CH1BRAW|5|great product
B005UKZAJG|5|This product goes everywhere I go. Everything I need is in one package. My daughters and I travel alot and this is so convenient. All my outfits are accompanied by the beautiful colors of this make up kit. This product goes along way and has lasted me a long long time. If you are wondering if you need it. Dont think twice...this is another must have Shany product!
B0097RNAVI|5|I love the highlighter in this unique kit.  a great buy.
B002VAPHXW|5|Awesome product and fast shipping :)
B00KTZB7JY|5|These are fantastic ! They are very much like the (wsp #43 human hair ) but just thicker .they apply so well and stay on for a week if so be it . From corner to corner these lashes do not come up at either corner like most . You can wear mascara but do not need with these . Love them !!
B00BCU5POI|5|good
B000PUU8K2|5|I have a long-term sagging eyelid on one eye. As I got older (now 57) the situation got worse--sagging so bad you couldn't see the lower half of the eyelid. I looked like I was half asleep.    Saw this at Avon site and decided to try it when it was on sale.  After a few weeks of use, I could see the whole eyelid! It was like magic!!     I'm only using the gel now on my upper lid and brow area (I have another brand of eye serum for under my eyes) and I believe the price is worth it. At Avon it's about $30, so I check back from time to time and when it is on sale price, I stock up. You only need a little of the gel or cream each use, so it lasts a long time.
B005N7YHGS|4|Takes a while to heat up. I have short extremely fine hair so it is hard to curl. This keeps the iron off the scalp and is easy to use with the brush. I don't mess with my hair much, I am 79 years old, with a few twists here and there looks ready for day. I am not sure this would do thick hair. It gives me the bit of body I need and some control.
B00240UWGG|5|Awesome floss. The only kind I use. It's not too thin so it won't hurt fingers but does a great job cleaning.
B00538TSMU|5|These lashes last longer than the ones I buy in retail stores. Worth it
B000TAE0RK|5|Good product.
B007IONAR6|4|Pretty color similar to gelish water field. It's very pretty and sparkly. It went on my swatch stick fine. I also gave this one to a friend because I have one just like it .
B0068UZBHS|5|Love these soap saver for my bar soaps.  I used to use a soap dish for my soap and it would get used quickly.  My soap in these soap savers lasts me anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks depending on the type of soap.  I am the only one using this soap, so in a family with more users you might use more soap.  I love this 4 pack, I use one in my showers at home and then one for traveling.
B00M1BPL5A|2|I have lots of fine wavy hair that is just below my shoulders.  This product did not work for me.  There are only 12 curlers provided in the kit which was not enough to curl all of my hair.  You have to use very small sections in order for your hair to fit into each of the rollers.  Thus, I had to separate my hair into three different sections in order to curl my entire head.  The rollers are not easy to put in and when you &#34;clip&#34; them shut there is a mark left on your hair from the hard plastic casing the silicone roller is inside.  I bought these because they seemed easier to put in and less damaging to the hair.  They are a struggle to put in and very time consuming.  The curls produced by these curlers are pretty enough, but not worth the time and effort.
B000X2FPXC|5|Great product!
B0001435F2|4|Color is really good.
B0013CSGBE|5|I love it!
B004EB5C6I|5|I really LOVE these mints.  I have always had a problem with my teeth easily getting cavities and started a dental hygiene routine that would hopefully help reduce these.  Part of the routine is xylitol several times a day.  I started out with these and loved them but thought they were so expensive.  When I reordered I ordered a cheaper brand and wow...what a mistake.  I have gone back to these and will not be going with any other brand.  They have a great flavor, great texture, and easy access bottle.  I love everything about them and highly recommend them.
B001IA0PCY|1|Told me the hq2 would work and it fits with a scraping sound in use. too much bother to return.<br /><br />sw
B0031NRC86|5|I am in my mid 40s and was regretfully a sun worshipper so my skin is wrinkly and porous for my age. This is my 2nd container of the Retinoid pads. After spending lots of time researching skincare found some great reviews on the Miracle Worker set which includes these pads and concentrate and cream kit. This purchase here was only for the pads. I feel like although it cant get rid of my deep wrinkle lines, it is smoothing out my skin and the texture and I have tried tons of skincare lines! I bought this retinoid separately bc I ran out of this piece first but use this in conjunction with the other 2 pieces that go along with the Miracle Worker set (concentrate and cream). You use at night- first the retinoid pads on clean skin, then a small amount of the concentrate and top it off with the moisturizer. I will continue to buy all of these items again-they feel great on my skin and seems to be helping. A tip to make these pads last that I got from someone else. When you get this you have to pour the retinoid solution onto the pads the very first time. Before doing this I cut the pads in half and it works perfectly so rather than lasting only 60 days worth I get 120 and it is plenty! I even use on my neck and hands before discarding the pad.
B00TKS5Y3Q|5|Great product - sharp and well made.
B008BA80H6|4|The smell is a little earthier than I wanted, but it still smells good and has a relaxing scent. It's a good quality oil.
B002IY58SA|5|I love body butters.  My legs can get dry and irritated, so I'm always looking for a heavy-duty moisturizer to calm them down.  Whish does the job!<br /><br />This lotion is almond scented.  I've used other almond scented products that were overpowering and unpleasant, in my opinion.  This body butter has a light almond scent and smells wonderful.  I'm not a super-nutty person, but I like it.  A lot.<br /><br />This lotion is thick.  It's not as thick as other body butters I've used, but it's got a heavy, whipped feel.  It goes on easily and absorbs without leaving my skin feeling greasy.<br /><br />This is a great body butter!
B00JQHXJA6|2|This does not smell like the body spray and reminds me more of a smell similar to hand soap.
B00DGGC0LW|5|Love this Wig!  It feels like human hair...soft to the touch.  I have received so many compliments on it!  I does shed so be prepared for that.
B006TCS79O|5|this is by far the best touch-up
B001DMQ6BG|5|I have thinning hair and this stuff works great. The label doesn't tell you to massage the spray into your scalp, but that's what I do, and my style lasts and lasts. This is a great product.
B001E6UT6O|1|I had terrible luck with this conditioner.  I selected the Persimmon and Rose Geranium Conditioner because I need decent moisturizing in my conditioner.  I've got long, thick hair, and it definitely needs an effective conditioner.  This particular conditioner is clearly not it.  If this is the moisturizing conditioner I can't imagine what the lighter ones are like.  This barely conditioned my hair at all.  It left it tangled and feeling like straw.  When I got out of the shower I could barely get a comb through my hair.  Needless to say, I won't be using this again.  If you only need light conditioning it might be worth giving this a try, because it really does smell wonderful, but it isn't very strong at all.
B0001MROQA|5|I ordered this because of the heat settings and cool tip design. My only reservation was that I really wanted a ceramic barrel, and this one was gold.<br />I am glad I went ahead with it. The weight is good, but not so heavy that my hands would tire. Barrel and clip mechanism are very smooth, so my long hair never gets tangled up in it. Overall it just feels like a great quality product. As final confirmation, I was in an expensive salon and saw that this was the curling iron they actually had for sale.<br />Love it so far!
B001330XFA|5|Great
B0009QZYLU|4|In 2 bleaches with 30 vl. developer it lifted my dyed black hair very well. Was expecting my hair to be pretty dark still but its pretty light now. the only downfall of this product is its VERY flaky. Not sure why but after its on for awhile you'll have a million white dots of bleach everywhere. Creates a real mess but other than that I really enjoy it. :)
B00ACK7FVU|2|I bought it because several reviewers said that it works great with their long hair. Not so with mine! I'm not sure if our definitions of &#34;long&#34; are different, but my hair goes down to about my waistline and I have to frequently readjust this clip since it won't stay in place for long. One good thing that I did notice is that wearing it all day did not give me a headache as some other clips have,
B000Z4U9S4|5|great product. too bad they have taken it out of circulation.hope they have a replacement soon for this great product.
B007N8WTLK|5|I have been using this blush for quite a few years.  It's harder to find but it lasts a long time.  I hope when I need it again I can find it!
B00DRFGKCM|5|Very good product.  I like it very much.
B003TJI3EO|3|Goes on great but I'm not a fan of the smell. I put it on before bed so I have plenty of time to let it dry.
B001T0HHBK|5|It is hard to use. But it is good. I do not know is it harmful for hair or no? Please tell me about that.<br /><br />Thanks a lot,
B004BS0RGO|3|I bought this thinking it was going to be something special since I love Bella Pierre.  This is basically cheap cheap cheap glitter.  Try NYX instead.  Cheap on Ulta.com.
B00OTAZGYM|4|it was ok I'm the powder is really good in the liquid but the brush is too small I love the filers everything else it was just a brush
B000P20U80|5|this item was for my son, he loves this cologne and does all the ladies.  LOL<br />a little pricey but he likes this product very much
B000C1Z3J0|1|I normally buy this perfume from Macy's but they didnt have any in stock in the large bottle. I am so mad about this bottle that i piurchased from this website. It is not the same color as the bottles i normally buy, it looks like it is watered down. The scent doesnt even last!
B00JNO3UHO|4|These are good tools. I wouldn't put it as top quality but serviceable. the case is to tightly packed and a bit hard to work with.
B0033EUIO8|5|Best clipper ever.  Oversize and well-made.
B0019701RU|5|Good price and it arrived on schedule.<br />I have used that a few times and It worked without any problems.<br />It is not clear in the instructions, but I think is a good idea to oil the blades before first use. After I oiled the blades for the first time the product worked much better.<br />It vibrates a lot, but not to a point to bother me.<br />You regulate the power turning a screw and for me that is a little awkward.
B009GWHMHC|1|Messy appearance upon arrival.  Does not maintain shape.
B001AXOYFS|5|Great product and doesn't overwhelm you with its fragence!Good Buy.Would definitely recommend to anyone, fast shipping,reasonable price, I would like to find it in a splash bottle.
B0015KDGZ0|3|I had this flat iron for a whole year and absolutely loved it. But almost exactly a year later it shorted out or something and i can't use it anymore. I think other people have had this problem as well. so if you don't mind buying a new straightener next year, this really is a good purchase.
B002EN3OAE|5|My family uses this soap for our faces.  We love it and it has improved my skin tremendously.  I have adult acne and this has helped clear my skin on my face.  It doesn't leave my face feeling dry or oily but just smooth.  I really like this product and wish I had this to use when I was a teen.  It is affordable and does what it says it will do.  The only problem is it is hard to find this product in local stores.
B00688YZBI|5|Amazing. I must have used too much at first because I am already almost completely out of it.<br />My skin is smother and younger looking!  I need to re-order!
B0081CWUD4|4|I have been using this product for a little over a month now, the first use didnt go so well but after a week and a half i loved it, now i just really like it. Funny thing is that the reason i dont like it as much is that its really doing its job. I have been wanting to try a sulfate and paraben free shampoo and just couldn't bring myself to spend the money on Wen so i decided on this. Im glad i did because it seems to do a good job at cleaning my hair and defiantly keeps it moisturized but the longer i used it the more often i have to use it. With shampoo i washed my hair every 3-4 days, the first 3 times i used this was the same but the longer i used it it seemed my hair was getting heavy and oily on day 2 and my scalp starts to itch like crazy if i try to go more than 2 days without using this. I believe this is from the fact that this product does not strip the oils from the hair like shampoo and the longer i use it the more oil is accumulating, so it actually is doing what it is suppose to do. I have chin length a line cut and 6 pumps is more than enough, i went overboard and used 8  pumps the first time and it was way too much. One major difference i have noticed is that bed head is almost an impossibility since i have started using this. I can wake up quickly run a brush through my hair and it falls right into place without needing to spray with water. My hair also feels much softer after use and smells wonderful!!!
B00DBRVKUI|4|My pores are smaller since using this product and it also helps with oil control. Using it along with the wonder pore toner works amazing. The beauty about this, is that  unlike many American brands Étude does not irritates the skin and helps it improve.
B00BLDSWCS|5|This stuff is amazing!  I love how soft my hands are now!  It came in a timely fashion and in an adorable little gift box...perfect for giving it to my mom for mother's day!
B00JZP0XBC|4|Ends began to fray around 4 weeks or so even though I took care of them. Might have to throw them away soon
B00GJXGMSQ|3|Like pictures!
B00GTAJB78|3|I do not feel that I can give a good review. 7 days is not long enough. It is a clear product. Goes on easily. Have not noticed any coloration difference. Does not irritate.
B002LE8PCS|4|The Cortex clipless iron itself works great: It gets SUPER hot and the swivel stick avoids tangles. The results are FANTASTIC: Your hair gets beautifully smooth and shiny, and the curls stay for much longer than if you'd used a regular clip iron.<br /><br />Having said that, note the following:<br />- If you've never used a clipless iron before, it's very different from using a typical, clipped curling iron. You must use technique to curl your hair correctly, and you must be especially wary of burning yourself.<br />- The thermal glove that comes with this Cortex curling iron is almost useless-- the iron is so hot that it'll still burn and hurt right through the glove.<br />- There is no temperature control on this iron, so it's either OFF or full-blast, SUUUUUPER-hot ON! If you have delicate hair, this curling iron may smooth it in the short-run but will probably damage and dry out your hair in the long-run if you use it often enough and without a product to protect against heat.
B004UB20FS|5|This product, the primer and the Hi-Def powder in warmth were suggested to me by my aesthetician because of my combination skin.  I tend to get a very oily T-zone and feel like makeup slides off that area in a short amount of time.  I go through face blot papers like there's no tomorrow!  Complicate that with my dry areas (I live in a very dry climate) and it is a nightmare picking a foundation.  I have tried high end foundations and had pretty much quit wearing it all together because I was so discouraged.  I received this and promptly packed it for my recent business trip to south Texas where it was 100 degrees F with high humidity.  I was hot and miserable but I could not believe how well this foundation held up!!  Coupled with the primer and Hi-Def powder, these products gave me great coverage, evened me out, and kept the shine under control.  I highly recommend!
B00AEUNJPY|3|This is overall a nice product, but it does leave my skin dry.  I have been looking for a shaving product that won't dry my skin further, and this didn't do it for me.  But the positives are that it does smell nice, lathers nicely, and is not too thick.  And a little goes a long way.  I also have sensitive underarms, and to combat that, I just use the same amount that I would use for my legs.  Again, I use such a tiny amount per application that this isn't an issue.  Not bad, but I am looking for something more moisturizing.
B00BFEKOR4|3|Works great.. I used it for stretch marks and it does cover them really well. However it rubs off under cloths. If it didn't rub off it would be an amazing product!!
B005DWJFFQ|5|Worked well with my flexi rods for perfect curls with no ends sticking out.
B00SMIIR0W|4|I have officially become a fan of this TrimStyle razor. I especially loved the soapy stuff that forms when water is added to it. it didn't cut me at all, and I could shave hard to reach places that I couldn't do with a regular stick razor. what I liked most though, is that you can use it in the shower and water will not ruin the battery inside, because the seal for the battery compartment is very tight.
B006W9K2OM|2|Ok, but a watered down version of a much better product I purchased locally.
B000V76ANI|5|This sunblock went on easy and did the job in the hot Texas sun. I will buy it again. It was thick enough so I felt my child was covered but it went on easily.
B00820YEDY|5|My other half thought he loved Chanel #5 or #19... or possibly #22 but couldn't remember which number it was that he liked. This is  a great way to test a perfume to make sure it agrees with your body chemistry prior to spending the $75-200 buck for something that smells like ode de pasture. Apparently, it wasn't any of the numbers that he liked... it was Allure. ... well he got the Chanel part right. The testers came perfectly packaged so they wouldn't break open.
B0050PZ0SW|5|I like this for my mixed kids hair...but the quantity is not enough. Mix kids have a lot of hair...and I have two, so buying this at 50 bucks it not budget friendly. I wont buy again..too expensive.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Excellent product works great!
B00EB7UCVK|4|The scents are lovely and the feel is nice. My two year old loves balms and I feel good about her using this product. The only downside to these balms is the longevity. Frequent application  is necessary .
B00406ZIBQ|1|Sick, you are putting dead baby parts on your face! Don't do it! Just stop! Everything about this is wrong. Eat food that is unprocessed and organic and wear sunscreen. Duh!
B007QRBICO|1|worst quality I have ever bought in the US. The top is so sharp that it hurts people who uses it.
B0002TSD08|5|Wife loves them, thinks they are the best around, got them shipped to Australia via family.<br />First set busted because she used with a cheap transformer, now she uses them with a Seven Star SF500 step down transformer.
B000NPWQU4|5|This product goes on easy and works well on my fair skin.
B0030E6UR0|5|Used this for several years but have recently gone to the Ubiquinol form of CoQ10 after reading several articles comparing the  absorbing capability of conventional ubiquinone CoQ10 vs ubiquinol CoQ10 with regard to health status and age of individual.<br /><br />http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2007/jan2007_report_coq10_01.htm
B00NR1YQFE|4|I like this cleanser.  It has a silky texture with little microbeads for gentle scrubbing, and a little is all that is required.  It cleans well, has a pleasant not-overpowering scent and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.<br /><br />It does not seem to cause blemish problems despite what someone speculated.  I normally have problems with &#34;adult acne&#34; and it hasn't been an issue.
B00CPYXFLU|4|They look real. They broke after 2 months of wearing them. Ears start to hurt after some hours of wearing. I was satisfied with the price.
B003GE49A4|5|Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year
B00Y0BY3GC|1|im not at all satisfied the fibers got all over my eyes and it is a horrible product over all
B00M1E5F1W|1|The RQ12 heads were great.  These new replacements for the RQ12 are anything but deserving of the &#34;+&#34;.  They are cheap feeling, yet more expensive than the old heads that lasted forever and gave a super clean shave without pulling hairs. After one week of using the RQ12, I've moved on and bought a different razor.  Philips / Norelco does not deserve any more of my money for producing this garbage.
B000S858FG|5|Love the glass bottle - much more stable storage. DMSO is the best kept secret in the medical industry. I use this regularly.
B004I788UK|5|I bought it for my friend. She said it was worthy!
B00NN07IMW|4|Very satisfied.
B00T4233F4|5|Will be ordering again. This product came in perfect condition it looks like the real deal even the pigmentation is great. It took about 3 weeks to come in all I can say is I'm very impressed.
B00FZE0WVI|5|I order another brush like this one that both came from the docooler line and they both arrive today 2 weeks early then its originally date. I actually thought the brush was going to be a little bit longer then it looks in the picture but its actually a little smaller then expected however i still really like it. The bristles are very sturdy and soft on my skin and it apply my foundation very smoothly. :)
B000VHDYWI|5|This is a great product....worth every penny.  Keeps arm comfortable and secure and attaches very easily to wheelchair.
B007NHCQQE|4|It is a very good product, comparing  to the original ivory, this one is better. The smell is very good. i have used original and this one and both are great.<br /><br />I am the only one who uses this soap at home and this soap finishes very fast.
B0034GLUK6|5|I was so happy to find one of my favorite products and wrapped so lovely , and it really works<br />  Joanna Green
B005FCBB7E|5|For years I have been receiving these from my dentis when I get my teeth cleaned. But I fould I needed more to do a really good job.
B005GLPPTY|5|Love this perfume and I received it on time. Thanks.
B0029P64UO|3|Kinda small!!
B00FMVRT8I|5|I have to agree with H.H. review; why is this item so over-priced? This type of business should be frowned upon! I will never purchase items from a vendor that price-gauges! It's bad enough the gas stations do it, I'll be damn if I do it over some make-up!<br /><br />Other than that, it's a very good product!
B00AI12A2C|5|I have had this cologne in my collection since I was in college several years ago.  It's the one cologne that has that evokes the ocean/nautical theme to it.  The cologne is definitely effective once it settles after a couple of hours.  It has a medium tone to it so it's not really light but not bold like a musk cologne.  It's the kind of cologne that is great for wearing to the office or going out to a social event.  Be prepared for many compliments when you wear it.
B004LE0YW0|1|It was nearly impossible to remove the product from its packaging.  It took 20 minutes, using a kitchen knife.  Then it was very difficult to open the battery compartment to install the batteries.  I had to use a rubber jar opener.  Highly recommend you try another R rand of facial brush.  All of them had similar ratings.
B00JBUT6A0|3|I like it, but I have had it for 2 wk. and have already broke the top. I get a lot of complements and asking where did I find it.
B00005JTW8|5|I have been using this moisturizer for years.  Let you in on a secret... I used to be a makeup and skin specialist for one of the most expensive lines.  This moisturizer has kept my skin supple and I am over 60!  No wrinkles!
B000I2P9KG|5|My wife has used this for over twenty years and we never tire of it. It is her signature fragrance. It was a good value.
B0084HCIHY|5|This happened to arrive the day after I had been cleaning overgrown brush from a vacant lot & came in contact with cedar resin which caused a horrible itchy rash all over my arms & legs. After trying calamine lotion, vinegar, baking soda, cortaid & allegra anti-allergy creams, I finally decided to apply this shea butter to calm my raw, sore, swollen arms. The relief was wonderful! The itching stopped almost completely and the healing process was accelerated by moisurizing my skin with this natural product (I know this because I did not apply it to my legs & they took much longer to heal). The smell was pleasant and although solid in the tub, the shea butter spread very easily after it came in contact with the warmth of my hand. I used this many times a day for 3 weeks and still have almost a full container left. I will definitely purchase this product again!
B001CBBXUM|4|I love the colors of this pencil. They are not overwhelmingly shiny or bright, but make your eyes really stand out. I use the light part first and put it under my eyes and in the inner corners. It looks great until I try to make neat lines with the black pencil... It's a little too soft and creamy, it's hard to use it as an eyeliner (I don't know what else you can use it for...). It smudges and cakes a little. But after some manipulations with the q-sticks and sponges, the colors look great.<br />I decided I will use the champagne side of the pencil and use a separate black eyeliner that is not this soft and thick.<br />I gave it a 4 for an everyday use, but it can be a 5 if you're going after smokey eyes.
B000N0OSAU|4|I called Luminess and they wanted $300 for this product.  I would not pay $300 but on Amazon I paid around $100 and it was worth it.  I like it a lot.  It's easy, fast, and the make up seems to last pretty long. I am a 36 year old woman who doesn't wear foundation ever because I can never find a foundation light enough with having red hair.  The lightest shade was perfect for me.  I like this product, the only downfall I would say is if you are looking for it to make pores look smaller, I don't believe it does that.  But over all I think it is a good product, I would buy it again.
B001773ZIO|1|the following morning after I received this terrible product I applied two dabs on the sides of my cheek where I had two dark spots. Later on at work I noticed my cheeks started turning red, I immediately knew I had some sort of reaction to the the cream but didn't expect for it to get worse..... Well it did. Later on in the evening my red cheeks became swollen , the following morning I developed a hard bump on each cheek where I had applied the cream it itches and burns like crazy.   I am now currently on day three experiencing the aftermath it is 6:21 am and i cant sleep. Please please think three times before buying this garbage.
B00158UIL2|1|Please, please, please read this review and heed our warnings.  I wish I would have and now it's too late. I purchased this mirror in late 2009.  I absolutely loved the design and the ability to close it.  It didn't last six months before the plastic light cover feel off.  I snapped it back in place and a month later the light would turn on when in the closed position and turn off when opened (an obvious electrical short).  I then spent $25 in postage to return it to the manufacturer for repair.  Because I had sent it past the one year mark (I got busy with life and failed to ship it right away) Zadro refused to repair it under warranty.  I then reminded of a few things:  (1) I paid $139 for this mirror and now another $25 in shipping to have it repaired (for this price it should last a lifetime and certainly longer than 6 months) and (2) I have yet to write my review on Amazon.  The mirror was repaired under warranty after I sent a check for $10 for the return shipping.  Total spent to date $175. Yesterday, the plastic light cover broke yet again (my guess is the plastic cannot withstand the heat from the bulb).  The mirror is held into place by this plastic cover and as I hadn't yet used my super duper duct tape to hold the mirror in place, it slammed down on my nose this morning breaking the skin between my eyes.  Do not buy this overpriced, junk yard mirror.  Does anyone have a bandade?
B00NGF2JUK|5|This wig is so awesome!  I got it as a gift for a young girl, but I wanted to keep it for myself!  I'll probably end up buying this for me at some point :)  Beautiful color and curls - what you get looks exactly like the picture.  It comes nicely packaged in a box.  Very happy with my purchase.
B000C1W6XG|5|I have been buying this for over 20 years and it is still my favorite - brings back memories every time hubby wears it.
B0009PRR1Q|4|I tended this to be used on my face for my acne scars, but I decided to use it elsewhere. My underarms tend to be dark like it's dirty (when it's NOT ^_^) even with scrubbing. It maybe a gene thing 'cause my sister has same problem. And now, after a month later, it is noticably lighter. <br />As for my acne scars. Those are lighter, too!
B000EVIV7E|1|Arrived with a huge Crack in the lid which they refused to replace. These hot rollers work terribly. My $30 Conair starter kit works better than this expensive crap
B00CWZ0BLE|2|good pricing but product came with with of the corner chipped off
B002NI0TDA|5|Perfect size, compact, yet functional. Easy to pack for road trips.
B005UL1B34|1|This is not what I was expecting in the quality of the pigment of the eyeshadow
B009I0KSQO|1|I was so excited about the Casino Royale color. It looked like a beautiful purple but when it arrived it was a rosy  plum color. According to other reviews the seller was not helpful with regards to returning the product. So I'll just save myself the hassle and eat the cost. But I won't buy from them again. And I'm not likely to buy nail polish online again either.
B001F51TR2|3|haven't noticed a change and very mild scrub. I prefer the apricot scrubs.
B000NL20EK|5|Love it!
B00LJI6X3A|4|This works better than I expected! I'm in my 40s and I've had the &#34;rough and bumpys&#34; on my arms for my entire life. I trust Gold Bond so I decided I had to try this product. When I first received it I was a little surprised to see a typo on the label. It actually made me worry that I might have gotten a fake product. I guess it was crazy of me, but I shrugged it off and tried it anyway. I'm pretty sure this is the real deal because it is the only thing I've tried that does work!<br />It does leave my skin feeling a little odd. It feels smooth and the bumps are gone, but it isn't really a soft feeling. Because of this I alternate between using this and my own homemade body butter - and it works out as a great combination for my skin.<br />The smell isn't great but that doesn't bother me, I use it at night before going to bed.
B001DKMY9Q|5|panasonic shaver works very well and have no complaints. will probably purchase a another if anything should happen to this one.
B003WR3QSG|4|I noticed some coloring of my soap on first use so you need to wash out brush before using. Excellent brush ,othewrwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B002Z6LHWW|5|the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent
B000HBNAJK|5|I've used this product before, during and after shampooing and it smells nice and isn't greasy and doesn't weigh my Irish/Portuguese hair down--just leaves it looking nice and shiny. I've also used it to clean leather and instead of lotion or cuticle oil and its staying time is a lot better than lotion! Also, you can't beat this price for this hard-to-find item!
B004F82HB8|5|The dropper bottle for this makes it so easy to add just the right amount to your polishes. I use this all the time, and it really extends the life of your polishes and makes sure you get all the value you can from them. Love this stuff!
B008BPHNX8|4|I wish the bands inside were a little tighter, because not ALL of the oils, but some will fall out during travel. Overall, it's nice. The best thing I've had so far.
B0043R5AHO|5|It is my own fault for not viewing the product closely enough... These are not the right nails for the french white tip. I did however still rate this product as a 5 star because it is not the products' fault for my lack of searching. The product quality is GREAT. These are what the professionals use (so it seems to me) for acrylic nails. They are just natural toned and not white tips. They are easy to file, cut, and shape. So it is going to work great if you want a normal fashioned painted nail. The price is a little more than other natural acrylic tips, but these are thicker and better compared to others that I have purchased. So you get what you pay for with these tips :)
B002X9XV48|5|this product is very amazing, i love this because it leaves you smelling good and not burnt smelling i was scared to order it offline i was worried i about get a fake but i have a bottle i got from my tanning salon an it was the real deal i paid 60  for it at the tanning salon an got it on here for 40$ so i'm very happy a must have if you are  tanning a lot leaves your skin silky smooth...
B00B407KAI|2|Item is solid and stainless and cuts average toenails but not the thicker and tougher ones, like my nails that have fungus. I squeeze it real hard and nothing happens.  I would not have bought it had I known.
B001ABLKK2|5|Expensive, but the lady loves it.
B001GBDSY2|1|I need a spray deodorant in a can short enough to fit onto my unadjustable shelf. After an hour of searching, I thought I had found it in this product, which is described as 5 inches tall (it least that's what the product description says right now as I type this; I don't know how long it will take Amazon to fix it). Alas, it arrived and turns out to be 8 inches tall, just like all the others. (5-inch cans exist; I have a couple of foot powders in such cans.) Could I return it? No, because it's an aerosol, and Amazon doesn't accept such \\"dangerous\\" shipments. Can I get a refund? Not online; you're locked out of the process automatically. If you phone them and complain, they'll credit your account and let you keep the product for free. (Hint hint hint: I did NOT do this on purpose. But other people might. Hint hint hint -- can you tell I'm upset with all the time I've wasted on this nonsense?)
B004UQ6Q62|5|Great! Just what they promised.
B0071B7XCO|4|Not bad,just have to see how long it last
B00M5H43V8|5|This oil smells amazing and I wear it often. I believe you could wear it for any occasion. I love it.
B00763LZF8|1|Have used now for a week and every time I floss, at-least one of the floss-sticks break. The floss/wire detaches from one side of the holder, every time.<br /><br />This was my first time trying Oral B after years of Dentek. Dentek isn't perfect, but I'm off to order the kind I used to get.
B00GAVOE1O|3|I am wearing this wig for an upcoming Con and I wish I would have spent the extra to get a more expensive one, I am now searching local stores to find wefts to add because it is so thin. You can see the wig cap in multiple areas other than that its a fine wig that will be great in my collection.
B0001B86HM|4|Have only used it twice but is doing the job.  It is definitely not like the ones they used to build before.  The old styles were more sturdy and strong.  Bought this for my mom who had a Westinghouse model that had been with her for over 30 years and now is when it broke.  But for the price it is all worth it.  I like the fact that you can fold it and close it.
B007ZURQZU|5|Very nice qualities it stays on your face all day , fabulous colors  you cannot  go wrong with thus purchase :-)
B001ET775C|5|I don't want my cows going around with rough chapped udders, so I buy them the best.  Rub this in, and they give me nice sweet milk in return.  You can almost see them smile, it feels so good.  No seriously, this is great for moisturizing your skin.
B000EGMBP2|5|Excellent product. We live in hot Arizona all year and we use this everyday. Good consistency and soaks in quickly with no white residue.
B007XKCEBI|5|Have used his product for a number of years--it does wonders for the nails!! (If used according to the directions)
B005RFAS3W|5|I've spent a lot of money on doctors & meds to solve a &#34;Jacuzzi tub scalp infection&#34;.<br />Who knew that bacteria / fungus / evil things lurked in the tubes of your Jacuzzi tub.<br />First thing is to clean the darn plumbing in the Jacuzzi tub.<br />Of course, see your dermatologist but don't leave it entirely up to the doctor.<br />I bought this shampoo & the cream to supplement what was prescribed &<br />I'm glad I did....  I am still battling the bumps on my scalp but this product really helps.<br />Good Luck. JJ
B0091LZ4ZA|3|It seems to work ok. Not sure if I got the formula correct mixing it with color camo. When you get the mix correct it works better than &#34;just for men&#34;.
B0010P6D28|1|allergic reaction
B001E96M4Y|1|Do NOT buy this product. They changed the formula in a major way without any indication on the packaging. They have not responded to complaints. I've used this for 20 years, and loved it - there was nothing else like it. The new formula smells horrible, like every other sunscreen (the old one had no scent at all), and irritates my sensitive skin. Hopefully this will bomb like the New Coke - wait till they bring it back.
B003BQ6QXK|3|The mirror works perfectly. However, most of the silicone adhesive that came with it had already congealed in the tube when it arrived. The small amount that I could squeeze out (using a pair of pliers!) wasn't enough to do the job. After a few weeks, the mirror came crashing down in the shower. Fortunately, it didn't break. I bought a tube of real silicone adhesive at a hardware store and remounted the mirror. So 5 stars for the design of the mirror and one star for quality control to ship it with a tube of silicone that had gone bad.
B00ICN91LG|5|Wife loves it, longer and thicker lashes.
B006UMU4NK|5|Use this everytime I do my nails and it works great!
B003V37Z9W|4|A very &#34;High tech&#34; shaving experience. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.
B004FVJJR0|5|Have purchased several of Rusk's hair care products recently and love them all.  Makes my hair healthier and much happier!
B00158J0EI|5|This product works so well.  I threw my fixodent in the trash.  Mix apply, a quick soak in water and you are like new!  Here is a great tip, the alcohol tastes horrible, so I put my partial quickly after adding the product into saran wrap, then bit down, tiny bit less molding of every nook and cranny of your mouth but still works great for me.
B00174LGSI|5|Using in addition with other lotion from fair & white and the result is super. Love it. Dark spot started fading away.
B00MQ6JL74|5|This bottle of Blue Nile is very fragrant. and last for ever. I would say its the best.
B00F4YQPYW|3|This is just an ok eyeliner. It is more of a lavender color than a deep violet. It does go on smoothly without tugging and may be good for people who want a light shade of purple.
B00M14WLPK|5|I like these tooth brushes. They are soft, but effective.
B004YF828O|5|What can I say .. This is a new trend and I get compliments all the time no matter which crackle I use ... In fact there are women I work with who have also started doing their nails the same way!
B0000YUX4O|1|This comb did not look like the picture.  In the advertisement, it appears to be hard plastic.  When the comb arrived, it appeared to be a cheap comb that I could have purchased from the local beauty supply store for less than $1.00.  I will not purchase from this seller again.
B003UGSU62|5|After reading reviews that the lipsticks came melted, i was skeptical but purchased anyway.<br />I was pleased that mine all came in perfect condition and looked wonderful.<br />The packaging is cheap and looks cheap but the colors and their color pay off is phenomonal!<br />great buy!
B007K449CE|5|We all know that washing hair with shampoo removes excess dirt, sweat, pool chlorine and oil, as well as other unwanted products from the hair and scalp. But removing dandruff and skin particles that build up in hair takes something a bit stronger and that where products like [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full]] come in.<br /><br />The key active ingredient in this shampoo appears to be pyrithione zinc (1.0%), which is a formulation known to reduce shedding, and according to some sources, moderately promotes hair growth. I've used the [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint]] before with very successful results, and earlier this year, that formulation became my daily shampoo. I also have a closely trimmed beard, and when dandruff occasionally shows up there, it's irritating.<br /><br />So where does this one fit in? Is it any better in controlling dandruff? Both of these shampoos appear to have the same general list of ingredients, but the key difference seems to be that the directions for the Cool Sport Mint version say; \\"for best results use daily.\\" This Strong & Full version states that \\"for best results use at least twice a week or as directed by doctor.\\"<br /><br />Personally I've settled into using the Cool Sport Mint variety as a regular daily shampoo, but supplement it with their [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration]] a couple times a week, as it has the conditioner built in. This Strong & Full version is the one that I use for mostly afternoon and evening use when my hair has gotten wet from strenuous exercise or after cycling. Hair can really get wet and nasty after being out on a mountain bike for a couple of hours in the summer.<br /><br />We all have different hair and different needs, but if you do get occasional (or frequent) dandruff, all of these products will do the job, and their descriptive titles are pretty accurate. I'll list all three here so that you don't have to go digging or searching if you want to try them out:<br /><br />* [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint]] - daily use<br />* [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full]] - occasional use<br />* [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration]] - has conditioner<br /><br />If I had any complaints at all it would be that there isn't enough of the tea tree ingredient in any of these. For anyone who has used a good shampoo with a decent concentration of tea tree, such as the [[ASIN:B003U4F6FC Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo]], you know how good that extra tingle can feel on the scalp. It also aids in dandruff control, but it's far more costly.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />I first received the Cool Sport Mint version as a Vine selection, tried it and liked it, so I moved on to try the others. Since then I've re-ordered the first one to replace my older daily shampoo, and as the other versions run out, will do the same with them. Can't recommend one over the other, as we all have different heads of hair, and what would work for one may not be as good for another. Again, none of these have enough tea tree for my liking, but that's a personal thing, and I guess it's what works best for each persons hair. In any case, this Strong & Full version is excellent and highly recommended, but so are the others.<br /><br />8/6/2012tles are pretty accurate. I'll list all three here so that you don't have to go digging or searching if you want to try them out:<br /><br />* [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint]] - daily use<br />* [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full]] - occasional use<br />* [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration]] - has conditioner<br /><br />If I had any complaints at all it would be that there isn't enough of the tea tree ingredient in any of these.

B00NUIY80C|5|Great product...love the smell of it!! I use drops in my lotion and hair products and to scent the room in my oil warmer. But my biggest use is just aromatherapy, place a drop on my wrist and relax!! Love it!! Love it!! Love it!!
B006R6OBTM|3|These used to be really good, but they break easily now. Out of the 75 pieces included only about half were usable.
B00GWT8UWI|5|Isabis Vitamin C Serum feels very velvety and smooth when I rub it into my skin, it absorbs fairly quickly and my face now feels super soft. This vitamin C serum itself is a slightly thicker consistency in comparison to all the other vitamin C serums I have tried before, which tend to be a more watery consistency. After nearly four weeks of application (twice daily), my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, my skin tone has evened out and it has also reduced the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes and forehead.<br /><br />I have already brought my mom a bottle for her birthday, as she has complimented me on my skin on numerous occasions, which is rare!!<br /><br />Now I don't need to wear as much make up to cover up my uneven skin tone, which is great! And knowing that my skin is getting vitamins C, A and E is also great. I must say I am pleasantly suprised with the quality of this vitamin C serum and I will be recommending it to all my best friends.<br /><br />This has to be the best vitamin C serum I have brought!
B009O48GTK|2|The wig arrived with one of the ponytail tangled.......Messed it up even more by combing it....
B000F41ZEG|5|Good product for firming fine hair. Ever since I used it, I do not want to try other hairsprays. It does not clash with the scent of my shampoo and perfume.
B00O59LG0A|4|Very impressed! I've tried countless &#34;all-natural&#34; deodorant products and never have good luck with odor protection. I thought I would give this a shot  and I have been so pleased with Primal Pit Paste. I work in a stressful environment and I also teach high intensity fitness classes and I've been ODOR FREE! I have never, ever had that with natural deodorants. Also, I love the lavender scent. The only downfall is scooping it out but really it's not so bad. I will definitely order this again!
B00PIGQMIA|1|Terrible taste<br />Not thing like other coconut water<br />Don't buy the powder
B00T3JAFWC|5|I bought this product for my son and it really works!
B00D3M0CRS|5|As a person who normally uses organic coconut oil as an overall body moisturizer, I liked the idea of trying a lighter weight oil for two persistent problem areas: my elbows and the heels of my feet.  I have never used Argan Oil before, but had heard all of the claims that it was lighter weight and easier to absorb. I decided to try Poppy Austin because theirs is an Organic product, and they donate a percentage back to the women's co-operatives in Morocco.<br /><br />Not only was I impressed with how fast it arrived (4 days from order to door...and I didn't pay for expedited shipping), but I was instantly impressed with how truly lightweight and fast-absorbing this Argan oil really is.<br /><br />I now use it daily on both my elbows and feet straight out of the shower.  Just a couple of drops used on each area is enough to keep them soft all day.  The lighter weight and fast absorption keeps my feet from sliding around in my shoes and my elbows from sliding across my desk at work. Great stuff for ladies who don't want a greasy feel, and don't have all day to get the moisturizing done!
B00BD822BI|5|Having done minimum skin care all my life, I decided it was time for the works before serious signs of aging set in. Hubby pitched in and helped me explore a brand that shall be nameless except for its price: more than a hundred dollars (sometimes lots more) for a small jar/tube of just about anything.  It sure worked.  Overnight I saw a difference.  A week later my skin looked noticeably younger.  I obtained a night cream, a day cream, an eye cream, a toner, a serum, hunting for online bargains--thinking they ought to last a lifetime even at the reduced prices I found.  Then I discovered Bel Essence.  Guess what?  It's JUST as good as the \\"hundreds of dollars\\" brands.  Encouraged, I searched Amazon and the comments for other substitutes.  From now on, my toner is Thayer's Rose Petal Witch Hazel, my serum is OZ Naturals Vitamin C 20% etc, my eye serum is Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and my moisturizer is Bel Essence intensive anti-aging treatment, which works well as a day or night cream -- a total of $89.68, not $993, for instance.
B000KBB5BC|5|I love it.  I didn't expect anything less.  I used to have this marcel handle iron in a larger size years ago but broke it.  When I found the Helen of Troy marcel handle curling iron again, I bought two of them.  The silver barrel is not as harsh on my hair as the gold barrels are.<br /><br />Marcel handles make it easier for me to swing the curl the way I want it to swing.  I have but one regret, I didn't get it in a larger size.
B00FSFRHO4|5|so stylish
B000NL0T1G|5|Great razor for a great price!
B00IQ21TK4|5|Item as described...fast delivery!
B001GBBZOW|5|Don't mind paying for something that works well..especially if it fits i my mailbox<br />thanks<br /><br />I like to re-order the shampoo without difficulty.
B000NJE40K|5|It is well balanced.<br />Holds the curling iron.<br />It fits on the shelf in my closet<br />Helps to keep the cord from getting tangled around the curling iron.
B00DP4N1R2|4|Lavender is one of my favorite fragrance. Hence I got this essential oil.  So far I have used this oil for three things:<br />1] In diffuser<br />2] Put few drops on cotton ball and keep it in shoe closet<br />3] Put in potpourri<br /><br />The smell last for a long time. It is light and soothing. I love the product and will definitely buy this again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.
B00F008GFQ|3|Hello,  I really like the brush a lot, it really makes a huge difference on how my liquid foundation comes on however, I was disappointed to find that the silver/metal handle has a huge dent in it.<br />The packaging was not damaged so this product was sent to me damaged from the warehouse.<br />Other than that, its a great brush.
B00H98OQHO|2|Just didn't like it.
B0077PLNB6|1|I read a lot of reviews before buy this item. Finally I received my Braun last week .... what a bad day, it's not work .... It is horrible, I used one time and other and other, and does not work for me. MAybe my hair is not thick enough I don't know.
B00J56DRBY|4|Arrived on time and works perfectly. It does not have a heat adjustment.
B0001J3U8Y|1|We bought this at suggestion of our dentist.  However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience. <br /> <br />Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave. <br /> <br />Save your money and go back to flossing!!
B00U11UBUM|5|You can tell it's very natural and very different than other product in the market. Will buy it again.
B004HVK7M4|5|This product can be a little messy to mix up, but it works very well.  If your eyebrows are mostly grey, you will need to leave it on for the extra time specified.  It arrived very quickly, and I have already used it twice saving me $40 at the salon!! Just make sure you follow the instructions carefully and you shouldn't have a problem!
B00RAOAPH2|5|I live in New York and every winter I suffer from chapped lips, mostly from the harsh cold & weather conditions but also from constantly blowing my nose. I think I have tried just about every product made for chapped lips but nothing seems to last long term. That is when I got the opportunity to try Living Nature’s Certified Natural LIP BALM with active manuka honey at a discount in return I would share my results and let them know my honest opinion. So I look up manuka honey and it turns out that it has antibiotic properties which protect against damage and can actually repair damaged tissue.  When I first tried it I noticed that I did not have to keep re-applying it like I did with other lip balms. It has an angled tip and you can squeeze just the right amount out without waste. Right away my lips felt soft & moisturized and it stayed on for hours. It puts a nice barrier over my lips that’s not sticky and protects my lips. It also gives them a very nice shine and restores the natural pink hue my lips once had.  I think this is a wonderful product.  I’ve been using it for a few days and my lips feel wonderfully hydrated! This is my new go-to for healing my dry chapped lips.
B005GOVYFK|5|Thanx Jessi!,...Very feminine ... Sexy and delicate at the same time. Has a mature scent to it, but still playful. My new favorite pefume.
B009PKWGZ8|5|A great costume accessory - I wore it while I worked on a 'cake walk' store at a school carnival.  It was fairly substantial and definitely looked like a cupcake.  It wasn't flimsy and stood up without any problems.  It's squashed a bit when it comes out of the bag but a bit of fluffing up and it was great
B002BS43HU|5|The heat is crazy, but I can see a difference.
B0076ZJN4Q|5|Beautiful, fragrant soap.  Excellent delivery service.
B0024JMXQY|4|This product is just what I needed.  It works just like I want.
B004SO2SVI|1|Total waste of money!!! Please don't be stupid and naive as I was. Does not work. Does not work. Does not work.
B00JA606SG|4|The colors are pretty and definitely pearly. These gels are thin so unless you like the sheer look you need to put at least 3 coats on. Also, they are very runny so not the best for painting designs unless you are quick to flash cure between brush strokes. Overall, I am happy with the gels. They come in sealed white pots and the pots I received were quite full.
B00EZ50KH4|5|We are very happy with this product.  We did not realize how far it needed to travel to get to us. However, we are using it and are pleased.
B00KMGVAVK|5|No complaints.  Item as described.
B00J9QXSZ0|5|Live it but takes practice to be perfect
B00BTHQ57U|5|Bought for my sister who is a cosmetologist. She loves it.
B0036ZA40W|4|I started to get receding gums from brushing to hard and to much. These really help.
B0002JKPA4|5|Love the rollers.  Easy to use and curl hair quickly.
B005AVMR28|5|Because the brush is good and I will love to buy another one because it's just to gud to be true
B001BO0KMC|4|This is an excellent curling hot brush.  I just wish it was a bit smaller, wish they made a 1&#34;.
B000ITL7ZU|5|Love this product! My feet haven't been this soft and smooth in awhile.  I typically do it every other day if needed but usually I don't need too.  Best when used while your feet are wet and use soap too! :)
B008YLYTP4|1|I searched amazon for triple milled french soap. This item was one of the results.<br />This is not triple milled french soap.<br />Pretty but I would not have spend this amount on a single small bar of soap. Not satisfied.
B00K5KAG5O|1|Disappointed....not the wig my wife ordered....different color, length and style.
B00QT9B2DA|1|Not happy
B00OPCHAB6|3|Dont see much effects
B00312F7XY|4|it doesn't seem like it would be very durable though...it is how ever the perfect size, shape & looks just so cute:)
B00ELM6XBI|5|The Happy should say it ,but I guess I'll tell you why I'm happy. Lost my one and only Stim handle on vacation. So I just should say it is forever lost. Then these appeared online....who would have thought...........
B004FEO38C|5|I have been using Ed Hardy Coconut Kisses tanning lotion, and loved it.  Was looking for something with a little more umph... so I purchased the Body Shots and couldnt be happier with it!!!  It tingles without being overly hot... takes just seconds before you feel it working!  Has given me a nice even tan, and never turned my hands orange as I saw other people complain about.  If you are not experienced with tinglers, I suggest you skip this lotion.  It is not for the inexperienced.  Love it and will continue using it, and will end up buying this again!
B0069SAYYO|4|Nice, secure option for styling your hair in a up-do.  My hair hangs a couple of inches below my shoulders and is a medium thickness.  These claws hold my hair without pulling.
B0000YV5U0|4|I haven't tried this product yet. Four stars represents the hope i have with it. shall write a detailed report later.
B00005AUIE|5|normal
B00KOHLLTI|3|Leaves a very strong, almost choking smell in the air after using. However, I do enjoy this particular scent.
B000BIPRGS|5|If Jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products. The aquasana shower filter  is an excellent product which i use .Whats it matter who's name is on it. It is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher.
B000F37UNM|4|Very sharp and well made. A bit small and curved for toenails.

B001MYLLSI|5|I bought this perfume for my mother for Mother's Day. She loved the smell, saying it reminded her of being on the beach. Also, it was $25 cheaper than in stores.
B008HJRLXK|5|Love this brush. Highly reccomend it.
B00AZPDS9A|5|fits like a glove
B00H8V6J2C|3|The only reason I'm giving this one three stars is because I ordered a flat kabuki brush and an angled one (the one shown here).  But, when I received my product, I received two FLAT kabuki's instead.  I should have contacted Amazon and sent it back but it seemed like a hassle for a make-up brush so I just kept the two flat brushes.  I would love to try an angled brush, since I contour a lot. Oh well!
B004K9JPG2|5|I like this brand and the quality very much<br />It's just so much better than I expected<br />I have some sun and got Medium, which is a perfect match<br />It's clean, natural looking and harmless ingredients<br />The price was less than many others, as well
B000KHZIJG|4|I like the Bio Ionic large round conditioning brush but with the long length of my hair and for straightening I wish I had ordered the xtra large.
B000WSX93A|3|Quick delivery. Smells nice.
B003S17772|5|wore my first pair to work (im a dancer) and they held up very well, kept them on while i slept and everything for three days straight and they still were beautiful and still reusable. buy it
B000BRSHXE|5|I normally use Oil of Olay Complete Defense, which was recommended years ago by my dermatologist. I continue using that during the day, but starting using Sebamed moisturizer at night. It is a great product, not oily but very moisturizing. All the Sebamed products I have used have been wonderful. Sebamed soap (green liquid) totally cleared up my adult acne. I was concerned this moisturizer might cause a flareup, but no problems. I really like it for a night cream.
B001KYRPLM|1|I looked high and low for this certain lipstick, by L'Oreal, seems they discontinued this color, well I found it on amazon.com so ordered it with a gift card that I had, turns out it is the right color but it is like putting chalk on your lips, not creamy at all, I was very disappointed.
B00SMIIR0W|4|I just received this product and loved it!  I have sensitive skin and this razor left no visible sign of irritation, nor do I feel any!  The waterproof trimmer worked great!  I had some difficulty removing all hair with the razor.  I had to take several passes in some areas.  I highly recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin!  It's easy to hold onto as it has a gel grip.  It's size is intimidating at first, but you soon realize it's incredibly easy handle.  I did notice it was just a slight bit hard to maneuver into the harder to reach areas.  All in all, I give it 4 stars!
B0015PGFQW|5|I have men's medium length fine straight hair. If your hair texture is different YMMV.<br />I have tried many different types of hair gel and pastes. This one is one of the best.<br />[[ASIN:B0010NRXYM TIGI Bed Head A Hair Stick for Cool People 2.7 oz (.77 g)]] and Manipulator are my two go-to products daily. It has medium hold that is workable and doesn't get sticky. You can touch your hair after it sets and it doesn't get into your hands like some other products do. Water reactivates it if you need to reset.<br /><br />So easy to use. I take about an almond size and it's all I need. Smells fruity but not overwhelming - scent fades after it sets.
B0043QNR2K|4|I have been wearing the PherX Pheromone cologne for gay men for a week or so now.  I have to say, I am glad I<br />made the purchase.  It works, and what a confidence builder as well.  I spray a little of it on after the morning shower,<br />and in the evenings.  I have a str8 roommate (fireman).  Even he has been more touchy, feely and super friendly lately!<br />The checkout dudes at the market even smile and chat more!  PherX cologne works for me....Rob in Washington State
B001D67O3G|5|This is the second time I have ordered this lip stain because I nearly used up all of the first I ordered a year ago. How often do you use up ALL of a cosmetic? Seriously. This is an honest to goodness lip stain - put the color on and leave it alone for a few minutes and it will dye the skin of your lips (temporarily) this gorgeous color. It doesn't just sit on top like a gloss or suck all the moisture out of your lips either, like most other &#34;lip stains.&#34; I even tried Sephora, and Morpho is WAAAAY better.<br /><br />The color will look a little different on every person because it works with your natural skin tone. Most cosmetics turn a bit orange when they hit my skin (it's not pretty) but this one stays a deep burgundy. Love it. When it's dry, I use my usual vitamin E lip balm over the top and away I ago.<br /><br />Can't say enough how much I love this product. I also have extremely sensitive skin, and this has never given me problems like (most) other products do (even the ones billed as hypoallergenic.)<br /><br />I put makeup on in the morning and then I just don't think about it for the rest of the day. It just doesn't occur to me. So I love having a lip stain that lasts more than a few minutes - even through lunch - without me thinking about it and reapplying. If I go out at night I usually touch it up, but I can still see some color from when I put it on in the morning.<br /><br />I wish there were more shades, but I wear this one constantly because it looks so good on me anyway.
B00ATS24EI|5|Great price and really good product.
B004O76DEC|2|Bought two back in September of last year, mailed on time with rebate voucher and UPC and never received the rebate check.
B00574WVJ2|5|I am not one to use a lot of &#34;products&#34;, but this is one I go out of my way to find.  Does great things for my hair and smells good too.
B000C1ZDTU|5|This perfume smells wonderful!!. I bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. Not a very bold scent, but smells great. Definitely recommend this!!
B002HWS9GG|1|The smartguide can't work.Maintenance personnel said:Circuit board has been damaged.
B003V264WW|5|I LOVE this blow dryer!  It's heavy and feels very professional when you are using it.  The soft sueded material feels great in your hand.  It is also very powerful which you can feel when in use.  My only con would be that I wish it had a swivel cord but other than that I am hoping it lasts for years and years.
B002C1POCY|5|This Lotion was a little expensive, but very worth it. I love the peony flower sent, and it's very moisturizing. The bottle was smaller than I expected though.
B0099OAOUO|2|I purchased this from this seller before and it was fine - the exact product my salon had used after my keratin treatment.  Not sure if Diora has changed the formula and/or packaging but the packaging/bottle design is different as is the scent and consistency.  It doesn't seem to have the same affect as the original formula. Very disappointed.
B0068UZBHS|5|These soap saver pouches are great!  No more mess with soap sitting in a dish and the soap last longer!  The mesh material creates a light exfoliating on the skin every time you wash. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B001GS6OB4|4|I waited to write this review after I had used this product a few times.  My review compares this product to the original Epilady coil epilator (made in Israel) and to the Braun Silk-Epil model 5318.<br /><br />First some general comments:<br />1. Pain - all epilation is painful. As a woman from the Indian subcontinent, I have lots of coarse hair and hair removal is something I've lived with for most of my life. I first started sugar-waxing at home in the 1970's - very messy process. But because I've been yanking hair out from its roots for a long time, it doesn't hurt much anymore, especially on my legs. That said, underarms are quite painful the first time you do them. So once you start, don't stop! Because if you let the hair grow out, it will hurt like the dickens again. Also, I can't do my bikini area at all.  Too much pain! I use pre-waxed strips instead. Some people mention epilating after a shower. I guess this helps. I always epilate after I shower so that my skin is free of all lotion and deodorant, so I can't really compare.<br />2. Ingrown Hair - yes this is an issue. For some reason it's a bigger problem for me with waxing and epilating than shaving. My solution is to use a loofah in the shower, very frequently. Dry brushing your skin with a mitt also helps. Those puffy plastic mesh things don't work at all, too smooth. Most of my ingrown hair occurs where my legs rub together since I usually sit with my legs crossed.<br />3. Time and repetition - epilation takes more time than shaving and you do need to go over the area more than once to remove all the hair. But I can wait a week or two between treatments vs shaving which I'd have to do pretty much every day so it's worth it. In terms of frequency, I use the epilators on my underarms and calves once a week and on my thighs and forearms once every two weeks.<br />4. Corded vs. Cordless - I had both corded and rechargeable coil Epiladies (original and &#34;Ultra&#34;). I found that once the battery on the rechargeable unit wore out, it seemed to slow down even when it was plugged in. So now I only use corded units.<br /><br />Original coil Epilady - I started using these about 20 years ago. I found them very forgiving in terms of how they had to be held against the skin, and how fast or slow you had to move them around on your skin. You could move it in straight lines or circles. They worked very well and they seemed to remove more hair in one pass than the newer designs. But I actually thought they worked better on longer hair than shorter hair. And their head shape meant that I never could do my underarms.  But they lasted a long time - about 15 years! Obviously they were pretty well built.<br /><br />Braun Silk-Epil 5318 - After my Epilady bit the dust, I moved to this product. This older model's tweezers have two metal teeth vs one plastic and one metal. I have seen other reviews that mention that two metal teeth are better than one being plastic. That said, this product works very well for me. You need to follow its directions, though. Move slowly in long swoops and hold the device at a 90 degree angle against your skin. I use the slower speed on the device because I thought the faster speed was causing more hair breakage. Also, I work against the growth pattern of the hair. This device is the best for getting into nooks and crannies and works well in the underarm area, because its head is fairly small and its a bit curved. It works best with hair around 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, and seems to get even the finest hair out.<br /><br />When I was using the old Epilady I had to shave my underarms. But I decided to try epilating them with the Braun and it is fantastic. To give you an idea, I have already had laser hair removal on my underarms which thinned the hair out a bit but didn't get rid of all of it. Now I use the epilator and although I'll never be an underarm model, I am hair free in this area and loving it.<br /><br />Emjoi Emagine - We built a winter home inthe south so I needed a second epilator and I picked this one based on the reviews.<br /><br />First the good: it is fast! The large number of tweezers makes it about 30% faster than the Braun. Also, the dual opposed head means you can go in various directions and it still works great. It's tweezers also have two metal teeth, by the way. You still have to follow the directions. Hold the device at a 90 degree angle (upright) against your skin. Move in small swipes. I use the slower speed. The device works well on shorter hair, just like the Braun.<br /><br />Now the bad - why I give it four stars instead of five. It is loud! Louder than the Braun. This isn't a big deal at my house but I don't think I could take it with me if I was visiting a friend. They'd wonder what the heck was going on. But the more important issue is that it's head is quite large, and flat. So it is harder to use in the underarm and behind-the-knee areas. Also hard to use around the knees (mine are pretty boney and angular).  This isn't a deal breaker for me but I suppose it might be for some people<br /><br />If my Braun dies I'll probably buy a new one to see if they work as well as my old model. However, I don't think you can go wrong with the Emjoi, so I can recommend it.the south so I needed a second epilator and I picked this one based on the reviews.<br /><br />First the good: it is fast!

B004TO1J6C|5|This spray in/leave in product really helps with hair that gets blow dried or heated. It protects and keeps the frizz away. Also gives good lift and body.
B00GP9ZE10|3|I like the size & ease of use, but the output is slow & doesn't fill a small room well. I have a larger one similar to this & it has high & low setting. The output on high is strong & fills up a large room easily. I will use this in a small room, but not very useful in the kitchen where I wanted it to be.
B003F6VJ0G|5|I had used gel for years, since i Let my hair grow out a bit  i need a new product to leave my hair to crunchy and dried out.  I purchased this 3 pack.  I like the quality of the product on my hair.  Does not feel crunchy, holds it in place, i can add a little water and re-style before going out in the evening again. Great product.
B001D4FF66|5|I really never write reviews for anything I buy online (and I shop online quite a bit), but I felt like I should in this case. I absolutely love Wen. My hair, when I am not using Wen Cleansing Conditioner, is very dry, frizzy, and a little bit wavy. It also tangles very easily and I can feel that I'm losing hair and causing damage every time I brush it. I ordered this bottle of the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner after I saw a commercial for it on tv and figured I would at least give it a shot since I was so frustrated with my hair. When I first started using it I was a little grossed out because my hair seemed more oily than normal, but I stuck with it and was careful to rinse my hair very well. The longer I used it, the better my hair felt, and my hair also did not get greasy at the roots as fast like it had before. It made my hair super soft, super shiny, tangle free, and actually defined the waves in my hair. After I used up the whole bottle, I decided it was too expensive and that maybe regular conditioner would do the same thing. This worked for a little while, but the condition of my hair gradually deteriorated to the way it was before I used Wen. Now I am scraping together the leftovers from my Mom's bottle of Lavender Wen until my new bottle arrives in the mail, because I don't want to use anything else anymore! The only complaint I have is that the pump does not work very well once you get down to the last inch or so of Cleansing Conditioner in the bottle, but I have just been taking the pump out and shaking out the right amount that I know works best for my hair. Also, I never have used as much as they say to use on the bottle and it has worked out just fine for me. I ordered the Cucumber Aloe to try this time and I can't wait for it to get here. This is like nothing I have ever used before, and has made such a difference in my hair. As soon as I find which scent I like the best, I will be ordering the gallon sized jug!
B002EP9OUG|5|this product is great, just all around perfection, i would definitely recommend it to any one and every one...BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!
B004OHQR1Q|5|These are made well. They are so pretty and they work so well to add special details to your nails. If needed I would re buy for sure. Worth the wait.
B00DR01M02|1|Never got it<br />Sent the wrong product
B00B2CEHAO|1|not so much. doesn't last. great color,
B001MA0QY2|4|I really like this product for the price. I normally purchase the FHI straightener but it was just getting too expensive. This comes with a great travel pouch bag and hair treatment oil. Only con is that it takes a little longer to heat up, but otherwise and so far this is a great product.
B008N6992S|5|Love It!!!!!!
B007SNGSFS|5|It does what it is supposed to do. No complaints. There is not much more that needs to be said.
B0045D7BG4|5|I am a man with short, fast growing hair, which makes white roots more of a problem. I was coloring my hair once a week because by the end of the week I had a 1/4\\" white stripe at the part. This is pretty noticeable when the overall length is 1 1/4\\". This tool puts the dye on my scalp, which apparently lets it literally soak into the hair below the scalp line. After 3 applications, I think I can go to just doing it every 2 weeks.<br /><br />Something else this helps with - I leave some gray at the temples, but getting the line correct between the gray and the colored hair was always hit or miss with the single point applicators. Then I would have to rub it in to be sure I got everywhere, which negates the value of applying it at the roots in the first place. Now I just comb this tool where I want the color and I can be sure it is evenly applied.<br /><br />Read the hair color directions - It needs to be left at the roots for a period of time, then rubbed into the rest of the hair for a time to blend. Most men's products take only 5 minutes total. Women's hair colors take 20-30 minutes, but they often cost less and I think the extra time gives more control over blending.<br /><br />To make life a little easier, fill your sink with soapy water before you start. Then, after applying the dye (while you are waiting for it to set), rinse the bottle in the sink, then put the applicator on the bottle and squirt soapy water till it comes clear. Then leave it soaking in the soapy water till you get done with your shower.
B0020MMCJI|4|I do love this spray, lovely spray. Use it everyday to work. I would definitely recommend this to others for purchase and use.
B00D13EUE0|3|I really loved the color of this online and I had read some reviews before buying it. Doing so, I knew the polish was going to be thin. I didn't realize that it would be SO thin to the point where I had to apply 5+ coats just to get a decent color. Also, since I had to apply so many coats it took forever to dry.
B008PTI0Z0|5|5 stars
B000VEQLHQ|4|You can really see close up with this mirror but it is hard to focus things in the right spot
B00275DH1A|4|This makeup is light enough for fair skin and has none of the yellow tones that most makeup has these days. I is a bit dry at the end of the day. Good color though.
B000NVPMI6|4|I ordered New Skin Scar Fade Topical Gel to remove a discoloration from a scar under my bellybutton. I was scratching there for a long time and the cut only got worse over time. Ive been using it now for I'd say a month and there are little spots that are significantly lighter than the scar originally was. I do feel that over more time it will be at least almost faded away completely.     The texture is really sticky though.
B007TLJP2W|1|I purchased the light, a pack of colors, base and top coat.  I stopped trying to get this right.  It didn't matter how much or how little I put on it didn't last more than a couple of days.
B00ORCFZHK|1|Not impressed by these... i have boughten better quality headbands at the dollar store... nothing special...
B00MAOCXX6|5|Received it on time and item as stated.  Great price
B003JN7LZM|5|I'm a Black guy who usually has a non-traditional hair style for an African-American man (I currently have a mohawk...or a brohawk as some of my friends have called it). I also texturize my hair regularly and soon discovered that mainstream hair gels really aren't designed for Black hair. They always made my hair really dry and brittle and made it look very dull; to get around this I would usually put some kind of moisturizer on my hair prior to using hair gel. That was always either too time consuming or too messy since sometimes the hair gel wouldn't mix well with the moisturizer. I'm also not very fond of a lot of products specifically made for Black hair because they rely too much on heavy moisturizers and I hate the greasy residue they leave behind. Elasta QP solves all of my problems in one product. It's a great styling gel that provides sufficient hold without drying my hair out. Once I use it my hair feels flexible to the touch and doesn't have a dull appearance and there's no embarrassing greasy residue. This is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of race or hair type. I really don't see how anyone could go wrong with this gel.
B00SA75A1Y|4|I love this! Is great product for the price. I like the bronzer the best out of all 3
B002ZSW7OC|5|thanks
B00E1XEQXY|5|Very happy with my purchase.
B00H93NJLS|4|I am using this oil on my face, neck, and chest as my daily moisturizer because what I have read indicates it's good at treating mild acne. It does have a slight odor that I don't really like, but it's certainly not strong enough to prevent me from using it.<br /><br />I have only been using it a few days, but my skin seems to have that healthy glow and I haven't gotten any new acne yet. The jury is still out on acne prevention, however.<br /><br />I put my makeup right on top of it and then need a little shine reducer dusted over my face before I'm ready to go. Keep it away from around your eyes if you are using eye makeup.
B004LB98H0|5|Best flat iron i have ever used! It heats up in less than 30 seconds and the flat iron comes in a really nice carrying case that you can use to lay the hot, flat iron on so you dont burn your counter. Not only did it make my hair smooth and shiny. My hair was more manageable, and no more flyaways! Thank you!
B00DZHPCTE|3|The price i guess is ok!
B00GYDBWD6|1|okay almay - what is going on.  this is such a dark, rich grape and goes on like a pastel.  very disappointed.  will try dampening the brush to see if i can get some more intensity, but overall - not a happy camper.
B003V264WW|5|I love this dryer! I wanted one that dried my fine hair well but didn't sound so whiny and loud. I read the reviews on this dryer and the comments on the deeper sound was what sold me. Now that I have it I have to say that yes, it's a sturdy dryer - not overly heavy but you can tell it's not a lightweight cheap version. The sound is wonderful! My husband even says that it doesn't wake him up like my previous &#34;whiny&#34; hair dryer. Best of all my hair dries in just a few minutes and feels great-not dried out or burnt but soft and silky. I've had it about a week and so far I cannot say enough good things about it.
B00HSNWZFA|5|has a more coconut smell but i like it. does the job and put me in a relaxing mood. All of us need that.
B00H8Z2LNY|5|As expected
B0037YF27C|5|Love this stuff...it makes a huge difference. It gives your hair a little extra...&#34;uhnnnn&#34;! Brings it back to life....Not greasy at all...it does wonders. I put it on at night...wrap my hair in a finish net scarf and wake up to bouncy hair! I need to add that I have natural hair that I get flat ironed straight...no perm here...best thing I EVER did. This product helps me maintain...I &#34;look like I have a perm&#34;!
B003Y21TD8|5|Great product - have tried others, but this one is the best.
B001T46SIE|1|I'm not sure if I'm using this right.  It's oil, I get that, but after you put it on, you can't put a bandage over it.  The bandage immediately falls off (it IS oil so it doesn't allow the sticky bandage to stick).  It claims to be gentle but it hurts and burns a bit.  I put it on a bug bite and it burned more after it was applied than before.  Did I mention it smells nasty?  It does.<br /><br />I've heard you can use it for diaper rash and it's safe for cloth diapers but I don't want to put it on my baby's bottom if he's already uncomfortable.
B002LMLN9W|2|I purchased the 4 pack, to date I have used 1.It might work for some, but not for me. I went back to Incident complete.
B00CUG2582|5|I've been a big fan of Sonicare Toothbrushes since I first tried them a few years ago.  The reason I liked them right away was that, unlike other electric toothbrushes I'd tried, this brand left my teeth feeling really clean and after a week of using it, my teeth looked whiter.  The other thing that impressed me right away is that the Sonicare has never made my gums bleed which they always did with other toothbrushes and even when brushing by hand.  I have no idea why that would be, since brushing my teeth by hand seems to me to be a lot less intense.  But that really sold me on the Sonicare and I've been using one or another Sonicare model ever since.<br /><br />They have lots of different models and I've used the [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], the [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], and the [[ASIN:B0085RZLUE Philips Sonicare HX6911/30 Flexcare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  (It isn't because they didn't last, but because I've had a chance to try them through the Vine program.) This one is my favorite so far because it has 9 total brushing speeds (which they call \\"experiences\\"):  3 cleaning modes (Clean, White, Gum Care) and 3 intensity settings (Low, Medium, High). The settings are easily changed with a combination of buttons on the front. This allows me to use the gentler speeds on sensitive areas of my mouth and the more intense on my front teeth which I'm always trying to get whiter.  In reality, all these different speeds and modes are kind of a gimmick because you'll probably find one or two that you like and those are the ones you'll always use.  It also has a 30 second buzzer/vibration feature which lets you know to move to another area of your mouth in case you're zoned out early in the morning or daydreaming and forget you've had the brush in one area for over 30 seconds.  I really like this feature.<br /><br />Another thing that I really like about this toothbrush is that it has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.  It's pretty compact and I don't have to keep it plugged in all the time because one overnight charge lasts for weeks. It comes with a plastic carrying case too, which is also convenient.  Once I became accustomed to a Sonicare I was never content to travel with a manual toothbrush. This toothbrush is not only effortless to use, but it gets my teeth really clean.that I really like about this toothbrush is that it has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.

B004KS2PD8|3|Very thin and quick to dry. Would be wowed if a little thicker perhaps and more sheen for the look I'm going for.
B008VB0WKS|4|They just good as usual, I've been using Lip Rouge from Anna Sui for 3 years and had nice experience! Moisturized, beautiful color, I usually cannot finish whole lip balms from other brands, but with these Lip Rouge I just wish they could last longer.
B0070O5UH2|5|I bought these towels as my family's gym towels (in Grey) and they are great so far. The color is really nice and the fabric is very absorbent. I'm very happy with the purchase!
B00028PNKW|1|Have not use yet.  Will return to rate.<br />Smell is very mellow.  Prefer strong smelling soap<br /> 4 more words required.
B00BBG0DEU|1|Same story here. 360 gem foot pedal NOT a true round pedal.  There is a difference.  Would not have payed money for what was shipped.
B004XWC856|5|How can one get excited over a dish drying mat?? Ez-peazy if you're OCD\\"ish\\". This is exactly what I wanted. Gone are the old cotton place-mats I used. This is large enough to fit in between the \\"legs\\" of my wood dish rack and is wide enough to catch drips from glass ware. It's super absorbent although being in Florida I do expect I'll have to bleach this bad boy occasionally. I was lucky enough to find one with a cream binding (I dislike the ones that have dark brown binding). The weave is sewn a tad crooked on one side but it's not prevalent enough to see when placed under my rack - otherwise I'd HAVE to return it (ya know?) I did a soak test with my sprayer and initially the back did not get wet. After a full dunk, I wrung it, twisted it, and squeezed it dry (holds a lot of water!) and after placing it flat it looked beautiful. Highly recommend. Can't wait to get my new rack!!...!!! :)
B000C1ZDTU|5|I love this smell. One of my all time favorites!
B007843W74|4|Just wanted to say that I use to buy this product in stores.  I was very happy when I saw I could buy on-line, however, when I received it and opened it up, the bottles had leaked open and was all over the place!  So, I had lost some of the product.  I probably will not order anything like this on-line again.
B00BB3K03M|5|this is a great product and perfectly holds and styles my thick hair even in hot humid weather.  It is a great value for the price and is better than other products costing 2-3 times the price.
B007F4B69S|4|It didnt whiten as much as I would like but its a good toothpaste.
B008LDFU26|5|I have used the Nerium night cream for a year now.  I am someone who does not use a lot of beauty products but was not liking what aging was doing to my skin.  My skin was feeling thinner, I was getting the puckers around my mouth, and my family has the brown spots develop as we get older, to mention a few.  Within a week, the skin on my face felt more supple and that continued to improve.  The puckers around my mouth diminished considerably as I continued to use the night cream, and the brown spots have softened to be barely discernible.  My skin has a glow to it.  I am someone who deals with the bottomline.  Truth is truth, and I will not exaggerate for love or money.<br />  I have not been pressured to &#34;sale&#34; nor would I associate with someone who would do that.  However now that I have some time, I will tell people my story as I choose to do so.<br />  Regarding negative reviews.  If it does not work for you, then that is the way it is.  No product works for 100% of the people.  You do not have to be mean about it.  Nerium does work for over a million people as evidenced by the fact that the company had the largest growth in their first year than any other company of its kind.<br />  I suggest that you get the product from someone that you trust, and you will have the 30 day money back guarantee.
B001VH6F9G|4|The original part was silver metalic (which initially caused me to buy a wrong exchange part at Wal-Mart!). The current plastic version looks cheaper but serves well.
B00HDZGF4K|5|Makes your face feel so good!!!!
B004L4EING|4|I like this set. The Shave mug, soap, and acrylic stand are great.  The everything in the set is high quality.  The only thing I'm not excited about is the brush.  The badger hair bristles are too soft and thin so it does not retain the water well.  Also, because the bristles are soft it is hard to build a decent lather.      Bottom line.  I would recommend the set because it is still are great bargain for the price.  I would probably throw a tweezerman badger brush in your cart when you order this because it is a superior brush against the one that comes in this set.
B004C0LX6O|2|The reason for two stars is because it took a month to get to me. My wife would ask me every day if we were going to recieve it. Yes we are overseas we order online frequently and everything has taken the most, two weeks. This was ridiculous. At least thats my point of view.
B002C8E86A|5|Quick and prompt.  Product arrived in good time from purchase and is exactly as described.
B00J26H2IG|5|This wax was recommended by multiple estheticians and was great for in home use
B002UKAD1E|5|Had my palette for over a year and havent even seen the bottom of the eyeshadow yet! Great size and assortment of colors!
B005X6M7JS|2|The Tanda Zap is the mini version of the Tanda Clear. The Zap will get rid of a zit in 2-3 days for me. You can really see a difference. This Tanda Clear thing doesn't really do anything. I thought it would save time because it has a larger light, but it's cycle is 3 minutes, instead of 2 minutes like the Zap. So it doesn't really save time and it doesn't really kill zits. Overall I think I wasted money on it.
B009DZKUVC|5|I love them they last about 4-5 days with the type of physical work I do. They go right on my nails, super cute
B001FB5ILE|5|This stuff is great.  I have relatively sensitive skin and I wanted something with spf.  I use this after shaving and it works wonderfully.
B00U57HQWI|5|This soap smells amazing and makes my hands ridiculously soft.
B003I6O5RC|5|I have been extremely happy with this mascara it looks great on the lashes and lasts amazingly.
B00JOMBTPA|1|weird ouwy stuff
B001E72308|3|Couldn't find in local store.  I use gel toothpaste but am trying to go more natural/organic so I ordered this to try.  Sooo not anything like the gel toothpastes you buy in the non natural versions.  Kind of a thick (reminds me of a medicine gel cream), hardish gel.  Weird feel.  Hard to squeeze from tube, a child would probably need help using it.<br /><br />Works great and will def. use it up but I think I will go back to the paste version of this brand and just have to use mouth wash for the &#34;clean&#34; feeling to last.  When I use the paste, after about 3 hours I start getting that &#34;not brushed&#34; feeling unless I use mouthwash after I brush.  With the gel my teeth feel clean all day.
B001MIZCA2|5|I'm allergic to TALC so it really bothers me when all these \\"mineral based\\" powders turn out to contain talc. Not so with this product. It is truly talc free.   The powder is fine enough that it stays on your skin, but not so fine that it settles into your pores and fine lines like some of those high-end micro powders. There is a touch of color in the powder, which bothered me at first, but then I realized that rather than merely being a finish, the powder acts as a base, evening out skin tone quite nicely. I simply put on my sunscreen and some touch-up, then brush a little of this powder on. No base necessary. If your sunscreen has a particularly oily finish, you may want to apply the powder twice, with a short wait between applications.  I have sensitive skin, so I don't wear make-up the way some women do, but for my comfort level, this is the ticket. It looks great, I don't feel it on my face, and it washes off easily. At this point, I think I'll keep buying this powder as long as they keep making it.
B000F35R00|5|I have been buying and tossing fingernail clippers for years as they get dull and tear the nails.  This clipper is super sharp providing clean cuts and no tearing.
B008U1Q4DI|3|OK nail decor..plain stones
B00GMDIKV0|3|It was great at the start. Then after washed it. It gets hard
B00I5H5Z1O|3|I received this razor in the mail from Influenster for testing purposes. While the razor is cute and convenient, I felt as though I had no control the first time I used it. As I've used it more, it no longer feels that way. This razor does take some time getting adjusted to because of the small handle. Although I received this for free I would like to point out that for $9.99 you only get this tiny razor and a case. There are no extra cartridges. You can use any Venus cartridge on this razor (like all other venus razors), but each box still costs in the mid teens for a box of 4 cartridges; with most other reusable Venus razor you get at least one extra head for the razor. This razor is a great idea, I'm just not sure that I love it
B00MNK9R5Y|5|I had the opportunity to try the Argan Oil Hair Mask leave in conditioner for review! Let me say that I really do like it! I had been meaning to try a deep conditioning product for a while now. I have long kinky hair that I wash and straighten with a flat iron almost daily so I was very much in need of this! The mask left my hair soft and shiny! I will recommend this product to anyone needing some TLC for their hair! :)
B0043JIFCY|5|I researched dermarollers. And I mean RESEARCHED. I've gone through forums and websites and checked out auction sites looking for information. After all, if you're going to stick your face with needles you better know what you're doing!    I found out there are two different types of dermarolling. There's the deeper type that is used to reduce scars and stimulate collagen. For this type, you use needles .75 mm and longer. Most people use 1.5. It takes like 90 days before you can do it again, because you are deliberately damaging your dermis.    Then there's the gentler kind used to help skin products penetrate down through the tough (dead) top layer of the skin. So the actives in there can do their work on newer skin. You use .25 mm or .5 needles for this. The Genosys is .25 mm so it is the perfect depth for skincare penetration.     You apply your product and then roll the roller over your face. My roller came with a DVD that showed a \\"French\\" beautician doing it. You can do it every day, but I'd recommend doing it every other day instead. Also, be sure to disinfect. I use alcohol and a UV light.    Here's why the product gets so many stars from me:  1. It doesn't hurt. Honestly. With or without the massage function on, it doesn't hurt.  2. The head is removable and replaceable. That makes it simpler to clean and disinfect. And when the needles eventually get dull or bend--which does happen to all of these contraptions--I can replace just the head.   (Although Genosys does not sell the longer needles to non-professionals, it is possible to find them for sale online. That means you can replace the head and do both types of dermarolling. But I'm not comfortable saying where I found this.)  3. More needles than most. Most dermarollers have about 200 needles on them. This one has more than twice as many, so I feel I can do a good job in less time.  4. Needle shape and roller format. Now I'm not sure how important these things really are, but without completely understanding, I was impressed with the slimmer diamond shaped needles and the way the rollers are formed.    The main after effects of rolling with this product are mild redness for about 20 min. And a slight but not painful sensation of a mild sunburn. It all goes away quickly. And the next day your face looks fabulous and extra plump.    Caution, though. One time I rolled a scar on my leg too fast and ended up dragging the roller sideways, scratching myself. It's important to pay attention to what you are doing! Do your homework and learn to use this product before you attempt dermarolling. It's worth it.
B004M1BO3U|5|My Dentist told me to get this toothbrush.<br /><br />I just got done having a bridge put in top teeth.<br /><br />He told me the way the other toothbrushes work, they are too harsh and after extended use will leave like a dark line above the bridge.<br /><br />All teeth problems start at the gum line so remember that when you brush.
B0009953GS|5|I absolutely love this mirror it is great for putting on make-up and tweezing eyebrows it's perfect!!!
B001IACV7G|5|They are not kidding...my naturally curly hair will not hold a curl after using this...a little too straight for me..but if you're looking for a smooth and non curl I believe you'll be satisfied!! Will be giving to my daughter to see if she likes it, I blow my hair dry and then use a curling iron. (won't hold a curl) not that is bad just not what I wanted.
B003CIRVOU|5|such a variety of shadows at such a bargain price.  The shadows wear well without irritating my eyes.  feel like a found a super deal.
B0037MQAE8|4|Very good product - feels comforting to the eyes, very effective in removing make-up, but one draw-back that I notice every day - just wish it had a pleasant, fresh scent - it doesn't even have no scent, it has a less than pleasant scent.  Other than that, it performs well.
B009PPCJVE|1|When I purchased these, I thought they were the bigger scrunchies. These are little bigger than a normal hairband, which doesn't work too well with my hair.
B000UK16AI|5|I  purchased my Norelco Arcitech and the replacement shaving unit from Amazon.  I received the best price from them and am totally happy with both products.  I've never had a better shaver.
B0064FMPUS|3|This product does not plump your lips...it dries on the lips and doesn't do anything else.  I have found, however, that this stuff makes a great lip primer before you put on your lip gloss or lipstick.  I put it on, let it dry, then add gloss or lipstick and it stays quite awhile.  It's worth it for that use but nothing else.
B0009PVV4A|5|Use it everyday and it works great!!
B0001EL73O|5|It is difficult to lock in a suntan all year long, but with the help of Murad's Self Tanner, my pale complexion doesn't have to suffer all year long. Murad Self Tanner works wonders without the harmful effects from the sun. The product doesn't cause streaking or leave your hands with the bronzed look. The tanner penetrates into your skin immediately and leaves your skin feeling softer and smoother. Murad Self Tanner contains pomegranate anti-oxidants, protecting you from the damage of the sun. This is one of the only self-tanners that actually contains sunscreen. It tans and protects! The tanner also maintains the healthy tone and texture of the skin. I apply it once a month and still achieve positive results. Murad Self Tanner definitely offers the natural tan without the potential damage from the sun.
B007BHW4WC|3|This is not a purchase for shampoo and conditioner, I don't know what DUO is . The product did not come with a pump either.  Very disappointed with how this company markets its products. Will buy from another from now on.
B00006BIJJ|5|The instructions say that you are supposed to \\"test a small area and wait 24 hours before using product to ensure you have no adverse skin reaction.  Do not use on irritated, sunburned, inflamed or broken skin.\\" If you head this warning I think your experience with this product will be a pleasant one. You do not have to wait 24 hours to take a shower. I recommend applying the mouse about 7 minutes before you get in the shower and then rinse off with the sponge in the shower. You are supposed to wait between 8 and 10 minutes. If you experience burning before that you should remove it from the skin immediately. Keep checking small patches to see if it is working, but don't be surprised if nothing happens after 5 minutes.  I found that the mouse was thick enough where it stuck to my skin and did not make much of a mess. I like this product and have not experienced burns from it. I wanted to write this review for perspective buyers just to let them know that it is VERY important to read and follow the directions on this product, and that if you do the results are worthwhile.
B007ONF4FW|2|Not what I expected. It's a huge sponge inside a jar filled with polish remover. What do i do with it? If I remove the sponge, It drips all over. IfI stick my fingers they get all wet!! Nonsense!!
B000SZNSR4|5|Here's a tidbit of information that I would like to pass on.  A young man did a study and if you leave the battery out to open air for 5 minutes before placing it in the Cochlear it doubles the life of the battery.  It works great.
B001MIZMIE|5|great product, works so well, great way to buy in pack of 4
B004WHC5G4|4|Easy to use. Same as name brand. Makes me feel like I'm doing something proactive. Does seem to arrest some hair loss in my case.
B000FS05VG|1|This dryer was good while it lasted.. but after maybe a month, it got a short in the cord, and as I was drying my hair one day, it blew up.. the back blew off, it sparked, almost caught my hair on fire, and left a burn mark on my hand..
B004JJU41I|5|I am a HUGE fan of the Deja Vu cosmetics line and the Vita Gel ranks at the top of my list.  A light moisturizing gel that is perfect for daily use.
B0062GYZ0M|4|Gives great coverage and poreless finish for everyday wear. It isn't full coverage or long-wearing, but it's so smooth and pretty for most occasions. I have oily skin and do have to powder it then blot or powder after maybe 5 hours, but the very natural-looking finish and silky texture is worth it.
B0069SQEK2|5|Love this stuff.
B00DX02YE4|3|I haven't used the product yet, but upon receiving, I thought, geez, the bottle is so small and I paid $25 for this?!  There is no pump either,  the picture makes it seem like you're getting a big bottle, but it's actually very small.  I'm not sure how long it will last me.  I just hope it's as good as the other reviewers have stated.
B002OND3LO|3|These are no better or worse than any other disposable straight blade. If anything it's the packaging that sets it apart from the others.
B00013Z1KU|5|For me, this stuff really works.  Put it on generously.  No fear of absorbing nasty chemicals through the tender underarm skin.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
B00GUNYDAE|2|The is made for people with narrow feet.  If you have wide feet, do not purchase this item
B000LX2X3S|2|too short for my little toe (1 1/4 in long).  otherwise, everything else is perfect.  total length is 3/4 in., taper from 1/2 to 9/16 in. ID, wall thickness of ~1/16 in.
B004Y9GTYE|5|Thanks for all<br />Thanks for gift
B00HHZME9Q|5|These are great. Just don't put oil in them. They are great for travel, they don't leak. Thank you .
B002RT71NQ|4|Sebastian Whip Cream really works great I love it!  Make's hair smooth not fly away hair.  I would have given it 5 star but I have one complaint.  Too much cream comes out the spout, I must throw half of it away or it will make my hait too soft and flat.
B0081CWUE8|3|If you are look for a dupe of Wen, this is a poor substitute. It is thin, and not terribly conditioning. But the seller sent quickly and well packaged and does smell nice.  I use it my bath water, as a skin conditioner.
B001B4NBOQ|5|very good quality sandlewood for the price very warm and woodsy and earthy smell. diluted in grape seed so is thick, I remove stopper because it will get clogged.
B001U8L104|5|I can thank Michael Landon for our purchase of Yardley Lemon Verbena with Shea Butter Bar Soap. Let me explain. Our sons, Kai (age 10) and Kou (age 8) are nearly finished watching the third season of [[ASIN:B0000C2IVT The Little House on the Prairie]]. It is from this TV series that my boys learned how Laura and her sisters adored Lemon Verbena perfume.<br /><br />I scoured Amazon, looking for a relatively inexpensive way to share the scent. Thankfully, this item is available because of the new Add-on program, which allows Amazon to offer thousands of low-priced items that would be cost-prohibitive to ship on their own. These items ship with qualifying orders over $25 and are eligible for free shipping.<br /><br />The bar of soap arrived in a small, cardboard box, placed inside a larger box with other orders. I could smell the soap through two layers of cardboard. Opening the smallest box had the same effect you'd expect from lighting a scented candle. Now, I'm not saying it was an offensive smell, but it was strong. Ultimately, we tested the bar in the shower and the whole household had the distinct smell of Lemon Verbena. Its ability to mask a multitude of sins, including irregular bathing, perhaps explains why this particular scent was so popular in the 1800s<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.
B00L8L6860|5|My girlfriend loved this product. we had so much fun. even the kids used them with thier halloween costumes. Awesome product would highly recommend.
B00QBL6ZCY|5|Thank you! This PINK Weekender Bag arrived 5 days early!!! It arrived well protected and was packaged nicely. My only upset is that 2 sequins have come off. Despite that, I still gave 5 stars because the sequins are sewn on. I don't think anymore will fall off or come loose. This bag is exactly as described, zip closure, inside pocket, and extra leather on the handles for extra durability. I know that this fabulous bag will work out for me on my trip! I recommend this bag & would purchase again. Many thanks, again! :-)
B00EB3CVCM|3|I didnt really notice a difference as a result of this product
B001VEK1HQ|1|I can't believe this item is listed wrong since it is amazon but indeed it is! Braun makes a much newer cartridge which this is not. This listing also does not include the cutter.<br /><br />Completely fraudulent listing, LOOK ELSEWHERE!
B00JJ37EXK|1|Buyer beware!!!  Used 2 times, first time motor wouldn't turn back on after use for about 3 hours.  Then would work.  2nd time I sprayed about half of my wife and the motor quit and can't get it to turn back on!!!  Terrible product.  Just so happens this is day 35 in the return window so Amazon won't take it back..
B000L596FE|5|I have curly a African american hair type that tangles soo easily. I wet my hair in the shower, used this brush, and it started to detangle my hair, and soon combed right through! It's a pretty good brush.
B009ORTUDI|1|Why didn't I read the ingredients list before purchasing? i HATE myself more than I hate this company. 10 minutes ago I loved them. Until I came upon testimonials written by makeup artists who said bare escentuals is NOT as good-a-company as we all probably think. THEN! upon further investigations, I've found aluminum AND bismuth oxychloride. for those of you who don't care, disregard. but for ORGANIC people, rethink what you buy VERY carefully. I was duped. and so too, can you be. always read the ingredients before you buy. such a shame because this is SUCH a beautifully made palette with a quality case. I'm devastated to be let down and mad at myself for trusting in a name. http://www.faerieorganic.com/#!ingredients/c22tj  &#60; this is legit. already researched it and found it to be 100% organic.
B001CS8BJ6|5|Before ordering this I had either used a trimmer which didn't get very close or a razer which sometimes takes longer than I care to invest at the time.  With this thing I trim first to get the hairs short then use this to get it close; and it gets very close.  After some use you get used to where the 'edge' is and can keep your beard quite clean looking.<br /><br />The blades are sharp and don't pull your hair like others I've tried.  I'm honestly fairly impressed by the quality here vs the price.  Will definitely buy again when needed.
B001SK2FEU|5|This is the best scent I have owned and is now my go to scent.  Numerous girls (&#62;5) have commended me on how nice I smell :)
B000MS5M9O|5|this is amazing !!! and will buy again thnx
B00GRA5890|5|I have tried so many different masks from the hard plastic that covers your nose and mouth down to the little silicone nasal piece that just fits into your nostrils.  I liked the sleepweaver cloth mask the best.  The prior model was not permanently attached to the hose like this one is and kept coming apart.  Also, the prior mask seemed to leak a little more so you heard more air hissing out from around the edges.  This newest version of sleepweaver fits better with a lot less air leakage.  This is definitely they way to go if you wear a mask.  Coming from someone who has tried so many varieties, I highly recommend this one.
B002JPJ2ZS|5|For several years, I've had thinning hair and I've tried multiple treatments for it:<br />-Propecia:  It might've helped with stopping hair loss, but there was no obvious improvement or new growth and didn't like that I needed to get a prescription for it and that it may have some negative side effects.<br />-Rogain: It seemed like it may have helped though the results were  not obvious -- and ultimately I developed an allergic reaction to it and so could no longer take it.<br />-iGrow: This is one of those laser things you wear.  After trying it once, I found it too inconvenient and didn't stick with it.  I ended up returning as I almost never used it.<br /><br />Finally, my stylist mentioned Viviscal, and so I thought I'd give it a try especially as it's something off-the-shelf and that I can conveniently get by simply ordering online (no need for a prescription) and that it's simply a pill and so not a hassle to use like the iGrow.<br /><br />And what can I say?! The results have been unbelievable. I've noticed a clear difference when I run my hand through my hair - I have a noticeably fuller head of hair in less than a month. My hair also seems to be growing faster.  People around me have noticed a difference. One thought perhaps I'd changed my hairstyle since it looks so much fuller, but there is no illusion here. I actually have thicker hair.  And once again, I love that it's so convenient and so something I know I can stick with - and the only potential side effect I've seen - is actually a really positive one impacting my personal life.
B00E0P6488|1|Save your money. The headband is extremely tight, the color is not as advertised, and they will not accept a return, even though this was only tried on, but never worn.
B00H0AKNI2|5|Really like this bun maker and the fact that it was covered in satin material.
B006QHXE8Q|5|My daughter order this set for herself and she loves it. None of the colors were broken when she received it. Good product!
B001FWXTFU|5|I read the other 2 reviews and absolutely agree. I have spent more money on toothpaste then I can even account for. This hasnt been available for awhile and my son keeps asking why we cant get the einstein paste. I still have to force him to use other kinds. What in the world happened?? I need this back!
B0080CO2F4|1|it has been well over a month and i still have not received this product.  i put one star just to be able to write this.  who can i contact about this?
B00DB6QCAM|1|I have on occasion used Mary Kay products, and they're usually great...this foundation however was not.  It seemed like it was sitting exposed to air for a while because if felt like spackling...thick and tough to work with (either with a make up sponge or my fingers).  The color made me look sickly.  I'm very fair and this color just looked blah.  Unfortunately I was so annoyed and disappointed with this makeup that I just tossed it into the trash.
B003U8ESI4|5|Most trimmers I've tried get around 20% of the hairs on each pass.  This one does far better and the vacuum feature is a bonus.
B00NQPJ3L8|3|My friend who gave me her honest thoughts said, &#34;It's like any other&#34;...based on her comments, I can only say that it's average.
B00NPJV4OO|4|The are really nice if your'e looking for a courser file..
B003983HZK|5|Great quality blades.  Just like what you get in the stores.
B00JXC6HJY|1|Total flop 👎
B001BMGZGO|4|Like the shimmer and scent. Very subtle in regards to the shine but also the scent is not too strong but great.
B00006IV45|5|Great product at a very good price!
B006W3P14Y|3|Amazonian Clay Full Coverage 12 hour foundation<br /><br />I have a lot of issues when it comes to my face. I have a lot of redness and bumpiness on my cheeks and chin. Even though the bumpiness isn't an issue on my nose and forehead, redness definitely is. I very seldom get acne, but I would describe my skin as oily, especially on my nose and cheeks. In addition, I also have very sensitive skin. I have to be really careful about what chemicals I put on my face. I have had used a couple of products that made my face feel like it was on fire. I've had many more that caused me to itch like crazy. Even though I always purchase products that are hypoallergenic or made specifically for sensitive skin, a lot of them still make me itch.<br /><br />I have tried many different types of foundation. I have tried some very cheap ones (NYC and Hard Candy) I have also tried most of the mid-priced store brands (Loreal, Maybelline, Merle Norman, Avon, and Mary Kay. I've even used a Clinique foundation. But regardless of how much I pay or where I purchase it, the result is always the same. It looks great when I first apply it, but after a short time, (generally 4 hours or less) the shine and redness start peeking through again. I had almost given up hope. I started to think that maybe my expectations for a foundation were unrealistic. Obviously, things like oil-free and suitable for sensitive skin are important, but for me, the three things I was most looking for were<br />1. Lightweight<br />2. Full, yet natural coverage<br />3 Long lasting<br /><br />The amount I've been spending on foundation has slowly been creeping up, so I decided maybe it was time to consider a high-end foundation. I spent about 3 days researching different foundations and reading reviews. Finally, I narrowed it down to 4 I was interested in trying. This product was the most expensive of the 4. This foundation is somewhat pricey,  so I didn't want to invest in a foundation I wasn't even sure I was going to like. I read a lot of positive reviews of this foundation online,  but honestly, I was skeptical. It just seemed too good to be true. Rather than shelling out the money for a full tube right away, I decided to see if I could somehow get a free sample. I felt a little silly. But I went to Sephora and asked if they did free samples of foundation. I expected the lady to laugh at me, but she was very nice. She said \\"That's not a crazy question at all. We are actually really big on samples. You can sample any product in the store.\\"  I also explained that I wasn't exactly sure what shade I needed. She said she would help me with that as well. I thought I needed either needed Medium or Light Medium. It turns out that the Light Medium was a perfect match to my skin. I was given a very generous free sample and couldn't wait to try it. But I was also nervous. I'd felt disappointed with so many other cosmetics, that I didn't really expect anything else from this product. Online reviews recommended applying it with a brush, so I purchased a cheap make-up brush and applied it that way.<br /><br />After applying this product for the first time, I was blown away when I looked in the mirror. It covered the bumps and redness completely, given me a flawless, natural look.  It also feels incredibly light on my face. It feels like my natural skin, not cakey or like I'm wearing a mask. But I knew the real test was still to come: How long would it last? Some previous reviewers did state that this foundation didn't last 12 hours, so I was a little worried. But I figured even if it lasted 8 hours it was an improvement over other products. I applied this product the first day at about 7 am. It still looked great when I removed it at around 10:30 that night. It hadn't faded or worn off at all. I was little concerned that this product might be difficult to remove. But a make-up remover wipe removed it with no problem whatsoever.<br /><br />Update 4-4-13<br />When I first got the sample of thisproduct and started using it, I loved it. I thought I had found my go-to foundation. So I purchased a full-sized tube. But the longer I used it, the less I liked it. This foundation doesn't feel heavy on your face, but it does get very cakey and powdery when it dries. I also found it difficult to apply evenly. In some places, I would get it too thin and in others too thick. It also wore off where I am most oily (my cheeks and especially my nose.) I also started to notice that this foundation rubs off very easily. One day I was trying on shirts. I was wearing a turtleneck and a tee-shirt. When I pulled my turtleneck up over my head, I immediately noticed that I had a good amount of foundation on the inside of my turtleneck. I felt less and less confident in this foundation as time went on. I also wasn't crazy sbout the texture of this foundation. It's kind of weird. It's somewhere between a liquid and a cream. I realized that I prefer a liquid foundation. I also want something that will cover well yet will blend into my skin. Previous reviews have mentioned they didn't think the coverage of this makeup wasn't matte enough. In my opinion, the coverage of this makeup is much too matte for my liking.<br />I would recommend getting a free sample of this product, and trying it at least a week before buying a full-sized tube. I would also recommend getting matched at a place like Sephora or Ulta so you are sure to get the right shade. I can definitely understand why there are so many positive reviews for this product. It lives up to its promises and offers great coverage. But I realized I had been hasty in purchasing a full-sized tube. I ultimately ended up returning the full-sized tube. This just wasn't the right foundation for me.<br /><br />In my opinion, a much better alternative to this product is Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte. It is available at Target and online for around $14.00 It is hypoallergenic, oil free, contains sunscreen, stays on all day, and is very lightweight. It provides full coverage, yet looks very sheer. It doesn't look heavy or artificial at all. It is also sweatproof. I started sweating like crazy recently while wearing this makeup. I blotted my face with a papertowel. I expected to see a ton of my foundation on the paper towel as well. But there was NOTHING! It still looked great! It has given me everything I was looking for at a fraction of the price of Amazonian Clay and Estee Lauder Double Wear. When choosing a shade, realize they they come in pairs. There are two choices each for light, medium and deep. The first shade in the pair is for warm tones and the second is for cool tones. Warm skintones tend to have yellow undertones. Cool skintones tend to have pinkish undertones. In my opinion, the best way to determine your skin tone is to look at the veins in your wrist. If they appear greenish, then you have a warm skin tone. If they look bluish, then you have a cool skintone. If you can't tell, then you have neutral skin tones. Most people tend to have warm skintones. But I discovered that I have cool skintones. So I chose to purchase the shade \\"Cool Beige\\" It was a perfect match for my skin. Give the Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. A great product for a great price.
B0023A7JF4|5|I will always buy this item its really does wonders for my skin
B001ET7HGG|5|I use only this for my face and private area b/c I am allergic to other products for face and personal hygiene wash products. I have been using this for over 15 years now and won't try other brands again with on/off trials of other brands. I have tried everything from organic, natural, pharmaceutical to over the counter products and it always leaves me itchy on face and personal areas. If you or someone you know has high sensitivity to wash products, try this but please be sure its the regular to sensitive skin cleansers and not the anti-blemish wash b/c it does have salicylic acid in it. YIKES!
B004Z67NSM|5|If you have bad acne scars then this is exactly what you need in your life!!!! Literally changed my life. I have so much more confidence all thanks to this little guy! Must have for acne/acne scars!
B00BS5CFTA|5|Everything was great
B002HR3AGU|5|One of the best products in class
B0002VNKQS|3|Made curls, but also made hair dull
B00008MOQJ|4|I Use This All The Time. Works Great
B000GD03TO|5|For the price, Mg 217 is the best buy available. Its effectiveness matches that of shampoo almost double the price.
B000C1W6P4|4|I bought this based on other reviews, and it did not disappoint. I've only worn it a couple of times, but have gotten compliments each time. Very happy with this purchase. If you want a cologne that a more sophisticated woman is attracted to, then this one is for you.
B000F4D0P8|4|This tape truly works - it really holds all night and then some. I used this on a dress whose arm holes were too big which showed my bra. I just need to get this dress tailored - it's too broad through the shoulders...anyways, it held with absolutely zero movement, my bra never showed and I felt confident. Danced in it too.<br /><br />One issue though - and it's a biggie - when I peeled it off at the end of the night OMG did it ever leave massive, red welts on my skin; including some light bruising! I'm fair and sensitive-skinned so maybe it's just me but it HURT although the pain went away by the next day.<br /><br />I'd be curious to know if anyone else had the same experience and maybe knows how to prevent it...because I really love the idea<br />behind fashion tape being a fast, easy fix when you don't have time to run to the tailor.
B0079LIVWW|5|If you are like me and use a lot of medications, sometimes it just gets to be a little much when the pills are so darn big it's hard to swallow them! So, I was very excited to get this new pill crusher from Sabi called Crush.<br /><br />If you need to you can take the very top off and store pills in there and then the bottom part of this pill crusher is where you will crush the pills. It's very easy to use and I like that it's super easy to clean out and ready to go for the next time you need to crush.<br /><br />I have RA & Fibromyalgia so I can appreciate these small things that might not seem like a big deal to some people, but when you have no strength sometimes to do simple things, it does mean a lot. My hands are my weakest link so having products that make my life much easier to handle is important to me. Such a small thing like this makes a huge difference in my life. On the days that I feel I just can't swallow another big pill, it's nice to know I have options. And that is really what makes products like this a godsend to me, it gives me back options.<br /><br /> Most pill crushers on the market require repeated twisting and untwisting to get the job done, and can be very difficult on the hands. In addition, most pill crushers out there can only crush small pills and cannot handle turning larger pills into powder. I thought that this was awesome because I can store the ones that are too big for me to swallow and when I get ready to take them I just get this out and crush them and add to my hot tea or whatever else I am drinking and it's done!<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

B00GDV55B4|5|A friend told me how good this product was, so I tried it and it worked GREAT!!!!  look younger already.
B003NTYR4A|5|I absolutely love this product for traveling! The towelette packs so easily and is a breeze to use. I exfoliate with a body scrub in the shower and put on a body light moisturizer before applying the product. What makes this towelette so easy to use is it is large enough to cover your whole body. It is also less messy than using a liquid self tanning cream or gel. Keep an extra towelette with you in your purse, bag or tote and you will always have a glow and your skin will be protected by sunscreen. I was lucky enough to review this product at a discount for my unbiased review. If you love your skin and are a self-tanning junkie like me , you need these in your arsenal of products!
B00FJLZIJI|5|Excellent buy arrived in good time great price would buy again!
B006OHM542|4|Easy to use, not as strong as I had hoped, but not sure how strong other brands are either. Has a nice pleasant scent that I can smell for a 30 minutes after using it :) Its not overpowering. Grape Smell!
B005UBN5AQ|5|I was really not sure what brush set to order... I'm glad I got these brushes! The travel case is great and very functional. I love all of the brushes! I do wish there was a big foundation brush but that is the only one I was missing. I have been able to tell such a different in how my makeup look after I started using these brushes.<br />This is the first set of REAL brushes I've bought. They are really soft and pick up the makeup really well especially for eye shadow. There was not a list of what the brushes were used for, but I went online and found one. I washed them when I first got them. There was hardly any loose bristles.<br />I would definitely recommend getting these brushes!
B008GOR6O0|4|Definitely not something for beginners but it's better quality than I'd been expecting.
B008LCCDTU|5|I couldn't be happier with this hair!  It's great quality, the color is great, washes really well and I haven't lost any pieces.  I bought this color as well as off black and they both look great.  I would highly recommend!
B00J42G2UW|5|I love it works really good. The first time I tried it I was amazed about how shinny clean my teeth looked. I keep feeling my teeth they felt so smooth I love that feeling. From now on this will be favorite toothbrush !!! It's a must try u have to try it what do you have to lose? Come on now ;) try it I promise u will like it. I received this for testing purposes from smiley360
B0071F6C1S|5|I finally ordered this after hearing all the raves about it. I don't think it's yet available in salons in Canada, so I ordered it online. Let me tell you, this product is phenomenal. I like big hair, so I am always on the prowl for volumizing products, and products that claim to make hair look/feel thicker, bigger, full of body. This product is superior to others that I've used because it not only makes my hair look thicker, it FEELS thicker. I wash my hair about every 3 days, and my hair still feels the same on the third day. Also, this product not only thickens the hair, but it makes my hair feel soft at the same time, plus adds shine to my hair. This does not make your hair look or feel crunchy at all. I also actually really love the scent of it as well. This product is a little pricey, but let me tell you, it's more than worth it. You'll feel like a fox when you use this in your hair. I still have almost a full bottle left and I'm already ordering my 2nd bottle. Can't praise this product enough.
B00198OG7U|5|Use it all the time...will keep ordering
B004MB8KNC|5|I used to overpay for these at the drugstore but now I know I can get them on Amazon! I keep a few in my purse, in my car, in my desk, at all times. And there's no better way to make friends in a sweaty amusement park line than whipping one of these babies out and offering it to someone. Freshness in a pouch!
B00HZDS8Q8|4|The V-collar is very deep, so I needed to put a tank top underneath it, The color and fabric are great! Very comfortable, and being a shorter person, I was nervous on the length, but It isn't too bad, I am 5'2 and I will only need a small heel to make sure I don't trip on the bottom. :)
B00005375E|5|This soap bar is amazing. I found it at Marshalls for only $1.99 a bar!!!!!! I used it and the result were amazing. My face looks great... No more acne at all. After Marshall ran out, I had to wait weeks until last week and they had tons. So try to find it at you nearest Marshalls store for a better price :)
B00352MHE2|2|Unlike some other Cetaphil skin products, there are Parabens AND Masking Fragrance in Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion for Dry Senstive Skin. There are many people who strive to avoid such substances. Cancelled the Daily Advance Lotion from my subscription order in favor of Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Moisturizer, which contains no Parabens or Fragrance.<br /><br />For anyone who might find it helpful. I did some research ahead of shopping for a new skin lotion and found this guidance: \\"Check labels for lactic acid, methylparaben, farnesol, and retinyl palmitate. Exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acid can be irritating and increase UV sensitivity. Some parabens are preservatives that can mimic the effects of estrogen. Research has detected parabens in breast tumors. Farnesol is a fragrance ingredient identified as an allergen by the European Union. It's in Cetaphil, which is labeled as fragrance free. A Cetaphil customer-service representative says the chemical acts as a preservative. Retinyl palmitate has been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer in animal studies, and it can convert to retinoids, associated with a risk of birth defects.\\"
B00R1P82UW|5|Amazing product! This is a MUST if you live in a humid climate. I love how it makes my skin look and feel without drying it out. I will continue using this product!
B005TUH4AK|5|Highly moisturising.  Other lotions don't go that deep; I have to use them every day.  With Pevonia - every two or three days.  I have a very dry skin and this is my fourth or fifth bottle.  Works great.  There is a lingering scent that stays but to me it smells very pleasant and warm.  The best lotion so far.
B00IM1RQ1U|5|Best moisturizer out there!
B000ULAY00|5|Great product. I bought it because I had used the AG Keratin Conditioner and loved it.  This was good also
B00J8UJNU6|1|I have been using this gel everyday for a few months now and have seen NO improvement.
B004QWVY8A|4|Good:  -Made in Hungary, not China.  -Li-ion battery.  -Cuts efficiently.  -Washable    -Top quality plastic, top quality design, top quality assembly.  -Light weight  -Reasonably priced.  Bad:  -Non user replaceable battery.  -Looks like a cockroach from certain angles.  -Hard to decipher, graphic/icon only manual.  -Proprietary external charger adapter. So no power cord sharing with older shavers. I want my old style IEC 60320 C1 type shaver plugs back!!!     4-and-half stars.
B004BCLRW8|5|This straightening iron is one of the best ones i have had, leave hair looking beautiful. last long yay thanks
B002XQ1USU|2|I don't understand this scent. It comes out as very weak to my nose.<br />Maybe there are aspects of my nose that doesn't cover the spectrum that lilique covers as a scent
B001ET6ZTG|5|These things work great! Each liner lasts 2 or 3 days. Easy to trim for perfect fit. No taste, no goo. Love it.
B00DIG586O|5|We wish p. s.  Aeropostale still sold this fragrance!
B00132TISE|4|I have thick curly hair and this is the best flat iron I have ever owned.
B00H0LHI5M|5|Wow! I am so happy with this cream! When I was offered at a great discount to try it and share my honest opinion I wasn't sure what to expect. This cream dos not disappoint! It is thick but yet flows smoothly and is well absorbed into the skin in seconds! Makes my hands really moist and soft without any greasy residue, with a sweet very mild smell it is very pleasant. I am to say the least impressed how well it works and feel safe to use being made with natural ingredients. Buy with confidence!
B0012GTZ20|4|My second order
B0061WQ4X8|5|Great!
B00068EXQ8|1|As per my son, too noisy, didn't like it, electric would have been better. Took apart to change blade hard time putting it back together.
B00LTK54LK|5|it was darker than i expected but i love it
B0073I1ZW4|5|Best stuff for curly or wavy frizzy hair
B00685V37K|5|Made a great Christmas present! I got it for my grandma and her immediate reaction was &#34;I'm getting all of the coolest presents this year!&#34;
B0064OMYAK|5|Was just perfect for my purse
B007389GSY|5|Bought this during a trip to Hawaii - absolutely love it. I made my sun and wind chapped lips feel so much better, and protected them for the rest of my trip. I'll be using this as my new &#34;go to&#34; lip balm.
B00BEJHLBM|5|Very nice fragrance!
B000NNAPLI|5|Shipping was really fast. The product leaves my hair smooth, moisturized and shinny.  I love affirm!!!<br />No burn.
B000V8BK1Y|5|The Murad Essential C line is like magic.  Finding any of this product line at such a deep discount is a big deal.  I was starting to get really deep crows feet and after a week they were almost gone.
B002PEH6LK|5|this stuff stinks so bad, it actually smells like a real fart and the smell lasts a while. good prank!
B005TKZS76|5|Love these little guys!  They are so comfortable in your hand as opposed to a big brush handle!  They work your powder into all the contours of your face and they are soooo soft.  And they are so small you can fit ALL of them in your make up bag when traveling.
B000TK99L2|1|I love this conditioner and have usually purchased it from my hairdresser at $28 for a small tub. I should have known better but decided to try this larger size at such a great price. What I ordered came direct from Amazon so I can't speak for other sellers, but what I received was either NOT an authentic, unadulterated Davines product or was an expired product. I lean towards thinking the real stuff was mixed with a cheap conditioner because the color of this product was somewhat marbled.<br /><br />Fortunately I had half a tub of real product to compare it with. What I received from Amazon was a different color, texture, and scent than what I purchased from my hairdresser. Most importantly, it left my hair feeling terrible when I tested it out. I immediately washed my hair again, applied the authentic product and got the great results I am used to. I've purchased many great, authentic beauty products at great prices from Amazon, but this was definitely not one of them. In this case you really get what you pay for.<br /><br />Fortunately I was able to return this for a full refund. Glad my hair didn't suffer damage - who knows what's actually in this bottle!!!
B00C8YCFU4|5|Ok...just used it first time and I haven't seen my skin look so refreshed in a long time. My dark circles under eyes seemed lighter, skin tighter and smooth.  Weirdly enough, I checked out my skin beforehand and did not see the little black hairs around my jaw line and neck ( that started few years before I turned 40) and after I was able to pluck six hairs that magically showed up!! I think the mask drew them out of my pores!!! Which can only mean I will eventually have less ingrown blemishes that cause my african american skin, less discolorations after that. I'm really excited to see what my skin will look like after some more weekly uses!!
B0000YUX4O|4|My child has long curly hair and it works great. The comb works very well when I have the conditioner in my child's hair. It really does a good job with dangling hair. It is also a strong comb. Good look and design. Received the comb on time as well.
B004BDVF6A|5|I love this eyeliner.  Love it.  I do not feel like it is anywhere in the same neighborhood as \\"dry,\\" and it seriously looks about as dark at the end if the day as it did in the morning.<br /><br />I work it into my upper lashes (after brushing on some light shadow) and soften the line with my pinkie.  It goes on smooth and dark, blends beautifully, is a strong black, and stays on all day.  No smudging at all for me.  Hands down best eyeliner i have ever used.
B004NKWC4A|4|It looked a little bit bigger in the picture.  But it will do. I will be using this for the beach.
B002JPJ2ZS|3|Not sure if it works yet.  Its only been 3 1/2 weeks and the product recommends 6.  I will continue using it; still hoping it will work.
B00CBY6V8S|3|I didn't notice any change or help but I believe my correction may not have been that great.  Have a friend with more difficult problems; it seems it has helped with these.
B007QHULH2|5|One of the best smelling colognes I have ever owned. Ranks at par if not slightly better than my Hugo Boss which I (and others) have loved for years. Great purchase and great price, saved me over $40 from buying it in store here in Canada
B008A8V1VQ|4|Subtle but sparkly. Overpriced though I think.
B003D1OZNG|2|Product leaves hair feeling light and fluffy at first, but then very dry. Scent is too strong and \\"follows\\" you throughout the day.
B000TC0LFS|5|very beautiful
B0002XROSQ|5|Great big curls!  Love it, just what I wanted.  Works great!  Thank you!!
B000ZJ2842|2|My aesthetician recommended vanicream as I have sensitive skin. However I don't think she had ever had a chance to try it herself. Vanicream is medical grade, chemical free, physical mineral sunblock free of irritants, etc. which is great; however, it unfortunately goes on EXTREMELY greasy, thick, and sticky. At least some of it also comes off when you sweat and it was quite visible on my friends' and my faces as we beaded with sweat in the hot Las Vegas sun yesterday! this is absolutely not an option for use on my face - it DOES rub in clear (though is white when you first apply and needs rubbing in), but the thick, sticky, greasy texture and SIGNIFICANT sheen left on the face (even after waiting over an hour) require extra time and steps to use oil blotting linens (about 5) and brush on a layer of powder (defeating the purpose of my new facial regimen and avoiding makeup and other skin clogging layers). Overall not worth the risk of clogged/smothered pores and horrible oil-slicked appearance. Also significant worries about using it on my body as you'll notice EVERYTHING you touch with it on your hands ends up with a thick greasy film.... Can't imagine my clothes would be any different but not worth the risk of ruining them.
B004Y0RL22|5|I wanted to try something different with my nails.  I love this product its so different. I will recommend this product to family and friends.
B00DQNFKZI|4|great product but shipping is a little slow.
B001E3G2RM|1|I have been self-waxing for years. Granted, I'm not an expert, and typically I haven't thought I was very picky. If it does the job, it does the job.<br /><br />This does the job, technically, but it is very very very difficult to get it to work. The heads do not work well at all, even if the wax is extremely hot, so it is very difficult to get any application at all, much less even application.<br /><br />The accompanying bottles are just terrible quality stuff. The cleaner is a goo that stays on your legs. The lotion is gross. The oil is ok. The after-wax soother, I have to admit, I didn't bother trying.<br /><br />I know that not all roll-on waxers are this bad. I have seen some at a salon that worked very nicely for repeated use.<br /><br />Please don't buy this. It's really quite terrible.<br /><br />VCruiser

B00OWA0LOE|5|Good
B002RTJ0JO|5|Lot of power in a small bottle, very strong.  My husband and I use as one of the ingredients for a mustard bath, which rids your body of toxins.  Worked like a charm, very soothing.
B000P27AYM|5|excelente
B00L8JBNE4|5|I live in OH and have chronic dry skin. I have tried many different natural and organic lotions to no avail. After one week of using this raw Shea butter, my legs no longer look like they're covered in alligator skin. I am amazed! The price on this raw Shea butter was much better than other brands. I will definitely be buying this again!
B001MP0T2Q|3|I expected the brush to be much bigger. It is a small brush, I have't tried it yet, but it seems like it will work.
B00JGK3EK8|5|I love it. It works amazing and I'm in love with being able to use it wet or dry. This product was given to me for free from the brand. It does hurt but it's not as bad as waxing. Pretty simple. You know what they say no pain no game.
B00GBZCK7O|4|I love the headbands. The colors match well with all my daughters outfits. Just wish that the bands could have been a little wider.
B001F51WBK|5|I guess reviewing this is a moot point since they stopped making around 2009, but it is the best deodorant I've ever used. Great scent and terrific moisture protection without being sticky. I bought up a bunch years ago and I just bought 16 more. That'll last me a while.
B0043C3ZN0|4|Absorbs well and has a lovely scent. May be a little light in the most dry seasons.
B000C1ZEY4|5|Unable to find this at any of my local stores.  I have used this fragrance for years and was glad to be able to find it on-line.
B0081E6THU|5|Perfect !!!
B0039P8EGU|5|good product, thanks
B00H7KTEZ8|4|I liked this but it didn't last long enough for the price.
B004BCVK3O|5|Amazon subscription plan makes this less expensive than local drug store price. Wonderful mascara that doesn't run, yet washes off well with simple soap and water.  Love it !
B006HK72VC|5|very good polish
B004D2C4Q4|5|Favorite skin product.  Does not cause break outs and not greasy.  Gentle, no burning or flaking of skin.
B007S2CJY8|5|I love it but I have very sensitive skin and it is a little too harsh for me.  I am going to have to go down to the .5 strength.
B004BRN154|5|Love this product!
B00BB5YHEI|5|This is a real good shaver im a barber an even with the thickest hair its removes it completely smooth
B00JNI1DZQ|3|I was really hoping for this to wow me. I love the design and the appeal to it. But, it doesn't do much for my short, straight lashes. I have tried many different techniques but they never stay curled for over a minute. They did not pull my lashes out or cut them off and I have applied quiet a bit of pressure to them. I have better results with a much cheaper curler though. Although these didn't work for me I think that for most people they will be great for so I would still recommend these.
B004OJBWAK|5|Arrived in great shape
B0046VGPHQ|2|Don't like it. I don't think it works well. It gets on things. It doesn't make me that tan. It's messy. The glove isn't as nice as the one I'm used to. It's hard to spray it only on the glove. Only positive is that when you apply it you instantly have a little more color than you did before. You do not wake up in the morning with amazing results. Tanceuticals is my fav and I bought this to go a little cheaper (and I had an amazon prime addiction). I am back to tanceuticals.
B001GS6OB4|4|I was very satisfied with the prompt delivery sevice of the Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual....  as well with the product, everything was as specified. The item was received 2 or 3 days earlier than expected which was great. At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the product or not for it was not working very well for me. I tried using it again about 3 days later, and to my surprise I love it. It took awhile to get the hang of using it but so far I am very satisfied with it. How long it will be before I have to use it again, well I do not know! I have used other brands which all said 6 weeks in between usages,  that was not true, for me it was  every 3 days and the hair on my face is not course or thick. I'm hoping this time it is 6 weeks in between usages like it says.  I will be giving this item a 4 star rating,  if it is six weeks before I have to use it again then I will give it a 10 star rating.
B0071XZW84|1|This is the first time I have tried Peter T Roth products. I was not impressed with the results. I thought for the price it should show visible changes, however, after using for over 2 months, I see no visible changes.
B00M7VB3QU|5|I recently had surgery and had to find a product that would keep my hair looking good in between shampoos and this was it! Works very well and smells divine.
B00D3M0CRS|5|Really like this product! I use it on my face every night and it actually does what it says it will do. I have celiac so I appreciate that it's a pure oil with no chemicals or gluten.  I live in a dry climate so I always had a bit of dry flakiness on my chin and sides of my nose. No more dry flakiness! My skin has never felt or looked this soft and supple. My only regret is not finding out about Poppy Austin Argon oil sooner.
B00BAVOZYK|5|Pretty pastel color. My 3rd favorite from the collection. Looks like it's pictured except it has a little bit of shimmer. Not a lot but a very little, which I was surprised by. I don't like shimmer, just solid cream looking polish. But the shimmer is so light you can hardly notice it.
B00005NAOD|5|Loving this cream. Goes on thick but feels good and gets face soft

B00752ZDD0|1|I ordered two of these for my hair. What I got was mineral water facial spray... I don't think it's really even worth going through the trouble of sending it back but I'm pretty upset I didn't get what I ordered.
B00F5NTC5Q|1|this kit comes all mixed up because things are not packaged properly, the cups, tips, grips, and ink were all  over in the case, the only thing that was where it should be was the needles, which are some generic brands. the guns in the picture are not the ones you receive, and everything is thin and weak. This is by far the worst kit I have ever seen. Pure Garbage! This is bait and switch, don't believe the picture!
B000BY2N7S|4|The size and easy capsules make it easy to swallow. I will likely buy this product again in the future.
